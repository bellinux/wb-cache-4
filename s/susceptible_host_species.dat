Conversely, {{when there is an}} increase in a species' range size, it is usually followed by an increase in population size (Gaston etal.). This ecological phenomenon, also known as the abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR), is well documented in several species of animals and plants (Gaston etal.) but has been little investigated in parasites. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Drovetski etal. () investigated the AOR in avian haemosporidians (vector-borne blood parasites) using data from four well-sampled bird communities. In support of the AOR, the research group found that the abundance of parasite cytochrome b lineages (a commonly used proxy for species identification within this group of parasites) was positively linked with the abundance of <b>susceptible</b> avian <b>host</b> <b>species</b> and that the most abundant haemospordian lineages were those with larger ranges. Drovetski etal. () also found evidence for both hypotheses proposed to explain the AOR in parasites: the trade-off hypothesis (TOH) and the niche-breadth hypothesis (NBH).

40|$|Pseudomonas cichorii harbors the hrp genes. hrp-mutants {{lose their}} {{virulence}} on eggplant {{but not on}} lettuce. A phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase gene (pat) is located between hrpL and an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldH) in the genome of P. cichorii. Comparison of nucleotide sequences and composition of the genes among pseudomonads suggests a common ancestor of hrp and pat between P. cichorii strains and P. viridiflava strains harboring the single hrp pathogenicity island. In contrast, phylogenetic diversification of aldH corresponded to species diversification amongst pseudomonads. In this study, the involvement of aldH and pat in P. cichorii virulence was analyzed. An aldH-deleted mutant (ΔaldH) and a pat-deleted mutant (Δpat) lost their virulence on eggplant but not on lettuce. P. cichorii expressed both genes in eggplant leaves, independent of HrpL, the transcriptional activator for the hrp. Inoculation into Asteraceae species susceptible to P. cichorii showed that the involvement of hrp, pat and aldH in P. cichorii virulence is independent {{of each other and}} has no relationship with the phylogeny of Asteraceae species based on the nucleotide sequences of ndhF and rbcL.

A novel technology known as atmospheric-pressure non-thermal plasma represents a means of generating various reactive species that adversely affect pathogens (inactivation) while simultaneously up-regulating host defense genes. The anti-microbial efficacy of this technology was tested on the plant fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and its <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> Solanum lycopercicum. Germination of fungal spores suspended in saline was decreased over time after exposed to argon (Ar) plasma for 10 min. Although the majority of treated spores exhibited necrotic death, apoptosis was also observed along with the up-regulation of apoptosis related genes. Increases in the levels of peroxynitrite and nitrite in saline following plasma treatment may {{have been responsible for}} the observed spore death. In addition, increased transcription of pathogenesis related (PR) genes was observed in the roots of the susceptible tomato cultivar (S. lycopercicum) after exposure to the same Ar plasma dose used in fungal inactivation.

40|$|Determining {{the effect}} of an {{invasive}} species on enzootic pathogen dynamics is critical for understanding both human epidemics and wildlife epizootics. Theoretical models suggest that when a naive species enters an established host–parasite system, the new host may either reduce (‘dilute’) or increase (‘spillback’) pathogen transmission to native hosts. There are few empirical data to evaluate these possibilities, especially for animal pathogens. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is enzootically transmitted by the swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) to colonially nesting cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota). In western Nebraska, introduced house sparrows (Passer domesticus) invaded cliff swallow colonies approximately 40 years ago and were exposed to BCRV. We evaluated how the addition of house sparrows to this host–parasite system affected the prevalence and amplification of a bird-associated BCRV lineage. The infection prevalence in house sparrows was eight times that of cliff swallows. Nestling house sparrows in mixed-species colonies were {{significantly less likely to}} be infected than sparrows in single-species colonies. Infected house sparrows circulated BCRV at higher viraemia titres than cliff swallows. BCRV detected in bug vectors at a site was positively associated with virus prevalence in house sparrows but not with virus prevalence in cliff swallows. The addition of a highly <b>susceptible</b> invasive <b>host</b> <b>species</b> has led to perennial BCRV epizootics at cliff swallow colony sites. The native cliff swallow host confers a dilution advantage to invasive sparrow hosts in mixed colonies, while at the same sites house sparrows may increase the likelihood that swallows become infected...|$|R

40|$|Many parasites are motile {{and exhibit}} {{behavioural}} preferences for certain host species. Because hosts can {{vary in their}} susceptibility to infections, parasites might benefit from preferentially detecting and infecting the most susceptible host, but this mechanistic hypothesis for host-choice has rarely been tested. We evaluated whether cercariae (larval trematode parasites) prefer the most <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species</b> by simultaneously presenting cercariae with four species of tadpole hosts. Cercariae consistently preferred hosts in the following order: Anaxyrus ( = Bufo) terrestris (southern toad), Hyla squirella (squirrel tree frog), Lithobates ( = Rana) sphenocephala (southern leopard frog), and Osteopilus septentrionalis (Cuban tree frog). These host species varied in susceptibility to cercariae in an order similar to their attractiveness with a correlation that approached significance. Host attractiveness to parasites also varied consistently and significantly among individuals within a host species. If heritable, this individual-level host variation would represent the raw material upon which selection could act, which could promote a Red Queen "arms race" between host cues and parasite detection of those cues. If, in general, motile parasites prefer to infect the most <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species,</b> this phenomenon could explain aggregated distributions of parasites among hosts and contribute to parasite transmission rates {{and the evolution of}} virulence.

The published article can be found at: [URL] epidemiological outcomes can depend strongly on the composition of an ecological community, particularly when multiple host species {{are affected by the}} same pathogen. However, the relationship between host species richness and disease risk can vary with community context and with the degree of spillover transmission that occurs among co-occurring host species. We examined the degree to which host species composition influences infection by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a widespread fungal pathogen associated with amphibian population declines around the world, and whether transmission occurs from one highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species</b> to other co-occurring host species. By manipulating larval assemblages of three sympatric amphibian species in the laboratory, we characterized the relationship between host species richness and infection severity, whether infection mediates growth and survivorship differently across various combinations of host species, and whether Bd is transmitted from experimentally inoculated tadpoles to uninfected tadpoles. We found evidence of a dilution effect where Bd infection severity was dramatically reduced in the most susceptible of the three host species (Anaxyrus boreas). Infection also mediated survival and growth of all three host species such that the presence of multiple host species had both positive (e. g., infection reduction) and negative (e. g., mortality) effects on focal species. However, we found no evidence that Bd infection is transmitted by this species. While these results demonstrate that host species richness as well as species identity underpin infection dynamics in this system, dilution is not the product of reduced transmission via fewer infectious individuals of a <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> We discuss various mechanisms, including encounter reduction and antagonistic interactions such as competition and opportunistic cannibalism that may act in concert to mediate patterns of infection severity, growth, and mortality observed in multihost communities...|$|E

It {{is of particular interest}} to Australian plant biosecurity as, like P. cinnamomi, {{it has the potential to}} become a major economic and ecological threat in areas with <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts</b> and conducive climates. Research was undertaken in California to assess the pathogenicity of P. ramorum on Australian native plants. Sixty-nine plant species within 24 families were sourced from established gardens and arboretums, and selected based upon provenance from areas of climatic suitability for P. ramorum as well as ecological and economical importance. Foliar, branch and log susceptibility were tested using detached leaf, branch and log inoculations. Sporulation potential and chlamydospore production was also tested on detached foliage of a select mid to upper storey species. Potentially highly <b>susceptible</b> foliar Australian <b>host</b> <b>species</b> included Eucalyptus regnans, Isopogon cuneatus, I. formosus, Leptospermum scoparium, L. lanigerum, and Melaleuca squamea, while potentially resistant hosts included Hedycarya angustifolia, Olearia argophylla, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, Pittosporum undulatum, and Podocarpus lawrencei. Disease incidence and severity were greater during the summer, and when the leaves were wounded. Putative sporulating hosts included Agonis flexuosa, C. ficifolia, Eucalyptus delegatensis, and E. viminalis.

40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi {{is a broad}} {{host range}} {{pathogen}} responsible for the degradation of many natural and cultivated ecosystems worldwide. For most biomes, numerous woody plant <b>species</b> are <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts</b> and are killed after infection. Two unresolved phenomena {{with regards to the}} life-cycle of P. cinnamomi were addressed in this study. Firstly, an investigation was conducted to determine how this poorly saprophytic pathogen persists in the long-term in the absence of <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts.</b> Secondly, it is not known how P. cinnamomi survives the long hot and dry summers of Mediterranean environments. Infested black gravel landscapes within the Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) forest of South-West Western Australia were suitable areas to address both knowledge gaps. Native annual and herbaceous perennial plant species common to severely infested black gravel sites were screened as possible hosts by controlled inoculation experiments and by sampling plants from the natural environment. Secondly, it was tested how long P. cinnamomi can survive on naturally infested black gravel sites {{in the absence of any}} living plant material. Vegetation was removed by herbicides, and pathogen survival monitored over 28 months. Based on the sampling of plants from the natural environment and from controlled inoculation experiments, it was evident that the majority of annual and herbaceous perennial plant species screened were infected by P. cinnamomi but most were asymptomatic <b>hosts.</b> These <b>species</b> are clearly a reason why P. cinnamomi can survive indefinitely on infested sites in the absence of <b>susceptible</b> woody <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> Transmission electron microscopic examination demonstrated that haustoria were produced in some annual and herbaceous perennial species and indicated for the first time that P. cinnamomi can colonise plants as a biotroph, without becoming necrotrophic. This is the first time haustoria have been shown to be definitively produced by P. cinnamomi in continuously asymptomatic plants. Survival propagules, in the form of oospores, thick-walled chlamydospores and stromata were also observed in these naturally infected species. Mating tests showed that the oospores were selfed by the A 2 mating type, and were produced in abundance with as many as 400 mm 2 of plant tissue. Selfed oospores have not been observed previously in naturally infected plants. Thick-walled chlamydospores were also produced in abundance, and both propagules types were shown to survive the environmentally adverse summer months and germinate when conditions were conducive the following autumn. Finally, stromata were observed in the majority of asymptomatic hosts, and have never been observed previously for P. cinnamomi. These stromata were shown to provide the nutrients for the prolific oospores numbers observed. 28 months after vegetation was killed by the herbicide treatments no P. cinnamomi was recovered from the soil, indicating that the pathogen can be eradicated from a site, when no living host material is present. This study has made major and significant contributions to our understanding of the life cycle of P. cinnamomi under natural conditions. The ability of the pathogen to grow as a necrotroph or endophytic biotroph indicates that the pathogen has evolved a range of growth modes allowing it to persist in an ecosystem regardless of whether <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts</b> are present or not. It is likely, that similar studies in other natural ecosystems in Australia or elsewhere will provide similar results. The ability to eradicate the pathogen in a relatively short time period through the removal of host material provides many opportunities for the control of this pathogen in managed and natural ecosystems...|$|R

Many high-elevation pine <b>species</b> are <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts</b> and experienced high levels of mortality in recent outbreaks, but co-occurring Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), the longest-living non-clonal organism, were not attacked. I assessed Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle by evaluating mountain pine beetle host selection behavior and reproductive success in this species. To evaluate mountain pine beetle host selection preference for Great Basin bristlecone pine, I used no-choice 48 -hour attack box experiments that confined pioneering female beetles onto pairs of living Great Basin bristlecone and limber pine (P. flexilis), a <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> tree <b>species.</b> To investigate the effect of induced tree defenses on host selection behavior, I repeated the tests on paired sections of Great Basin bristlecone and limber pines that had been recently cut, thereby removing their capacity for induced defensive reactions to an attack. Mountain pine beetles avoided Great Basin bristlecone pine relative to limber pine, suggesting that Great Basin bristlecone pine has {{a high level of}} resistance to mountain pine beetle due at least in part to stimuli that repel pioneering females from initiating attacks, even when induced defenses are compromised. To investigate mountain pine beetle reproductive success in Great Basin bristlecone pine, I compared the mating success, fecundity, and brood production of mountain pine beetle parents placed in cut Great Basin bristlecone pine bolts with that of mountain pine beetles placed in cut bolts of limber pine and lodgepole pine (P. contorta), two susceptible species. Initial reproductive development was similar in all three tree species, but nearly all brood in Great Basin bristlecone pine died before emerging. The extensive offspring mortality observed in Great Basin bristlecone pine may be a key evolutionary driver behind mountain pine beetle aversion to the species. These findings suggest that Great Basin bristlecone pine is a highly resistant species with low vulnerability to climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle outbreaks at high elevations...|$|R

40|$|Phytophthora ramorum, {{the cause}} of sudden oak death in the western USA and a {{damaging}} pathogen in Europe, is a biosecurity threat of unknown magnitude to New Zealand and Australasia because of its presence in traded ornamental plants.

Also, the identification of potential hosts will permit determination of areas at risk within countries {{that do not have}} P. ramorum. Susceptibility of New Zealand plants, including 17 endemic and three commercial species (Eucalyptus globulus, Pinus radiata and Acacia melanoxylon), as well as two known Rhododendron cultivar hosts, was determined by analysing the size of lesions on inoculated excised leaves and branches, while infectivity was determined by counting sporangia produced on leaves. In order to identify extremely <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts,</b> seven <b>species</b> were inoculated using three concentrations of zoospores ranging from low (1 × 10 ^ 2 zoospores/mL) to high (5 × 10 ^ 3 zoospores/mL). In branch inoculations, P. radiata and Nothofagus fusca were as susceptible as the Rhododendron cultivars. Pseudopanax arboreus, Fuchsia excorticata and one Rhododendron cultivar were equally susceptible in leaf inoculations. However, F. excorticata was the only species with 100 % infected leaves, high foliar sporulation and was highly susceptible at all three zoospore concentrations. Leptospermum scoparium was the only asymptomatic foliar host that had high reisolations of the pathogen. F. excorticata, P. radiata, N. fusca, P. arboreus and L. scoparium should be added to the potential host list for P. ramorum and monitored for symptoms and sporulation in gardens and nurseries in the USA and Europe.

40|$|Laurel wilt is a {{destructive}} vascular disease responsible for high mortality of American tree {{species in the}} family Lau raceae, particularly redbay (Persea borbonia) and swampbay (P. palustris), two dominant components of Coastal Plain forest communities in the southeastern United States.

During gallery excavation, females of X. glabratus introduce a newly-described, obligatory fungal symbiont, Raffaelea lauricola. This fungus proliferates within the gallery and provides food for the beetles, but it has proven to be pathogenic to American lauraceous hosts, which have had no co-evolved history with R. lauricola. Presence of the foreign fungus elicits secretion of resins and formation of extensive parenchymal tyloses within xylem vessels. The extreme defensive response results in blockage of water transport, systemic wilt, and ultimately tree death. The beetle vector was first detected near Savannah, Georgia in 2002, and since has spread throughout the Southeast to become established in six states. The epidemic spread south through Florida more rapidly than predicted and currently threatens commercial production of avocado (Persea americana). Recent research indicates that California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) can serve as a re productive host for X. glabratus and is susceptible to laurel wilt disease. Thus, the US Pacific coastal forest ecosys tems (and the California avocado industry) would be negatively impacted should the vector become established along the western coast. This review article summarizes our current understanding of the insect vector, the mycopathogen, and the <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> tree <b>species.</b> It also addresses elements of disease management and limitations with our current de tection methods for redbay ambrosia beetle, which rely on manuka oil lures. Of the host-based attractants evaluated, cubeb oil shows the most promise as a potential new lure for X. glabratus.   </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the coral disease, Acropora white syndrome (AWS), was directly compared on reefs in the species-poor region of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and the species-rich region of American Samoa (AS) with results suggesting that biodiversity, which can affect the abundance of <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts,</b> is important in influencing the impacts of coral disease outbreaks. The diversity-disease hypothesis predicts that decreased <b>host</b> <b>species</b> diversity should result in increased disease severity of specialist pathogens. We found that AWS was more prevalent and had a higher incidence within the NWHI as compared to AS. Individual Acropora colonies affected by AWS showed high mortality in both regions, but case fatality rate and disease severity was higher in the NWHI. The site within the NWHI had a monospecific stand of A. cytherea; a species that is highly susceptible to AWS. Once AWS entered the site, it spread easily amongst the abundant <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts.</b> The site within AS contained numerous Acropora species, which differed in their apparent susceptibility to infection and disease severity, which in turn reduced disease spread. Manipulative studies showed AWS was transmissible through direct contact in three Acropora species. These results will help managers predict and respond to disease outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Wildlife {{epidemiological}} outcomes {{can depend}} strongly on {{the composition of}} an ecological community, particularly when multiple host species {{are affected by the}} same pathogen. However, the relationship between host species richness and disease risk can vary with community context and with the degree of spillover transmission that occurs among co‐occurring host species. We examined the degree to which host species composition influences infection by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a widespread fungal pathogen associated with amphibian population declines around the world, and whether transmission occurs from one highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species</b> to other co‐occurring host species. By manipulating larval assemblages of three sympatric amphibian species in the laboratory, we characterized the relationship between host species richness and infection severity, whether infection mediates growth and survivorship differently across various combinations of host species, and whether Bd is transmitted from experimentally inoculated tadpoles to uninfected tadpoles. We found evidence of a dilution effect where Bd infection severity was dramatically reduced in the most susceptible of the three host species (Anaxyrus boreas). Infection also mediated survival and growth of all three host species such that the presence of multiple host species had both positive (e. g., infection reduction) and negative (e. g., mortality) effects on focal species. However, we found no evidence that Bd infection is transmitted by this species. While these results demonstrate that host species richness as well as species identity underpin infection dynamics in this system, dilution is not the product of reduced transmission via fewer infectious individuals of a <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> We discuss various mechanisms, including encounter reduction and antagonistic interactions such as competition and opportunistic cannibalism that may act in concert to mediate patterns of infection severity, growth, and mortality observed in multihost communities. There are many ways in which infection can be influenced by species diversity. Here we show experimentally that the interactions between species in a multi‐host amphibian community drive the severity of infection by the amphibian chytrid fungus. We find no evidence that infection is transmitted between two host species in our study, suggesting that spillover infection is not a cause of dilution effects in this system...|$|E
40|$|Root {{infection}} in <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species</b> is initiated predominantly {{in the zone}} of elongation, whereas {{the remainder of the}} root is resistant. Nectria haematococca infection of pea (Pisum sativum) was used as a model to explore possible mechanisms influencing the localization of root infection. The failure to infect the root tip was not due to a failure to induce spore germination at this site, suppression of pathogenicity genes in the fungus, or increased expression of plant defense genes. Instead, exudates from the root tip induce rapid spore germination by a pathway that is independent of nutrient-induced germination. Subsequently, a factor produced during fungal infection and death of border cells at the root apex appears to selectively suppress fungal growth and prevent sporulation. Host-specific mantle formation in response to border cells appears to represent a previously unrecognized form of host-parasite relationship common to diverse species. The dynamics of signal exchange leading to mantle development may {{play a key role in}} fostering plant health, by protecting root meristems from pathogenic invasion...|$|E
40|$|Pichinde virus (PICV) is an enveloped {{single-stranded}} RNA New World arenavirus. The {{new world}} arenaviruses {{are divided into}} three separate clades designated as A, B, and C. The clade B arenaviruses are known to cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever. The clade A PICV is prevalent in the rodent population of Colombia. PICV is currently designated as a biosafety level- 2 (BSL 2) pathogen due to its low pathogenicity in humans. Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the cellular receptors utilized by the virus glycoproteins to enter the host cell. Clade B arenaviruses utilize various species-specific forms of Transferrin Receptor 1 {{to gain access to the}} inside of a host cell where they replicate. The cellular receptor that mediates entry by clade A arenaviruses has not been identified and is the basis of my research. The goal of this study is to purify PICV glycoprotein variants containing multiple truncations in order to study the binding of the glycoprotein to cells from highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> We have designed and purified multiple protein truncations of the PICV virus glycoprotein. The binding interactions of these protein truncations requires further study...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study describes development and evaluation of a simulation model representing the life cycle of the parasite Haematoloechus coloradensis, and use of the model to examine effects of variations in temperature and precipitation on parasite population dynamics. The model consists of 4 submodels, each representing dynamics of a different developmental stage of the parasite and population dynamics of its associated <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> The parasite egg submodel represents dynamics of parasite eggs in the environment as a function of parasite recruitment and mortality, and snail infection. Snail, odonate, and frog submodels represent population dynamics and infection of the 3 <b>host</b> <b>species,</b> and parasite development within each host. In the snail submodel parasites are affected by recruitment of susceptible individuals, snail infection, cercariae shedding, and snail and cercaria mortality. Snail infection is determined by encounter rate between parasite eggs and susceptible snails. In both odonate and frog submodels recruitment and mortality of hosts constitute the source of <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts</b> and parasite mortality, respectively. Odonate infection is determined by encounter rate between cercariae and susceptible odonates. Frog infection is determined by encounter rate between infected odonates and susceptible frogs. Simulated population dynamics and seasonal variations in prevalences of infection for second (odonate) and definitive (frog) hosts generally agreed with field observations (Dronen, 1978). Differences between simulated and observed variations in prevalence for the first intermediate host (snail), probably were due to failure of the model to represent (1) effects of temperature on parasite development within snails and (2) parasite-induced host mortality. High precipitation and short summers (favorable conditions for host populations) resulted in higher stable prevalences than baseline conditions for the 3 <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> Simulated effects of low precipitation and extended summers (unfavorable conditions for <b>host</b> <b>species)</b> indicated that temperature had a greater impact on parasite population dynamics than precipitation. <b>Susceptible</b> <b>host</b> abundances were decreased during extended summers to levels below which encounter rate could maintain the parasite population. Overall, results suggest that timing of occurrence of a given disturbance may be as important in determining impact on parasite population dynamics as the specific nature of the disturbance...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRecent {{cases of}} {{emergent}} diseases have {{renewed interest in}} the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that promote parasite adaptation to novel hosts [1 – 6]. Crucial to adaptation is the degree of mixing of original, <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts,</b> and novel hosts. An increase {{in the frequency of}} the original host has two opposing effects on adaptation: an increase in the supply of mutant pathogens with improved performance on the novel host [7 – 9]; and reduced selection to infect novel hosts, caused by fitness costs commonly observed to be associated with host switching [10 – 17]. The probability of disease emergence will therefore peak at intermediate frequencies of the original host. We tested these predictions by following the evolution of a virus grown under a range of different frequencies of susceptible (original) and resistant (novel) host bacteria. Viruses that evolved to infect resistant hosts were only detected when <b>susceptible</b> <b>hosts</b> were at frequencies between 0. 1 % and 1 %. Subsequent experiments supported the predictions that there was reduced selection and mutation supply at higher and lower frequencies, respectively. These results suggest that adaptation to novel hosts can occur only under very specific ecological conditions, and that small changes in contact rates between <b>host</b> <b>species</b> might help to mitigate disease emergence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractViroids are single-stranded, covalently closed, circular, highly {{structured}} noncoding RNAs that cause disease in several economically important crop plants. They replicate autonomously and move systemically in host plants {{with the aid}} of the host machinery. In addition to symptomatic infections, viroids also cause latent infections where there is no visual evidence of infection in the host; however, transfer to a <b>susceptible</b> <b>host</b> can result in devastating disease. While there are non-hosts for viroids, no naturally occurring durable resistance has been observed in most <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> Current effective control methods for viroid diseases include detection and eradication, and cultural controls. In addition, heat or cold therapy combined with meristem tip culture {{has been shown to be}} effective for elimination of viroids for some viroid–host combinations. An understanding of viroid–host interactions, host susceptibility, and non-host resistance could provide guidance for the design of viroid-resistant plants. Efforts to engineer viroid resistance into <b>host</b> <b>species</b> have been underway for several years, and include the use of antisense RNA, antisense RNA plus ribozymes, a dsRNase, and siRNAs, among others. The results of those efforts and the challenges associated with creating viroid resistant plants are summarized in this review...|$|R
