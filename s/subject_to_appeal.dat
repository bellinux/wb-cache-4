He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K.

25|$|Many of {{the former}} lower-level Traditional Courts became magistrates' courts, able to apply {{customary}} law, but <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the High Court. The Malawi Constitution of 1994 recognised customary law {{as an integral part}} of the legal system and provided for Traditional Courts with limited jurisdiction over civil and minor criminal cases, but no legislation to set up such courts was introduced until 2011. In February 2011, the Malawi Parliament approved legislation re-introducing local traditional courts handling most civil cases and some minor criminal cases, as a means of making justice more accessible to rural Malawians. This legislation had not been put into effect because of financial constraints as of May 2017.|$|E
25|$|On February 14, two {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses in Jefferson County, Timothy Love, Lawrence Ysunza, Maurice Blanchard, and Dominique James, {{asked to be}} allowed to intervene in the suit because their challenge to Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage within the state raises substantially the same arguments as the original suit. On February 27, 2014, before the final order was issued, the state attorney general asked Judge Heyburn to stay enforcement of his Bourke order for 90 days, noting that even if the state does not appeal the decision it needs time to implement it. Judge Heyburn issued a final order in Bourke on the same day ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions at once, which created de jure legalization of recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages; being a final order it was then immediately <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal.</b> He then bifurcated the case and allowed the new plaintiffs to intervene and argue against Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to in-state {{same-sex couples}}. This portion of the case would remain in district court, retitled as Love v. Beshear. A briefing schedule on the in-state issue was completed by May 28. On February 28, 2014, Judge Heyburn issued a shorter, 21-day stay in Bourke, instead.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{amended the}} INA to add new {{provisions}} enforcing mandatory detention laws. These apply to any alien who {{is engaged in}} terrorism, or who is engaged in an activity that endangers U.S. national security. It also applies {{to those who are}} inadmissible or who must be deported because it is certified they are attempting to enter to undertake illegal espionage; are exporting goods, technology, or sensitive information illegally; or are attempting to control or overthrow the government; or have, or will have, engaged in terrorist activities. The Attorney General or the Attorney General's deputy may maintain custody of such aliens until they are removed from the U.S., unless it is no longer deemed they should be removed, in which case they are released. The alien can be detained for up to 90 days but can be held up to six months after it is deemed that they are a national security threat. However, the alien must be charged with a crime or removal proceedings start no longer than seven days after the alien's detention, otherwise the alien will be released. However, such detentions must be reviewed every six months by the Attorney General, who can then decide to revoke it, unless prevented from doing so by law. Every six months the alien may apply, in writing, for the certification to be reconsidered. Judicial review of any action or decision relating to this section, including judicial review of the merits of a certification, can be held under habeas corpus proceedings. Such proceedings can be initiated by an application filed with the United States Supreme Court, by any justice of the Supreme Court, by any circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or by any district court otherwise having jurisdiction to entertain the application. The final order is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Provisions were also made for a report to be required every six months of such decisions from the U.S. Attorney General to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate.|$|E

These courts operated through relaxed rules of evidence and due process and were often staffed by law students and inexperienced lawyers. However, the decisions of the [...] "Tribunales Especiales" [...] were <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> in regular courts. Many of the National Guard prisoners were released immediately due to lack of evidence. Others were pardoned or released by decree.

2500|$|Due to the {{deviation}} from normal NCAA investigative process {{as well as}} the nature of the sanctions, four trustees of the university filed an appeal of the sanctions. Board member Ryan McCombie, a 26-year U.S. Navy veteran who was elected to the board in July 2012 by members of the school's alumni association, led the trustee appeal. A letter filed on the trustees' behalf by Paul Kelly of Jackson Lewis LLP with the NCAA called the sanctions [...] "excessive and unreasonable". The letter also argued that President Erickson exceeded his authority in accepting the sanctions.
