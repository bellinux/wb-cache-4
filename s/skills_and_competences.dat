50|$|DISCO - European Dictionary of <b>Skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>Competences</b> is a {{structured}} vocabulary for {{the description of}} <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> in different contexts such as labour market, education, and training, and the recognition of qualifications. DISCO provides a <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> classification that is neither linked to occupations nor to qualifications. Instead it functions as a thesaurus of <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competences</b> {{which is based on}} existing international standards and classifications and thus represents a terminological basis for the description of <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competences,</b> occupations as well as personal skill profiles and CVs, job vacancies, and job requirements or for describing curricula, courses, Diploma and Certificate Supplements or learning outcomes in general. Available in ten language versions (CZ, DE, EN, ES, FR, HU, IT, LT, SE, SK), DISCO is meant to support transnational comparability of competences acquired in an educational or work context throughout Europe.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an assessment strategy for an Engineering problem-based learning course offered to first year {{students at the}} University of Southern Queensland. The assessment involves initial auditing of existing <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> of each student to facilitate the effective allocation of students with different levels of expertise in various discipline areas, into well balanced teams. This balance {{in combination with the}} formal assessments in the course, have been shown to encourage effective mentoring within and between teams. The formal assessment strategy includes a mix of both summative and formative assessment. The summative assessment of objectives combines team and individual assessment and is tailored to individual students’ existing skill levels. The emphasis is on advancement of <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> rather than simply achieving a minimum standard. This strategy provides the flexibility for equitable assessment of students with different initial <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> levels. This is particularly relevant to students studying in the distance mode who may have considerable professional experience <b>and</b> advanced <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence.</b> By tracking progress towards the achievement of objectives, students develop an individual portfolio of achievements that can be continued throughout the remainder of their programs and professional lives. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a strategy for}} auditing existing <b>skill</b> levels, <b>and</b> assessing achievement of course objectives, by students enrolled in Engineering Problem Based Learning (PBL) courses. Our method involves initial auditing of existing <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> of each student, and continual assessment to monitor progress. The initial skill assessment will facilitate the effective allocation of students with different levels of skill in various discipline areas, into well balanced teams. This balance will facilitate effective mentoring within the teams and, because improvement by individuals and the team collectively will be formally assessed, mentoring within the teams will be encouraged. The formal assessment of objectives will be tailored to individual student’s existing skill levels. The emphasis will be on advancement of <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> rather than simply achieving a minimum standard. This novel strategy will provide the flexibility for equitable assessment of students with different initial <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> competency levels; particularly relevant to students studying in the distance mode who may have considerable professional experience <b>and</b> advanced <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence.</b> By tracking progress towards the achievement of objectives, students can be provided with an individual portfolio of achievements through the suite of PBL courses. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} which <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> are {{imperative to}} assure optimal effectiveness {{and safety of}} procedural sedation (PS) in children and to analyze the underlying levels of evidence. Study Design and methods. Systematic review of literature published between 1993 and March 2009. Selected papers were classified according to their methodological quality and summarized in evidence-based conclusions. Next, conclusions were used to formulate recommendations. Results. Although the safety profiles vary among PS drugs, the possibility of potentially serious adverse events and the predictability of depth and duration of sedation define the imperative <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> necessary for a timely recognition and appropriate management. The level of effectiveness is mainly determined by the ability to apply titratable PS, including deep sedation using short-acting anesthetics for invasive procedures and nitrous oxide for minor painful procedures, and the implementation of non-pharmacological techniques. Conclusions. PS related safety and effectiveness {{are determined by the}} circumstances <b>and</b> professional <b>skills</b> rather than by specific pharmacologic characteristics. Evidence based recommendations regarding necessary <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>competence</b> should be used to set up training programs and to define which professionals can and cannot be credentialed for PS in children...|$|R
