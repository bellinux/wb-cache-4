2500|$|However, {{these type}} of possessors are problematic. There is a {{discrepancy}} between where the possessor appears syntactically in an inalienable possession construction and what its <b>semantic</b> <b>relationship</b> to the inalienable noun seems to be. Semantically, the possessor of an inalienable noun is intrinsic to its meaning and acts like a semantic argument. In the surface syntactic structure, however, the possessor appears in a position that marks it as an argument of the verb. [...] Thus, there are different views on how these types of inalienable possession constructions should be represented in the syntactic structure. The binding hypothesis argues that the possessor is an argument of the verb. Conversely, the possessor-raising hypothesis argues that the possessor originates as an argument of the possessed noun and then moves to [...] a position where on the surface {{it looks like it}} is an argument of the verb.|$|E

This transformation—applying the logarithm, then dividing by the information entropy of the item over all contexts—provides for greater differentiation between items and effectively weights items by their ability to predict context, and vice versa (that is, items that appear across many contexts, like [...] "the" [...] or [...] "and", will be weighted less, reflecting their lack of semantic information). A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is then performed on the matrix , which allows the number of dimensions in the matrix to be reduced, thus clustering LSA's semantic representations and providing for indirect association between items. For example, [...] "cat" [...] and [...] "dog" [...] may never appear {{together in the same}} context, so their close <b>semantic</b> <b>relationship</b> may not be well-captured by LSA's original matrix [...] However, by performing the SVD and reducing the number of dimensions in the matrix, the context vectors of [...] "cat" [...] and [...] "dog"—which would be very similar—would migrate toward one another and perhaps merge, thus allowing [...] "cat" [...] and [...] "dog" [...] to act as retrieval cues for each other, even though they may never have co-occurred. The degree of semantic relatedness of items in memory is given by the cosine of the angle between the items' context vectors (ranging from 1 for perfect synonyms to 0 for no relationship). Essentially, then, two words are closely semantically related if they appear in similar types of documents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To develop {{sophisticated}} {{database management}} systems, {{there is a}} need to incorporate more understanding of the real world in the information that is stored in a database. Semantic data models have been developed to try to capture some of the meaning, as well as the structure, of data using abstractions such as inclusion, aggregation, and association. Besides these well-known relationships, a number of additional <b>semantic</b> <b>relationships</b> have been identified by researchers in other disciplines such as linguistics, logic, and cognitive psychology. This article explores some of the lesser-recognized <b>semantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and discusses both how they could be captured, either manually or by using an automated tool, and their impact on database design.

40|$|Objective: To explore {{multiple}} {{relationships in}} traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge by comparing binary and multiple relationships during knowledge organization. Methods: Characteristics of binary and multiple <b>semantic</b> <b>relationships</b> {{as well as}} their associations are described. A method to classify multiple relationships based on the involvement of time is proposed and theoretically validated using examples from the ancient TCM classic Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces. The classification includes parallel multiple relationships, restricted multiple relationships, multiple relationships that involve time, and multiple relationships that involve time restriction. Next, construction of multiple <b>semantic</b> <b>relationships</b> for TCM concepts in each classification using Protégé, an ontology editing tool is described. Results: Protégé is superior to a binary relationship and less than ideal with multiple relationships during the constitution of concept relationships.

Semantics {{seems to be a}} promising field for their application: Greimas observed how semantic layers are stabilized in a document thanks to redundancy, thus transmitting less information. For example, the context stabilizes one of the possible meanings of ambiguous syntactic structures such as “the chicken is ready to eat. ” by reducing the probability of the other meanings. Among different probabilistic algorithms, a model based on quantum geometry could better represent natural language semantics. <b>Semantic</b> <b>relationships</b> seem not commutative [3]; they violates Leibniz's law as it happens in quantum logic; many <b>semantic</b> <b>relationships</b> are not represented by morphosyntactic elements, as the vector state is not observable; the stabilisation of a semantic bind could be modelled by entanglement.
