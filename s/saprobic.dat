5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{can form}} fairy rings in grassy areas like pastures, {{and is also}} found along roadsides; it {{produces}} fruiting bodies in summer and autumn. It is a <b>saprobic</b> species, and so derives nutrients by decomposing organic matter.|$|E
5|$|The fungus is <b>saprobic,</b> {{and grows}} on the ground, in leaf litter, or on decomposing wood. It has been {{collected}} in Spain, South Carolina, Florida, and Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|A <b>saprobic</b> species, Entoloma murrayi derives {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a <b>saprobic</b> species, {{deriving}} {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One field guide notes {{a preference for}} sugar maple. It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together {{at the base of}} the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Mycena inclinata is a <b>saprobic</b> fungus, {{deriving}} its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of {{breaking down the}} three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} others {{species of the}} genus Psilocybe, is a <b>saprobic</b> fungus, meaning it obtains {{nutrients}} by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought {{to live on the}} decaying root remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} Calostoma have been {{collected}} in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests, containing tree species from the families Fagaceae, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae, and Dipterocarpaceae. The type species C.cinnabarinum was shown to form ectomycorrhizae with Quercus species, using isotopic labeling, molecular and morphological analyses. Southeast Asian Calostoma have also been described as ectomycorrhizal. Calostoma sarasinii forms ectomycorrhizae with species of Lithocarpus (Fagaceae) while Calostoma retisporum forms ectomycorrhizae with species from the Myrtaceae. The ectomycorrhizal mode of nutrition is predominant in the Sclerodermatineae suborder. Historically, it had been assumed to be <b>saprobic,</b> due to its taxonomic uncertainly, and presumed relatedness to other <b>saprobic</b> fungi like the stalked puffballs and the earthstars.|$|E
5|$|A <b>saprobic</b> species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or {{in groups}} or {{clusters}} on the ground. It can also grow in fairy rings. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It {{has been reported}} from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance.|$|E
5|$|A <b>saprobic</b> species, {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus hondensis grow {{scattered}} or in groups under conifers or in mixed forests. They {{have also been}} reported to grow in fairy rings. The fungus {{is found in the}} Pacific Coast of North America, from British Columbia in Canada south to California, but is most common in California. The mushroom fruits in the fall from September to October throughout much of its range, but in California the fruiting season tends to be from November to February.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a <b>saprobic</b> species, {{and grows}} on dead leaves {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is {{frequently}} encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E
5|$|Crinipellis zonata is <b>saprobic,</b> {{living on}} the debris or roots of hardwoods; it {{contains}} wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. The mushrooms grow individually or in small clusters, {{and can be found}} between August and September. In North America, it is distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal. It has also been collected in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a <b>saprobic</b> fungus, {{and grows}} on the {{decaying}} wood of deciduous and coniferous trees. Host species include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is <b>saprobic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa is a <b>saprobic</b> species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in {{clusters}} on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. The fungus has been noted to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} <b>saprobic,</b> {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all species}} {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is <b>saprobic,</b> and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed {{to such an extent}} that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha.|$|E
5|$|Lysurus mokusin is <b>saprobic,</b> {{and grows}} solitarily {{or in small}} groups in forest litter, and wood chip mulch used in landscaping, and compost. Documented {{sightings}} of L.mokusin include Australasia, the Canary Islands, Korea, Japan, China (Fujian Province), and the Bonin Islands. The species was unknown in Europe until it was reported in Italy in 1979; it is considered an alien species in that continent. In the United States, it has been collected from the states of California, Texas, and Washington, D.C..|$|E
5|$|Mycena cinerella is a <b>saprobic</b> fungus, and derives {{nutrients}} by decomposing {{leaf litter}} and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic {{matter in the}} soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under pine and Douglas fir, typically {{in the late summer}} and autumn. In the United States, it has been collected from Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California. In Europe, it has also been collected from the Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota flammans, {{commonly}} known as the yellow pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap, is a basidiomycete agaric mushroom of the genus Pholiota. Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales. As it is a <b>saprobic</b> fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead coniferous trees. P.flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in boreal and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified.|$|E
5|$|Strobilurus tenacellus is a <b>saprobic</b> wood-rotting fungus. It fruits singly or {{in small}} groups on fallen and often {{partially}} buried cones of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in coniferous and mixed forests. It is found in Europe and Asia, {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grow {{scattered}} or {{in groups}} on forest duff or humus under conifers, summer and fall, and may grow in rings or arcs. Thought to be a <b>saprobic</b> species (that is, obtaining nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter), {{it has also}} been found on rotten wood. The fungus is able to protect itself from mycophagy by the springtail Ceratophysella denisana, a common mushroom feeder, by releasing repellent odorous compounds when it is injured.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula pusio grow on the ground, on well-rotted stumps, or among {{decaying}} tussock grass. They are {{presumed to be}} <b>saprobic,</b> and obtain nutrients by breaking down larger organic molecules found in the soil or in decaying wood. P.miranda in contrast, {{is thought to be}} ectomycorrhizal, as it appears to associate with Arillastrum gummiferum, the predominant canopy tree in the forests where it is found.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a broad {{distribution}} in forested areas of North America and Europe. A <b>saprobic</b> fungus, it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter, {{and as such}} is usually found growing on the stumps and logs of fallen deciduous trees. However, it is also found {{on a variety of}} living trees as well. For example, in Europe it has been found on the stems of living spruce (Picea abies) in Finland, France, Great Britain, Norway, and Germany.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} <b>saprobic,</b> and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color makes it easy to overlook.|$|E
5|$|A <b>saprobic</b> species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and {{overlapping}} clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>saprobic</b> mushroom, or {{decomposer}} {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|Banksiamyces is {{classified}} in the Helotiaceae, a widespread but poorly known family of fungi, many species of which are <b>saprobic</b> on herbaceous or woody tissues. The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative, and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order. Based on physical similarity, Wen-Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the Encoelioideae subfamily of the Helotiaceae. He conceded, however, {{that he had not}} examined any specimens.|$|E
5|$|Being <b>saprobic,</b> P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees, with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn. It is a fungus {{with a wide}} geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a <b>saprobic</b> species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it is characterized by the bright orange to yellow cap that in young specimens is covered with tufts of fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E
5|$|Like many morel species, the {{ecological}} mode of Morchella populiphila {{is not known}} with certainty, but it is suspected of being both <b>saprobic</b> (obtaining its nourishment from nonliving or decaying organic matter) and mycorrhizal (symbiotic with trees) at different stages in its life cycle. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups. It is found in Oregon to Nevada and northern California, where it grows on dried-out riverbeds. Fruiting, which occurs in the spring, tends to occur shortly after the emergence of Verpa mushrooms, and before the appearance of other morels.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a <b>saprobic</b> fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, {{deriving}} nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum, {{commonly}} known as the spiny puffball or the spring puffball, is a type of puffball mushroom in the genus Lycoperdon. The <b>saprobic</b> species has been found in Africa, Europe, Central America, and North America, where it grows on soil in deciduous woods, glades, and pastures. It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, Lycoperdon americanum, but this suggestion has not been followed by most authors. Molecular analysis indicates that L.echinatum is closely related to the puffball genus Handkea.|$|E
5|$|Parasola auricoma is a <b>saprobic</b> species, and so obtains {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down organic matter into simpler molecules. The fruit bodies grow either singly or in groups, often in large numbers, at road sides in deciduous forests, or on grassy areas. The mushrooms are short-lived, usually lasting {{only for a}} few hours before collapsing. Common in Europe and North America (including Hawaii), it has also been recorded from Japan. In Europe, fruit bodies appear most commonly in spring and summer months, while in North America, fruiting is more common in the late summer and autumn, after rains.|$|E
5|$|Phallus hadriani is a <b>saprobic</b> species, {{and thus}} obtains {{nutrients}} by decomposing organic matter. In North America, {{it is commonly}} associated with tree stumps, or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground. In Great Britain, its distribution {{is more or less}} restricted to coastal dunes, while in Poland, it has been noted to avoid humid and humic forest soils, and live in symbiosis with xerophilous grasses and the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia. The mushroom is one of three species protected by the Red Data Book of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi is a <b>saprobic</b> species, and derives {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down the complex insoluble polysaccharides found in woody material, such as cellulose and lignin. Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups, and are attached to buried or partially buried sticks in forests. Basswood has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species. Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring, but may occasionally also in late fall. Although the distribution appears to be largely restricted to the eastern United States, it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994, representing the first European collection.|$|E
5|$|The fungus is <b>saprobic,</b> and so derives {{nutrients}} from breaking down dead plant material, such as leaves, bark, needles, and twigs, that {{has fallen to}} the ground. Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech-hemlock forests {{during the summer and}} autumn, although it has been recorded growing on lawns. It is also often found under eastern North American oaks. The distribution includes the US states Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Vermont. It has also been collected in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
