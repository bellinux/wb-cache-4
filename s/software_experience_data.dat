40|$|The {{efficient}} management of experience knowledge is vital in todayâ��s knowledge-based economy. This paper {{is concerned with}} proposing a model for <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> knowledge. The model is aimed to represent the backend of knowledge management tools that support organisational learning activities in a typical software organisation. Generic knowledge models have failed to produce good quality <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> management tools. The diversity in the types and forms of <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> knowledge makes it necessary to establish customised knowledge models to effectively accommodate such domain-specific knowledge. Our model extends the simple generic knowledge models that usually rely on non parameterised knowledge (i. e. free text) or that just reflect certain types of <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> knowledge (tacit or explicit). In contrast, our model aims to strike a delicate balance between explicit and tacit knowledge {{that in a way}} act as correlated information sources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{studies the}} {{potential}} success of using <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> bases for organizational learning. First, {{a survey of}} some previous efforts in the area is presented, together with experiences from related fields. The NASA-SEL Experience Factory will be especially commented. We note, that, modern network technologies like the Web provide new possibilities for distributed storage, access and dissemination of relevant knowledge. However, the main problem lies in internalizing formal knowledge (learning), not in externalizing experiences (model building). Then we present an empirical study of four <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> bases in the Norwegian SPIQ project for software process improvement, done in 1997 - 99. The SPIQ project proposes a pragmatical, overall method for how to plan, establish, use and evaluate <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> bases. The actual hypotheses and research method are presented, followed by a characterization of the studied experience bases and their actual usage and role in the associated companies. The most critical success factors {{are found to be}} incremental startup with a low ambition level, usefulness of the knowledge being offered, and, most importantly, stable company strategies and key personnel (may seem obvious, but still not easy). Some advice for introducing and evaluating <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> bases are finally given. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} gender, grade and experience, defined as {{technological}} experience on one hand, and <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> on the other, upon various attitudes were examined. Specifically, three sets of attitudes were examined: (1) the usefulness of technology to curriculum, career awareness, self and society, (2) anxiety, confidence, liking and usefulness, and (3) affective and cognitive domains. Three instruments were administered: the Vosburg Survey (1993, modified), the Computer Attitude Scale (Gressard 2 ̆ 6 Loyd, 1986), and the Cognitive and Affective Attitude Scales (Bannon, Marshall, 2 ̆ 6 Fluegal, 1985). The experimental group included 80 grade 10 and 11 students, who were surveyed after two years of intensive work with modern technological applications in their elementary school. The control group consisted of 78 students from the same high school who were of similar age and gender, but who did not have the same intensive elementary school background in the use of technology. Data showed that students with more technological experience had a more positive attitude with regard to liking technology. In addition, greater <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> was related to reduced anxiety and more positive ratings for curriculum, career awareness, self, society, and the cognitive domain. Moreover, greater <b>software</b> <b>experience</b> was related to more positive attitudes for males in the areas of confidence and liking.

40|$|For mobile {{networks}} diverse usage scenarios {{have different}} capability requirements on connection density and user <b>experienced</b> <b>data</b> rate, and modeling such capability diversity {{is crucial to}} the strategy evaluation in addressing the problem of high traffic load and scalability of network resources. Therefore, it is necessary to build a capability model in two dimensions of connection density and user <b>experienced</b> <b>data</b> rate. This paper aims at addressing this challenge based on an investigation of network capability in large-scale urban environment. First, our statistical study shows that the spatial distribution of these two parameters can be accurately fitted by log-normal mixture model. Second, we find that only six basic capability patterns exist among the 9, 000 cellular base stations. Their connections with the urban functions of geographical locations are also explored in our work. Based on these two discoveries, we build a network capability model which can generate synthetic base stations with diverse connection density and user <b>experienced</b> <b>data</b> rate.

40|$|In design {{research}} literature, several {{tools and}} techniques {{have been developed}} that support design teams in establishing creative understandings of people and their contexts of product use, e. g.
