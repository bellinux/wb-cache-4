5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> black and white stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> horizontal red and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue <b>shirt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
