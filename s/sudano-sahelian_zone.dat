40|$|The {{major problem}} {{when dealing with}} {{modeling}} evapotranspiration process is its nonlinear dynamic high complexity. Researchers developed reference evapotranspiration (ET-ref) estimation models in rich and poor data situations. Thus, the well-known Penman-Monteith (PM) model always performs the highest accuracy results of ET-ref from a rich data situation. Its application in many areas particularly in developing countries such as Burkina Faso has been limited by the unavailability of the enormous climatic data required. In such circumstances, simple empirical Hargreaves (HARG) equation is often used despite of its non-universal suitability. The present study assesses the artificial neural network (ANN) performance in ET-ref modeling based on temperature data in Bobo-Dioulasso region, located in the <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> of Burkina Faso. The models of feed forward backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm type ANN and Hargreaves (HARG) were employed to study their performance by comparing with the true PM. From the statistical results, BPNN temperature-based models perform better than HARG. Beside, when wind speed is introduced into the neural network models, the coefficient of determination (r 2) increases significantly up to 9. 52 %. While, sunshine duration and relative humidity might cause only 3. 51 and 6. 69 % of difference, respectively.

Earlier studies by ICRISAT and CIRAD and their partners in West Africa showed {{the potential of}} the implementation of these principles for the management of some major pests of both staple food and horticultural crops, and their limitations for others, notably in the water-saving and income-generating systems mixing cereals, legumes, and high-value crops currently promoted in the <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> <b>zones,</b> such as the drip irrigation-based African Market Garden (AMG) and the water harvesting-based Bio-Reclamation of Degraded Lands (BDL) systems. Pigeon-pea showed potential for trap-cropping tomato fruit worm (TFW) on okra, while Andropogon grass was dismissed for such management of stem-borer on pearl millet, and mixed results were obtained with castor bean and other potential trap crops for panicle-feeding bug management on sorghum.

I begin this work by disaggregating the term "food security" into its various components, then continue by exploring what is generally understood by the concept of "desertification" and what this actually translates to in terms of land degradation. I then discuss how an error in NASA's method for calculating interannual NDVI CoVs impacted both my own work and our concepts of the Sahel's boundaries. Field data I gathered in the central and northern Sahel indicate that cogent, simple explanations of latitudinal variations in CoV do exist, albeit not everywhere. The Gourma region of Mali provides an excellent example of how complexity confounds any neat quantization of information. For the more southerly agropastoral zone, high CoV variability flags rapid, dynamic desertification processes. Results of village- and household-level profiles along a transect in the heart of Hausaland confirm that rapid, dynamic land degradation corresponds with a high interannual CoV. Climate, especially rainfall and potential evaporation, form the basis of an analysis the outcome of which explains how and why the Malian Gourma shows a nonlinear, "anomalous" NDVI response to rainfall. I also explore the strong correlation between rainfall and NDVI in the southern Sahel, but conclude {{that if there is a}} link between NDVI and crop yields, it is very weak indeed.

Plant growth was assessed in 5 – 6 plots per field in 48 fields located in the <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> agro-ecological <b>zone</b> of southeastern Mali. A unique series of Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In this experiment, for half of the fields at least 50 % of the NDVI variance within a field was due to fertilization. Moreover, the sensitivity of NDVI to fertilizer application was crop-dependent and varied through the season, with optima at the end of August for peanut and cotton and early October for sorghum and maize. The influence of fertilizer on NDVI was comparatively small at the landscape scale (up to 35 % of total variation), relative to the influence of other components of variation such as field management and catena position. The NDVI response could only partially be benchmarked against a fertilization reference within the field.

Yet, they continue to be left out in decision-making, affecting their livelihoods and benefitting little or nothing from developmental programmes/projects. Of the eight environmental/rural development projects implemented in Katsina State, northern Nigeria from 1996 to 2006, none were for the pastoralists ([Ibrahim 2006]). Over the years, access to their land and other critical resources is undermined. The 1965 Grazing Reserve Law aimed to settle herders in northern Nigeria, through the acquisition of ‘native land’ for grazing. However, less than 1 % of targeted grazing reserves had been gazetted in the northern states by 1980. In 1988, an ambitious programme to support pastoral livelihoods was launched, aimed to grant 10 % of national territory as grazing reserves for lease allocation to herders, an effort by the central government to protect pastoralism, but that has not been enforced; by 1998, of the 313 grazing reserves acquired, only 52 were gazetted, and even these reserves have been intruded into by agricultural cultivation ([CIEL 2006]; [Hoffmann 2004]; [Moutari 2008]). As the expansion of arable terrain continues, pastoralists are being driven into ever more marginal areas, and cultivators continue to extract the water which feeds pastoral wells.|$|R

In order to help improve its growth and development, we assessed mycorrhizal diversity of tamarind parklands in Senegal. Materials and methods. Three sites of tamarind populations were sampled for each agro-ecological zone in Senegal: the Sahelian zone (i), Sahelo-Sudan zone (ii) and Sudan zone (iii). Soil and root samples were collected in each site and used for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) spore isolation and root colonization assessment. We identified the mycorrhizal fungi from spore collections and evaluated the root mycorrhization rate, defined as percentage of roots colonized according to agro-ecological zones. Results and discussion. The results did not reveal a specific AM fungal strain associated with tamarind plants. Three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were identified from spores on the genus level: Glomus, Scutellospora and Acaulospora. Tamarind sites with sandy soil texture (70 - 90 %) and located in dry areas (Sahel and Sudano-Sahel zones) were shown to be rich in mycorrhizal propagules. High densities of soil AM propagules evaluated with the Most Probable Number method (MPN) were found in Niokhoul (1100 propagules per 50 g of soil), Sakal (790 propagules per 50 g of soil) and Mbassis (780 propagules per 50 g of soil).

40|$|Rural {{people in}} the Sahel derive {{multiple}} benefits from local ecosystem services on a daily basis. At the same time, {{a large proportion of}} the population lives in multidimensional poverty. The global sustainability challenge is thus manifested in its one extreme here, with a strong need to improve human well-being without degrading the landscapes that people depend on. To address this challenge, knowledge on how local people interact with their landscapes, and how this changes over time, must be improved. An ecosystem services approach, focusing on benefits to people from ecosystem processes, is useful in this context. However, methods for assessing ecosystem services that include local knowledge while addressing a scale relevant for development interventions are lacking. In this thesis, such methods are developed to study Sahelian landscapes through an ecosystem services lens. The thesis is focused on village landscapes and is based on in-depth fieldwork in six villages in northern Burkina Faso. In these villages, participatory methods were used to identify social-ecological patches (landscape units that correspond with local descriptions of landscapes, characterized by a combination of land use, land cover and topography), the provisioning ecosystem services generated in each social-ecological patch, and the benefits from ecosystem services to livelihoods (Paper I). In Paper II, change in cover of social-ecological patches mapped on aerial photographs and satellite images from the period 1952 - 2016 was combined with population data and focus group discussions to evaluate change in generation of ecosystem services over time. In Paper III, up-scaling of the village scale assessment to provincial scale was done through the development of a classification method to identify social-ecological patches on medium-resolution satellite images. Paper IV addresses the whole <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> climate <b>zone</b> of West Africa, to analyze woody vegetation as a key component for ecosystem services generation in the landscape. It is based on a systematic review of which provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are documented from trees and shrubs on agricultural lands in the region. Social-ecological patches and associated sets of ecosystem services are very similar in all studied villages across the two regions. Most social-ecological patches generate multiple ecosystem services with multiple benefits, illustrating a multifunctional landscape (Paper I). The social-ecological patches and ecosystem services are confirmed at province level in both regions, and the dominant social-ecological patches can be mapped with high accuracy on medium-resolution satellite images (Paper III). The potential generation of cultivated crops has more or less kept up with population growth in the villages, while the potential for other ecosystem services, particularly firewood, has decreased per capita (Paper II). Trees and shrubs contribute with multiple ecosystem services, but their landscape effects, especially on regulating ecosystem services, must be better studied (Paper IV). The thesis provides new insights about the complex and multi-functional landscapes of rural Sahel, nuancing dominating narratives on environmental change in the region. It also provides new methods that include local knowledge in ecosystem services assessments, which can be up-scaled to scales relevant for development interventions, and used to analyze changes in ecosystem services over time. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript. Paper 3 : Manuscript.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Concerns of Africans with {{transgenic}} {{foods and}} {{genetically modified organisms}} seem to have minor repercussions in general on the use and the commercialisation of these products on African markets {{and particularly in the}} northern <b>sudano-sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> of Cameroun. In this line, different crops (cotton, and maize) and some commercialized branded food products were sampled on local farms, markets and chops. Evaluation of {{the presence or absence of}} GMO was performed using labelling system, completed by the laboratory analysis using PCR methods combined with the electrophoresis. Amongst all collected items, sampled cotton of varieties IRMA L 484, IRMA L 457 and maize varieties ATP SRY (CHC 202), ECKEBIL (CLH 103), PAN 4 P- 767 BR, PAN 5 Q- 433 B and PAN 6 Q- 445 B, were found to contain the foreign genetic material. Amongst processed commercialised brand products, 39 were found to contain genetically modified ingredients. Most were maize (glucose and syrup) and soya (lecithin) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{recent decades}} Sahelian soils {{have gone through}} various forms of degradation, the most {{dramatic}} being the extension of bare and crusted soils. Mulch, when placed on a crusted and bare soil, triggers termite activity within a few months. Termite activity enhances decomposition of the mulch and hence nutrient release in the soil. The change of soil characteristics due to termite activity was enough to create conditions necessary for natural vegetation development and crop production on previously degraded bare soils in the <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> of northern Burkina Faso. This Tropical Resource Management Paper (16) documents through its eight chapters the cause and effects of these processes.

40|$|In the <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> of West Africa {{there is}} {{potential}} for groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) to be grown as a dry-season crop where irrigation is available. However, there are substantial {{variations in the}} temperatures during the post-rainy season that {{can be expected to}} in¯uence growth and yield. An experiment at the ICRISAT Sahelian Centre was done in order to study the effect of sowing date on phenology, yield and the processes of yield determination for four groundnut cultivars under irrigation in the dry seasons of 199091 and 199192. Starting on 15 November, eight sowing dates at 2 -weekly intervals were tested. Sowing date signi®cantly affected phenology (time to emergence, ¯owering and maturity) with groundnut sown in NovemberDecember taking the longest time to reach these phenological stages. November and December sowings gave the highest pod yield within each year, despite the lowest crop growth rates (B), and yield declined progressively as sowing occurred later (50...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>Sudano-Sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> {{of western}} Africa, characterised by semi-extensive {{agriculture}} and subhumid climate, soil degradation and water shortages are widespread features. Soil {{and water conservation}} practices are introduced to the farmers, but often abandoned thereafter. Some interesting results have been obtained, on a hillside scale, {{in the southern part}} of the cropping basin of Senegal. As a supplement to the experimental design, two small watersheds (2. 5 ha) were delineated and equipped in representative hillside locations. In 1998, both the watersheds were planned and submitted to an hydrological survey. One of them, located on a colluvial/alluvial terrace, was also submitted to soil water storage and grain yield monitoring. Results highlight a decisive effect of soil and relief features on the efficiency of conservation measures. Relevant results were obtained on the terrace, but upstream areas still generated marked soil and water losses. These phenomena, in addition to socioeconomic constraints, partly explain farmers' behaviour noticed on the hillside scale. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Revamping the Groundnut Sector in the <b>Sudano-sahelian</b> <b>Zone</b> of North Cameroon. Prior to the {{introduction}} of cotton, groundnut was the main cash crop in North Cameroon. Groundnut is no longer exported due to its high local consumption and the strong competition of cotton, which became the main crop of farmers in plains with the current crisis of the cotton sector and the devaluation of the CFA francs, groundnut production is receiving more and more attention. The first step to revamp groundnut sector is to build up an efficient and everlasting groundnut seed production system. Unfortunately, in North Cameroon, there are no efficient structures where groundnut seeds can be multiplied and distributed. Under such conditions, farmer organisations, if backed by non governmental organizations (NGOs) and with technical support from the national agricultural research centres, could produce good quality and sufficient quantities of noncertified seeds {{to meet the needs of}} small-scale farmers in North Cameroon...|$|E
