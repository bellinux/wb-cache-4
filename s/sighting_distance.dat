40|$|Recent {{development}} {{and research in}} the United States have indicated the need for increased stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> and the consideration of decision <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> For sag vertical curves with overpasses, the current mathematical methodology considers only the case where the overpass is centered {{at the point of}} vertical intersection.

Stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> is an important parameter used in the design of a roadway's horizontal and vertical alignment. Many of the parameters used in the current stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> equation were developed in the 1950 s and may not accurately reflect the driver and vehicle population currently on the transportation network. An accident causation study was conducted to determine if roadways with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> present a safety hazard for the transportation network. Rural two-lane and multilane roadways with limited <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> crest vertical curves were identified in three states, and accident narratives for the most recent three to five years were obtained for the selected roadways. After analyzing the accident narratives, it was determined that only 18 of the 439 accident narratives evaluated had limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance,</b> during the daytime or nighttime, as a possible contributing factor. Ten of the 18 accidents with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor were caused by a vehicle striking another vehicle. There has been a concern that roadways with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> present a significant problem for the older driver as well as large trucks. The percentage of older drivers on the selected two-lane and multilane study sites with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> was similar to the percentage of older drivers in all accidents, reported by the National Safety Council. Only 30 of the accident narratives evaluated were large truck accidents. In addition, only one of the large trucks was involved in an accident with stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a possible contributing factor. Older drivers and large trucks {{did not appear to be}} overrepresented in accidents on roadways with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> All the accidents with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor occurred on vertical curves with a K value less than 125, which corresponds to 400 feet of stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> Most of the accidents with limited stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor occurred on vertical curves with a K value less than 100, which corresponds to 350 - 375 feet of stopping <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> Available <b>sight</b> <b>distances</b> less than 350 - 400 feet may present a safety problem...|$|R

30|$|The {{characteristics}} of the level crossing in terms of <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> {{made it easy for}} participants to see the train. Further research should be conducted in conditions where the train could be seen only when closer to the crossing (by reducing the <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> to the minimum distance required in the Australian standard). Further, this study induced a certain level of familiarity with driving through crossings with the technology, using two repetitive sessions. This can be confirmed by the reduction in stopping compliance, which suggests that drivers started to rely on the technology. However, the study was of a limited time, and effects on a longer term could not be estimated. The reduction of compliance at the crossing with the introduction of the technology as well as the feedback obtained from participants {{at the end of their}} trial suggest that with time drivers may start to largely rely on the technology if they perceive it reliable. This could potentially reduce the ability of drivers to detect approaching trains when the system fails. The decrement of compliance with the introduction of the technology should be carefully taken into consideration if such system was to be implemented at crossings. Reliability and integrity of the technology should be analysed and used to model risks involved with the implementation of such technology. In particular, overall effects on safety at each individual crossing should be evaluated in order to ensure that risk does not increase.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sight</b> <b>distance</b> {{refers to}} the length of {{unobstructed}} vision along a roadway, Providing longer unobstructed distances will increase safety and improve traffic operations, but it will also increase construction costs. Because of the importance of <b>sight</b> <b>distance,</b> every attempt must be made to use the most current data available and make accurate assumptions regarding design elements. This article concentrates on <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> of at-grade intersections. Intersections inherently introduce points of conflict between traffic movements, An accident at these points of conflict is influenced by driver behavior, traffic control, and geometric design. A transportation engineer has little control over driver behavior, but does have control over the choice of traffic control and geometric design. One element in the design of an intersection is <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> along a roadway. Adequate <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> will allow for various driver reactions and behaviors and will thus improve safety and traffic operations. It is not practical to provide unlimited <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> along roadways and at intersections because of the cost of obtaining rights-of-way and flattening grades. A balance must be struck between safety and construction costs. As a minimum, the <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> must be sufficient to allow the driver to perceive the intersection, identify approaching vehicles and gaps in the traffic stream, and safely execute any maneuver.

40|$|The third {{edition of}} the Australian Standard AS 1742 Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices Part 7 {{provides}} a method of calculating the <b>sighting</b> <b>distance</b> required to safely proceed at passive level crossings based on the physics of moving vehicles. This required distance becomes greater with higher line speeds and slower, heavier vehicles so that it may return quite a long <b>sighting</b> <b>distance.</b> However, at such distances, there are also concerns around whether drivers {{would be able to}} reliably identify a train in order to make an informed decision regarding whether it would be safe to proceed across the level crossing. In order to determine whether drivers are able to make reliable judgements to proceed in these circumstances, this study assessed the distance at which a train first becomes identifiable to a driver as well as their, ability to detect the movement of the train. A site was selected in Victoria, and 36 participants with good visual acuity observed 4 trains in the 100 - 140 km/h range. While most participants could detect the train from a very long distance (2. 2 km on average), they could only detect that the train was moving at much shorter distances (1. 3 km on average). Large variability was observed between participants, with 4 participants consistently detecting trains later than other participants. Participants tended to improve in their capacity to detect the presence of the train with practice, but a similar trend was not observed for detection of the movement of the train. Participants were consistently poor at accurately judging the approach speed of trains, with large underestimations at all investigated distances...|$|E
