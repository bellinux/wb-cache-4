5|$|The year 1916 marked {{four centuries}} since Palestine had {{become part of}} the Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire.

5|$|Decline {{in market}} demand {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the trade and the stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives.

5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> views kosher certification {{as an indication of}} wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted a large <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged {{the revival of}} Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|E

5|$|Industrial belts within Greater Dhaka {{is a major}} {{manufacturing}} hub, {{bounded by}} the Buriganga, Meghna, Dhaleshwari, Balu and Turag Rivers. The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy. The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers. Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ a large <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> – rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013. Dhaka has improved congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond {{by the introduction of}} a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|In 634 CE Gaza was {{besieged by}} the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As {{following}} the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It {{was captured by}} Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by 'Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, although its Byzantine garrison was massacred. The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century, a large <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> swiftly adopted Islam, Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i religious code, {{one of the four}} major Sunni Muslim schools of law (fiqh). Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Millions {{of people}} were persecuted in the violent struggles that ensued across the country, and {{suffered}} {{a wide range of}} abuses including public humiliation, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, hard labor, sustained harassment, seizure of property and sometimes execution.

By the 1840s, German settlers had overtaken the Mennonites as the dominant <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> Many Germans settled in the small hamlet to the southeast of Waterloo.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the connection between economic disaffection and support for far-right anti-immigration political parties in Western European countries. The article adjudicates empirically between two explanations for this connection. On the one hand, the "ethnic competition hypothesis ” contends that economically dissatisfied <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> tend to vote for far-right anti-immigration parties because these <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> {{have to compete with}} recent immigrants for scarce resources. On the other hand, theories of economic voting contend that economically dissatisfied <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> gravitate to far-right parties because of their “outsider ” or opposition status, rather than just because of their anti-immigration positions. The analysis exploits the cross-time and cross-national breadth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Social Survey. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis indicate that the “political outsider ” hypothesis outperforms the ethnic competition hypothesis as an explanation for the empirical connection between economi...|$|R
