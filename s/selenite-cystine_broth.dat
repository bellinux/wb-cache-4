40|$|Rapid {{detection}} of salmonellae in chicken meat was accomplished by using the magnetic immuno-polymerase chain reaction assay (MIPA). A direct polymerase chain reaction assay performed with chicken meat spiked with Salmonella typhimurium resulted in poor sensitivity (approximately 10 (7) CFU/g of meat). The use of immunoseparation with a Salmonella serogroup B-specific monoclonal antibody improved the sensitivity, but enrichment was required for the {{detection of}} low levels of contamination. Enrichment for 6 h in either buffered peptone water, lactose broth containing tergitol- 7, or <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth</b> resulted in the detection of an initial inoculum of 100 CFU per g of meat. Enrichment of the salmonellae present on 25 g of spiked chicken meat for 24 h in either buffered peptone water or <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth</b> before detection by the MIPA yielded a detection limit of approximately 0. 1 CFU/g of meat. A detection limit of approximately 1 CFU/g of meat was obtained when the spiked meat was stored at - 20 degrees C before enrichment for 24 h and analysis with the MIPA. Although the MIPA was developed for S. typhimurium, a MIPA in which a panel of six monoclonal antibodies specific for Salmonella serogroups A through E was used detected the presence of 0. 1 CFU of Salmonella enteritidis per g of chicken meat. These data indicate that the method is applicable to other commonly isolated serotypes...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} injured and uninjured salmonellae in foods and feeds. The steps of pre-enrichment in a nonselective broth and selective enrichment in a selective medium were combined into a single procedure. This was achieved by the gradual release of selective agents from wax-coated gelatin capsules added at the time of inoculation of nonselective basal broths. Pre-enrichment in lactose broth was combined with selective enrichment in tetrathionate or <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth</b> by using timed-release capsules containing iodine or selenite. Five different categories of foods and feeds, naturally contaminated with salmonellae, were examined to compare the efficiencies of the capsule methods with conventional procedures. Combination of the separate steps of pre-enrichment and selective enrichment into a single procedure was feasible and resulted in substantial savings of labor and materials...|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{meat and}} {{byproducts}} {{are the main}} protein source for man. However, such foods are related to outbreaks of food-borne infections around the world, caused mainly by Salmonella spp. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the presence of Salmonella spp. in material collected in properties of backyard chickens (eggs, ration, cloacal swab and drag swab) and to perform a survey {{of members of the}} Enterobacteriaceae family in eggs commercialized in the main free markets of Fortaleza. Individual cloacal swabs were collected from 405 backyard chickens from 18 houses and 10 eggs were also collected for analysis of eggshell and internal content from each sampled household, totaling 180 eggs. From the free markets, 90 eggs were collected. Once sampled, the ration, cloacal swab, drag swab, shell and internal contents of eggs were incubated in Peptone Water and aliquots were placed in Rappaport- Vassiliadis broth and <b>Selenite-Cystine</b> <b>broth</b> added Novobiocin. Following, aliquots of each broth were streaked in plates Brilliant Green agar and MacConkey agar. Suspect colonies for Salmonella spp. were submitted to biochemical identification, with the temperature and incubation time standardized in 37 ºC/ 24 h, respectively. Eggs collected from houses were broken in sterile beaker and maintained in bacteriological incubator at 37 ºc/ 24 h. After such period, aliquots collected were incubated in Rappaport- Vassiliadis broth and <b>Selenite-Cystine</b> <b>broth</b> added Novobiocin, following the same bacteriological procedure mentioned previously for swabs. Eggs from free markets were analyzed with the same methodology as the house eggs, minus the antibiotic Novobiocin in the Selenite-Cystin broth, and with further biochemical tests used to identify the different members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. No Salmonella spp. were isolated from swab or egg samples. However, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Klebsiella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp. were isolated from eggs of free markets. Accordingly to the methodology used, we may suggest that backyard chickens from Fortaleza present a satisfactory sanitary status. However, free market eggs did not present adequate sanitary conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different selective enrichment broths and DNA extraction techniques on the detection of Salmonella Typhimurium in swine feces by PCR. Feces samples (n= 10) were inoculated with approximately 102 Salmonella Typhimurium organisms, first enriched in GN-Hajna broth and secondly enriched in Rappaport-Vassiliadis, Muller-Kaufmann tetrathionate and <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broths.</b> In order to produce DNA-templates for PCR, aliquots from the broths were subjected to three DNA extraction methods: boiling-centrifugation, salting-out and phenol-chloroform. Detection of Salmonella was significant lower when phenol-chloroform was applied to selenite-cystine and Muller-Kaufmann tetrathionate (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The boiling-centrifugation technique had best cost/benefit ratio and can be successfully used as a rapid DNA template preparation from the three enriched broths tested...|$|R
40|$|To {{overcome}} {{problems associated}} with application of PCR to clinical samples, we have combined a short cultivation procedure with a Salmonella-specific PCR-hybridization assay to specifically identify Salmonella serovars from clinical samples of various animal species. The technique was investigated by using fecal samples seeded with known numbers of Salmonella organisms and cultivated for different lengths of time in assorted selective and nonselective enrichment media. The ability of PCR to amplify a Salmonella-specific DNA product (457 -bp sequence covering the Salmonella invE and invA genes) was examined in Southern hybridizations with an internal oligonucleotide probe. Forty-seven Salmonella isolates representing 32 serovars were evaluated, and all Salmonella isolates resulted in a 457 -bp product that hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe, whereas no hybridizations were evident with 53 non-Salmonella organisms. The assay detected as few as 9 CFU of Salmonella organisms in pure culture and as little as 300 fg of purified chromosomal DNA. Rappaport-Vassiliadis and tetrathionate broths were inhibitory to PCR, whereas brain heart infusion and <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broths</b> were not. The PCR-hybridization assay coupled with a brain heart infusion enrichment culture incubated for 2 h detected as few as 80 CFU of Salmonella organisms in seeded feces. We have successfully identified Salmonella serovars in clinical samples from swine, horses, and cattle more rapidly than with conventional culture techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay were both 100 % compared with culture results. These results indicate that a combined cultivation-PCR-hybridization assay could be applicable and advantageous in the rapid identification of Salmonella serovars in routine diagnostic situations...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{determining}} the presence of salmonella in food is described. It consists of pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water modified {{by the addition of}} dulcitol and trimethylamine oxide, followed by selective enrichment in a <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth</b> with similar modifications. Changes in the conductance of the selective enrichment broth are monitored continuously using a suitable impediometric instrument. Most of the Salmonella spp. tested gave a fast (approximately 100 microS/h) and large (greater than 600 microS) change in conductance, other enteric bacteria much less or no change. The assay is usually complete within 24 h. Samples of foodstuffs, naturally and artificially contaminated with Salmonella spp., were all correctly classified. Some strains of Citrobacter freundii produced a false positive conductance response, and they could not be selectively eliminated using antibiotics or cyanide. The conductance method is simple and easy to use, gives rapid results and involves less media and subculturing than is required for traditional methods...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of three protocols for bacteriological isolation of Salmonella enterica and detection by PCR in swine feces samples. Pool of feces (n= 62) were processed by three different methods. Method 1 : samples (10 g) were pre-enriched in BPW (1 : 10) and enriched in Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (1 : 100). Method 2 : samples (1 g) were first enriched in GN-Hajna broth (1 : 10) and secondly enriched in Muller-Kaufmann tetrathionate broth (1 `: 10). Method 3 : Single step enrichment of feces (1 g) in <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth</b> (1 : 10). PCR was performed using DNA extracted from the last enrichment broth of each bacteriological method. Salmonella enterica was cultured from 13 out of 62 samples (20. 9 %) and seven different serotypes were isolated. The methods 1, 2 and 3 resulted in 9 (14. 5 %), 6 (9. 6 %) and 2 (3. 2 %) positive samples, respectively. PCR was significantly superior than conventional bacteriology for Salmonella detection only when Rappaport-Vassiliadis was used for DNA-template preparation...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{of developing a}} quick, sensitive, and reliable test for Salmonella in nonfat dry milk (NDM) {{is evident from the}} recent tracing of Salmonella outbreaks to this product. Normally, coagulation of casein occurs when assaying NDM under regular cultural conditions, raising the possibility of trapped bacteria. After 20 hr of incubation of NDM in preenrichment lactose broth, enrichment was achieved by using <b>Selenite-Cystine</b> <b>Broth.</b> Smears from the enrichment broth were examined by the fluorescent-antibody technique (FAT) with a commercially available polyvalent O globulin conjugated with fluorescein. Standard cultural methods (SCM) were performed for comparison with FAT. Sensitivity of FAT was definitely improved by the use of trypsin. Casein coagulation of NDM can be avoided by addition of trypsin to samples during initial preenrichment in lactose broth. Samples containing approximately one Salmonella per 10 g were easily detected by FAT with the use of trypsin-treated samples. The method required only 42 hr to complete. Additionally, the use of trypsin enhanced recovery of Salmonella by use of SCM, as evidenced by alteration in the observed coliform to Salmonella ratios...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of slaughter pigs carrying Salmonella Typhimurium after a entericolitis outbreak in a commercial pig farm. A cross-sectional study was done during the slaughter of a batch of 86 animals. Mesenteric lymph nodes from 43 pigs were collected and pre-enriched in buffered peptone water (1 : 10) overnight at 37 ∞C Afterwards, aliquots of 1 mL and 0. 1 mL were transferred to <b>selenite-cystine</b> and Rappaport-Vassiliadis <b>broth,</b> respectively. A loopful of each sample was streaked onto XLT 4 and brilliant green agar plates, which were incubated at 37 ∞C for 24 hours. Salmonella was cultured in 23 out of 43 collected samples (53. 48 %). Salmonella Typhimurim (13 strains) and Salmonella enterica subs. enterica 1, 4, 5, 12 :i:- (10 strains) were isolated. These results indicated that the slaughter of pigs from batches previously affected by enteric salmonellosis may represent a high risk for pork contamination, since there is an positive association between infected pigs before slaughter and carcass contamination...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{compounds}} {{were screened}} in vitro in Trypticase soy broth for antimicrobial activity against a virulent strain of Salmonella enteritidis. Of the several compounds tested, polymyxin B showed the strongest inhibition in vitro, preventing growth at {{a concentration of}} {{less than or equal}} to 10 micrograms/ml. Polymyxin B administered in the drinking water was effective in vivo for preventing infections in 1 -day-old chickens but did not remove established infections in 1 -week-old chickens. It was found that trimethoprim, which was not active in vitro, prevented colonization and removed existing infections in 1 -day-old chickens when it was administered together with polymyxin B sulfate. Enrichment cultures in which <b>selenite-cystine</b> and tetrathionate <b>broth</b> media were used showed that chickens given a combination of 100 micrograms of polymyxin B sulfate per ml and 250 micrograms of trimethoprim per ml 24 h prior to oral inoculation with 10 (8) to 10 (9) CFU were negative for S. enteritidis after 7 days. Established infections (10 (5) to 10 (6) CFU/g of feces) in 1 -week-old chickens were eliminated by treatment with the polymyxin-trimethoprim system. This antimicrobial agent treatment may be useful for preventing colonization in poultry and for eliminating S. enteritidis from infected flocks...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To make a {{preliminary}} {{assessment of the}} incidence of Salmonella in Egyptian dairy products, and to investigate the effectiveness of various protocols {{for the detection of}} the pathogen in these products. Methods and Results: Samples of milk and related dairy products were randomly collected from local markets and examined for the presence of Salmonella. While most samples were free of the organism, isolates of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium PT 8 could be recovered from 'matared' cream specimens. These isolates were susceptible to antibiotics usually used to challenge infections caused by Salmonella. A combination of buffered peptone water, Muller-Kauffman tetrathionate broth, and brilliant green phenol red agar gave the best results for the detection of the pathogen. <b>Selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth</b> and Hektoen enteric agar were ineffective as an enrichment and a plating medium, respectively, in the isolation of Salmonella. A modified identification strategy that reduces the burden of serological testing of presumptive isolates is proposed. Conclusions, Significance and Impact of the Study: 'Matared' cream could be a vehicle for transmitting Salmonella. Using the above combination of media, beside the suggested modified confirmatory procedure, should increase the effectiveness and ease of the detection of Salmonella in milk and dairy products...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} cultivation and PCR-hybridization procedure {{for the detection}} and identification of Salmonella typhimurium was evaluated over a 42 -day period with eight experimentally infected beagles. Rectal swabs were taken at several times postinfection, inoculated into <b>selenite-cystine</b> <b>broth,</b> and plated onto Hektoen-Enteric Enteric agar immediately after incubation for 4 and 24 h. PCRs and hybridizations were also conducted with each sample, {{and the results were}} compared with those of standard culture techniques to evaluate the efficiency of the PCR-hybridization procedure. The PCR-hybridization procedure was more sensitive than standard culture techniques at each enrichment incubation (P < 0. 05). In addition, the PCR-hybridization procedure was significantly better than culture up through 3 days postinfection (P < 0. 05). A nonspecific amplified product, relatively close in size to the 457 -bp specifically amplified product, did not hybridize to an internal oligonucleotide probe or to a random-primed labeled probe. Subsequent sequence information revealed that the product had very little similarity to the 457 -bp product but had significant similarity to an Escherichia coli aldehyde dehydrogenase gene. This study indicated that a cultivation and PCR-hybridization procedure is significantly better than culture for the identification of S. typhimurium. Additionally, the results confirm the importance of determining specificities of PCR products beyond the gel electrophoresis level by hybridization with a specific probe...|$|E
