40|$|International audienceSharks {{are a major}} {{component}} of the top predator guild in oceanic ecosystems, but their trophic relationships remain poorly understood. We examined chemical tracers of diet and habitat (δ 15 N and δ 13 C, respectively) and total mercury (Hg) concentrations in muscle tissue of seven pelagic sharks: blue shark (Prionace glauca), <b>short-fin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> (Isurus oxyrinchus), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus), crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) and silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from the data poor south-western tropical Indian Ocean. Minimal interspecific variation in mean δ 15 N values and a large degree of isotopic niche overlap - driven by high intraspecific variation in δ 15 N values - was observed among pelagic sharks. Similarly, δ 13 C values of sharks overlapped considerably for all species with the exception of P. glauca, which had more 13 C-depleted values indicating possibly longer residence times in purely pelagic waters. Geographic variation in δ 13 C, δ 15 N and Hg were observed for P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. Mean Hg levels were similar among species with the exception of P. kamoharai which had significantly higher Hg concentrations likely related to mesopelagic feeding. Hg concentrations increased with body size in I. oxyrinchus, P. glauca and C. longimanus. Values of δ 15 N and δ 13 C varied with size only in P. glauca, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in diets or habitats. Together, isotopic data indicate that – with few exceptions - variance within species in trophic interactions or foraging habitats is greater than differentiation among pelagic sharks in the south-western Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is possible that this group exhibits some level of trophic redundancy, but further studies of diets and fine-scale habitat use are needed to fully test this hypothesis...|$|E

Shark take, driven by vast demand for meat and fins, is increasing. We set out to gain {{insights}} into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16, 610 sharks were observed caught, with 11, 166 identified to species level. Of these, 70. 6 % were blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 28. 4 % <b>short-fin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> (Isurus oxyrinchus), and 1 % were other species (including thresher (Alopias vulpinus), hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), porbeagle (Lamnus nasus), and other Carcharhinidae species (Carcharhinus brachyurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Galeorhinus galeus). Mean ± SD catch per unit effort of 33. 6 ± 10. 9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1. 9 ± 3. 1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83. 7 % of sharks caught (74. 7 % blue sharks; 93. 3 % <b>mako</b> <b>sharks)</b> were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods. We would like to thank the members of the fishing communities who participated in this study, in particular the fishers who were willing to have an observer onboard. We acknowledge Pro Delphinus staff: Bernedo, Cuentas, Lopez, and Mamani, for their help in data collection. We are thankful also to Pro Delphinus staff Natalia Ortiz and Nadia Balducci for support in data entry.

40|$|The shark genus Isurus is {{cosmopolitan}} {{and represented}} by two species: the shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus and the longfin mako lsurus paucus. Besides a few cetaceans (Visser et al., 2000) and man, the adult <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is not prey to any marine animal, but {{is considered an}} apex predator {{at the top of}} the marine environment food web. Shortfin and longfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> are often captured incidentally in various pelagic fisheries throughout the world and may be vulnerable to overfishing (Baum et al., 2003; ICCA T, 2004). Researchers have documented such declines and many shark populations in general at various geographical locations are believed to be at critical population levels or may have already collapsed (Baum et al., 2003; Baum and Myers, 2004; Baum and Myers, 2005) due to direct or indirect fishing activities (Martin, 2005). Sharks are long lived, slow growing, reach sexual maturity late in their life history, and produce few offspring; thus, overall population growth is slower and sharks have a lower growth rate than most teleosts (Musick, 1999). According to the JUCN World Conservation Union 2 ̆ 7 s Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species, the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> was assessed and listed under the category Lower Risk (Near Threatened (NT)) in 2002. Taxa under this category do not qualify for Conservation Dependent status, but are close to qualifying under the Vulnerable category. In 2005, the longfin make shark was assessed and listed in the Vulnerable category under the same Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species. More recently, the Committee on the Status of the Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) drafted an assessment and population status for the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> (COSEWIC, 2006). Based on the review, the committee decided to list the species as Threatened under the criteria A 2 b. According to the COSEWIC definitions, Threatened is defined as a species likely to become endangered if limiting factors are not reversed. Presently, little to no information is available for the longfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> and limited information is available for the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark.</b> Although COSEWIC (2006), ICCA T (2004), and IUCN (2002) have conducted status reviews on the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark,</b> this report provides the first and only complete comprehensive review that has used all available information on the shortfin and longfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark.</b> This comprehensive review was primarily based on published literature obtained by using the Nova Southeastern University library online database search system and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Pelagic Observer Program (POP) database. The shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is an apex predator that has some special evolutionary traits unlike any other shark species. There are only five species classified in the Lamnidae family (shortfin mako, longfin mako, porbeagle, salmon, and white shark). Review of molecular genetics studies revealed that only one species of the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> exist worldwide (Heist et al., 1996). Distinct from most <b>sharks,</b> the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> has the ability to regulate its internal body temperature and closely resembles the physiology of some tunas. Distribution information has revealed the shortfin and longfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> are highly migratory species found in every major ocean. Both species are captured in commercial fisheries (pelagic longlines and gillnets) worldwide and abundance trends show that the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> has declined over the last 30 years. The shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is captured in great numbers and ranks as one of the most dominant species caught in pelagic longlines and gillnets. The longfin mako, although also caught in similar fishing gears, is rare in catch composition data. Today, worldwide size composition data shows that male shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> are being caught at or below the size at maturity and below the female shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> size at maturity. Moreover, size composition information shows that commercial fisheries are exploiting virtually the species entire size range (60 - 340 em FL). Recent age and growth information studies indicate that the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is one of the slowest growing and longest lived extant shark species. Reproduction information suggests that the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> has one of the longest gestation periods and reproductive cycles within the elasmobranchs, More importantly, intrauterine cannibalism has recently been documented in the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark,</b> which has only been previously reported in the sand tiger shark Carcharius taurus. Unlike most shark species, the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is economically important for both its quality of meat and fins. Even though the species is physiologically unique, economically important, and exploited in significant relatively large numbers, this review has revealed that there are limited specific regulations and management plans currently in place, and recovery plans for the shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> are lacking. Based on the results of this review, it is highly recommended that further research in age specific population dynamics, fishery yield models, and specific domestic and international management measures be implemented for the conservation and sustainability of the longfin and shortfin <b>mako</b> <b>sharks...</b>|$|R
