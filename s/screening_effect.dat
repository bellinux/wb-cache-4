5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the <b>screening</b> <b>effect</b> of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
25|$|Only {{electrons}} in s orbitals demonstrate non-zero probability because their 3D spherical shape incorporates the volume {{taken up by}} the nucleus.

A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently (2013) ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture; this screening programme is, due to the <b>screening</b> <b>effect,</b> likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases.|$|E
40|$|The plasma <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> {{of dense}} quantum plasmas on H+ + H charge {{exchange}} and ionization cross sections are calculated by the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method. For charge exchange cross sections, {{it is found}} that the <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> reduce cross sections slightly in weak screening conditions. However, cross sections are reduced substantially in strong screening conditions. For ionization cross sections, with the increase of <b>screening</b> <b>effects,</b> cross sections for low energies increase more rapidly than those for high energies. When the <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> are strong enough, {{it is found that}} ionization cross sections decrease with the increase of incident H+ energy. In addition, the cross sections have been compared with those in weakly coupled plasmas. It is found that in weak screening conditions, plasma <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> in the two plasmas are approximately the same, while in strong <b>screening</b> conditions, <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> of dense quantum plasmas are stronger than those of weakly coupled plasmas.

30|$|The <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in a microfluidic system. It is mainly caused by the adsorption of ions at the liquid–solid interface [62]. The <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> remarkably reduces the effective surface charge density at the trap and driving electrodes. As a result, the effective field generated by the driving electrodes is reduced, thus the real average charge each micro-particle carries should be higher {{than what we have}} calculated. The curve of potential depth versus height in Fig.  1 c has taken the <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> on trap electrodes rather than the <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> on particles into consideration; the latter could weaken the trap’s constraint on charged particles.|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of He 2 + + H {{ionization}} {{in dense}} quantum plasmas (DQPs) {{has been studied}} by the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method. The interactions between charged particles have been described by the exponential cosine-screened Coulomb potential. It is found that ionization cross sections in plasma environments are obviously larger than those in plasma-free environments due to the <b>screening</b> <b>effects.</b> Cross sections for H+ also have been calculated for comparison. For H+, cross sections increase {{with the increase of}} <b>screening</b> <b>effects.</b> However, for He 2 +, cross sections begin to decrease in strong <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> at intermediate energies. Furthermore, He 2 + impact ionization cross sections in weakly coupled plasmas (WCPs) also have been calculated. The interactions have been described by the static screened Coulomb potential. It is found that when <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> are weak, cross sections in DQPs and WCPs are approximately the same. As <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> increase, cross sections in DQPs become larger than those in WCPs at high energies. However, when <b>screening</b> <b>effects</b> are strong enough, cross sections in DQPs become smaller than those in WCPs at low and intermediate energies. </span...|$|R
25|$|The World Health Organization {{stated that}} a 2013 thyroid {{ultrasound}} screening program was, {{due to the}} <b>screening</b> <b>effect,</b> {{likely to lead to}} an increase in recorded thyroid cases due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases. The overwhelming majority of thyroid growths are benign growths that will never cause symptoms, illness, or death, even if nothing is ever done about the growth. Autopsy studies on people who died from other causes show that more than one third of adults technically have a thyroid growth/cancer. As a precedent, in 1999 in South Korea, the introduction of advanced ultrasound thyroid examinations resulted in an explosion in the rate of benign thyroid cancers being detected and needless surgeries occurring. Despite this, the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the ongoing}} precautionary {{ultrasound}} screening program in and around Fukushima, (36%) of children in Fukushima Prefecture in 2012 {{were found to have}} thyroid nodules or cysts, but these are not considered abnormal. This screening programme is, due to the <b>screening</b> <b>effect,</b> likely, according to the WHO, to lead to an increase in the incidence of the diagnosis of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases. For example, the overwhelming majority of thyroid growths prior to the accident, and {{in other parts of the}} world, are overdiagnosed (that is, a benign growth that will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the growth) with autopsy studies, again done prior to the accident and in other parts of the world, on people who died from other causes showing that more than one third (33%+), of adults technically has a thyroid growth/cancer, but it is benign/never caused them any harm.|$|E
25|$|For example, the lithium atom has two {{electrons}} {{in the lowest}} 1s orbit, and these orbit at Z=2. Each one sees the nuclear charge of Z=3 minus the <b>screening</b> <b>effect</b> of the other, which crudely reduces the nuclear charge by 1 unit. This means that the innermost electrons orbit at approximately 1/4 the Bohr radius. The outermost electron in lithium orbits at roughly Z=1, since the two inner electrons reduce the nuclear charge by 2. This outer electron should be at nearly one Bohr radius from the nucleus. Because the electrons strongly repel each other, the effective charge description is very approximate; the effective charge Z doesn't usually come {{out to be an}} integer. But Moseley's law experimentally probes the innermost pair of electrons, and shows that they do see a nuclear charge of approximately Z−1, while the outermost electron in an atom or ion with only one electron in the outermost shell orbits a core with effective charge Z−k where k is the total number of {{electrons in}} the inner shells.|$|E

Moreover, we find that the <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> also highly depends on the length of nanowires on the field emission performance. The turn-on fields increase from 6.6 to 13.6 V μm− 1, and β values decrease from 1, 857 to 699 after the 10 -h growth. The <b>screen</b> <b>effect</b> is predominated after the length of nanowires increases, namely the longer growth time, thereby degrading the field emission performance. Consequently, the turn-on fields and β values change from 13.6 V μm− 1 and 699 to 6.6 V μm− 1 and 1, 857, respectively, as the growth time of Sn-doped ITO NWs decreases into 3 h.
