He set up an attack for Dirk Kuyt but the shot went <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Chelsea goalkeeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hill, the {{regiment}} suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He {{was replaced by}} Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within fifteen minutes of going over the top. But {{on either side of}} them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving {{the regiment}} and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated {{from the rest of the}} force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered to dig in and hold the position. They held on until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E
5|$|The referee {{added two}} minutes of injury time {{at the end of}} extra time, during which time Manchester United won another free kick, but Scholes' shot was <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Arsenal {{defensive}} wall. Then, with just seconds left in regulation time, Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half, only to be cynically body-checked by Reyes. Referee Styles made no hesitation and showed Reyes a second yellow card, making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, after Manchester United's Kevin Moran in 1985. The full-time whistle went immediately after Reyes' dismissal, and the match finished at 0–0, making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout.|$|E

50|$|Notice {{that certain}} hands (2 pair, 3 pair, full belly) will be natural-only hands, because wild cards can make better hands. (For example, two pair using {{a wild card}} is no longer two pair, but three of a kind.) This effect boosts the probabilities of some high-scoring hands, such as <b>straights,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of lower-scoring hands.|$|R

5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
5|$|The two {{combined}} battalions began {{digging in}} around Isurava. A headquarters {{had been set}} {{up at the top of}} the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group. Using a Bren gun he had taken from wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery and the rest of the group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that the undergrowth was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E

25|$|The {{exciting}} young Manchester United team {{put together}} by manager Tommy Docherty progressed in the First Division and reached the 1976 FA Cup Final, where they were strong favourites to beat Southampton, who were from the Second Division. But Manchester United's youthful side succumbed to nerves – Coppell included – and Southampton's more experienced professionals ran out 1–0 winners. Coppell had the first shot of the game, hitting a 25-yard drive <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Southampton goalkeeper {{in the first two}} minutes.|$|E

With four races remaining in the season Todd was fourth in the standings, a dismal 256 points behind leader Ted Musgrave. With Bodine's three wins, {{he was able to}} gain one spot to third and an entire 183 points on Musgrave to finish only 73 points behind.|$|E

The Hawks won eight games <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the season and, despite faltering late in the home-and-away season, had a close win in a semi-final against Port Adelaide and made it to the preliminary finals in when they narrowly lost to Essendon. In the off-season, Hawthorn traded Trent Croad and Luke McPharlin for the Number 1 draft pick, Luke Hodge, No. 20 (Daniel Elstone) and No. 36 (Sam Mitchell). Croad would, ironically, return to Hawthorn two years later.|$|E

50|$|Compared to the Eurasian curlew, the {{slender-billed}} curlew is whiter on the breast, tail, and underwing, {{and the bill}} is shorter, more slender, and slightly <b>straighter</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base.

The head pattern, with a dark cap and whitish supercilium, recalls that of the whimbrel, but that species also has a central crown stripe and a more clearly marked pattern overall; the pattern of the {{slender-billed curlew}} would be hard to make out in the field.|$|R

25|$|On 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an {{assassination}} attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi. The emperor was taking a stroll {{with one of his}} officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell of Tír Chonaill, on a city bastion, when Libényi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre.|$|E
25|$|A player {{could also}} try to get around a defender by stepping, swerving, or goose-stepping past them. To sidestep a defender, the attacking player takes a wide step in one {{direction}} while running forward and then shifts their body weight in the opposite direction. If successful the defender will be off balance, allowing the attacker to accelerate past. When swerving, an attacker runs <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> defender, but before making contact accelerates and sways to the outside. Although similar to a side step, the swerve involves less sideways movement, but results in less loss of speed. The goose-step is a move made famous by David Campese and involves slowing down while running {{on the outside of}} the opponent, causing them to also slow, before accelerating away.|$|E
25|$|Forwards tend to run {{straight}} and {{hard at the}} opposition, while the backs run at gaps between players or use speed and guile to run around them. In modern games of rugby some backs can {{be as big as}} forwards and attempt to break through the defensive line using brute force and many forwards possess the running skills of backs. Players run <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> opposition with the aim of either breaking the tackle or getting forward momentum from which to set up another attack. If they are close to the try line they can drive in low to aid grounding the ball. Players can also try to break through tackles by spinning after making contact or by using the hand not carrying the ball to fend (push) off the defender.|$|E
