5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
25|$|In general, Filipino {{women find}} {{pride in their}} work. They do not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives them a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life. In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E
25|$|There is {{sometimes}} corruption and theft {{by the employees}} of a shelter, as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food {{over a period of}} time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering. The homeless are often obliged to adopt various strategies of self-presentation in order to maintain a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> which constrains their interaction with passers-by and leads to suspicion and stigmatization by the mainstream public.|$|E

25|$|The {{presidency}} {{began to}} be transformed in the 1990s. Hillery's conduct regarding the dissolution affair in 1982 came to light in 1990, imbuing the office with a new <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and stability. However, it was Hillery's successor, seventh President Mary Robinson, who ultimately revolutionized the presidency. The winner of an upset victory in the highly controversial election of 1990, Robinson was the Labour nominee, the first President to defeat Fianna Fáil in an election and the first female President. Upon election, however, Robinson took steps to de-politicize the office. She also sought to widen {{the scope of the}} presidency, developing new economic, political and cultural links between the state and other countries and cultures, especially those of the Irish diaspora. Robinson used the prestige of the office to activist ends, placing emphasis during her presidency on the needs of developing countries, linking the history of the Great Irish Famine to today's nutrition, poverty and policy issues, attempting to create a bridge of partnership between developed and developing countries.|$|E

500|$|Morales' {{government}} {{has been seen as}} part of the pink tide of left-leaning Latin American governments, becoming particularly associated with the hard left current of Venezuela and Cuba. It has been widely praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left, who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a [...] "political laboratory" [...] or [...] "a living workshop" [...] for the development of an alternative to capitalism. Domestically, Morales' support base has been among Bolivia's poor and indigenous communities. For these communities, who have widely felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales [...] "invokes a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and destiny" [...] in a way that no other contemporary politician has done. He has received the support of many democratic socialists and social democrats, as well as sectors of Bolivia's liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favoured him over the right-wing opposition.|$|E

2500|$|Beauford Delaney {{was born}} December 30, 1901 in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States of America. Delaney's parents were {{prominent}} and respected members of Knoxville's black community. His father Samuel {{was both a}} barber and a Methodist minister. His mother Delia was also prominent in the church, and earned a living taking in laundry and cleaning the houses of prosperous local whites. Delia, born into slavery and never able {{to read and write}} herself, transferred a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and self-esteem to her children, and preached to them about the injustices of racism and the value of education. Beauford was the eighth of ten children, only four of whom survived into adulthood. He summed up the reasons for this in a journal entry from 1961, saying [...] "so much sickness came from improper places to live – long distances to walk to schools improperly heated… too much work at home – natural conditions common to the poor that take the bright flowers like terrible cold in nature…" ...|$|E
2500|$|The State Bar of Arizona {{appealed to}} {{a desire to}} {{maintain}} a certain air of [...] "professionalism" [...] among lawyers as justifying its ban on lawyer advertising. [...] Advertising, the State Bar asserted, would [...] "undermine the attorney's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and self-worth", [...] "erode the client's trust in the attorney" [...] by exposing an economic motive for representation, and [...] "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession". But the public understands that attorneys make their living at the bar, and few attorneys deceive themselves by thinking otherwise. [...] "Bankers and engineers advertise, and yet these professions are not regarded as undignified. [...] In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the failure of lawyers to advertise creates public disillusionment with the profession." [...] A lack of information about the price of legal services tends to dissuade people of modest means from seeking legal representation, even when it is in their best interest to engage such representation. [...] Finally, insofar as the [...] "belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism, the historical foundation for the advertising restraint has crumbled." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{right not}} to be {{subjected}} to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is invariably associated with ‘human dignity’. The idea <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> plays some role in this right’s interpretation, although the content of the idea in this context, as in others, is unclear. Making <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dignity</b> idea involves a number of challenges. These challenges give rise to the methodological-type question {{at the heart of this}} article: how should human rights lawyers go about articulating the content of ‘dignity’? The article proposes, and models, a methodological approach in response. Its core argument is that human rights law needs the vocabulary provided by theorizations <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> but that these theorizations should be anchored in authoritative human rights jurisprudence. It argues that this approach can help make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dignity</b> idea in a way that facilitates a richer understanding of its influence on interpretation...|$|R
