5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
500|$|Al-Mushīr {{frequently}} {{appeared on}} {{local and regional}} media. In one interview he called protesters [...] "traitors". In another, he echoed Muammar Gaddafi by accusing protesters of using drugs. [...] " [...] given pills which affected their minds and made them do unusual things," [...] Al-Mushīr said. He also had a warning for protesters: [...] "I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who {{did not get the}} message, 'If you return we will come back, stronger this time'." [...] He said that the Bahraini uprising was [...] "by all measures a conspiracy involving Iran {{with the support of the}} United States". He also said that the uprising which he called a [...] "coup plot" [...] was supported by more than a dozed of U.S.- and an unnamed Gulf country-funded NGOs.|$|E
500|$|During {{the lead}} up to the War of 1812, Wodrow chaired an anti-war meeting in Hampshire County at which those {{assembled}} objected to a heedless rush to war with the British, which was in line with contemporary Federalist principles. According to historian Stuart L. Butler, Wodrow and the meeting's attendees felt that: to involve [...] in an expensive and uncertain war, for purposes not absolutely necessary, and entail taxes and misery on ourselves and our posterity, when we might enjoy the blessings of peace and plenty and a good price for our produce on terms as honorable at least as those for {{the last fifteen years}} past, would appear to them the extreme of folly, little short of madness. Wodrow and the committee believed that within two years of the war's beginning, it would become unpopular because of the need for increased taxation and prolonged military service. Wodrow and the committee stated, [...] "the nation would rise in its constitutional strength, and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who brought about such an unpropitious state of things, 'depart from ye wicked.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia {{was asked}} by a {{reporter}} whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, [...] "You know what I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> people?" [...] and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with {{a letter to the}} editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning [...] "I've had enough, go away" [...] and noted, [...] "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.|$|E
2500|$|Pope John Paul II was {{the first}} pontiff to {{actively}} fight against Mafia violence in Southern Italy. In 1993, during a pilgrimage to Agrigento, Sicily, he appealed to the Mafiosi: [...] "I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> responsible: 'Convert! One day, the judgment of God will arrive!'" [...] In 1994, John Paul II visited Catania and told victims of Mafia violence to [...] "rise up and cloak yourself in light and justice!" [...] In 1995, the Mafia bombed two historical churches in Rome. Some believed {{that this was the}} mob's vendetta against the pope for his denounciations of organised crime.|$|E
2500|$|The manor layout is {{designed}} to emphasize {{the lord of the}} manor's role as a Chancellor, as the King's representative and thus as God's deputy in the country and on the estate. The parable of the bridesmaids in Matthew's Gospel, ends with a speech: [...] "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand: 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father'." [...] and [...] "Then shall he <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> on the left hand, 'Depart from me, ye cursed…'" [...] Similarly the location of the caryatid-like figures from the Old Testament also emphasizes who the lord of the manor sees as his peers: the lawmaker, the military leader and the prophet are at his level at to his right.|$|E
2500|$|At 9 o'clock {{the king}} {{received}} a phone call from the president of the Council, advising him to find refuge in Mafra or Sintra, since the rebels were threatening to bomb the Palace of Necessidades. D.Manuel II refused <b>to</b> leave, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> present: [...] "Go if you want, I'm staying. Since the constitution doesn't appoint me any role other than of letting myself be killed, I will abide by it." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2007 the Magis Theatre Company of New York City {{presented}} their adaptation in an off-Broadway run at Theatre 315 in the Theatre District with music by award-winning composer Elizabeth Swados and puppets by Ralph Lee. [...] Lauded by the New York Times for its imagination, theatrical skill and daring, theatre critic Neil Genzlinger called the production thought provoking [...] "with plenty to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> interested {{in matters of}} the spirit." [...] In the following years Magis {{worked closely with the}} C.S. Lewis estate to make its adaptation available to over a dozen theatre companies from Canada to Ecuador. The Taproot Theatre of Seattle chose the Magis adaptation to open its new Theater Space in 2010 and extended the run due to popular demand. [...] The Pacific Theatre Company presented the Magis adaptation in its 2010–2011 season.|$|E
2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).|$|E

5000|$|Garcia {{fell ill}} in 1939 {{during a visit}} to Zaragoza which saw him {{transferred}} to Madrid for treatment. He died in 1940 in a clinic and was buried in the Cathedral of Palencia, where he requested to be buried so that he could be close to the tabernacle. His wish was: [...] "I ask to be buried next to a tabernacle, so that my bones, after death, as my tongue and my pen in life, are <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who pass: there is Jesus! There it is! Do not leave him abandoned!" ...|$|R

6000|$|This, then, Isaiah knew--that {{the heart}} of the Holy Lord pitied and yearned after those poor sinful Jews, as a husband's after a foolish and sinful wife. And how much more should we believe the same, how much more should we believe that His heart pities and yearns for all foolish and sinful people here in England now!

Surely, surely, if Isaiah had a right to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> Jews, [...] "Seek the Lord while He may be found," [...] I have a thousand times as much right to say it to you.
