50|$|It is {{possible}} though difficult to retrofit a catalytic converter to older stoves models, and retrofits rarely perform well. However, a drawback with catalytic converters is that (as when fitted to automobiles) {{they have a}} limited life before needing to be replaced, although new catalysts often last 5 - 10 years. More modern wood stoves are designed from the outset with an integral secondary combustion chamber. This mixes exhaust gases (smoke and particulates) with preheated fresh air and thus re-burns otherwise wasted fuel. The end result is similar, with much reduced emissions and increased fuel efficiency; stoves utilizing this design are often marketed as clean-burning stoves and exempted from <b>smoke</b> control <b>regulations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are a large}} group of widespread organic contaminants which possess different safety hazards. Some of these compounds are considered as very probable human carcinogens and mutagens. Due to this fact, they were included among the most monitored pollutants in the environment. New analytical procedure worked up on the basis of performed experiments, having consisted in testing of several isolation, purification and identification systems, was applied to the target laboratory samples. As a first step, ultrasonic extraction of a homogenised sample with chloroform for isolation of analytes from sample matrix was used. Gel permeation chromatography on Bio Beads S-X 3 utilising chloroform as mobile phase was applied to remove most co-extracts (lipids, pigments, etc.) of PAH group. High-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection was employed for identification and quantitation of the analytes. PAHs were separated on silica-bound polymeric octadecylsilyl ligand layer using gradient elution with a mixture of polar solvents. Reliability of a determination arose when confirmation analysis with a method of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection was performed. Appreciable attention was given to an evaluation of the effect of food technology and cooking procedures on PAH concentrations changes in processed foods. The observations were focused on the most important risk procedures - smoking, grilling and frying. The found data indicated higher contamination risk (i. e. levels above hygienic limits) for products smoked by means of equipment with limited <b>smoke</b> <b>regulation,</b> food barbecued in flames, meat grilled with the risk of fat pyrolysis and food fried under extreme conditions (overburnt and rarely changed frying oils).

30|$|I {{believe that}} the current {{ecological}} nightmare that we are mired in is due to people problems rather than to technological holdups. In my experience, the reluctance of managers to use fire typically involves {{one of the following}} personnel or management problems: marginal competence, self-serving agenda, complacency or satisfaction with the status quo, no cookbook to follow, other priorities with a lower risk factor (also known as higher personal comfort factor), a supervisor who hinders rather than facilitates fire use, or just not understanding and appreciating that fire is the “Ecological Imperative,” a term coined by Frank Cole (a legendary positive force behind the scenes {{as well as in the}} trenches). In addition, the inability to get a permit, fear of litigation in the instance of an escape, and <b>smoke</b> management <b>regulations</b> play a part in their reluctance.|$|R

40|$|Historical smoke {{concentrations}} at monthly resolution for {{the early}} twentieth century are found for Kew Observatory, London, using the atmospheric electricity proxy technique. Smoke particles modify the electrical properties of urban air: an increase in smoke concentration reduces air's electrical conductivity and increases the Potential Gradient (PG). Calibrated PG data are available from Kew since 1898, and air conductivity was measured routinely between 1909 and 1979 using the technique developed by C. T. R. Wilson. Automated smoke observations at the same site overlap with the atmospheric electrical measurements from 1921, providing an absolute calibration to smoke concentration. This shows that the late nineteenth century winter smoke concentrations at Kew were approximately 100 times greater than contemporary winter smoke concentrations. Following <b>smoke</b> emission <b>regulations</b> reducing the <b>smoke</b> concentration, the electrical parameters of the urban air did not change dramatically. This is suggested to be due to a composition change, with an increase in the abundance of small aerosol compensating for the decrease in smoke. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Smoke-free area {{regulation}} has been issued recently in Bali Province and Badung District. This study aimed to identify factors associated to the compliance of local smoke-free regulation in star hotel. Methods : This {{study was a}} cross-sectional analytic study conducted in Badung District from March to May 2014. Samples of numbered 104 hotels and the managers that selected using systematic random sampling. Compliance data collected through observation using the observation form and the data of managers through interviews using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using chi-square test and poisson regression. Result : The results shows that the compliance of star hotel to local smoke-free regulation was low (15. 4 %). The concrete support of hotel managers {{was significantly associated with}} the compliance to <b>smoke</b> free <b>regulation</b> (PR= 4. 25; 95 %CI: 1. 03 - 17. 58). The factors that not significantly associated to the compliance were the knowledge (PR= 2. 0; 95 %CI: 0. 8 - 4. 9), attitude (PR= 2. 5; 95 %CI: 0. 8 - 8. 2), and organization support (PR= 1. 8; 95 %CI: 0. 7 - 4. 5).

40|$|Smoke alarms provide {{early warning}} {{of a fire}} in the home, {{potentially}} saving residents’ lives. It can take just minutes for a fire to reach flashpoint in a modern home. Residents that take longer or require assistance to respond in a fire, including older people, children, and people with disabilities, are at greatest risk. It is essential to have smoke alarms rapidly detect fire smoke, and awaken and alert residents, so they can escape safely. <b>Smoke</b> alarm <b>regulations</b> have led to increased uptake of smoke alarms in Australian homes, but fire authorities and researchers recommend that more be done. Residents in new dwellings are safeguarded by regulations for hard-wired and interconnected smoke alarms. However, the majority of residents living in older dwellings have less regulatory protection; most states and territories require a minimum of just one battery-powered smoke alarm, and some have no requirement for smoke alarms. Even when smoke alarms are installed in dwellings, many are not operational due to lack of maintenance and disconnection to avoid nuisance alarms. This second edition of Summary Bulletin: Fire Safety – Smoke Alarms responds to recent Australian regulatory changes for smoke alarms in dwellings, advances in smoke alarm devices, and current smoke alarm recommendations of fire authorities and researchers. It examines the function and use of contemporary smoke alarm devices and details the applicable national and state/territory regulations for different dwelling types. Recommendations are made for smoke alarm selection, placement and maintenance, to detect fire smoke whilst avoiding nuisance alarms; alert residents of all ages and abilities when fire smoke is detected; and ensure reliable smoke alarm functioning in a fire...|$|R

A cross sectional survey, involving 175 smokers attending smoking cessation clinics at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, United Kingdom and University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between May 2005 and February 2007. Data on demographics, smoking history, nicotine dependence and smoking behaviour were collected. Results. All participants were males, mean age 30. 7 ± 10. 3 years. Caucasians initiated smoking significantly ear- lier (mean age 14. 8 ± 2. 8 years) (p = 0. 001) and smoked regularly significantly earlier (mean age 17. 3 ± 3. 5) (p = 0. 003) than Malays (mean starting age 16. 9 ± 4. 4 years and mean age regular use 19. 5 ± 4. 5 years), re- spectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In utero {{environmental}} {{tobacco smoke}} (ETS) exposure exacerbates initial lung responses of adult mice to ovalbumin (OVA), a common allergen in rodent models of allergic asthma. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that in utero ETS exposure alters expression of genes (including asthma-related and inflammatory genes) in the lungs of adult mice and that this differential expression is reflected in differential respiratory and immune responses to nontobacco allergens. METHODS: Using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2. 0 arrays, we examined gene expression changes in lungs of BALB/c mice exposed to ETS in utero, OVA, or saline aerosol at weeks 7 – 8, and OVA sensitization and challenge at weeks 11 – 15. Data sets were filtered by transcript p-value (≤ 0. 05), false discovery rate (≤ 0. 05), and fold change (≥ 1. 5). Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Genes differentially expressed {{as a result of}} in utero ETS exposure are involved in regulation of biological processes (immune response, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell metabolism) through altered cytoskeleton, adhesion, transcription, and enzyme molecules. A number of genes prominent in lung inflammation were differentially expressed on PCR but did not pass selection criteria for microarray, including arginase (Arg 1), chitinases (Chia, Chi 3 l 3, Chi 3 l 4), eotaxins (Ccl 11, Ccl 24), small proline-rich protein 2 a (Sprr 2 a), and cytokines (Il 4, Il 6, Il 10, Il 13, Tnfa). CONCLUSION: The differential lung gene expression reported here is consistent with previously reported functional changes in lungs of mice exposed in utero to ETS and as adults to the nontobacco allergen OVA.

40|$|Difficult pupils are {{a source}} of major concern. In 1980 a study was {{undertaken}} in fourteen Christchurch state secondary schools to examine the nature, incidence, correlates, etiology and treatment of 'difficult' behaviour. Classroom teachers, senior staff, and 'difficult' as well as well-behaved pupils contributed their perceptions of the problem. The main research methods were rating scales and structured interviews. Teachers nominated 210 pupils (116 boys and 94 girls) (2. 6 % of the combined secondary school rolls) as so difficult that they needed help to cope with them. Lower socio-economic levels, Non-Europeans, children from larger families or solo parent homes and children of lower scholastic aptitude were over-represented. Persistent defiance and behaviours which interfered with learning were the teachers' main concerns. Sex, race, scholastic aptitude, and type of school proved to be significant classificatory variables. Males, Non-Europeans, those of low scholastic aptitude and those from co-educational schools tended to engage more frequently in the more blatantly anti-social misbehaviours. Sex interacted with race, with Non-European females tending to <b>smoke,</b> flout uniform <b>regulations</b> and use obscene language more frequently than other groups. While senior teachers saw family factors as important they also acknowledged the contribution of the school curriculum and organization. The most favoured solution was improved staffing ratios to allow greater flexibility in providing for difficult pupils within the school. Difficult pupils were rated significantly lower in social development and self-esteem than controls. However there was considerable overlap in the pupils' self-descriptions, reported perceptions of the opinion held of them by significant others, definition of problem behaviour and suggested solutions. In spite of this more of the difficult pupils regarded themselves, and saw those in authority regarding them, negatively. Their misbehaviours constituted challenges to authority rather than being schoolwork-related. Both groups saw the responsibility for control lying primarily with teachers. A third of the difficult pupils expressed a desire to change their attitudes and behaviour at school and to achieve better family communication...|$|R
