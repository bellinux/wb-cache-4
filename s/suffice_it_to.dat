Many reviewers said the mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park, then still a relatively new show.

As the network dedicated to bringing viewers the best stories on television, we are so pleased {{to have the opportunity}} with The Walking Dead to raise the bar within this popular genre and continue our commitment to being the home of premium television on basic cable." [...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels. It is legitimately great storytelling that is not only highly entertaining, but incredibly thought provoking as well. People who are familiar with the comic books know what's coming, but <b>suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> say, this is only the beginning of a long, intense, and powerful ride.

Speaking {{of the first two}} episodes, Mark Hughes of Forbes added additional praise, saying, [...] "Quite simply, in Daredevil Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with Batman Begins, Iron Man, and [...]" [...] Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they [...] "would’ve been hailed as one of Marvel’s best films to date." [...] Mike Hale at the New York Times was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace [...] "leisurely", but [...] "a pleasant change from the norm", and called Cox's performance [...] "divided", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, Daredevil is [...] "eminently watchable", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.|$|E
