50|$|In 2012, Moelis and {{his company}} {{purchased}} Ocean Village, an 1100-unit Mitchell Lama complex in Far Rockaway, Queens, just days after Hurricane Sandy flooded the complex with more than five feet of seawater. Originally built in 1972, the complex suffered from decades of neglect under the prior owners and over 30% of the units were vacant {{at the time of}} purchase. L+M executed a $60 million rehabilitation covering all apartment interiors, common areas, roof replacement, mechanical and electrical equipment upgrades, landscaping and various <b>storm-proofing</b> and resiliency measures. In addition, the existing concrete facade was clad with an exterior insulation and finishing system to insulate the buildings, protect the buildings from water infiltration, and update the property’s aesthetic. Throughout the rehabilitation, L+M worked to ensure that Arverne View (renamed by the residents) remained a viable source of affordable housing for the long term.|$|R

40|$|This case {{describes}} the start-up of SENZ Umbrellas, a Dutch venture founded by three graduates of Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands) who aimed to introduce an asymmetrical, <b>storm-proof</b> umbrella onto a mass-market where product innovation was limited. It demonstrates the marketing challenges start-ups face in bringing an innovative consumer product to market. In particular, the case focuses {{on how to}} promote a new consumer product and create brand awareness when resources are limited. This case can be used both in entrepreneurship courses to illustrate marketing issues common to the ‘start-up’ stage, and in strategic marketing programmes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a fourth}} of the cotton {{produced}} in the US since 2002 has been produced in Texas, with most coming from the High Plains. In recent years, Texas has accounted for {{almost half of all}} US cotton production (USDA-NASS, 2008 b). Most cotton on the High Plains is of more <b>storm-proof</b> varieties that have traditionally been harvested using stripper harvesters. However, improvements in irrigation technology and shifting markets for US cotton have increased interest in picker harvesters in the region. A holistic comparison of picker and stripper harvesters in irrigated cotton on the High Plains of Texas was conducted focusing on differences in system efficiencies, the costs of ginning, fiber and yarn quality, and potential economic returns under comparable crop yields and conditions. Harvester performance was evaluated based on harvest efficiency, time-inmotion, and fuel consumption. Stripper harvesters left less cotton in the field, but most of the cotton left by the picker was of low quality. While the time spent in each operation of harvest was highly dependent on the operator and support equipment available, in general, picker harvesters were able to harvest a unit area of high-yielding cotton more quickly than stripper harvesters. The cost of ginning picked and stripped cotton was evaluated considering current fee schedules from gins on the High Plains. On average, it cost a producer $ 4. 76 more per bale to gin stripped-and-field-cleaned cotton than picked cotton. Fiber quality parameters were compared between harvest treatments based on results from High Volume Instrument (HVI) and Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) tests. Samples were ring-spun into carded and carded-and-combed yarns. Differences in fiber quality between harvest treatments were more pronounced when growing conditions were less favorable. Few differences were detected in carded yarn quality between harvest treatments, while more pronounced differences favoring picked cotton were seen in carded-and-combed yarns. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine the production scenarios in which picker and stripper harvesters were most appropriate. Results indicate that, if a producer has sufficient yields coupled with sufficient area to harvest per machine, picker harvesting is a more profitable alternative to producers of on the High Plains...|$|E
