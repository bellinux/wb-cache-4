5|$|Marge and Lisa {{discover}} Bart's {{deception and}} inform the passengers {{that the virus}} is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how much fun his life has been.|$|E
25|$|Reggie Lass (Britt McKillip): George's younger sister. Though George {{ignored her}} while she was alive, Reggie is very much {{affected}} {{by the death of}} her sister. She believes that George's ghost still roams about the city and visits their home from time to time– technically, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Due to her eccentric, seemingly pathological way of grieving her sister's death, Reggie is placed in psychiatric therapy.|$|E
25|$|When Bobby pushes Jane {{down the}} stairs during a scuffle, Jane lies to Kathy that she tripped, but Bobby tells Kathy the truth. Kathy confesses her fears to Jane that Bobby may have anger {{management}} problems, and after Bobby later smashes a plate in anger, Jane tells Kathy that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Bobby's feud with Sharon's son Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) escalates when Bobby kills Dennis's pet spider. Sharon tells Kathy he is evil and needs help, and Kathy then tells Sharon that Bobby pushed Jane {{down the stairs}}, so Sharon tells the Beales she {{will go to the}} police about Lucy's killing. Bobby finds out the truth from Dennis, who is later severely injured in a car crash. When the family discover that Phil has been rushed to hospital with a damaged liver, Sharon, Kathy and Phil's former girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) go to the hospital only to find out that Phil discharged himself.

6000|$|... "I suppose <b>she</b> <b>'s</b> right," [...] he thought--"I suppose <b>she</b> <b>'s</b> <b>right.</b> I {{ought not}} to have tried to speak to her!" [...] As a matter of fact, he did not at all feel that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} perfectly rigid, {{standing as}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{for a long}} time. Then she staggered to the couch and lay down, and went heavily to sleep. When she awoke, she remembered what she had done, {{but it seemed to}} her, she had only hit him, as any woman might do, because he tortured her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> perfectly <b>right.</b> <b>She</b> knew that, spiritually, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> In her own infallible purity, she had done what must <b>be</b> done. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pure. A drugged, almost sinister religious expression became permanent on her face.|$|R
60|$|Again Mrs. Pendyce {{shook her}} head, knowing by {{instinct}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The film's opening {{scenes are}} not great filmmaking. They're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation, murky and heavy on theory. [...] My {{guess is that}} much of the fascination with this film is {{inspired}} by the unveiling of facts, unclearly seen. There isn't a whole lot of plot– basically, just that Maya thinks <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> and she is.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was named}} in 1984 the paper's news editor, and was {{reported}} to have fainted on her first day. She started her own opinion column in 1987. As a writer for The Guardian in 1982 she defended the Labour Party {{at the time of the}} split with the Social Democratic Party. While working for The Guardian, Phillips wrote a play called Traitors, which was performed at the Drill Hall from January 1986. The play was set at the time of the 1982 Lebanon War and centred around the moral dilemmas of a Jewish journalist who as political editor of a liberal magazine has to decide whether to veto an article written in anti-semitic tones, and also whether <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to publish a leaked document about the Falklands War. The play was reviewed by John Peter in The Sunday Times as [...] "a play of blistering intelligence and fearless moral questioning", although he considered it bordering on implausible.|$|E
60|$|I {{never thought}} of her mother. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Even if she were wrong, I must obey her.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Clinch, {{struck with}} the idea, stopped to consider. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> It {{certainly}} WAS himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> The man Edgar {{tried to}} silence had turned upon him, savage and rather breathless.|$|R
60|$|CATHERINE (also rising). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> Sergius. If {{such women}} exist, {{we should be}} spared the {{knowledge}} of them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing less so,' {{said the}} Doctor. 'One {{would think it}} was a naiad that had had an offer from the {{mountains}} next, for she has been shedding a perfect river of tears ever since; and all that the united discernment of the family has yet gathered is, that she cries rather more when we tell her <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to say No than when we tell her <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to say Yes.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE YEWS: (Mingling their boughs) Listen. Whisper. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> and I {{had nothing}} more to say except to wish her success in her efforts.|$|R
60|$|And mostly <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Only her rightness was so demanding, so restless, that it left Mr. Wrenn gasping.|$|R
60|$|For {{nearly a}} minute I did not speak, but I knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> {{and at last}} I {{admitted}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so, I suppose so. Well, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> As {{the world}} goes in Prague, my child, you will degrade {{yourself}} by marrying a Jew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'If you can't {{get your}} friend on quiet, ladies,' said the policeman, 'I {{shall have to}} take 'er up. Drunk and disorderly <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> enough.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Felix, 'Mettie {{shall not}} be teased: <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> in the main.' But his tone was that he always used when her {{prudence}} {{was too much for}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> In {{the present}} temper {{of the popular}} mind, the absence of Ambrose was a {{suspicious}} circumstance in itself.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> A {{few minutes}} sufficed {{to put the}} loose shingle to rights, and then Ian descended to the room below.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have brought}} Venetia her toys,' said Captain Cadurcis, 'and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to defend me, as I {{have been working}} for her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She did {{not want}} to let me come out," [...] said Nina. [...] "She is angry. She says the man just gone is some Rajah. I think <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You would try,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, kindly; 'but I think <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Indeed, Louis, {{you must}} {{forgive me for}} saying that you are hardly old enough to make up your mind--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{what she}} said," [...] replied Shaggy, [...] "and I believe <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> We {{were on our way}} to conquer the Nome King when {{suddenly}} we fell into the Tube." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> If <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> {{capable of}} giving it up, {{she would not}} have been Hilda. There was but one other way left.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mrs. Norton said Jack was {{not invited}} to Sir Harry Griffin's because {{his father was a}} stock-jobber. Do you think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{about the}} main point. Alice came, and Dan could see {{with his own}} weary eyes {{that she had not}} slept either.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I can {{run down}} every Sunday,' said Ferdinand. 'It is her determination; I suppose <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> Felix, but I wish-- If I could wish her otherwise, {{she should be}} less prudent!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> Reuben," [...] the squire replied. [...] "You can {{transplant}} a young tree, easily enough; but you can't an old one. Somehow they won't {{take root}} in new soil.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said, 'I {{have done}} so; but your mamma thinks, and, on {{examination}} of the subject, I perceive <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> that the service has no meaning unless it {{take place in the}} church.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> It <b>was</b> of no use. As well {{might one}} {{have talked to}} the wooden cuckoo, already {{referred}} to, in Mrs Potter's timepiece.|$|R
60|$|Her manner {{took him}} a little aback. Nevertheless he {{reflected}} {{that there were a}} good many people within hearing, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> cautious.|$|R
60|$|I got up {{and took}} my hat. She patted me on the shoulder. I could have {{throttled}} her at that moment. And yet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
