40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comparison}} study {{of health and}} wellness outcomes for a sample of law enforcement officers and a sample of community corrections professionals within the same state. As such, {{it is the first}} attempt to determine and compare the independent variables which are <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement officer and community corrections professionals’ health and wellness for criminal justice employees working in the same context. Data used in the research was gathered from nearly identical health and wellness surveys distributed to the sample of law enforcement officers and the sample of community corrections professionals. Logistic, negative binomial, and Poisson regression analyses were performed to determine which independent variables are <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> officer and professionals’ health and wellness outcomes. Results show several factors are <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> both officer and professionals’ health and wellness, with law enforcement organizational factors being the most frequent <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement health and wellness. Demographic variables are the most frequent <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> professionals’ health and wellness.

25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> reactivity to substance cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E

Methods: 6185 patients were followed over a 2 year period and <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> blood pressure control were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Primary independent variables assessed were age, gender, race, antihypertensive medication class, and comorbidities. The primary dependent variable was {{systolic blood pressure}}. Results: Sixty percent of patients studied had controlled hypertension. <b>Significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> better blood pressure control were the presence of coronary artery disease, use of loop diuretics, not using miscellaneous antihypertensive agents, lower age, and not of Hispanic descent or not an African-American. Conclusions: Frequency of systolic blood pressure control {{was found to be}} higher than previously reported. In contrast, age, sex, and race were <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> control as reported elsewhere.

Navy to assess the non-cognitive skills of potential recruits. The TAPAS test aims to assess various aspects of recruit behavior that are not captured by typical screening tests, such as schooling and the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) along with other observable characteristics measured at entry. This thesis estimates whether the TAPAS scores predict recruit attrition in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), while controlling for schooling, AFQT scores, and demographics. Indeed, the analysis finds that several TAPAS facets are <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> attrition behavior. In particular, dominance, intellectual efficiency, order, adventure seeking, commitment to serve, and situational awareness are <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> DEP attrition.

Japanese EFL learners completed TOEIC listening test, L 2 proficiency tasks, and memory span tasks. The results of the multiple regression analysis confirmed that L 2 phonological modification knowledge and L 2 syntactic knowledge were the <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> L 2 listening comprehension. The two variables accounted for 65 % {{of the variance in the}} model. In the case of lower-level group, L 2 phonological modification knowledge and L 1 working memory capacity emerged as the <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> L 2 listening comprehension. On the other hand, L 2 vocabulary breadth and L 2 syntactic knowledge were the <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> L 2 listening comprehension in the higher-level group.

Forty-one infants died (21 %); standardized neurodevelopmental and functional assessments were conducted on 149 of 153 (97 %) survivors at {{a mean age of}} 52 months. Five <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> death were identified with logistic regression analysis: gestational age 23 to 26 weeks, intraventricular hemorrhage grades 3 or 4, male gender, five-minute Apgar &le; 3, and absence of prophylactic calf lung surfactant extract. <b>Significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> neurodevelopmental morbidity included sepsis, male gender, and nonwhite race. <b>Significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> disability at age four included neurodevelopmental impairment and severe retinopathy of prematurity.

40|$|Few {{data have}} been {{available}} to examine the longitudinal behavioral changes among injection drug users despite the favorable findings of previous studies on reduced risk in drug injection and needle sharing. A substantial number of injection drug users may either not change their risk behaviors or may lapse later. This study examined the longitudinal risk patterns of drug injection and patterns of unprotected sexual practice over a 48 -month follow-up period. The main {{purpose of this paper}} was to develop predictive models of initiation and maintenance of safer behaviors and, in particular, to identify factors that predict the maintenance or initiation of safer behavior over time. Four patterns of behavioral changes for both drug injection and sexual practice were defined: Initiation of safer behaviors, consistently unsafe practices, lapse into risky practices, and maintenance of risk reductions. A total of 415 injection drug users participated in the Risk Assessment Project in Philadelphia. All participants were assessed every six months using the Risk Assessment Battery and HIV antibody test. Each participant had at least two observation points. Using the logit model with generalized estimating equations method, the author found the following results. The longitudinal patterns of risky sexual practice was significantly associated with the patterns of drug injection. Being Black and unemployed at baseline were <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> initiation of cessation of drug injection. Being Black, being in methadone treatment, and receiving the HIV seropositive result were <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> maintenance of cessation of drug injection. Being female and receiving the HIV seropositive result were <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> initiation of safer sexual practice. Being older, being female, and receiving the HIV seropositive result were <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> maintenance of safer sexual practice.
