Using this application, CFS can assist in determining if emotionally salient faces have a shorter suppression time compared to neutral faces. Significant differences have been shown in <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> depending on the images being suppressed.

40|$|A recent {{focus in}} the field of {{consciousness}} research involves investigating the propensity of initially non-conscious visual information to gain access to consciousness. A critical tool for measuring conscious access is the so-called breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm (b-CFS). In this paradigm, a high contrast dynamic pattern is presented to one eye, thereby temporarily suppressing a target stimulus that is presented to the other eye. The time it takes for observers to report (e. g., the location of) the initially suppressed stimulus provides a measure of conscious access. Typical observations in b-CFS studies include the finding that upright faces are released from suppression faster than inverted faces, and the finding that stimuli that match the current content of visual working memory are released from suppression faster than mismatching stimuli. Interestingly, the extent to which observers exhibit these effects varies extensively (in the range of hundreds of milliseconds). By re-analyzing existing datasets and a new dataset we establish that the difference in RTs between conditions in b-CFS tasks (i. e., the effect of interest) is highly correlated with participants' overall suppression durations, and with their trial-to-trial variability in RTs. We advocate the usage of a simple latency- normalization method, which (1) removes the between-subject variability in <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> from the effect of interest, while (2) providing distributions of RT differences that are better suited for parametric testing. We next compare this latency-normalization method to two other transformations that are widely applied on within-subject RT data (z-transformations and log-transformations). Finally, we tentatively discuss how trial-to-trial variability and overall <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> might relate to prolonged phases of shallow suppression that are more prone to modulations of conscious access...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how seizures terminate and why some seizures are followed by a period of complete brain activity suppression, postictal generalized EEG suppression. This is clinically relevant {{as there is a}} potential association between postictal generalized EEG suppression, cardiorespiratory arrest and sudden death following a seizure. We combined human encephalographic seizure data with data of a computational model of seizures to elucidate the neuronal network dynamics underlying seizure termination and the postictal generalized EEG suppression state. A multi-unit computational neural mass model of epileptic seizure termination and postictal recovery was developed. The model provided three predictions that were validated in EEG recordings of 48 convulsive seizures from 48 subjects with refractory focal epilepsy (20 females, age range 15 - 61 years). The duration of ictal and postictal generalized EEG suppression periods in human EEG followed a gamma probability distribution indicative of a deterministic process (shape parameter 2. 6 and 1. 5, respectively) as predicted by the model. In the model and in humans, the time between two clonic bursts increased exponentially {{from the start of the}} clonic phase of the seizure. The terminal interclonic interval, calculated using the projected terminal value of the log-linear fit of the clonic frequency decrease was correlated with the presence and duration of postictal suppression. The projected terminal interclonic interval explained 41 % of the variation in postictal generalized EEG <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> (P < 0. 02). Conversely, postictal generalized EEG <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> explained 34 % of the variation in the last interclonic interval duration. Our findings suggest that postictal generalized EEG suppression is a separate brain state and that seizure termination is a plastic and autonomous process, reflected in increased duration of interclonic intervals that determine the duration of postictal generalized EEG suppression...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{controversially}} debated topic whether stimuli can {{be analyzed}} up to the semantic level when they are suppressed from visual awareness during continuous flash suppression (CFS). Here, we investigated whether affective knowledge, i. e., affective biographical information about faces, influences {{the time it takes}} for initially invisible faces with neutral expressions to overcome suppression and break into consciousness. To test this, we used negative, positive, and neutral famous faces as well as initially unfamiliar faces, which were associated with negative, positive or neutral biographical information. Affective knowledge influenced ratings of facial expressions, corroborating recent evidence and indicating the success of our affective learning paradigm. Furthermore, we replicated shorter <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> for upright than for inverted faces, demonstrating the suitability of our CFS paradigm. However, affective biographical information did not modulate <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> for newly learned faces, and even though <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> for famous faces were influenced by affective knowledge, these effects did not differ between upright and inverted faces, indicating that they might have been due to low-level visual differences. Thus, we did not obtain unequivocal evidence for genuine influences of affective biographical information on access to visual awareness for faces during CFS...|$|R
40|$|When {{dissimilar}} {{images are}} {{presented to the}} two eyes, binocular rivalry (BR) occurs, and perception alternates spontaneously between the images. Although neural correlates of the oscillating perception during BR {{have been found in}} multiple sites along the visual pathway, the source of BR dynamics is unclear. Psychophysical and modeling studies suggest that both low- and high-level cortical processes underlie BR dynamics. Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the involvement of high-level regions by showing that frontal and parietal cortices responded time locked to spontaneous perceptual alternation in BR. However, a potential contribution of early visual areas to BR dynamics has been overlooked, because these areas also responded to the physical stimulus alternation mimicking BR. In the present study, instead of focusing on activity during perceptual switches, we highlighted brain activity during suppression periods to investigate a potential link between activity in human early visual areas and BR dynamics. We used a strong interocular suppression paradigm called continuous flash suppression to suppress and fluctuate the visibility of a probe stimulus and measured retinotopic responses to the onset of the invisible probe using functional MRI. There were ∼ 130 -fold differences in the median <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> across 12 subjects. The individual differences in <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> could be predicted by the amplitudes of the retinotopic activity in extrastriate visual areas (V 3 and V 4 v) evoked by the invisible probe. Weaker responses were associated with longer <b>suppression</b> <b>durations.</b> These results demonstrate that retinotopic representations in early visual areas {{play a role in the}} dynamics of perceptual alternations during BR...|$|R
40|$|To {{efficiently}} {{interact with}} the external environment, our nervous system combines information arising from different sensory modalities. Recent evidence suggests that cross-modal interactions can be automatic and even unconscious, reflecting the ecological relevance of cross-modal processing. Here, we use continuous flash suppression (CFS) to directly investigate whether haptic signals can interact with visual signals outside of visual awareness. We measured <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> of visual gratings rendered invisible by CFS either during visual stimulation alone or during visuo-haptic stimulation. We found that active exploration of a haptic grating congruent in orientation with the suppressed visual grating reduced <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> both compared with visual-only stimulation and to incongruent visuo-haptic stimulation. We {{also found that the}} facilitatory effect of touch on visual suppression disappeared when the visual and haptic gratings were mismatched in either spatial frequency or orientation. Together, these results demonstrate that congruent touch can accelerate the rise to consciousness of a suppressed visual stimulus and that this unconscious cross-modal interaction depends on visuo-haptic congruency. Furthermore, since CFS suppression is thought to occur early in visual cortical processing, our data reinforce the evidence suggesting that visuo-haptic interactions can occur at the earliest stages of cortical processing...|$|R
40|$|Evoked by {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} mental nerve, the masseter inhibitory reflex consists of an early and a late silent period (SP 1 and SP 2), which interrupt the voluntary electromyographic (EMG) activity in the masseter muscle. We recorded the masseter inhibitory reflex and measured its latency, depth of <b>suppression,</b> <b>duration</b> and recovery cycle to paired stimuli, in patients with Huntington's chorea. Parkinson's disease, dystonia, or unilateral masticatory spasm. In patients with Huntington's chorea the reflex data and recovery cycle were normal. In patients with Parkinson's disease or dystonia, although the reflex data were normal, SP 2 recovered far more rapidly {{than it did in}} control subjects. This is possibly due to hypoactivity of an inhibitory control of the polysynaptic chain of ponto-medullary interneurons that mediate SP 2. In patients with unilateral masticatory spasm, both SP 1 and SP 2 were absent. Suppression is probably absent because this involuntary movement originates at a point along the peripheral course of the nerve...|$|E
40|$|When {{conflicting}} {{images are}} {{presented to the}} corresponding regions of the two eyes, only one image may be consciously perceived. In binocular rivalry (BR), two images alternate in phenomenal visibility; even a salient image is eventually suppressed by an image of low saliency. Recently, N. Tsuchiya and C. Koch (2005) reported a technique called continuous flash suppression (CFS), extending the <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> more than 10 -fold. Here, we investigated the depth of this prolonged form of interocular suppression as well as conventional BR and flash suppression (FS) using a probe detection task. Compared to monocular viewing condition, CFS elevated detection thresholds more than 20 -fold, whereas BR did so by 3 -fold. In subsequent experiments, we dissected CFS into several components. By manipulating the number and timing of flashes {{with respect to the}} probe, we found that the stronger suppression in CFS is not due to summation between BR and FS but is caused by the summation of the suppression due to multiple flashes. Our results support the view that CFS is not a stronger version of BR but is due to the accumulated suppressive effects of multiple flashes...|$|E
40|$|Presenting {{different}} {{images to}} each eye triggers 'binocular rivalry' {{in which one}} image is visible and the other suppressed, with the visible image alternating every second or so. We previously showed that binocular rivalry between cross-oriented gratings is altered when the fingertip explores a grooved stimulus aligned {{with one of the}} rivaling gratings: the matching visual grating's dominance duration was lengthened and its <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> shortened. In a more robust test, we here measure visual contrast sensitivity during rivalry dominance and suppression, with and without exploration of the grooved surface, to determine if rivalry suppression strength is modulated by touch. We find that a visual grating undergoes 45 % less suppression when observers touch an aligned grating, compared to a cross-oriented one. Touching an aligned grating also improved visual detection thresholds for the 'invisible' suppressed grating by 2. 4 dB, relative to a vision-only condition. These results show that congruent haptic stimulation prevents a visual stimulus from becoming deeply suppressed in binocular rivalry. Moreover, because congruent touch acted on the phenomenally invisible grating, this visuo-haptic interaction must precede awareness and likely occurs early in visual processing. © 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

40|$|The {{content of}} visual working memory (VWM) affects the {{processing}} of concurrent visual input. Recently, it has been demonstrated that stimuli are released from interocular suppression faster when they match rather than mismatch a color that is memorized for subsequent recall. In order to investigate {{the nature of the}} interaction between visual representations elicited by VWM and visual representations elicited by retinal input, we modeled the perceptual processes leading up to this difference in <b>suppression</b> <b>durations.</b> We replicated the VWM modulation of <b>suppression</b> <b>durations,</b> and fitted sequential sampling models (linear ballistic accumulators) to the response time data. Model comparisons revealed that the data was best explained by a decrease in threshold for visual input that matches the content of VWM. Converging evidence was obtained by fitting similar sequential sampling models (shifted Wald model) to published datasets. Finally, to confirm that the previously observed threshold difference reflected processes occurring before rather than after the stimuli were released from suppression, we applied the same procedure to the data of an experiment in which stimuli were not interocularly suppressed. Here, we found no decrease in threshold for stimuli that match the content of VWM. We discuss our findings in light of a preactivation hypothesis, proposing that matching visual input taps into the same neural substrate that is already activated by a representation concurrently maintained in VWM, thereby reducing its threshold for reaching visual awareness...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, interocular {{suppression}} {{is believed}} to disrupt high-level (i. e., semantic or conceptual) processing of the suppressed visual input. The {{development of a new}} experimental paradigm, breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS), has caused a resurgence of studies demonstrating high-level processing of visual information in the absence of visual awareness. In this method the time it takes for interocularly suppressed stimuli to breach the threshold of visibility, is regarded as a measure of access to awareness. The aim of the current review is twofold. First, we provide an overview of the literature using this b-CFS method, while making a distinction between two types of studies: those in which <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> are compared between different stimulus classes (such as upright faces versus inverted faces), and those in which <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> are compared for stimuli that either match or mismatch concurrently available information (such as a colored target that either matches or mismatches a color retained in working memory). Second, we aim at dissociating high-level processing from low-level (i. e., crude visual) processing of the suppressed stimuli. For this purpose, we include a thorough review of the control conditions that are used in these experiments. Additionally, we provide recommendations for proper control conditions that we deem crucial for disentangling high-level from low-level effects. Based on this review, we argue that crude visual processing suffices for explaining differences in breakthrough times reported using b-CFS. As such, we conclude that there is as yet no reason to assume that interocularly suppressed stimuli receive full semantic analysis. © 2014 Gayet, Van der Stigchel and Paffen...|$|R

Focusing on the suppression process, the present study asks whether neural events underlying rivalry suppression take place prior to, or subsequent to those underlying the synthesis of subjective contours. Specifically, we examined whether (i) a subjective contour could prematurely return a suppressed target to dominance and (ii) whether suppression of a Kanizsa-type inducer precludes {{the formation of a}} subjective contour. <b>Suppression</b> <b>durations</b> were not abbreviated by the subjective contour, but suppression did prevent the formation of a subjective contour.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the effects of highfrequency electrical stimulation on electrographic seizure activity during and after stimulation (ONeffect and OFF-effect). Methods: The modulation and suppression of epileptiform activity during (ON-effect) and after (OFF-effect) high-frequency electrical stimulation was investigated using the high-K + and picrotoxin hippocampal slice epilepsy models. Uniform sinusoidal fields (50 Hz) were applied with various intensity levels for 1 min across brain slices. Extracellular and intracellular activity were monitored during and after stimulation. Results: The ON-effects of high-frequency stimulation were highly variable across individual slices and models; ON-effects included modulation of activity, pacing, partial suppression, or activity resembling spreading-depression. On average, epileptic activity, measured as power in the extracellular fields, increased significantly during stimulation. Following the termination of electrical stimulation, a robust poststimulation suppression period was observed. This OFF suppression was observed even at relatively moderate stimulation intensities. The duration of OFF suppression increased with stimulation intensity, independent of ON-effects. Antagonism of GABAA function did not directly effect OFF <b>suppression</b> <b>duration.</b> Conclusions: The present results suggest that “rational” seizure control protocols using intermittent high-frequency electrical stimulation should control for both ON and OFF effects...|$|E

In a cross-sectional study, peripheral blood samples {{were obtained from}} tolerant (n = 15, median 38. 5 months post-HCT) and non-tolerant (n = 17, median 39. 5 post-HCT) HCT recipients and healthy control subjects (n = 10) for analysis of immune cell subsets and differential gene expression. There {{were no significant differences}} in immune subsets across groups. We identified 281 probe sets unique to the tolerant (TOL) group and 122 for non-tolerant (non-TOL). These were enriched for process networks including NK cell cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, lymphocyte proliferation, and cell cycle and apoptosis. Differential gene expression was enriched for CD 56, CD 66, and CD 14 human lineage-specific gene expression. Differential expression of 20 probe sets between groups was sufficient to develop a classifier with > 90 % accuracy, correctly classifying 14 / 15 TOL cases and 15 / 17 non-TOL cases. These data suggest that differential gene expression can be utilized to accurately classify tolerant patients following HCT.

40|$|Items {{in visual}} working memory (VWM) {{can help to}} {{prioritize}} information. An experiment was conducted to investigate whether a memory item, only relevant for a memory recall test later, can influence access to awareness of a suppressed stimulus in a suppression task. In the experiment, subjects were first asked to remember a prospectively relevant item (a colour hue), on which they would be tested later in the experiment. Subsequently, the subjects were administered a breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS) task. This prospective memory item remained the same for several trials. The memory-based influence of the colour was measured in breakthrough times, where breakthrough times were assumed to be indicative of access to awareness. The <b>Suppression</b> <b>duration</b> times of the suppression task provide knowledge about whether these memory items are transferred from VWM to long-term memory (LTM) and back. It was expected that items in VWM would influence the subjects’ performance on the b-CFS task, whereas items stored in the LTM would have no influence. After trial repetition {{it is expected that}} the prospective memory items being transferred from VWM to LTM and back to VWM before being replaced by a new memory item.

In a series of seven experiments, we assessed the impact of stimulus inversion on the detection of person silhouettes, headless bodies, faces and other objects {{from a wide range of}} animate and inanimate control categories. We used continuous flash suppression (CFS), a variant of binocular rivalry, to render stimuli invisible at the beginning of each trial and measured the time upright and inverted stimuli needed to overcome such interocular suppression. Inversion strongly interfered with access to awareness for human faces, headless human bodies, person silhouettes, and even highly variable body postures, while <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> for control objects were not (inanimate objects) or only mildly (animal faces and bodies) affected by inversion. Furthermore, inversion effects were eliminated when the normal body configuration was distorted. The absence of strong inversion effects in a binocular control condition not involving interocular suppression suggests that non-conscious mechanisms mediated the effect of inversion on body and face detection during CFS. These results indicate that perceptual mechanisms that govern access to visual awareness are highly sensitive to the presence of conspecifics...|$|R

Cross-sectional analysis of 33 HIVinfected participants age ≥ 40 years and on stable ART ≥ 3 months were compared to 14 HIV-uninfected participants of similar age, gender, and cardiovascular disease risk. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from fasting blood glucose and insulin measurements. Peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and percentages of monocyte intracellular IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, or TNF-α responses were determined by flow cytometry. We observed higher percentages of monocytes producing IL- 1 β and IL- 8 after oxLDL stimulation were associated with higher IR as measured by HOMA-IR (all p< 0. 005) in HIV-infected participants on ART (median age 53 years, 87 % males) but not in HIVuninfected participants. Longer duration since HIV diagnosis and longer duration since antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation were both associated with higher basal monocyte cytokine responses (all p< 0. 05).

40|$|Hypoxia can depress ventilation, {{respiratory}} load sensation, and {{the cough}} reflex, and potentially other protective respiratory reflexes such as respiratory muscle responses to increased respiratory load. In sleep-disordered breathing, increased respiratory load and hypoxia frequently coexist. This study aimed {{to examine the}} effects of hypoxia on the reflex responses of 1) the genioglossus (the largest upper airway dilator muscle) and 2) the scalene muscle (an obligatory inspiratory muscle) to negative-pressure pulse stimuli during wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesized that hypoxia would impair these reflex responses. Fourteen healthy men, 19 – 42 yr old, were studied on two separate occasions, ~ 1 wk apart. Bipolar fine-wire electrodes were inserted orally into the genioglossus muscle, and surface electrodes were placed overlying the left scalene muscle to record EMG activity. In random order, participants were exposed to mild overnight hypoxia (arterial oxygen saturation ~ 85 %) or medical air. Respiratory muscle reflex responses were elicited via negative-pressure pulse stimuli (approximately – 10 cmH 2 O at the mask, 250 -ms duration) delivered in early inspiration during wakefulness and sleep. Negative-pressure pulse stimuli resulted in a short-latency activation followed by a suppression of the genioglossus EMG that did not alter with hypoxia. Conversely, the predominant response of the scalene EMG to negative-pressure pulse stimuli was suppression followed by activation with more pronounced suppression during hypoxia compared with normoxia (mean ± SE <b>suppression</b> <b>duration</b> 64 ± 6 vs. 38 ± 6 ms, P = 0. 006).

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that neonatal deafness of 7 - 13 months duration leads to loss of cochleotopy {{in the primary}} auditory cortex (AI) that can be reversed by cochlear implant use. Here we describe {{the effects of a}} similar duration of deafness and cochlear implant use on temporal processing. Specifically, we compared the temporal resolution of neurons in AI of young adult normal-hearing cats that were acutely deafened and implanted immediately prior to recording with that in three groups of neonatally deafened cats. One group of neonatally deafened cats received no chronic stimulation. The other two groups received up to 8 months of either low- or high-rate (50 or 500 pulses per second per electrode, respectively) stimulation from a clinical cochlear implant, initiated at 10 weeks of age. Deafness of 7 - 13 months duration had no effect on the duration of post-onset response suppression, latency, latency jitter, or the stimulus repetition rate at which units responded maximally (best repetition rate), but resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the ability of units to respond to every stimulus in a train (maximum following rate). None of the temporal response characteristics of the low-rate group differed from those in acutely deafened controls. In contrast, high-rate stimulation had diverse effects: it resulted in decreased <b>suppression</b> <b>duration,</b> longer latency and greater jitter relative to all other groups, and an increase in best repetition rate and cut-off rate relative to acutely deafened controls. The minimal effects of moderate-duration deafness on temporal processing in the present study are in contrast to its previously-reported pronounced effects on cochleotopy. Much longer periods of deafness have been reported to result in significant changes in temporal processing, in accord with the fact that duration of deafness is a major factor influencing outcome in human cochlear implantees.

40|$|The {{mystery of}} {{conscious}} visual experience has intrigued many philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists for decades, if not centuries. One of the insights {{research on this}} topic has yielded {{is that there is}} no one-to-one correspondence between physical visual input and our corresponding perceptual experience. Indeed, in some specific situations visual input can be presented to the observer, while remaining invisible. The ultimate goal of this dissertation was to achieve a better understanding of the representational nature of a perceptually suppressed visual stimulus. More specifically, the overarching research question was: “To what extent does perceptual organization take place in the visual system for stimuli rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression?”. Indeed, throughout this PhD we have relied on a paradigm called “continuous flash suppression (CFS) ” to manipulate the contents of visual awareness. The research presented in this dissertation is divided into two main parts, the first part being oriented to more theoretical aspects regarding the mechanisms of suppression through CFS while the second part focuses on the representation of the suppressed stimulus. The first two chapters present two studies on the determinants of effective suppression through CFS and the temporal characteristics of the time series of <b>suppression</b> <b>durations.</b> In Chapter 2, we show that feature overlap between the mask and suppressed stimulus is more important to enable effective suppression than the dynamic nature of the CFS mask. In Chapter 3, we report that <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> are not independent, yet show small, but significant sequential correlations, implying that CFS elicits a hallmark characteristic of other multistable phenomena, perceptual memory. Based on the results of these two studies, we conclude that CFS relies on mechanisms similar to binocular rivalry, and that it might constitute a stronger form of binocular rivalry. In the following seven chapters, which comprise the second part of the dissertation, we present seven studies that tap into the representation of the perceptually suppression stimulus. In Chapter 4, we consider whether the surface induced by the classic Kanizsa stimulus is represented during suppression. In Chapter 5, we ask whether a supraliminal auditory stimulus can influence suppression strength of a perceptually suppressed looming stimulus. In Chapters 6 to 8, we show that launching events (an exemplary stimulus of causality perception) enter awareness faster than pass or pseudo-launch events, biological motion stimuli do not yield an inversion effect, and that faces presented in familiar configurations break suppression faster, respectively. Finally, Chapters 9 and 10 consider complex, high-level processing under CFS. In Chapter 9, we fail to replicate a previously observed result in which incongruent scenes broke suppression faster compared to congruent ones. In Chapter 10, we ask whether words are processed during suppression, but observe neither a word frequency nor a word type (word vs. pseudo-word) effect. In sum, the results presented in the second part of this dissertation show very limited visual processing during CFS, the implications of which are discussed in Chapter 11. status: publishe...|$|R

The present study sought to learn whether this exceptional auditory ability impacts visual perception under stimulus conditions that provoke visual competition {{in the form of}} binocular rivalry. Nineteen adult participants with 3 - 19 years of musical training were divided into two groups according to their performance on a task involving identification of the specific note associated with hearing a given musical pitch. During test trials lasting just over half a minute, participants dichoptically viewed a scrolling musical score presented to one eye and a drifting sinusoidal grating presented to the other eye; throughout the trial they pressed buttons to track the alternations in visual awareness produced by these dissimilar monocular stimuli. On "pitch-congruent" trials, participants heard an auditory melody that was congruent in pitch with the visual score, on "pitch-incongruent" trials they heard a transposed auditory melody that was congruent with the score in melody but not in pitch, and on "melody-incongruent" trials they heard an auditory melody completely different from the visual score. For both groups, the visual musical scores predominated over the gratings when the auditory melody was congruent compared to when it was incongruent. Moreover, the AP participants experienced greater predominance of the visual score when it was accompanied by the pitch-congruent melody compared to the same melody transposed in pitch; for non-AP musicians, pitch-congruent and pitch-incongruent trials yielded equivalent predominance. Analysis of individual durations of dominance revealed differential effects on dominance and <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> for AP and non-AP participants.

After training, subjects imagined climbing the routes under control conditions and with one of three secondary tasks derived from the working memory literature.

The longer <b>duration</b> of acid <b>suppression</b> with omeprazole, particularly during the day, when food is ingested and H 2 -receptor antagonists are less effective, is reflected in the clinical superiority for symptom relief and ulcer healing and especially for the treatment of erosive esophagitis. Extensive clinical experience has proved omeprazole to be safe, and concerns over hypergastrinemia, ECL-cell hyperplasia, and carcinoid formation have not been substantiated in humans. Recent evidence has shown that omeprazole suppresses Helicobacter pylori and, in combination with antibiotics, can eradicate this organism in a substantial proportion of patients. This effect may result from enhancement of antibiotic bioavailability and optimizing host defense mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Generalized tonic–clonic seizure (GTCS) is the commonest seizure type {{associated}} with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This {{study examined the}} semiological and electroencephalographic differences (EEG) in the GTCSs of adults as {{compared with those of}} children. The rationale lies on epidemiological observations that have noted a tenfold higher incidence of SUDEP in adults. Weanalyzed the video-EEG data of 105 GTCS events in 61 consecutive patients (12 children, 23 seizure events and 49 adults, 82 seizure events) recruited from the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. Semiological, EEG, and 3 -channel EKG features were studied. Periictal seizure phase durations were analyzed including tonic, clonic, total seizure, postictal EEG suppression (PGES), and recovery phases. Heart rate variability (HRV) measures includingRMSSD (root mean square successive difference of RR intervals), SDNN (standard deviation of NN intervals), and SDSD (standard deviation of differences) were analyzed (including low frequency/high frequency power ratios) during preictal baseline and ictal and postictal phases. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to find associations between electroclinical features. Separate subgroup analyses were carried out on adult and pediatric age groups as well as medication groups (no antiepileptic medication cessation versus unchanged or reduced medication) during admission. Major differences were seen in adult and pediatric seizures with total seizure duration, tonic phase, PGES, and recovery phases being significantly shorter in children (p b 0. 01). Generalized estimating equation analysis, using tonic phase duration as the dependent variable, found age to correlate significantly (p b 0. 001), and this remained significant during subgroup analysis (adults and children) such that each 0. 12 -second increase in tonic phase duration correlated with a 1 -second increase in PGES <b>duration.</b> Postictal EEG <b>suppression</b> <b>durations</b> were on average 28 s shorter in children. With cessation of medication, total seizure duration was significantly increased by a mean value of 8 s in children and 11 s in adults (p b 0. 05). Tonic phase duration also significantly increased with medication cessation, and although PGES durations increased, this was not significant. Root mean square successive difference was negatively correlated with PGES duration (longer PGES durations were {{associated with}} decreased vagally mediated heart rate variability; p b 0. 05) but not with tonic phase duration. This study clearly points out identifiable electroclinical differences between adult and pediatric GTCSs that may be relevant in explaining lower SUDEP risk in children. The findings suggest that some prolonged seizure phases and prolonged PGES duration may be electroclinical markers of SUDEP risk and merit further study...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{relative}} {{effects of}} radiation dose escalation (RDE) and androgen <b>suppression</b> (AS) <b>duration</b> on local prostatic progression (LP) remain unclear. Methods: We addressed this in the TROG 03. 04 RADAR trial by incorporating a RDE programme by stratification at randomisation. Men were allocated 6 or 18. months AS. ±. 18. months zoledronate (Z). The main endpoint was a composite of clinically diagnosed LP or PSA progression with a PSA doubling time ≥ 6. months. Fine and Gray competing risk modelling with adjustment for site clustering produced cumulative incidence estimates at 6. 5. years for each RDE group. Results: Composite LP declined coherently in the 66, 70 and 74. Gy external beam dosing groups and was lowest in the high dose rate brachytherapy boost (HDRB) group. At 6. 5. years, adjusted cumulative incidences were 22 %, 15 %, 13 % and 7 % respectively. Compared to 6. months AS, 18. months AS also significantly reduced LP (p < 0. 001). Post-radiation urethral strictures were documented in 45 subjects and increased incrementally in the dosing groups. Crude incidences were 0. 8 %, 0. 9 %, 3. 8 % and 12. 7 % respectively. Conclusion: RDE and increasing AS independently reduce LP and increase urethral strictures. The risks and benefits to the individual must be balanced when selecting radiation dose and AS duration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown {{cognitive}} enhancement effects of well-practiced experiences that involve executive cognition, such as musical and language abilities (e. g. Bialystok and DePape, 2009). Aims: The present study aims to investigate {{whether there is a}} difference in the enhancement of executive processing between monolingual-musicians and bilinguals, and what the effects may be for people with intensive musical experience as well as linguistic experience, and confidence in two or more languages. A battery of attentional and temporal attentional tasks, as well as duration discrimination and temporal comparison tasks were administered. Methods: There were a total of 73 participants taking part in the study, based on their music and language abilities the participants were divided into four groups: Bilinguals, Monolingual-Musicians, Bilingual-Musicians and one control group consisting of monolingual non-musicians. The groups were compared on four different executive functioning tasks, all involving sustained and selective attention, response <b>suppression</b> and <b>duration</b> estimation, looking at performance for both auditory and visual stimuli. Results: The results suggest a positive effect of musicianship across all tasks, except the last temporal comparison tasks. Bilinguals performed comparatively poorly, and there was a suggestive effect of bilingualism being at a disadvantage for the tasks involved in the study, as the Bilingual-Musicians did not show any potential enhancement effect of performance based on language experience, whereas musicianship had a clear additive effect on pitch discrimination. Conclusion: Even though musicians were found to perform better on all tasks, this does not necessarily suggest modularity-specificity, but could be generalized enhanced cognitive phenomena originating from original cognitive differences, e. g. a better working memory, that does not relate to musicianship per se. The results also suggest that bilinguals might have low response inhibitory control, as opposed to conceptual control, which could relate to misperception of time...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Monocular form {{deprivation}} {{early in}} life leads to a dramatic loss of binocularly driven cortical neurons and behaviorally demonstrated form–deprivation amblyopia. However, we previously reported that brief daily periods of unrestricted vision during monocular form deprivation can prevent or reduce the impact of amblyopia. In this study we determined {{whether or not the}} binocular response properties of V 1 and V 2 neurons of these monkeys were altered. Methods: Six infant macaque monkeys were reared with monocular diffuser between 3 weeks and 4 months of age. The rearing regimen included daily unrestricted vision for one, two or four hours. Upon completion of the behavioral testing to determine if the monkeys exhibited amblyopia, we conducted the microelectrode recording experiments to measure the disparity sensitivity of individual units and the prevalence of binocular suppression in V 1 and V 2. Results: There was a clear loss of binocularly balanced cells in both V 1 and V 2 of monkeys reared with one hour of normal vision. Ocular dominance distribution of V 2, but not V 1 units, was shifted in favor of the non–deprived eye. Monkeys reared with 4 hours of normal vision did not have any loss of binocular cells in either V 1 or V 2. Monkeys reared with 2 hours of unrestricted vision showed a slight reduction in units dominated by the deprived eye. However, in all treated groups, there were significant reductions in the disparity sensitivity and anomalous increases in binocular <b>suppression.</b> The <b>duration</b> of unrestricted vision did not affect the severity of these binocular response deficits in either V 1 or V 2. Conclusions: These results suggest that the developing binocular connections in V 1 and V 2 are exceedingly sensitive to binocularly uncorrelated signals and thus, earlier or more complete intervention is necessary to prevent binocular response deficits from emerging...|$|R
40|$|Binocular rivalry is {{a complex}} process characterised by alternations in perceptual {{suppression}} and dominance that result when two different images are presented simultaneously {{to the left and}} right eyes. It has been reported recently that the addition of contextual cues will promote the predominance of the context consistent rivalry target. In contrast to Levelt's second proposition (1965), this effect has been found to result exclusively from an increase in the dominance phase <b>duration,</b> while the <b>suppression</b> phase <b>duration</b> remains unaffected. METHODS: Human subjects were simultaneously presented with a small (2 degrees) disc consisting of gratings (four cycles per degree) of different orientations to the two eyes. Four experiments were conducted to ascertain the effects of background gratings and contextual colour information on target predominance and phase duration. For each of the four experimental conditions, the orientation and colour of the target gratings and surrounding contextual background were systematically manipulated. RESULTS: In this study, we report an effect opposite to that of Levelt. Contradictory contextual information increases target predominance and phase duration during binocular rivalry. Our results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} promote the dominance of the context contradictory percept with co-linearity, co-chromaticity and orientation cues. In line with previous studies involving context, we find that this effect on predominance is due to an increase in the duration of the dominance rather than the suppression phase. DISCUSSION: We discuss our findings in respect to those from previous studies and consider high- and low-level processes that may be responsible for these apparently 'contradictory' roles of context on binocular rivalry. In addition, we discuss how the apparent 'anti-Levelt' effect of context can be reinterpreted in a manner that brings it back in line with Levelt's second proposition and raises the question of whether 'suppressability' plays a disproportionately large role in determining the duration of perceptual phases in binocular rivalry...|$|R
40|$|Different cause-and-effect {{relationships}} between hemolytic and infectious processes are catego-rized in a clinically useful manner as follows: infections causing hemolysis by invasion of {{red blood cells}} (RBCs), by hemolysins, or by immune mechanisms; oxidative damage to RBCs dur-ing infections; hemolysis secondary to infection-induced pathologic processes; hemolytic effects of antimicrobial therapy; and predisposition of an individual to infection caused by an underly-ing hemolytic disorder or therapy for that disorder. The mechanisms of these interrelationships are discussed in detail. Anemia is commonly recognized {{during the course of}} in-fections, especially chronic and acute infections in children [1, 2]. Possible mechanisms for this development of anemia include failure of iron utilization, bone-marrow <b>suppression,</b> and shortened <b>duration</b> of red blood cell (RBC) survival (hemolysis). Hemolysis is a well-recognized feature of infections such as malaria, but it may also occur {{in a wide variety of}} other infections. Recognition of such hemolysis is important not only because it may require specific management but also be-cause it may provide a clue to the cause of the infectious process. The association of hemolytic anemia with infection has been briefly reviewed by Beutler [3]. The present review will pro-vide a clinically useful classification of different cause-and-effect associations of hemolytic and infectious processes and examine the mechanisms by which these associations occur...|$|R
40|$|Stimulus {{artifacts}} inhibit reliable {{acquisition of}} biological evoked potentials for several milliseconds if an electrode contact is utilized for both electrical stimulation and recording purposes. This hinders {{the measurement of}} evoked short-latency biological responses, which is otherwise elicited by stimulation in implantable prosthetic devices. We present an improved stimulus artifact suppression scheme using two electrode simultaneous stimulation and differential readout using high-gain amplifiers. Substantial reduction of artifact duration has been shown possible through the common-mode rejection property of an instrumentation amplifier for electrode interfaces. The performance of this method depends on good matching of electrode-electrolyte interface properties of the chosen electrode pair. A novel calibration algorithm has been developed that helps in artificial matching of impedance and thereby achieves the required performance in artifact <b>suppression.</b> Stimulus artifact <b>duration</b> has been reduced down to 50 mu s from the stimulation-cum-recording electrodes, {{which is similar to}} 6 x improvement over the present state of the art. The system is characterized with emulated resistor-capacitor loads and a variety of in-vitro metal electrodes dipped in saline environment. The proposed method is going to be useful for closed-loop electrical stimulation and recording studies, such as bidirectional neural prosthesis of retina, cochlea, brain, and spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Ghrelin {{has been}} shown to have {{antiepileptic}} function. However, the underlying mechanisms by which, ghrelin exerts its antiepileptic effects are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether neuropeptide Y (NPY) mediates ghrelin anticonvulsant effect in the brain through its Y 1, Y 2 or Y 5 receptors. Methods: Male Wistar rats were bilaterally microinjected with ghrelin 0. 3 nmol/μl/side and NPY antagonists; GR 231118 (Y 1 receptor antagonist), BIIE 0246 (Y 2 receptor antagonist), CGP 71683 (Y 5 receptor antagonist) or solvents (Saline, DMSO) into the dorsal hippocampus 20 minutes before ghrelin administration. Thirty minutes after ghrelin microinjection, a single convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (50 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (ip). Afterwards, duration of seizure and total seizure score (TSS) were assessed for 30 minutes in all animals. Results: Intrahippocampal injection of 0. 3 nmol/μl/side ghrelin decreased duration of seizure and TSS induced by PTZ. The <b>suppression</b> of both <b>duration</b> (p< 0. 001) and TSS (p< 0. 001) induced by ghrelin in hippocampus were significantly blocked by GR 231118 (10 μg/μl/side), BIIE 0246 (400 pmol/μl/side) and CGP 71683 A (5 nmol/μl/side). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that NPY Y 1, Y 2 and Y 5 receptors in the hippocampus may somehow mediate the anticonvulsive action of ghrelin. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that ghrelin acts in the hippocampus to modulate seizures via NPY...|$|R
