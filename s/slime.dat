5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green <b>slime</b> {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. <b>Slime</b> was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with <b>slime,</b> and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a <b>slime</b> geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and <b>slime</b> still lasts on the network.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Slime</b> Curling mini-game was added.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{recognizable}} symbol of the best-selling video game series in Japan, the <b>Slime</b> has been featured prominently in Dragon Quest-related merchandise. It has its own section called 'Smile Slime' on the Square Enix JP shopping website. <b>Slime</b> merchandise includes plush toys, pencil cases, keychains, game controllers, a stylus, and several boardgames including one titled Dragon Quest <b>Slime</b> Racing. In Japan, pork filled steam buns shaped like slimes have been sold. For Dragon Quest's 25th anniversary, special items were sold including business cards, tote bags, and crystal figurines.|$|E
50|$|The Psi Energy Pulse {{damaged the}} Tank and <b>Slimer</b> escaped. The team finds him {{looking at the}} Containment Unit. When the Rookie takes a shot, <b>Slimer</b> avoids it and the Proton Stream hits the Unit, {{releasing}} the Sloth Ghost. Rookie and Ray pursued <b>Slimer</b> into the Sub-Basement but it escaped through a wall. After the Sloth Ghost was recaptured, the Ghostbusters headed to the Sedgewick Hotel on Ray's hunch <b>Slimer</b> would return to his old haunt. Sure enough, <b>Slimer</b> was found by Ray, Peter, and Rookie eating and drinking off someone's tray in front of Room 1218. Rookie took a shot but <b>Slimer</b> ran for it and tried to hide. Rookie roused him out and <b>Slimer</b> flew off towards the elevators where he descended {{back to the ground}} floor (but not before sliming Peter for a second time). <b>Slimer</b> is joined by Bellhop Ghosts. With renewed paranormal activity, Egon opts to split up. Rookie and Peter are tasked with recapturing <b>Slimer.</b> Peter believes he's feasting in the Alhambra Ballroom but the manager John O'Keefe bars entrance. Peter regroups and leads Rookie through the kitchen to access the other entrance to the ballroom. Rookie and Peter successfully trap <b>Slimer.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Slimer</b> {{is placed}} {{back into a}} working Paranormal Containment Research Tank when the team returns from Times Square. When Ivo Shandor shut down the {{containment}} grid, <b>Slimer</b> is among the escapees. After the Ghostbusters destroy Shandor {{and return to the}} physical plane, <b>Slimer</b> <b>slimes</b> Ilyssa Selwyn just as she and Peter are about to kiss in Central Park. In the stylized version of the game, <b>Slimer</b> flies around, on the loose once again, as the Rookie fires on him during the credits.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Slime</b> {{has been}} placed on a {{multitude}} of different kinds of merchandise. The Slime's friendliness, limited power, and appealing form have caused the <b>Slime</b> to become a popular character and symbol of the Dragon Quest series.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Slime</b> {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in Dragon Quest as the first and weakest enemy in the game, and has made a similar appearance in all subsequent Dragon Quest titles. In , the monster is an easy recruit that learns a variety of magic spells. The <b>Slime</b> is also the protagonist of its own spinoff series, beginning with <b>Slime</b> MoriMori Dragon Quest, a Japanese Game Boy Advance title. It was followed by , which was released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, and the Japanese-exclusive title, <b>Slime</b> Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3 for the Nintendo 3DS. These games follow a nation of slimes who are intelligent and civilized, but also cute and somewhat comical. In the North American localization of the Dragon Quest games for the Nintendo DS, joking references and puns are made about slimes. <b>Slime</b> also appeared in three crossover games along with characters from Nintendo's Mario franchise: Itadaki Street DS, Mario Sports Mix, and Fortune Street.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{similarities}} in morphology and lifestyle, the <b>slime</b> molds (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water molds (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly {{classified in the}} kingdom Fungi, in groups like Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The <b>slime</b> molds were studied also as protozoans, leading to a ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, <b>Slimer</b> {{got his own}} cartoon series {{primarily}} {{aimed at}} young children. Unlike previous series, <b>Slimer</b> was able to talk very well. Many episodes of <b>Slimer!</b> {{had little to do}} with the Ghostbusters franchise, simply being about everyday events for <b>Slimer.</b> Interestingly, like in the first film, he still haunts the Sedgewick Hotel, visiting it in many episodes as a visiting pest.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the first}} film, <b>Slimer</b> appears to lack intelligence, only caring about gaining food to eat. In the second movie, <b>Slimer</b> appears more intelligent, and could drive a bus. <b>Slimer</b> {{is shown to}} be caring in The Real Ghostbusters, showing {{compassion}} from Ray Stantz, and kissing Janine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slimer</b> wasn't {{always a}} {{definite}} {{part of the}} Ghostbusters II script. It {{was a matter of}} considerable debate if he should appear at all. Slimer's appeal, luckily, was very universal among children {{thanks in part to the}} first movie and The Real Ghostbusters. <b>Slimer</b> was given a subplot and written into movie - <b>Slimer</b> would eat various foods in the Firehouse while Louis Tully would try to trap him then they would become friends. Michael Gross requested elements of the animated version of <b>Slimer</b> to be incorporated into the movie. Tim Lawrence and Thom Enriquez worked on a new design. Meanwhile, Bobby Porter was called into portray <b>Slimer.</b> Some of the technology and techniques used for Nunzio Scoleri were used for <b>Slimer</b> - the divided head construct, pneumatic jaws, SNARK and a fat suit - a departure from the first movie where he was hand puppeteered. Then <b>Slimer</b> was removed from the script. Porter was released.|$|R
5|$|The <b>slime</b> glands {{along the}} body of the hagfish secrete {{enormous}} amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous <b>slime</b> has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of slimes found throughout the Dragon Quest and Rocket <b>Slime</b> series. These include slimes in different colors, bubble slimes, which look like pools of <b>slime,</b> nautical slimes that wear conch shells, the rare metal slimes, which have high defense, give out large amounts of experience points, and tend to flee from battle, healslimes, which have tentacles, and king slimes, which are very large slimes wearing crowns and come in various versions, such as regular or metal.|$|E
5|$|Storks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills and ibises use to clean off fish <b>slime.</b> Storks lack a pharynx and are mute.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Slimer</b> {{appears in}} the 2016 film Ghostbusters: Answer the Call, voiced by Adam Ray. After Rowan North unleashes an army of ghosts upon New York City, the Ghostbusters see a green glow coming from a hot dog stand, and find <b>Slimer</b> inside. <b>Slimer</b> {{promptly}} hijacks the Ecto-1 and rides off. The Ghostbusters are unable to stop him. <b>Slimer</b> is later seen driving the Ecto-1 around New York City {{and several of his}} ghostly friends. While the original <b>Slimer</b> was created as an androgynous blob with no gender defining characteristics, Ghostbusters: Answer the Call introduces a female <b>Slimer</b> character with red lipstick and a bow tie in its blonde hair. The Ghostbusters later cause both Slimers to crash the Ecto-1 into the portal to cause [...] "Total Protonic Reversal" [...] and close the portal.|$|R
50|$|Again {{voiced by}} Ivan Reitman, and {{now known as}} <b>Slimer</b> (after the events of The Real Ghostbusters), <b>Slimer</b> first appears in Ghostbusters II when Louis Tully caught <b>Slimer</b> eating his lunch, to which {{the two of them}} fled in fear from one another. In a deleted scene set between the scene with Dana's bathtub and the scene with Dana and Venkman going out for dinner (mentioned in the novelization), Louis {{attempts}} to catch <b>Slimer</b> using a Proton Pack.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth season in 1988, the show was retitled to <b>Slimer!</b> and the Real Ghostbusters. It aired in a one-hour time slot, which the show began doing under its {{original}} name earlier that same year in January. In addition to the regular thirty-minute Real Ghostbusters episode, a half-hour <b>Slimer</b> sub-series was added that included 2-3 short animated segments focusing on the character <b>Slimer.</b> Animation for the <b>Slimer!</b> cartoons was handled by Wang Film Productions. At the end of its seven-season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of <b>Slimer,</b> with multiple episodes airing out of production order.|$|R
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. <b>Slime</b> molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor <b>slime</b> molds {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E
5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating <b>slime</b> mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} <b>slime</b> mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2007, Anderson {{appeared}} on Tom Green Live! in character. He also {{appeared on}} <b>Slime</b> Across the UK & Ireland in character on August 15. During {{the week of}} November 5, he appeared as Mr. Kennedy on five episodes of Family Feud with several other WWE wrestlers.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Ghostbusters, <b>Slimer</b> stayed with Egon Spengler as he watched over the Containment Unit in the Ghostbusters Firehouse. In 1997, when there was a sudden surge in supernatural activity, <b>Slimer</b> flew to Egon's class to inform him of the bad news. After the formation of the [...] "Extreme Ghostbusters", <b>Slimer</b> joined them in their cases.|$|R
50|$|At one point, <b>Slimer</b> was recaptured {{and kept}} in a Paranormal Containment Research Tank in the Firehouse in the lobby. Egon Spengler {{is said to have}} used him for various paranormal studies (a nod to the take on <b>Slimer</b> in The Real Ghostbusters). On Thanksgiving weekend 1991, <b>Slimer</b> was playing with Peter Venkman's ESP cards inside the Paranormal Containment Research Tank.|$|R
50|$|The {{main source}} of {{tellurium}} is from copper anode <b>slimes,</b> which contain precious metals as well as various tellurides. These <b>slimes</b> are roasted with sodium carbonate and oxygen to produce sodium tellurite.|$|R
5|$|Storks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills and ibises use to clean off fish <b>slime.</b> Storks lack a pharynx and are mute. One species has been {{recorded}} in Maryland.|$|E

50|$|<b>Slimer</b> had an {{antagonist}} named Professor Norman Dweeb, an archetypical mad scientist usually {{accompanied by}} a sidekick pink poodle named Elizabeth. Dweeb wants to capture <b>Slimer</b> to experiment on him and to gain personal glory. Dweeb also made three appearances in the main series, one a clip show from the last two seasons. Other enemies of <b>Slimer</b> include an alley cat named Manx, a dog named Bruiser, a tough woman named Mrs. Stone, and the ghost gangsters Goolem and Zugg {{as well as their}} boss Scareface. One of the ghosts from the <b>Slimer</b> cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in The Real Ghostbusters to be captured a second time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slimer</b> is a {{character}} from the Ghostbusters franchise. He appears in the films Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989) and Ghostbusters: Answer the Call (2016), in the animated television series The Real Ghostbusters, <b>Slimer!</b> and Extreme Ghostbusters, and in the video games Ghostbusters: The Video Game and Beeline's Ghostbusters. <b>Slimer</b> was voiced by Ivan Reitman and Adam Ray in the films and by Frank Welker in the cartoon series. In The Real Ghostbusters, he is the Ghostbusters' mascot.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slimer</b> {{was given}} {{personal}} {{enemies in the}} show, such as an eccentric scientist named Professor Dweeb who wanted to capture <b>Slimer</b> in order to study him, an alley cat named Manx, a dog named Bruiser, and two ghosts named Goolem and Zugg.|$|R
5|$|The cap cuticle has a {{width of}} 250 to 450µm and {{consists}} of loopshaped, dark hyphae with a width from 2 to 3µm, which form an ixocutis (a horizontal layer of hyphae embedded in <b>slime)</b> and possess clamp connections; the fungus has no hypocutis. The gill trama consists of hyphae about 3 to 8µm thick; the cap tissue comprises radial hyphae.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} starfish {{consists}} mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish {{often with a}} global distribution. The shape is pentagonal or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. They mostly have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often spiny pedicellariae. This group includes the <b>slime</b> star.|$|E
5|$|Ward helps Quatermass and Fowler gain {{entry to}} the plant and they find that Dillon has been {{discharged}} from the infirmary and has left. They then look around and discover that gases are pumped to the giant pressure domes from the pilot plant: ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, as opposed to oxygen as in Quatermass' moonbase pressure dome idea. Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away to look inside a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black <b>slime,</b> which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the <b>slime</b> is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E
5000|$|Ray Stantz took a {{liking to}} the ghost and named him [...] "Slimer" [...] to annoy Venkman. When the Ghostbusters were {{attacked}} by their ghostly doppelgangers, <b>Slimer</b> distracted the entities long {{enough for them to}} be drained of their energy. The Ghostbusters were then able to overpower and trap them. The Ghostbusters agreed to adopt <b>Slimer</b> from then on. For an official statement to the press given by Venkman, <b>Slimer</b> is allowed to freely roam for [...] "scientific research being conducted".|$|R
5000|$|During the {{pre-production}} of Ghostbusters, Ivan Reitman remarked <b>Slimer</b> {{was sort}} of like Bluto in the film Animal House, like the ghost of John Belushi. Since then, <b>Slimer</b> has been described as [...] "The Ghost of John Belushi" [...] by Dan Aykroyd in many interviews.|$|R
50|$|Dailey's career {{started at}} the age of 16. His band, <b>Slimer,</b> were signed to Cargo Records and put on the line up for Warped tour ‘99. The deal with Cargo came into place after Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 noticed the band as they opened a show in ‘97. Already a member of local punk bands, Dailey played his first show at 14 opening for The Queers. <b>Slimer,</b> disbanded after the tour to attend college. <b>Slimer</b> {{featured}} now well known hip-hop/reggae producer, Yeti Beats, on vocals.|$|R
