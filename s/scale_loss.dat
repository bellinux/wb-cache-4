25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise <b>scale</b> <b>loss,</b> and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E

50|$|Overall {{there is}} no need to protect or set aside {{conservation}} easements for the bigmouth buffalo, it seems to be a very well adapted species to its range and maintains its population well naturally. However it would be good to have a proper estimate on the abundance of species across its native range and monitored in order to catch any beginning of decline quickly to take action. Since the bigmouth is a foodfish it is easy to look at the commercial catching as a way to sample the population. It is shown that knotted nets can harm the fish causing hemorrhages and <b>scale</b> <b>loss</b> which would not be conducive to having little impact on the species while sampling. It would be ideal to seine for the bigmouth through oxbows and other regions of their range. This should be done in multiple locations in the Lake Erie, Ohio River, Mississippi River, Tennessee River, Milk River, Los Angeles aqueducts and Missouri River reservoirs where the fish are known to be caught. The species should be netted, sized, counted, and released. If the funding was available it would be good to tag the small ones for future population estimates.|$|E

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1990, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) {{initiated}} {{testing of a prototype}} inclined penstock screen installed in a 9 -foot diameter penstock at the Elwha Hydroelectric Project in Washington State. Results from the first series of tests showed that the screen effectively diverted coho smolts from the penstock with minimal injury. If results of future tests with other species are successful, the design concept has significant potential for application at other hydroelectric projects. The compact nature of the screen, which is designed to function at relatively high water velocities, is particularly suitable for retrofitting at projects where space limitations preclude installation of conventional screening systems. In the first series of tests conducted at the facility, over 99 percent of the coho smolts were diverted without mortality.

5000|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{destruction}} can occur both naturally and through anthropogenic causes. Events leading to natural habitat loss include climate change, catastrophic {{events such as}} volcanic explosions and through the interactions of invasive and non-invasive species. Natural climate change, events have previously been the cause of many widespread and large <b>scale</b> <b>losses</b> in habitat. For example, some of the mass extinction events generally {{referred to as the}} [...] "Big Five" [...] have coincided with large scale such as the Earth entering an ice age, or alternate warming events. Other events in the big five also have their roots in natural causes, such as volcanic explosions and meteor collisions. The Chicxulub impact is one such example, which has previously caused widespread losses in habitat as the Earth either received less sunlight or grew colder, causing certain fauna and flora to flourish whilst others perished. Previously known warm areas in the tropics, the most sensitive habitats on Earth, grew colder, and areas such as Australia developed radically different flora and fauna to those seen today. The big five mass extinction events have also been linked to sea level changes, indicating that large <b>scale</b> marine species <b>loss</b> was strongly influenced by loss in marine habitats, particularly shelf habitats. Methane-driven oceanic eruptions have also been shown to have caused smaller mass extinction events.|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{catchment}} <b>scale</b> soil <b>loss</b> {{based on}} rainfall simulators is often {{hampered by the}} difficulty to scale up simulator results. Our objective was to develop and test a method for estimating catchment <b>scale</b> soil <b>loss</b> based on observed rainfall using a variable intensity rainfall simulator in an erosion-sensitive catchment in semiarid Tunisia. A 7 -year period, 1992 - 1999, with observed sedimentation amounts in a downstream reservoir was chosen to test a methodology. The methodology was based on (1) energy adjustment for the used simulator due to the difference in kinetic energy of simulated and natural rainfall at equal intensities and (2) upscaling of simulated erosion in which rill erosion was estimated by adjusting the difference between slope lengths for the plots versus the catchment after onset of runoff. The comparison between calculated soil loss from rainfall simulator experiments and observed sedimentation in the downstream reservoir displayed good overall results. Calculated soil loss {{was found to be}} about 96 %, 36 %, and 80 % for different observed subperiods, respectively. The observed low value for the second period was probably due an exceptionally intense rainfall event during this period, which appears to have led to gully erosion, soil slide, and riverbank collapse. Therefore, during this event, siltation in the reservoir may essentially be due to unaccounted erosion processes such as gully erosion. Overall, however, it appears that plot-scale variable intensity rainfall simulators can rather successfully estimate catchment <b>scale</b> soil <b>losses.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
