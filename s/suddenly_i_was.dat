25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
500|$|Gunn's {{reflections}} on joining Hibernian are tinged with regret: [...] " [...] very difficult indeed. I had spent 12 great years at Norwich and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not {{regarded as the}} number 1 (by Mike Walker) anymore." [...] He joined Hibernian when they were bottom of the Scottish Premier Division; Alex McLeish had recently been appointed manager.|$|E
500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. For me, {{it was like a}} five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the role of trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E
60|$|At all events, when I {{look back}} upon the boy <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> see the {{beginnings}} of a real person who fades little by little as manhood arrives and advances, until <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware that a stranger has taken his place....|$|R

6000|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{aware of}} the q-b darting past me like a storm. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> see her pouncing on three giggling young hussies just in front--the {{inevitable}} black velveteen tam, the inevitable white curly muffler, the inevitable lower-class flappers. [...] "Did you want something? Have you something to say? Is there something that amuses you? Oh-h! You must laugh, must you? Oh--laugh! Oh-h! Why? Why? You ask why? Haven't I heard you! Oh--you spik Ingleesh! You spik Ingleesh! Yes--why! That's why! Yes, that's why." ...|$|R
500|$|From 2006 to 2008, M.I.A. {{lived in}} the Bedford-Stuyvesant {{neighbourhood}} of Brooklyn, New York, where she met Benjamin Bronfman (a.k.a. Benjamin Brewer), an environmentalist, founder of Green Owl, musician {{and member of the}} Bronfman family and Lehman family. They became engaged and she gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on 13 February 2009, just three days after performing at the Grammy Awards. In February 2012, it was announced that she and Bronfman had split. In a 2013 interview with Ferrari Sheppard, M.I.A. commented on her relationship with Bronfman and his family's wealth: [...] "I think it’s weird. It’s not that I got with Ben and then <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a billionaire. You know? I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it’s interesting that it is more about the concepts of, again, elitism and power. Who Ben is on paper sounds way more powerful than who I am because of where he comes from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daryl Braithwaite and {{his twin}} brother, Glenn, were born on 11 January 1949 {{and raised in}} a working class family in Melbourne. His father, a plumber, worked on the Snowy Mountains Scheme in the mid-1950s. Braithwaite {{attended}} Punt Road Primary School in South Yarra, then Christ Church Grammar, where the twins sang in the school choir. He later said, [...] "I will always recall the horror of my first solo in the choir singing 'Once in Royal David's City' when the choir master, Leonard Fullard, gave me a note and then <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on my own. It was terrifying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Posing as {{a married}} couple, Argüello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having {{passed through a}} {{security}} check of their luggage—and were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess {{and she was going to}} catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Appleby {{felt that}} the keen blue eyes were quietly scrutinizing him. “No,” he said. “There <b>is</b> a fact <b>I</b> must mention which I also think would prevent you wishing to {{entertain}} me. A business man hiring anybody would have questions to ask, and I left the old country <b>suddenly.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not sure that a charge of manslaughter has not been brought against me by this time.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>suddenly,</b> while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> half-running half-walking {{along the}} highway, dreaming no evil, came {{a voice from}} the thicket on my right, shouting: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{not taken}} me <b>suddenly.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> raging {{inwardly}} {{for the last six}} months. But just now this seemed a good place to flare out. It's so quiet, and we are alone." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{attracted}} by Bartleby's closed desk, {{the key in}} open sight left in the lock.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a {{thing of}} bestial fury, {{standing}} up with hands held up and clenched, rigid in gesture of impotent threatening, against the sky. [...] .|$|E
60|$|I was {{for going}} on, {{and after a}} little {{hesitation}} he resumed his spade; and then <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he at once.|$|E
60|$|She {{started to}} walk to where <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> seen she <b>was</b> limping. So <b>I</b> gave her a hand down to my room, and set her on a chair.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{his voice}} made me <b>suddenly</b> sad. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> comforted when <b>I</b> felt the Story Girl slip her hand into mine. So we {{walked out of the}} woods into the autumn dusk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] the lad said saluting. [...] "I am {{a little}} stiff, and it hurts me if <b>I</b> move <b>suddenly,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> should not feel it if we were engaged again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{want to say}} {{at present}} is this: I need help. I have come to that--I came upon you <b>suddenly.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wandering, mad with rage, naked, impotent. I could have murdered. And I saw you--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{filled with}} the thought of her and a great longing for her. What would she do when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? What would she do? How would she take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|E
60|$|I walked there, then, {{one morning}} quite {{early on the}} upper terrace {{immediately}} under the castle wall, and alternately I read from the De Civitate Dei which I had brought with me, alternately mused upon the matter of my reading. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> disturbed by a sound of voices just below me.|$|E
60|$|Mine was a milder and slighter experience, but its thrill was of {{the same}} kind. For I strolled through a place I had {{imagined}} quite virgin and unvisited (as far as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned), and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> found <b>I</b> <b>was</b> treading in my own footprints, and the footprints were nearly twenty years old.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me--pardon me, Senor," [...] {{said the}} priest, hastily sinking back upon his bench, [...] "I was {{thinking}} of other things. You--you--came upon me <b>suddenly.</b> <b>I</b> thought it <b>was</b> the acolyte. Go on, Senor! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> interested." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> able now {{to see him}} well. As a rule he was neat in his person, but now {{his clothes}} were in disorder. He looked <b>suddenly</b> bedraggled. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{convinced}} he had <b>been</b> drinking, and <b>I</b> smiled. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{on the point of}} chaffing him on his state.|$|R
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on my feet, {{every sense}} alert, staring. In the moonlight, made milky by the haze, he was indistinct. And yet I {{could have taken}} oath that the square, {{diminutive}} figure, with the head set forward on the shoulders, was Gignoux's. If this man were not Gignoux, then the Lord had cast two in a strange mould.|$|E
60|$|And then, quite <b>suddenly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{startled by}} a human cry--a piteous, wailing cry that told of {{helplessness}} and pain. I went forward more {{quickly in the}} direction whence it came, rounded a stout hazel coppice, and stood suddenly before a rude hut of pine logs built {{against the side of}} the rock. Through a small unglazed window came a feeble shaft of light.|$|E
60|$|We {{remained}} there stretched out at full length on the ground, with {{no possibility of}} gaining information which might be of service {{to us in the}} future, ten minutes or more, and then, <b>suddenly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to exert all my will-power to prevent a scream of fear from escaping my lips, for what was unmistakably a human foot had been planted directly upon my leg.|$|E
5000|$|In a statement, Wells {{admitted}} swerving, {{saying she}} was reaching for her car heater controls. Wells lost a speaking engagement because of the incident. Later, Wells said, [...] "I think it is so hysterical that people went nuts over it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> what, now, 102 years old? I get booked {{for the first time}} in my life and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a drug-using bum? I have told people the facts, but facts don't interest people or the media. They only trust headlines. The only reason <b>I</b> even cared <b>was</b> because it negatively affected my film festival and film school, and my sponsors <b>were</b> concerned. If <b>I</b> did not own a not-for-profit school, <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> on Saturday Night Live making fun of it!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1972, the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Eduard Prchal, {{described}} the events: [...] "I received {{the green light}} from the tower and we began our take-off run. I pulled the stick back and the aircraft started to climb. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at 150ft <b>I</b> pushed the controls of the aircraft forward to gain speed. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> discovered <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not able to pull the stick back. The steering mechanism was jammed or locked." [...] The aircraft then lost height rapidly. Prchal closed the four throttles and warned the others through the intercom [...] "Attention, crash". The aircraft crashed into the sea.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{left him}} <b>suddenly.</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{producing}} a bad impression, but with my double down {{there it was}} most trying to be on deck. And {{it was almost as}} trying to be below. Altogether a nerve-trying situation. But on the whole I felt less torn in two when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> with him. There was no one in the whole ship whom I dared take into my confidence. Since the hands had got to know his story, it would have been impossible to pass him off for anyone else, and an accidental discovery was to be dreaded now more than ever....|$|R
6000|$|Finding {{that we had}} a {{day before}} us, we {{explored}} the queer old town, and, as our tastes varied, each went a different way. I roamed about the narrow streets, seeking some odd souvenir to carry away, and was peering into a dark lane, attracted by some fine shells, when <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> arrested by a sight which caused me to pause {{in the middle of a}} puddle, exclaiming dramatically, [...] "At last! at last!" ...|$|E
60|$|When, on that day, I shuffled shyly {{into this}} homely place, and, {{thinking}} myself alone there, fell to examining it, <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to a}} standstill by a curious choking sound which seemed to proceed from the shadows behind the bookcase. Wondering as to its cause, I advanced cautiously to discover a pink-clad shape standing in the corner like a naughty child, with her head resting against the wall, and sobbing slowly.|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{answered}} a little vaguely. He had some calls to make, {{and he was}} not altogether sure. I left him in a few minutes and descended to the street. I turned westward and walked for some little distance, when <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> attracted by the sight of a familiar figure issuing from the door of a large, gray stone house. We came face to face upon the pavement. It was the man whose life I had probably saved only a few hours ago.|$|E
6000|$|Then for {{the first}} time my heart smote me for what I had done; for the passionate desire of life was alight in his eyes. What right had I to make him share my fate? My deep joy <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> numbed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a murderess! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I came on them <b>suddenly,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> chasing deer, {{and almost}} ran into their camp; but I saw, {{and fell in}} the grass. I thought the chief raised his head quickly when I fell; but he looked down again, and I crawled away." ...|$|R
6000|$|I nodded, {{and turned}} away for the lift. The {{cigarette}} between my lips <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> tasteless. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> experiencing a new sensation, and distinctly an unpleasant one. With it was coupled an intense curiosity to know {{the identity of the}} man who was even now with Felicia! ...|$|R
