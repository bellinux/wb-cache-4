25|$|The manorial records offer a good {{opportunity}} to study the geographical distribution of the plague. Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England, though a place like East Anglia, which had frequent contact with the Continent, was severely affected. On a local level, however, there were great variations. A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population. The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality, since the rolls only record the heads of households, normally an adult male. Here the IPMs <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly.|$|E

2500|$|Because many {{of these}} plurals do not end in -s, {{some of them have}} been reinterpreted as {{singular}} forms: particularly the words datum and medium (as in a [...] "medium of communication"), where the original plurals data and media are now, in many contexts, used by some as singular mass nouns: [...] "The media is biased"; [...] "This data shows us that ..." [...] (although a number of scientists, especially of British origin, still say [...] "These data <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> ..."). See below for more information.
