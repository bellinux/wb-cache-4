Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goals of this research were {{to gain a better understanding}} of the performance of ring-shank (annularly threaded) nails in lateral connections common to the post-frame industry, and to evaluate the European yield model (EYM), the basis for derivation of allowable design values, for ring-shank nails. Inputs to the EYM include nail bending yield strength, dowel bearing strength, and connection geometry. These parameters as well as single-shear connection strength were determined for nine nail groups tested in Southern Pine lumber. Nail specimens included three suppliers, two <b>shank</b> <b>types</b> (smooth and ringshank), two diameters (3. 76 and 4. 50 mm), and two coatings (galvanized and ungalvanized). Ring-shank nails averaged 85 % higher nail bending yield strength than the common nails for all but two groups. A regression model relating dowel bearing strength to specific gravity was developed based on tests with the nine nail groups loaded parallel-to-grain in Southern Pine. A statistically significant reduction in dowel bearing strength was observed for 4. 50 compared to 3. 76 mm diameter nails. While ring-shank nail connection maximum loads were roughly twice that of common nails for the same diameter, no significant differences were observed for yield loads. The current yield load definition is based on the slope of the initial portion of the load-displacement curve and does not adequately account for increases in connection strength resulting from higher steel quality. As a result, predicted yield loads based on the EYM were significantly higher than observed yield loads. A revised yield load definition is needed which includes yielding predicted by the EYM without including factors extraneous to the model. Ring-shank nails exhibited significantly higher lateral connection strengths than the common nails tested as a result of increased steel strength and gripping action of the threads. Finally, standardization in ringshank nail manufacturing must be instituted to ensure minimum steel and thread quality, before any increase in design values for ring-shank nails is implemented...|$|R

40|$|O Sistema Plantio Direto {{consiste}} no conjunto de técnicas que associam preservação dos recursos naturais, aliadas à mínima mobilização do solo. O desempenho da semeadora-adubadora está diretamente ligado aos mecanismos de contato com o solo, mais especificamente, as hastes sulcadoras. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a mobilização do solo, o desempenho operacional e o desenvolvimento da cultura do milho, quando semeado com dois tipos de hastes sulcadoras em três profundidades de semeadura. O experimento foi conduzido no ano agrícola de 2011 / 12 em área experimental da Fazenda de Ensino, Pesquisa e Extensão da UNESP/Jaboticabal em LATOSSOLO VERMELHO Eutroférrico típico. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos casualizados, esquema fatorial 2 x 3, com quatro repetições. As variáveis analisadas foram: área mobilizada, desempenho operacional e características agronômicas da cultura. A área mobilizada houve significância para os fatores haste e profundidade. O comportamento distinto das hastes é devido a seus parâmetros construtivos, sendo fator limitante para profundidade de trabalho, pois, determina o volume de solo mobilizado. No desempenho operacional do conjunto trator semeadora-adubadora houve diferença tanto para haste como profundidade. Desta forma opta-se pela haste que teve uma maior mobilização do solo e exigiu menor força e potência na barra de tração, trabalhando a menor profundidade desde que o solo esteja em condições adequadas de semeadura, um vez que não houve diferença na produtividade final de grãosThe no-tillage {{system is}} a set of techniques that combine natural resources preservation combined with minimum soil tillage. The seeder performance is directly linked to the mechanisms in contact with the soil, more specifically the planter shanks. This paper had as objective to evaluate the soil mobilization, operational performance and development of the corn crop when sown with two <b>shank</b> <b>types</b> furrow openers in three sowing depths. the operating performace of the tractor-seeder, soil tillage and agronomic characteristics of maize, working with two <b>types</b> of planter <b>shanks</b> fertilizer and three depths of operation. The experiment was conducted in the agricultural year 2011 / 12 at the experimental area the farm of teaching, research and extension UNESP/Jaboticabal on Eutrudox. The experimental design was completely randomized, 2 x 3 factorial with four replicates. The variables analyzed were mobilized area, operating performace and agronomic characteristics culture. The area mobilized indicated significant factors and depth shank. Results showed no interaction between <b>types</b> of <b>shank</b> and depth factors, however the mobilized area showed different behavior for shank factor because of this construction parameters, been a limiting factor for depth of work, thus determines the volume of mobilized soil. Operating performance of the tractor seeder was no difference for both shank as depth. Thus opts for shank had a greater mobilization of soil and required less force and power to the drawbar, working the shallowest depth where the ground conditions are suitable for sowing, one time {{there was no difference in}} the final yield of grain...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustic emission transferability method in applications of valve leakage rate detection and tool wear monitoring. The method aims {{to transfer the}} information between AE inspection systems using different types of sensor and position by relationship which was called a transfer function. The spectrum density function/AErms spectra of both wide band (WD) and resonance (R 15 and R 30) AE sensors were studied. The results demonstrate a very good similarity transfer function in various conditions. Three sets of cutting condition of tool wear monitoring in machining tests were conducted. A tool <b>shank</b> of <b>type</b> SDJCL 1616 H 11 and carbide tool inserts of type CG 4035 DCMT 11 T 3 04 -UF (Sandvik Coromant) were used. Two AE sensors were mounted on the tool-holder: a WD sensor (PAC) {{at the end of}} the tool-holder and an R 30 sensor (PAC) on the side. For valve leakage rate detection, artificial leaks from incomplete closure of ball valve are used to simulate the leakage. The tests were conduced by varying inlet pressure from 1 to 5 bars in three valve sizes of 1, 2 and 3 inches respectively. The AE signals detected at the two sensors (WD and R 15) were analyzed in real-time using a Hewlett Packard HP 89410 A. Transfer functions of two AE sensors are calculated and represented by the ratio of frequency responses of the two sensors. This is particularly useful since the information obtained from one sensor may be converted into another without having to repeat the experiments. With the proposed acoustic transferability, it will be possible to make comparison between results obtained from different set-ups...|$|R
40|$|Characterizing local chicken {{types and}} their mostly rural {{production}} systems is prerequisite for designing and implementing development and conservation programs. This study evaluated the management practices of small-scale chicken keepers and the phenotypic and production traits of their chickens in Oman, where conservation programs for local livestock breeds have currently started. Free-range scavenging was the dominant production system, and {{logistic regression analysis}} showed that socio-economic factors such as training in poultry keeping, household income, income from farming and gender of chicken owners influenced feeding, housing, and health care practices (p< 0. 05). A large variation in plumage and <b>shank</b> colors, comb <b>types</b> and other phenotypic traits within and between Omani chicken populations were observed. Male and female body weight differed (p< 0. 05), being 1. 3 ± 0. 65 kg and 1. 1 ± 0. 86 kg respectively. Flock size averaged 22 ± 7. 7 birds per household with 4. 8 hens per cock. Clutch size was 12. 3 ± 2. 85 and annual production 64. 5 ± 2. 85 eggs per hen. Egg hatchability averaged 88 ± 6. 0 % and annual chicken mortality across all age and sex categories was 16 ± 1. 4 %. The strong involvement of women in chicken keeping makes them key stakeholders in future development and conservation programs, but the latter should be preceded by a comprehensive study of the genetic diversity of the Omani chicken populations...|$|R
