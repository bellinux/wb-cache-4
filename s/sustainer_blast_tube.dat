50|$|An {{oil burner}} is a heating device which burns #1, #2 and #6 heating oils, diesel fuel or other similar fuels.

5000|$|The end of {{the barrel}} was threaded, and this thread was used to screw on a blast-reduction tube of a length that {{depended}} on the installation requirements: One of the outstanding features of this weapon is the method of solving <b>blast</b> <b>tube</b> difficulties, a troublesome problem in all installations of aircraft cannon in fighter aircraft. The Soviets' simple solution was to thread the {{end of the}}ir standard barrel and then screw on for whatever length was needed a heavy piece of tubing, the bore diameter of which was slightly greater than that of the rotating band of the projectile. This arrangement allowed the blast and gas to leak around the projectile before it cleared the tube, not only reducing the blast effect of the weapon but also by its added length safely leading the blast and projectile past portions of the plane that would otherwise have been injured.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of shock}} waves in long shock tubes is well known; however, there is scarcely {{any information on}} the behaviour of blast waves in long <b>blast</b> <b>tubes.</b> To obtain some more information, a blast simulator with a cross-section area of 432 cm 2 and a length of 20 m has been constructed in the Ernst-Mach-Institut.

40|$|Blast-associated shock wave-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) remains a persistent risk for armed forces worldwide, yet its detailed pathophysiology remains to be fully investigat-ed. In this study, we have designed and characterized a laboratory-scale shock tube to de-velop a rodent model of bTBI.

50|$|Problems {{with the}} Brigand became {{apparent}} during its operations in Malaya, with undercarriages failing to lower. This was traced to rubber seals in the hydraulic jacks deteriorating in the hot, humid climate. Just as this problem was being resolved another problem arose, more serious because {{it led to}} fatalities; a propensity for aircraft damage and loss, during strafing runs employing the four 20 mm cannon. An accumulation of gases in the long cannon <b>blast</b> <b>tubes,</b> which ran under the cockpit, were igniting through use of high-explosive shells. This in turn severed hydraulic lines, which would burn, so that in effect the Brigands were shooting themselves down. This was cured by drastically reducing ammunition loads and using only ball rounds. The Brigand also had a propensity to shed one propeller blade leading to complete propeller failure, which in turn {{would lead to the}} engine being wrenched off the wing and an inevitable crash. This was found to be caused by corrosion in the propeller locking rings. More frequent maintenance helped alleviate this problem.|$|R
40|$|Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) {{induced by}} blast waves from detonations {{provides}} huge diagnostic problems. It may {{be assumed that}} several mechanisms contribute to the injury. Thus, the primary blast overpressure, acceleration movements, focal impacts as well as heating could contribute to the injury. In a number of experiments we have evaluated the injuries induced by these mechanisms. Our experimental models include a <b>blast</b> <b>tube</b> in which an anesthetized rat can be exposed to controlled detonations of PETN explosives that result in a pressure wave with a magnitude between 130 and 600 kPa. In this model, the animal is fixed with a metal net to avoid head acceleration forces. The pressure wave is of simple Friedländer type, {{with a duration of}} less than 0. 5 ms. Animals that are exposed side on suffer from lethal bleedings from the lungs if the peak pressure exceeds 300 kPa. In recent experiments we have mounted animals in a rigid metallic body protection that covers all parts of the body except for the head, which rests on a bar that prevents from acceleration movements. With this protection the animals survive 600 kPa. The second model is a controlled penetration of a 2 mm thick needle, which is assumed to represent the focal impact of fragments. In the third model the animal is subjected to a high-speed sagittal rotation angular acceleration. This model is assumed to be relevant for rapid acceleration movements that can occur after explosions. Immunohistochemical labeling for amyloid precursor protein revealed signs of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the penetration and rotation models. Signs of punctuate inflammation were observed after focal and rotation injury. Exposure in the <b>blast</b> <b>tube</b> did not induce DAI or detectable cell death, but functional changes. Affymetrix Gene arrays showed changes in the expression in a large number of gene families including cell death, inflammation and neurotransmittors in the hippocampus after both acceleration and penetration injuries. Exposure to primary blast wave induced limited shifts in gene expression in the hippocampus. The most interesting findings were a down regulation of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. These experiments indicate that rotational acceleration may be a critical factor for DAI and other acute changes after blast TBI. The further exploration of the mechanisms of blast TBI will have to include a search for long-term effects. Detailed studies on the anxiety related pathways from the brainstem represent an important part these continued studies...|$|R

The installations tested appear to have little effect on the maximum-lift coefficient of the model. However, the drag coefficient shows a definite change.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a common}} cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity among civilians and servicemen alike. The spectrum of TBIs encompasses mild to severe cases, with the predominate number of TBIs being mild (mTBI). Combat-related TBI inflicted by explosive blast (bTBI) is highly prevalent among military personnel. The injurious environment caused by explosive blast includes the high-energy shock wave that dissipates energy at the boundaries of anatomical structures with distinct acoustical impedance, and the blast wind that can propel the body resulting in acceleration/ deceleration type of injury. mTBI can also occur in the civilian population often {{as a result of}} contact sports and because of the mild acute symptoms it is often repeated. mTBI causes transient mood and cognitive changes, but it may also increase the risk for late onset chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Little is known about the mechanism of mTBI and its post-sequelae. Monoamine projections from the brainstem {{play a key role in}} modulating the forebrain regions, and galanin, a neuropeptide that, in the rat, is co-localised with two of these key neurotransmitters. Dysfunctions in these systems have been associated with mood/anxiety disorders. In this thesis we set out to examine changes in the monoamine and galanin systems following single and repeated blast exposure, in male and female rats. mTBI was induced using an experimental <b>blast</b> <b>tube</b> which uses real explosives. For one of the studies a shock tube that uses compressed air was also used to produce a blast-induced mTBI (mbTBI). The models appeared to cause mbTBI, given that no injury was observed when staining for degeneration, blood vessel damage, or disruption to the white matter tracts in either model, following single or repeated exposure. The noradrenaline (NA) system was found to be particularly sensitive to mbTBI. The transcript levels of the biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were found elevated immediately post-exposure bilaterally in the locus coeruleus (LC) in both males and females. This was concurrent with a transient increase in NA levels in a number of forebrain regions, and translated into decreased immobility in the forced swim test. This was only explored in the males and using the <b>blast</b> <b>tube.</b> Sex-specific differences were found in the serotonin system (5 -HT). Here the transcript levels of the biosynthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH 2), were elevated across the mid/caudal-rostral dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in females. The elevation occurred acutely post-TBI and remained even after day (D) 7, the last time point evaluated. In the males TPH 2 was similarly elevated, but more modestly and only transiently. The increase was limited to only the mid/caudal part of the DRN, and by D 3 TPH 2 levels were similar to levels detected in sham animals. No changes in 5 -HT levels were seen in the forebrain regions of male rats. Exposure induced changes in the expression of galanin and its receptors were also examined by in situ hybridisation but in males only. Galanin mRNA levels increased bilaterally in the LC and gradually in the mid/caudal, but not in the rostral DRN and remained elevated, even at D 7 in both nuclei [...] However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction only confirmed the acute galanin increase in the LC, and in addition revealed galanin transcripts in the hippocampus. In terms of the galanin receptor 1 - 3 (GalR 1 - 3), GalR 1 was increased in the ventral periaqueductal grey and this increase persisted at D 7 post-TBI, at this time-point GalR 2 was decreased. In the forebrain regions GalR 3 appeared to be the most dynamic receptor, decreasing in most regions immediately following TBI, and recovering on D 7 post-exposure, except in the ventral hippocampus, where changes persisted. A cumulative effect of repeated exposure to blast was not apparent in the levels of the transcripts for TH, TPH 2, and galanin using either the <b>blast</b> or shock <b>tube</b> in male rodents. Serum analyses revealed sex-specific differences acutely following a single blast exposure, including an increase in corticosterone and substance P in female and decreased BDNF levels in male exposed rats. Taken together, these findings indicate a role for both the monoamine and the galanin systems following blast exposure, these changes appear robust across models and sexes (although some sex-specific differences are apparent). Hence these systems are possibly mediators of post-TBI sequelae and tartargeting the persistent dysfunctions in these systems may bring about therapeutic benefits...|$|R
40|$|From {{the machine}} guns and air raids of the World Wars to the {{lingering}} effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam, the threats that U. S. troops endure have continually changed with every era of war. No exception to this rule are the conflicts of Afghanistan and Iraq, which are the first in U. S. history to see improvised explosive devices (IEDs) – bombs detonated under artillery vehicles and on crowded streets, sometimes strapped to suicide bombers – as the primary mode of attack waged on U. S. soldiers. Young in their diagnosis but vast in impact, blast injuries from IEDs make up about 80 percent of injuries to U. S. troops returning from Iraq, and have earned the title the signature injury of these wars. The prevalence of injuries from this weapon of choice has elicited an onslaught of questions that researchers are scrambling to answer: What are the long term effects of these close-range, frequent blasts? How do blast waves impact soldiers in artillery vehicles differently than those on foot? And perhaps the most perplexing, how are these blasts causing traumatic brain injury, or TBI, in 10 to 20 percent of returning troops? Wayne State researchers, Dr. Cynthia Bir and Dr. Pamela VandeVord, {{and a team of}} collaborators are working to answer those questions with the project Blast Induced Neurotrauma, an investigation funded by a $ 790, 000 grant from the Office of Naval Research and additional funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

30|$|A {{number of}} past fires, {{for example the}} Channel tunnel fires and the Mont Blanc tunnel fire, show that fires pose {{a serious threat to}} the tunnel structure. There are four main types of tunnel constructions: cut and cover, {{immersed}} <b>tube,</b> drilled and <b>blasted</b> and bored <b>tube</b> tunnels. The dominating construction material is concrete. There are two main classes of concrete for tunnels: low-porosity (high-strength) and high-porosity concrete. For low-porosity concrete (often used in bored and blasted tunnels) the dominant failure process in tunnel fires is spalling, i.e. the explosive delamination of concrete. For high-porosity concrete in immersed and cut-and-cover tunnels the main failure mode is sagging of the roof due to loss of strength and expansion due to heat. Another threat for cut-and-cover and immersed tunnels is that the opposite, unexposed side, cracks. Measures to protect the tunnel integrity are, for low- and high-porosity concrete tunnels, either focused on withstanding fire exposure (fireproof concrete or insulation) or on fire suppression (Carvel 2005; Carvel and Both 2012).|$|R

This hypothesis was addressed in five specific aims: 1) develop a <b>blast</b> shock <b>tube</b> instrument and impact instrument to deliver relevant blast-exposure and impact-injury to mice, 2) validate a mouse model of single blast-exposure that recapitulates brain pathology in blast-exposed military veterans diagnosed with CTE, 3) validate a mouse model of single-repeat closed-head impact-injury that recapitulates brain pathology in contact sport athletes diagnosed with CTE, 4) match kinematics of blast and impact models using high-speed videography, 5) deploy kinematically-matched mouse models of single blast-exposure and single-repeat closed-head impact-injury to investigate mechanisms that trigger experimental concussion and post-traumatic sequelae. Blast and impact injuries were shown to cause similar CTE-linked brain pathologies, including microvasculopathy, neuroinflammation, astrogliosis, and phosphorylated tauopathy. Despite similarities in chronic consequences, blast-exposure and impact-injury produced different acute neurological responses. Surprisingly, impact-injured mice demonstrated signs of experimental concussion, whereas blast-exposed mice with comparable head kinematics did not. Computational modeling indicated that point loading of forces during impact, as opposed to distributed loading in blast, caused ipsilateral spikes in cortical shear stress which we conclude to be responsible for experimental concussion. The blast-exposure and impact-injury models have been {{and will continue to be}} invaluable tools for elucidating the mechanisms of and relationships between concussion, TBI, and CTE. 2019 - 07 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} response of thin plates, made of Docol 600 DL steel and the aluminium alloy EN-AW- 1050 A-H 14, subjected to blast loading. The intention was also to validate the use of the shock tube facility at SIMLab at NTNU, and to recreate the experiments by using non-linear FE numerical simulations. The material parameters were obtained by performing tensile tests of the two materials. An accurate material description was obtained by applying an inverse modelling method. To verify the pressure distribution in the shock <b>tube,</b> <b>blast</b> experiments were conducted and the exact pressures applied to the plate were measured. The results displayed a uniform pressure distribution subjected to the plate. After calibrating the pressure, component experiments were used to determine the structural response of the steel and aluminium plates. Different analytical techniques were used in order to predict the structural response of the plates. Due to a dynamic blast loading, idealizations and analytical solutions proved to be too inaccurate. Numerical non-linear finite element simulations had to be introduced in order to solve the plate problem. The finite element program Abaqus CAE was used to provide a simple numerical model of the plates. The implemented blast loads were based on the Friedlander equation. Although several simplifications were made {{in the design of the}} plates, the numerical model provided efficient results with adequate accuracy. A parameter study was performed in order to investigate how different parameters in the numerical model influenced the response of the plate. The reflected peak pressure and the thickness of the plate proved to affect the structural response the most...|$|R
40|$|The loading {{conditions}} {{used in some}} current in vivo and in vitro blast-induced neurotrauma models may not be representative of real-world blast conditions. To address these limitations, we developed a compressed-gas driven shock tube with different driven lengths that can generate Friedlander-type <b>blasts.</b> The shock <b>tube</b> can generate overpressures up to 650 [*]kPa with durations between 0. 3 and 1. 1 [*]ms using compressed helium driver gas, and peak overpressures up to 450 [*]kPa with durations between 0. 6 and 3 [*]ms using compressed nitrogen. This device is used for short-duration blast overpressure loading for small animal in vivo injury models, and contrasts the more frequently used long duration/high impulse blast overpressures in the literature. We also developed a new apparatus that is used with the shock tube to recreate the in vivo intracranial overpressure response for loading in vitro culture preparations. The receiver device surrounds the culture with materials of similar impedance to facilitate the propagation of a single overpressure pulse through the tissue. This method prevents pressure waves reflecting off the tissue that can cause unrealistic deformation and injury. The receiver performance was characterized using the longest helium-driven shock tube, and produced in-fluid overpressures up to 1500 [*]kPa at the location where a culture would be placed. This response was well correlated with the overpressure conditions from the shock tube (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 97). Finite element models of the shock tube and receiver were developed and validated to better elucidate the mechanics of this methodology. A demonstration exposing a culture to the {{loading conditions}} created by this system suggest tissue strains less than 5 % for all pressure levels simulated, which was well below functional deficit thresholds for strain rates less than 50 [*]s− 1. This novel system {{is not limited to}} a specific type of culture model and can be modified to reproduce more complex pressure pulses...|$|R
40|$|Shock {{tubes are}} {{commonly}} employed to test candidate armor materials, validate numerical models, and conduct simulated blast experiments in animal models. As DoD interests desire to field wearable sensors as <b>blast</b> dosimeters, shock <b>tubes</b> may also serve for calibration {{and testing of}} these devices. The high blast pressures needed for experimental testing of candidate armors are unnecessary to test these sensors. An inexpensive, efficient, and easily available way of testing these pressure sensors is desirable. It is known that releasing compressed gas suddenly can create a repeatable shock front, and the pressures can be finely tuned by changing the pressure to which the gas is compressed. A Crosman 0. 177 caliber air pistol was used (without loading any pellets) to compress and release air in {{one end of a}} 24 inch long 3 / 4 inch diameter standard pipe nipple to simulate a blast wave {{at the other end of}} the tube. A variable number of pumps were used to vary the peak blast pressure. As expected, the trials where 10 pumps were used to compress the air resulted in the largest average peak pressure of 101. 99 kPa (+/- 2. 63 kPa). The design with 7 pumps had the second biggest peak pressure, with an average peak pressure of 89. 11 kPa (+/- 1. 77 kPa). The design with 5 pumps had the third largest peak pressure, with an average peak pressure of 78. 80 kPa (+/- 1. 74 kPa). 3 pumps produced an average peak pressure of 61. 37 kPa (+/- 2. 20 kPa). 2 pumps produced an average peak pressure of 48. 11 kPa (+/- 1. 57 kPa). The design with just 1 pump had the smallest peak pressure and produced an average peak pressure of 30. 13 kPa (+/- 0. 79 kPa). This inexpensive shock tube design had a shot-to-shot cycle time of between 30 and 45 seconds. Comment: Five pages, three figure...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown an {{increase}} in the frequency of traumatic brain injuries related to blast exposure. However, the mechanisms that cause blast neurotrauma are unknown. Blast neurotrauma research using computational models has been one method to elucidate that response of the brain in blast, and to identify possible mechanical correlates of injury. However, model validation against experimental data is required to ensure that the model output is representative of in vivo biomechanical response. This study exposed porcine subjects to primary blast overpressures generated using a compressed-gas shock <b>tube.</b> Shock <b>tube</b> <b>blasts</b> were directed to the unprotected head of each animal while the lungs and thorax were protected using ballistic protective vests similar to those employed in theater. The test conditions ranged from 110 - 740 kPa peak incident overpressure with scaled durations from 1. 3 - 6. 9 ms and correspond approximately with a 50 % injury risk for brain bleeding and apnea in a ferret model scaled to porcine exposure. The bulk head acceleration and the pressure at the surface of the head and in the cranial cavity were measured. Immediately after the blast, 5 of the 20 animals tested were apneic. Three subjects recovered without intervention within thirty seconds and the remaining two recovered within 8 minutes following bagging and administration of the respiratory stimulant doxapram. Gross examination of the brain revealed no indication of bleeding. Intracranial pressures ranged from 80 - 685 kPa {{as a result of the}} blast and were notably lower than the shock tube reflected pressures of 300 - 2830 kPa, indicating pressure attenuation by the skull up to a factor of 8. 4. Peak head accelerations were measured from 385 - 3845 G’s and were well correlated with peak incident overpressure (R 2 = 0. 90). One standard deviation corridors for the surface pressure, intracranial pressure, and head acceleration are presented to provide experimental data for computer model validation...|$|R
