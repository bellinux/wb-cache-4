40|$|Despite the Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{efforts in}} Rothgery {{to shore up}} a 2 ̆ 2 bright-line rule 2 ̆ 2 for {{attachment}} based upon prior case law, {{the contours of the}} Sixth Amendment right to counsel are still somewhat obscure. To understand the impact of the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding,</b> each state will need to assess its criminal procedure and identify how to reconcile the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding</b> with current practices. This Comment identifies two areas of North Carolina criminal procedure that have been impacted by the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding</b> in Rothgery: (1) the expanded scope of a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s protection under the Sixth Amendment during police questioning under Rothgery; and (2) Rothgery 2 ̆ 7 s impact on attachment of the right to counsel in light of the arresting officer 2 ̆ 7 s discretion to cite the arrestee rather than perform a full custodial arrest. This Comment will discuss: the disconnect between the rule enunciated in Rothgery and current North Carolina criminal procedure; the impact of Rothgery on current practices, specifically police interrogation of defendants without the presence of counsel and the practice of misdemeanor citation and custodial arrest; and finally, recommendations for streamlining North Carolina criminal procedure to comply with the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding</b> in Rothgery...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} two terminating tableau {{systems for}} hybrid logic with the difference modality. Both systems {{are based on}} an abstract treatment of equality. They expand formulas {{with respect to a}} congruence closure that is not represented explicitly. The first system employs pattern-based blocking. The second system employs chain-based blocking and covers converse modalities. Both systems can handle transitive relations. 1 Introduction There are two established ways to arrive at modal logic with equality [5, 10, 1]. One approach employs the difference modality D, defined such that a property Ds holds for a state x if there exists a different state y such that <b>s</b> <b>holds</b> for y. The other approach, known as hybrid logic, employs nominals, which are primitive properties holding for exactly one state x. Without further extensions, the difference modality is more powerful than nominals. Once nominals are accompanied by the global modality E (Es holds for x if there exists a y for which <b>s</b> <b>holds),</b> both approaches have the same expressivity [13]...|$|R
