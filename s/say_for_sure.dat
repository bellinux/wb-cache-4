500|$|During {{one stop}} on {{the first leg of}} his [...] "Common Sense Solutions Tour", Thompson made a bold promise. [...] He proclaimed that if elected president, his {{administration}} would eliminate breast cancer by 2015. Once accomplished, he planned to [...] "then attack every major cancer one after the other." [...] Thompson explained that the disease had afflicted his family as well as millions of others and stated that [...] "there's no candidate in either party more prepared and more motivated to lead this effort than me." [...] He compared the announcement to President Kennedy's pledge to put {{a man on the moon}} before the end of the 1960s. The plan consisted of increases in funding for cancer research, including a doubling of the National Institute of Health's budget and additional incentives for private medical professionals to find a cure. Furthermore, Thompson remarked that as part of the plan, he would travel the world to promote cures, improving the United States' international standing. David Miller of CBS News questioned whether the announcement was [...] "a desperate measure by a desperate candidate, or a well-thought out policy by a former Health and Human Services secretary." [...] He added, [...] "we can't <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> but this item is proof that it did succeed in drawing attention to the other Thompson in the race." ...|$|E

The counter-tendencies can therefore not be taken as minor nor as necessarily dominated by the class polarization tendency.

500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E

Bedaux argues, [...] "if the symbols are disguised {{to such an extent that}} they do not clash with reality as conceived at the time... there will be no means of proving that the painter actually intended such symbolism." [...] He also conjectures that if these disguised symbols were normal parts of the marriage ritual, then one could not <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> whether the items were part of a [...] "disguised symbolism" [...] or just social reality.|$|E

50|$|While many {{political}} analysts came to assume {{during this time}} that Clinton would run, she {{took a long time}} to make the decision. While Clinton said she spent much of the two years following her tenure, as Secretary of State, thinking about the possibility of running for president again, she was also noncommittal about the prospect, and appeared to some as reluctant to experience again the unpleasant aspects of a major political campaign. Those around her were split in their opinions, reportedly, with Bill Clinton said to be the most in favor of her running again, Chelsea Clinton leaning towards it, but several of her closest aides against it. She reportedly studied Obama's 2008 campaign to see what had gone right for Obama as compared to her own campaign. Not until December 2014, around the time of the Clintons' annual winter vacation in the Dominican Republic, did she <b>say</b> she decided <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> that she would indeed run again.|$|R
2500|$|The {{encyclical}} Humani generis redemptionem from 15 June 1917, {{deals with}} blatant ineffectiveness of Christian preaching. According to Benedict XV, {{there are more}} preachers of the Word than ever before, but [...] "in the state {{of public and private}} morals as well as the constitutions and laws of nations, there is a general disregard and forgetfulness of the supernatural, a gradual falling away from the strict standard of Christian virtue, and that men are slipping back into the shameful practices of paganism." [...] The Pope squarely put part of the blame on those ministers of the Gospel who do not handle it as they should. It is not the times but the incompetent Christian preachers who are to blame, for no one today can <b>say</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> that the Apostles were living in better times than ours. Perhaps, the encyclical states, that the Apostles found minds more readily devoted to the Gospel, or they may have met others with less opposition to the law of God.|$|E
