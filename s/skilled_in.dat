40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen many changesthat may have {{affected}} earnings of Canadianworkers. The proliferation of {{information and communication technologies}} and the fast-growing sup-ply of relatively <b>skilled</b> workers <b>in</b> low-wage countries have allowed Canadian firms to contract out highly <b>skilled</b> jobs <b>in</b> services such as engineering and informatics, increasing international trade in relatively sophisticated commercial services. Likewise, trade in goods produced by non-OECD countries has been growing sharply. As a result, Canadian workers have faced growing international competition, not only from relatively <b>skilled</b> workers <b>in</b> service industries but also from less <b>skilled</b> ones <b>in</b> goods-producing indus-tries. This expansion of international trade with non-OECD countries has opened new markets for Canadian firms, potentially stimulating employmen...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women to explore the careers of young women during the {{transitional}} decade of the 1970 s. The paper pays particular attention to women <b>in</b> <b>skilled,</b> traditionally male occupations. Contrary to human capital theory predictions, women with high initial labor force attachment entered <b>skilled</b> jobs <b>in</b> the traditionally female sector rather than <b>skilled</b> jobs <b>in</b> the traditionally male sector. The women most likely to enter skilled male jobs were those with low initial labor force attachment who entered <b>skilled</b> jobs later <b>in</b> life. Women experienced mixed success <b>in</b> <b>skilled</b> male jobs. Those who entered skilled male jobs {{were less likely to}} make long-term careers in these jobs than were women who entered skilled non-male jobs. On the other hand, women who remained <b>in</b> <b>skilled</b> male jobs earned considerably more than did other women. Women's chances of remaining <b>in</b> <b>skilled</b> male jobs from year to year increased over the decade of the 1970 s, suggesting that prospects for women in these jobs improved over the decade.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{the share of}} adult populations with college degrees {{increased}} more in cities with higher initial schooling levels than in initially less educated places. This tendency appears {{to be driven by}} shifts in labor demand as there is an increasing wage premium for <b>skilled</b> people working <b>in</b> <b>skilled</b> cities. <b>In</b> this article, we present a model where the clustering of <b>skilled</b> people <b>in</b> metropolitan areas is driven by the tendency of skilled entrepreneurs to innovate in ways that employ other skilled people and by the elasticity of housing supply.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} production functions for {{small and large}} …rms in three indus-tries and …nd that large …rms have a higher elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers <b>in</b> <b>skilled</b> jobs {{as well as a}} higher elasticity of substitution between <b>skilled</b> workers <b>in</b> <b>skilled</b> jobs and capital than small …rms. Based on four theorems, we show that these di¤erences explain the higher labour productivity, capital intensity and skill intensity in large …rms. We advance the conjecture that the higher productivity enables large …rms to employ <b>skilled</b> workers <b>in</b> low-skilled jobs in periods of low wage for skilled-workers, building up a reserve capacity of skilled-workers...|$|R

5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men <b>skilled</b> <b>in</b> statecraft to pass.|$|E
5|$|After his accession, Diocletian and Lucius Caesonius Bassus {{were named}} as consuls and assumed the fasces {{in place of}} Carinus and Numerianus. Bassus {{was a member of}} a senatorial family from Campania, a former consul and proconsul of Africa, chosen by Probus for signal distinction. He was <b>skilled</b> <b>in</b> areas of {{government}} where Diocletian presumably had no experience. Diocletian's elevation of Bassus as consul symbolized his rejection of Carinus' government in Rome, his refusal to accept second-tier status to any other emperor, and his willingness to continue the long-standing collaboration between the empire's senatorial and military aristocracies. It also tied his success to that of the Senate, whose support he would need in his advance on Rome.|$|E

5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies <b>skilled</b> <b>in</b> music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest.

This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. This {{trade with the}} North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties {{prohibited}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as <b>skilled</b> <b>in</b> trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E
