The model will serve as a test bed for students in 2. 672 to study the energy losses between the battery, motor, and kinetic energy of the car during acceleration and regenerative braking over a range of realistic driving profiles. The goal is to maintain fidelity to the dynamics of a road-worthy vehicle while making the model lab-safe and simple to operate. The model drive train will be designed on a one-to-one scale with the vehicle to be simulated. A motor and controller from an electric vehicle will be purchased to provide realistic electric drive for the system. The kinetic energy of the car will be simulated by a flywheel of equivalent mass.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades {{there has been}} a {{considerable}} development in the modeling of car-following (CF) behavior as a result of research undertaken by both traffic engineers and traffic psychologists. While traffic engineers seek to understand the behavior of a traffic stream, traffic psychologists seek to describe the human abilities and errors involved in the driving process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these two research streams. It is necessary to consider human-factors in {CF} modeling for a more realistic representation of {CF} behavior in complex driving situations (for example, in traffic breakdowns, crash-prone situations, and adverse weather conditions) to improve traffic safety and to better understand widely-reported puzzling traffic flow phenomena, such as capacity drop, <b>stop-and-go</b> oscillations, and <b>traffic</b> hysteresis. While there are some excellent reviews of {CF} models available in the literature, none of these specifically focuses on the human factors in these models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a diagnostic and prognostic condition monitoring method for insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules for use primarily in electric vehicle applications. The wire-bond-related failure, {{one of the}} most commonly observed packaging failures, is investigated by analytical and experimental methods using the on-state voltage drop as a failure indicator. A sophisticated test bench is developed to generate and apply the required current/power pulses to the device under test. The proposed method is capable of detecting small changes in the failure indicators of the IGBTs and freewheeling diodes and its effectiveness is validated experimentally. The novelty of the work lies in the accurate online testing capacity for diagnostics and prognostics of the power module with a focus on the wire bonding faults, by injecting external currents into the power unit during the idle time. Test results show that the IGBT may sustain a loss of half the bond wires before the impending fault becomes catastrophic.

Heavy-duty trucks driven frequently in city traffic, such as cement mixers, need to be shifted very often and in <b>stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic.</b> Since few heavy-duty transmissions have synchromesh, automatic transmissions are commonly used instead, despite their increased weight, cost, and loss of efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Riding {{the clutch}} {{occurs when the}} driver does not fully release the clutch pedal.

50|$|The manual {{transmission}} couples {{the engine to}} the transmission with a rigid clutch instead of the torque converter on an automatic transmission or the v-belt of a continuously variable transmission, which slip by nature. Manual transmissions also lack the parasitic power consumption of the automatic transmission's hydraulic pump. Because of this, {{manual transmission}}s generally offer better fuel economy than automatic or continuously variable transmissions; however the disparity has been somewhat offset {{with the introduction of}} locking torque converters on automatic transmissions. Increased fuel economy with a properly operated manual transmission vehicle versus an equivalent automatic transmission vehicle can range from 5% to about 15% depending on driving conditions and style of driving. The lack of control over downshifting under load in an automatic transmission, coupled with a typical vehicle engine's greater efficiency under higher load, can enable additional fuel gains from a manual transmission by allowing the operator to keep the engine performing under a more efficient load/RPM combination. This is especially true as between manual and automatic versions of older models, as more recent advances including variable valve timing reduce the efficiency disadvantages of automatic transmissions by allowing better performance over a broader RPM range. In recognition of this, many current models (2010 and on) come with manual modes, or overrides on automatic models, although the degree of control varies greatly by the manufacturer. Also, manual transmissions do not require active cooling and because they are, mechanically, much simpler than automatic transmissions, they generally weigh less than comparable automatics, which can improve economy in <b>stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic.</b> However this gap in economy is being rapidly closed, and many mid to higher end model automatic cars now get better economy than their standard spec counterparts. This is in part due to the increasing impact of computers co-ordinating multiple systems, particularly in hybrid models in which the engine and drive motors must be managed, as well as using different automatic technology such as CVT and Dual-Clutch Automatics.|$|E
5000|$|Coordination of the {{lighting}} {{along with the}} capturing of all other photographic elements in the film were achieved by cinematographer Jack N. Green. Stunt coordinator Terry Leonard and second unit director Buddy Van Horn, oversaw the task of integrating the scope of stunt people working to produce the action which numbered over twice as many actors in the film (said to be over 80 stuntmen), while supervisor John Frazier controlled the special effects. Green, Van Horn, Leonard, Frazier, and production manager Valdez began close pre-production discussions three months before principal photography. To meet his stylistic lighting objectives in shaping the scenery environment, Green utilized powerful Musco Lighting developed during the 1980s. Commenting on a production scene surrounding the character of Pulovski at his residence, Green noted the home was characteristic of [...] "359 degrees" [...] of accessible turns of the camera. He detailed how the crew would [...] "go in with these little ceiling units, {{as close to the}} ceiling as we could get them, little accent lights onto the place the actors would be. It would look like it was coming from those practicals but, again, at a dramatic angle." [...] Describing a stunt-related sequence early in the film performed by Eastwood himself, Van Horn, who had been a stunt associate for almost 35 years, took the opportunity to commend the actor on his contributions saying, [...] "Clint likes to do everything live, ... When you read the script, you know {{everything is going to be}} pretty much live action. Sometimes you have to talk him out of something that just might be a little too risky. Not that he couldn't do it, but if something even minor should happen, you couldn't afford to suspend the production." [...] The sequence which Van Horn alluded to, was a scene that involved Eastwood behind the driver's seat racing a Chevrolet Blazer through <b>stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic,</b> while swerving to avoid oncoming cars from the opposite direction. The scene included 20 other stunt drivers operating a carefully rehearsed formation through a head-on collision course. According to Van Horn, who engineered the sequence with Leonard, he noted, [...] "The whole thing is like a football play, ... We all sit down and figure out where the cars are, where Clint makes the break out of traffic, where the other cars are going, and just the whole cause and effect for how and why he pulls into (the intersection) and decides to head on through. That's all worked out ahead of time." [...] Leonard added, [...] "In a situation where your rehearsal time is extremely limited, it becomes that old expression: experience, ... It becomes a seat of the pants kind of thing, about 20 drivers and Clint who know where the close calls are going to be and who's going to be in what position when. But once you get going, there's always the element of surprise, where maybe a car is 10 feet closer than it was expected to be, and a driver must react to that." ...|$|E

40|$|Ramp {{flow control}} (also known as ramp metering) uses {{specialized}} traffic signals that release vehicles onto a freeway in a smooth and even manner. The {{goal is to}} minimize the interference of entering vehicles on freeway traffic and prevent <b>stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic</b> that ripples upstream and slows the entire freeway. Flow signals facilitate smoother traffic merging and keep the freeway moving efficiently {{for a longer period}} of time by releasing only one or two vehicles at a time. Less <b>stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic</b> means fewer crashes that can cause additional congestion. In return, vehicles wait on the ramp, which may also reduce demand by causing diversion. This strategy may not eliminate traffic congestion but can delay its onset and shorten its duration. Target Market Freeways with recurring flow breakdowns Recurring freeway breakdowns occur daily in most congested metropolitan areas. Researchers have observed that average speeds may decrease but will generally remain close to freeflow speed as flow increases. The freeway will begin to approach a breaking point and reach an unstable condition as the flow approaches the available capacity. This breakdown of the freeway causes the congestion and queues to reach farther back in the traffic stream. The discharging vehicles from the bottleneck can then increase their speeds, but the freeway will stabilize at characteristics well below the freeway capacity. Flow control can limit the number of vehicles entering a freeway and help prevent a flow breakdown. <b>Stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions Flow signals can be considered for freeway entrance ramps upstream of freeway sections where <b>stop-and-go</b> <b>traffic</b> occurs on a routine basis.
