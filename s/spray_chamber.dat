This article describes its application to ICP introduction system <b>spray</b> <b>chambers.</b> We undertake to print and study cyclone <b>spray</b> <b>chambers</b> by combining and comparing for the first time 3 different AM processes, 5 materials and 8 designs. The analytical performances of these <b>spray</b> <b>chambers</b> are compared with commercial glass and PFA chambers in terms of signal intensity, stability, oxide ratio, LOD and wash-out time. LODs measured with polymer printed chambers are in the range or even outperform those measured with the glass chamber even though 3 D-printed chambers provide lower results in terms of sensitivity than glass. Compared to PFA chambers, the printed chambers are superior in terms of LOD. At low temperature, the printed chambers' efficiency depends on both AM process and manufacturing material. SLA and FDM printers give lower results in terms of sensitivity but not in LOD than the Polyjet printer. This study also illustrates the influence of the inner shape of the side arm nebulizer and confirms the importance of a free aerosol recirculation current around the nebulizer tip.

Final solidification of the strand may take place after the strand has exited the spray-chamber.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{frequently}} used technique in nuclear forensics. In this technique a purified sample is nebulized in a <b>spray</b> <b>chamber</b> and then aspirated into a plasma. The high {{temperature of the}} plasma leads to sample dissociation and high efficiency of ionization of the analyte. The ions then enter the mass spectrometer where they are discriminated based on mass based on a double focusing system. Ions of various masses are detected simultaneously by a bank of detectors {{similar to those used}} in the thermal ionization mass spec. MC-ICP-MS has a more rapid analysis because i does not require lengthy filament preparation. For high quality, however, there is a requirement for extensive sample cleanup. Argon plasma is also less stable and requires relatively expensive equipment as well as skilled operators.|$|E
50|$|To {{maximise}} {{plasma temperature}} (and hence ionisation efficiency) and stability, the sample should be introduced through the central tube {{with as little}} liquid (solvent load) as possible, and with consistent droplet sizes. A nebuliser {{can be used for}} liquid samples, followed by a <b>spray</b> <b>chamber</b> to remove larger droplets, or a desolvating nebuliser can be used to evaporate most of the solvent before it reaches the torch. Solid samples can also be introduced using laser ablation. The sample enters the central channel of the ICP, evaporates, molecules break apart, and then the constituent atoms ionise. At the temperatures prevailing in the plasma a significant proportion of the atoms of many chemical elements are ionized, each atom losing its most loosely bound electron to form a singly charged ion. The plasma temperature is selected to maximise ionisation efficiency for elements with a high first ionisation energy, while minimising second ionisation (double charging) for elements that have a low second ionisation energy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} nebulization devices and <b>spray</b> <b>chambers</b> used to couple ion chromatography with ICP-OES. In this prospect, the chromatographic performances for the separation of Cr(III), Cd(II), Ga(III) and Fe(III) were compared for all the nebulizers and chambers tested. In fact, the choice of a suitable interfacing device is mainly dictated by its sensitivity. However, this study shows that chromatographic efficiency could also be important. The results indicate that the difference in volume between the conventional and miniaturized cyclonic chambers is not critical with respect to extra-column band broadening for the case of classical columns. So, the conventional chamber, which presented the highest sensitivities and limits of detection, was selected. However, the study of five nebulizers, a conventional pneumatic concentric nebulizer and four micronebulizers, showed that they influenced the number of theoretical plates more.

50|$|The {{most common}} method {{is the use}} of {{analytical}} nebulizers. Nebulizer converts liquids into an aerosol, and that aerosol can then be swept into the plasma to create the ions. Nebulizers work best with simple liquid samples (i.e. solutions). However, there have been instances of their use with more complex materials like a slurry. Many varieties of nebulizers have been coupled to ICP-MS, including pneumatic, cross-flow, Babington, ultrasonic, and desolvating types. The aerosol generated is often treated to limit it to only smallest droplets, commonly by means of a Peltier cooled double pass or cyclonic <b>spray</b> <b>chamber.</b> Use of autosamplers makes this easier and faster, especially for routine work and large numbers of samples. A Desolvating Nebuliser (DSN) may also be used; this uses a long heated capillary, coated with a fluoropolymer membrane, to remove most of the solvent and reduce the load on the plasma. Matrix removal introduction systems are sometimes used for samples, such as seawater, where the species of interest are at trace levels, and are surrounded by much more abundant contaminants.|$|E
50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the <b>spray</b> <b>chamber</b> to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|E

Either type of electrodes {{is part of a}} thin-layer electrochemical flow cell that is positioned upstream of a microconcentric nebulizer for the ICP-MS. Performances of these electrodes were compared in terms of the analytical “figures of merit” (e. g., dynamic ranges, reproducibility, hydrodynamic stability, and elimination of matrix effects detrimental to ICP-MS). The coupled technique (ASV-ICP-MS) is found to possess a wide dynamic range (at least 4 to 5 orders of magnitude) and to be reproducible. Both electrodes are much more stable than the thin mercury film electrode (TMFE) traditionally used for ASV-ICP-MS, with the lifetime of the NCBFE exceeding 8 h.
