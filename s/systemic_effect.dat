5|$|RNA {{interference}} is a {{vital part}} of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material, especially in plants where it may also prevent the self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana express multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout the plant in a <b>systemic</b> <b>effect</b> and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting. This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to infection by specific types of bacteria. These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process.|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE: Formoterol is {{approved}} as asthma rescue medication in many countries. The exact {{duration of the}} airway vs. <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> of formoterol compared with another rescue medication, salbutamol, has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the duration of airway bronchodilatory <b>effects</b> vs. <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> of inhaled formoterol and salbutamol in asthmatic patients. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with stable and reversible asthma were given single doses of formoterol dry-powder inhaler (OxisTurbuhaler) 2 x 9 microg (lower dose; LD) and 6 x 9 microg (higher dose; HD), salbutamol (VentolinDiskhaler) 3 x 400 microg (LD) and 9 x 400 microg (HD), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Airway and <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> were assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), serum potassium, blood pressure, corrected QT-interval (QTc), and palpitation and tremor scores. Time with clinically relevant bronchodilation (FEV 1 increase 12 %) without clinically relevant markers of <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> (serum potassium suppression 0. 2 mmol/L, QTc-prolongation 20 ms, or heart rate increase 8 beats per minute) was evaluated. RESULTS: Bronchodilation was maintained for 24 h with both formoterol doses and for 7 - 11 h with salbutamol. Maximum bronchodilation and <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> were similar after formoterol and salbutamol, except for statistically significantly larger maximum heart rate and palpitation and tremor scores after salbutamol. Systemic responses were similarly brief for formoterol and salbutamol (7 h). CONCLUSIONS: The airway effects of inhaled formoterol are of long duration, whereas the <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> are of a similarly short duration as salbutamol. Thus, the time with clinically relevant bronchodilation without <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> is substantially longer after formoterol than after salbutamol...|$|R

25|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} that feeding ticks, sandflies, and, more recently, mosquitoes, have {{an ability to}} modulate the immune response of the animals (hosts) on which they feed. The presence of this activity in vector saliva {{is a reflection of}} the inherent overlapping and interconnected nature of the host hemostatic and inflammatory/immunological responses and the intrinsic need to prevent these host defenses from disrupting successful feeding. The mechanism for mosquito saliva-induced alteration of the host immune response is unclear, but the data have become increasingly convincing that such an effect occurs. Early work described a factor in saliva that directly suppresses TNF-α release, but not antigen-induced histamine secretion, from activated mast cells. Experiments by Cross et al. (1994) demonstrated that the inclusion of Ae. aegypti mosquito saliva into naïve cultures led to a suppression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ production, while the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are unaffected by mosquito saliva. Cellular proliferation in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with mosquito salivary gland extract. Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either Ae. aegypti or Cx. pipiens mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN-γ production. Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and <b>systemic</b> <b>effect</b> on the immune response.|$|E

2500|$|It {{takes over}} one hour for Marinol to reach full <b>systemic</b> <b>effect,</b> {{compared}} to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages. Many people using Marinol {{have said that}} Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, {{and it has been}} speculated that this disparity {{can be explained by the}} moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis. For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the cannabis plant such as nabiximols are being developed. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, [...] "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." [...] Mr. Kleiman's opinion notwithstanding, clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone.|$|E

Tattersfield The {{contribution of}} the swallowed fraction of an inhaled dose of salmeterol to it <b>systemic</b> <b>effects.</b> J. A. Bennett, T. W. Harrison, A. E. Tattersfield. #ERS Journals Ltd 1999. ABSTRACT: Salmeterol is approximately eight times as potent as salbutamol for sys-temic effects. This may be because the drug is eight times more potent on receptors or there may be differences in systemic bioavailability. The <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> of salbuta-mol are limited by its fairly high first-pass metabolism, but the oral bioavailability of salmeterol is unknown. The {{contribution of the}} swallowed fraction of an inhaled dose of salmeterol to its <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> were analysed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Twelve healthy subjects were given inhaled salmeterol 400 mg, inhaled salmeterol 400 mg plus oral activated charcoal or inhaled placebo plus oral activated charcoal on three separate days. Cardiac frequency (fC), Q±T interval corrected for heart rate (QTc), plasma potassium and glucose concentrations were measured for 4 h following the inhaled drug. Salmeterol with and without oral charcoal produced significant changes for all measures compared to placebo. The magnitude of effect following salmeterol alone was significantly greater than that following salmeterol plus charcoal for fC and glu-cose (mean (95 % confidence interval) differences 8 (2 ± 13) beats. min- 1, 0. 59 (0. 04, 1. 13) mmol. L- 1, respectively) and nonsignificantly greater for QTc interval and potas-sium concentration. The differences between salmeterol given with and without charcoal suggest that 28 ± 36 % of the systemic response to salmeterol administered from a metered-dose inhaler are due to drug absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, most of the <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> are due to the inhaled fraction of the drug...|$|R
