In a lexA 51 recA 441 strain, where the SOS mutagenesis functions are constitutive, targeting at dimers is confirmed by demonstrating that the induction of glutamine tRNA <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> is susceptible to photoreversal. In the same strain induction of backmutations is not susceptible to photoreversal. Thus delayed photoreversal mutagenesis produces <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> that can be targeted at pyrimidine dimers and does not produce backmutations that are not targeted at pyrimidine dimers. This correlation supports the idea that delayed photoreversal mutagenesis in umuC defective cells reflects a mutation process arrested at a targeting pyrimidine dimer photoproduct, which is the immediate cause of both the alteration in DNA sequence and the obstruction (unless repaired) to mutation fixation and ultimate expression...|$|R

Based on the nature and position of the prlA mutations, we propose that transmembrane domain 7 of SecY functions in signal sequence recognition. Results suggest that this interaction may involve a right-handed supercoil of alpha-helices. <b>Suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> that alter this domain appear to prevent signal sequence recognition, and this novel mechanism of suppression suggests a proofreading function for SecY.

A derivative bearing an ochre <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> was selected following mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitroso-N'-nitroguanidine. The suppressor-bearing strain was treated with nitrous acid to eliminate suppressor function by mutation, and a strain lacking suppressor activity was selected. The selected strain which had lost suppressor function was then subjected to mutagenesis to induce a second <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation.</b> The alternating sequence (induction of an ochre <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> → induction of a mutation eliminating ochre suppressor activity) was repeated 29 and one-half times in a single strain.

In order to identify gp 2. 5 interactions we designed a screen for suppressors of gp 2. 5 lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine. Screening for suppressors of dominant lethal mutations of essential genes is challenging as the phenotype prevents propagation. We select for phage encoding a dominant lethal version of gene 2. 5, whose viability is recovered via second-site <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation(s).</b> Functional gp 2. 5 is expressed in trans for propagation of the unviable phage and allows suppression to occur via natural selection.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} {{an unusual}} codon-specific translational suppressor in Escherichia coli. The suppressor {{resulted from a}} spontaneous mutation in a chromosomal gene during a selection for suppressors of the auxotrophic nonsense mutation trpA(UGA 211). The suppressor allows readthrough of UGA mutations at two positions in trpA and at two sites in bacteriophage T 4. It does not, however, suppress amber (UAG) or ochre (UAA) mutations that were tested in both genomes, {{some of which were}} at the same positions as the suppressible UGA mutations. The suppressor also does not allow mistranslation of the UGA-related trpA missense mutations UGG at positions 211 and 234, AGA at 211 and 234, CGA at 211, or UGU and UGC at 234. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> was mapped by genetic procedures to position 89 on the E. coli genetic map. Localization of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> to rrnB was achieved by cloning it in the low-copy-number plasmid pEJM 007 by in vivo recombination from the chromosome. Recloning in bacteriophage M 13 and subsequent DNA sequence analysis allowed the identification of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> as a deletion of the cytidylic acid residue at nucleotide position 1054 of the 16 S ribosomal RNA. The mutant EcoRI-Xba I fragment from the suppressor gene was recloned, from M 13, in an otherwise wild-type rrnB in the plasmid pEJM 007, and UGA suppression was examined. The UGA-suppressing activity of the reconstructed suppressor-containing pEJM 007 was indistinguishable from that of the original recombinant suppressor-containing plasmid. This result demonstrates that the C 1054 deletion in 16 S rRNA is both necessary and sufficient for UGA suppression.

These Tat variants were analyzed {{in the context of}} the infectious virus, and several mutants were found to be defective for replication. In an attempt to obtain second-site suppressor mutations that could provide information on the Tat protein structure, some of the replication-impaired viruses were used as a parent for the isolation of revertant viruses with improved replication capacity. Sequence analysis of revertant viruses frequently revealed changes within the tat gene, most often first-site reversions either to the wild-type amino acid or to related amino acids that restore, at least partially, the Tat function and virus replication. Of 30 revertant cultures, we identified only one second-site <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation.</b> The inactive Y 26 A mutant yielded the second-site <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> Y 47 N that partially restored trans-activation activity and virus replication. Surprisingly, when the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> was introduced in the wild-type Tat background, it also improved the trans-activation function of this protein about twofold. We conclude that the gain of function measured for the Y 47 N change is not specific for the Y 26 A mutant, arguing against a direct interaction of Tat amino acids 26 and 47 in the three-dimensional fold of this protein. Other revertant viruses did not contain any additional Tat changes, and some viruses revealed putative second-site Tat mutations that did not significantly improve Tat function and virus replication. We reason that these mutations were introduced by chance through founder effects or by linkage to suppressor mutations elsewhere in the virus genome. In conclusion, the forced evolution of mutant HIV- 1 genomes, which is an efficient approach for the analysis of RNA regulatory motifs, seems less suited for the analysis of the structure of this small transcription factor, although protein variants with interesting properties can be generate...|$|E

In this paper, we describe another interesting rRNA mutant, selected as a translational suppressor of the chain-terminating mutant trpA (UGA 211) of E. coli. The finding that it suppresses UGA at two positions in trpA and does not suppress the other two termination codons, UAA and UAG, at the same codon positions (or several missense mutations, including UGG, available {{at one of the}} two positions) suggests a defect in UGA-specific termination.

Several avenues of action of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutation</b> are suggested, including altered interactions with release factors, ribosomal protein L 11, or 16 S rRNA.

On the basis of this initial section, several classes of extragenic suppressor mutants were isolated that completely or partially corrected the Tra- and Rfa- phenotypes of the prototype rfaH mutant. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> included mutations in rho and mutations that mapped in or close to rpoBC. Other <b>suppressor</b> <b>mutations</b> were located elsewhere on the chromosome, presumably identifying other genes that {{play a role in the}} RfaH-mediated transcriptional regulation...|$|R
