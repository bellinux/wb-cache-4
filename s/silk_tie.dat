25|$|The 83 × 67cm (33 × 26 in) {{painting}} shows a half-length {{portrait of}} the painter Édouard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier {{in front of a}} dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black <b>silk</b> <b>tie</b> which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E
500|$|The Western {{world not}} only {{inspired}} Jinnah in his political life, but also greatly influenced his personal preferences, {{particularly when it}} came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public. He came to own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with detachable collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the same <b>silk</b> <b>tie</b> twice. [...] Even when he was dying, he insisted on being formally dressed, [...] "I will not travel in my pyjamas." [...] In his later years he was usually seen wearing a Karakul hat which subsequently {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Jinnah cap".|$|E
500|$|Gluck, an English artist whom Brooks painted around 1923, {{was noted}} in the {{contemporary}} press as much for her style of dress as for her art. She pushed the masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions, which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s. Articles about her presented her cross-dressing as an artistic eccentricity or {{as a sign that}} she was ultra-modern. [...] Brooks' portrait shows Gluck in a starched white shirt, a <b>silk</b> <b>tie,</b> and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a [...] "mad dressmaker"; her right hand, at her waist, holds a man's hat. Brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of La Belle Époque. But while many of Brooks' early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures [...] "consumed by petticoats, veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity", Gluck is self-possessed and quietly intensean artist who insists on being taken seriously. [...] Her appearance is so androgynous that {{it would be difficult to}} identify her as a woman without help from the title, and the title itselfPeter, a Young English Girlunderscores the gender ambiguity of the image.|$|E

60|$|The {{young man}} stood {{and stared at}} his questioner. He was wearing a blue serge suit, {{obviously}} ready-made, thick boots, a doubtful collar, a machine-knitted <b>silk</b> <b>tie</b> of vivid colour.

60|$|When {{they arrived}} at the door of his dwelling, he noticed two women sitting on a bench close by, thickly veiled and beautifully dressed. Their wide satin {{trousers}} were embroidered in silver, and their muslin robes were of the finest texture.

50|$|Previously, a grey or (if at a funeral) a black neck-tie was obligatory. Now all colours are worn; in many {{clubs and}} {{societies}} the Club Tie is acceptable to distinguish members from guests at formal lunches and breakfasts. The original silver Macclesfield design (a small check) is still used particularly with cravats, and is often called a wedding tie. The English etiquette authority, Debrett's, dictate that woven <b>silk</b> <b>ties</b> are preferred to cravats.|$|R
60|$|Sir Timothy smiled. He {{was looking}} {{exceedingly}} well that morning, the very prototype {{of a man}} contented with life and his part in it. He was wearing a morning coat and silk hat, his patent boots were faultlessly polished, his trousers pressed to perfection, his grey <b>silk</b> <b>tie</b> neat and fashionable. Notwithstanding his waxenlike pallor, his slim figure and lithe, athletic walk seemed to speak of good health.|$|E
60|$|When Anna Stormer {{came into}} the study she found her husband {{standing}} at the window with his head a little on one side--a tall, long-legged figure in clothes of a pleasant tweed, and wearing a low turn-over collar (not common in those days) and a blue <b>silk</b> <b>tie,</b> which she had knitted, strung through a ring. He was humming and gently tapping the window-pane with his well-kept finger-nails. Though celebrated {{for the amount of}} work he got through, she never caught him doing any in this house of theirs, chosen because it was more than half a mile away from the College which held the 'dear young clowns,' as he called them, of whom he was tutor.|$|E
60|$|He wore loose {{clothes of}} a strange bluish drab colour, and a conservative, round Panama hat without the cock-a-loop {{indentations}} and cants with which Northern fanciers disfigure the tropic head-gear. Moreover, he was the homeliest man I have ever seen. His ugliness was less repellent than startling--arising from a sort of Lincolnian ruggedness and irregularity of feature that spellbound you with wonder and dismay. So may have looked afrites or the shapes metamorphosed from the vapour of the fisherman's vase. As he afterward told me, his name was Judson Tate; and he {{may as well be}} called so at once. He wore his green <b>silk</b> <b>tie</b> through a topaz ring; and he carried a cane made of the vertebræ of a shark.|$|E

60|$|We at once entered, {{and were}} warmly greeted. The {{master of the}} house was an aristocratic-looking islander, dressed in loose linen drawers, a fine white shirt, and a sash of red <b>silk</b> <b>tied</b> about the waist, after the fashion of the Spaniards in Chili. He came up to us with a free, frank air, and, {{striking}} his chest with his hand, introduced himself as Ereemear Po-Po; or, to render the Christian name back again into English--Jeremiah Po-Po.|$|R
50|$|H. C. Cohn Company Building-Andrews Building is a {{historic}} industrial and commercial building located at Rochester in Monroe County, New York.

6000|$|Pickering {{is seated}} at the table, putting down some cards and a tuning-fork {{which he has been}} using. Higgins is {{standing}} up near him, closing two or three file drawers which are hanging out. He appears in the morning light as a robust, vital, appetizing sort of man of forty or thereabouts, dressed in a professional-looking black frock-coat with a white linen collar and black <b>silk</b> <b>tie.</b> He is of the energetic, scientific type, heartily, even violently interested in everything that can be studied as a scientific subject, and careless about himself and other people, including their feelings. He is, in fact, but for his years and size, rather like a very impetuous baby [...] "taking notice" [...] eagerly and loudly, and requiring almost as much watching to keep him out of unintended mischief. His manner varies from genial bullying when he is in a good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong; but he is so entirely frank and void of malice that he remains likeable even in his least reasonable moments.|$|E
6000|$|Horatio had {{procured}} Mrs. Blapton for {{the opening}} after some ineffectual angling for the Princess Adeline, and the thing was done at half-past three in the afternoon.

60|$|The {{shortness}} of breath took all fire, all animation out of his voice; his great, pale cheeks hung like filled pouches, motionless, without a quiver; but in his blue eyes, narrowed as if peering, there was the same look of confident shrewdness, a little crazy in its fixity, they must have had while the indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his cell. Before him, Karl Yundt remained standing, one wing of his faded greenish havelock thrown back cavalierly over his shoulder. Seated {{in front of the}} fireplace, Comrade Ossipon, ex-medical student, the principal writer of the F. P. leaflets, stretched out his robust legs, keeping the soles of his boots turned up to the glow in the grate. A bush of crinkly yellow hair topped his red, freckled face, with a flattened nose and prominent mouth cast in the rough mould of the negro type. His almond-shaped eyes leered languidly over the high cheek-bones. He wore a grey flannel shirt, the loose ends of a black <b>silk</b> <b>tie</b> hung down the buttoned breast of his serge coat; and his head resting {{on the back of his}} chair, his throat largely exposed, he raised to his lips a cigarette in a long wooden tube, puffing jets of smoke straight up at the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|He used to {{keep the}} papers folded safely in square pieces of <b>silk</b> <b>tied</b> up with <b>silk</b> thread. He always carried in his {{shoulder}} bag paper sheets, and fountain pen as well as ink pot of various colours. All the 7751 verses of Dasabodh were written in his neat handwriting. These manuscripts are still worshipped in the Domgaon Math which was under his charge. Shree Kalyan Swami recorded the holy songs in manuscript form.

25|$|Besides {{the sacred}} Bodhi trees of Buddhism the veneration of certain spirits related to trees, known generically as Nang Mai, {{is common in}} Thai folklore. The most {{well-known}} of these tree spirits is Nang Ta-khian which according to Thai oral tradition inhabits Hopea odorata trees and may appear as a beautiful woman wearing traditional Thai attire. Trees, logs, beams or keels of wooden boats where the spirit is deemed to reside are an object of pilgrimage and have lengths of colored <b>silk</b> <b>tied</b> as an offering.
