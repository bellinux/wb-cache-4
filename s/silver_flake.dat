40|$|Abstract—To {{improve the}} {{electrical}} properties of electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), short-chain difunctional acids, such as malonic acid (acid M), adipic acid (acid A), and terephthalic acid (acid T) were introduced into a typical isotropic conductive adhesive formulation. By in-situ {{replacement of the}} commonly used surfactant-stearic acid in silver(Ag) flakes, such difunctional acids can increase the conductivity of ECAs. With the addition of malonic acid and adipic acid, which only have short chain single-bond hydrocarbon between the dicarboxylic groups, the conductivity of the typical conductive adhesives was improved significantly. Terephthalic acid, however, deteriorates the conduc-tivity due to the rigid aromatic structure in the molecule. Dynamic mechanical analysis and thermomechanical study indicated the improved electrical properties with malonic and adipic acids were achieved without negatively affecting the mechanical and physical properties of ECAs.

40|$|Power {{electronic}} systems {{are needed in}} diverse areas such as electricity transmission or electrical drives in industrial applications. Due to losses inside the chips, cooling is necessary. Si-chips can theoretically tolerate up to 200 °C; solder interconnects are not suitable for temperatures exceeding 125 °C, though. Furthermore, many solders comprise lead, which has been banned by government initiatives such as the European RoHS. Therefore, other means of interconnection have to be found. One approach is a sintering technology that joins chips and substrates by sintering of a <b>silver</b> <b>flake</b> powder [1, 2]. Due to the application of an external pressure of 30 to 50 MPa, sintering takes place at temperatures below 300 °C. However, these pressures can lead to cracking of the brittle silicon chips and ceramic substrates. The {{next step is to}} use silver nanoparticles instead of micron-scaled silver flakes [3, 4]. Their huge surface energy leads to improved sinterability. Due to this fact, the pressure needed could be brought down to less than 5 MPa. The particles are passivated using organic capping materials to avoid agglomeration. The work shown in this article investigates the influence of the passivating material on the sintering behaviour of silver nanoparticles and evaluates their suitability for die bonding at temperatures below 300 °C.

Conductivity level depends, among other things, on level of aggregation of filler particles. The research has been focused on improvement of electrical properties by better aggregation of filler particles in adhesive. Following methods have been tested with the goal to support aggregation: ultrasound mixing for 60 s, rotary mixing for 60 s, and addition of a small amount of AgNO 3. The goal of addition of this salt has been to decrease Coulomb forces between particles of filler. Four types of formulations {{have been used for}} experiments.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in silver thin film coated polymer spheres as conductive fillers in isotropic conductive adhesives (ICAs). Such ICAs yield resistivities similar to conventional <b>silver</b> <b>flake</b> based ICAs while requiring {{only a fraction of the}} silver content. In this work, effects of the nanostructure of silver thin films on inter-particle contact resistance were investigated. The electrical resistivity of ICAs with similar particle content was shown to decrease with increasing coating thickness. Scanning electron micrographs of ion milled cross-sections revealed that the silver coatings formed continuous metallurgical connections at the contacts between the filler particles after adhesive curing at 150 °C. The electrical resistivity decreased for all samples after environmental treatment for 3 weeks at 85 °C/ 85 % relative humidity. It was concluded that after the metallurgical connections formed, the bulk resistance of these ICAs were no longer dominated by the contact resistance, but by the geometry and nanostructure of the silver coatings. A figure of merit (FoM) was defined based on the ratio between bulk silver resistivity and the ICA resistivity, and this showed that although the resistivity was lowest in the ICAs containing the most silver, the volume of silver was more effectively used in the ICAs with intermediate silver contents. This was attributed to a size effect due to smaller grains in the thickest coating...|$|E

40|$|During {{the recent}} two decades, {{considerable}} {{efforts have been}} made to explore new generations of interconnecting materials and printed lines to replace the traditionally used toxic lead-based solders in electronic industries. Electrical conductive adhesive (ECA) which consists of conductive metallic particles and a polymeric matrix has attracted {{a great deal of attention}} as one of the most promising alternative materials. The conventional ECAs are typically made of silver micro flakes and epoxy resin. The low electrical conductivity of these ECAs is their main drawback compared to traditional lead-based solders, which hinders their applicability in today’s blooming electronic industries. An enormous amount of research works have been conducted to enhance the electrical conductivity of the conventional ECAs, including increasing the polymer shrinkage, surface modification of silver flakes, introduction of low melting components to the ECA formulation, and the use of nano-sized conductive materials inside the formulation of the conventional ECAs. All of these approaches affect the quality of inter filler interaction inside the electrical network, in different ways. The recent progress in nanotechnology helped material scientists to precisely design nanomaterials with different morphologies and surface chemistry. Owing to this capability, incorporation of nano-sized conductive fillers with different natures, morphologies, and surface properties inside the conventional formulation of ECAs has drawn considerable attention to overcome the common drawbacks of conventional ECAs, such as poor electrical and mechanical properties, reliability issues, and large filler content. It has been reported that the introduction of conductive nanomaterials into the conventional ECAs can improve the electrical conductivity of ECAs if their size, morphology, and the ratio between nanofiller and silver flakes is carefully taken under consideration. In this project, we developed new generations of hybrid electrical conductive adhesives (ECAs) by introducing conductive nanofillers (spherical silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), high aspect-ratio silver nanobelts (Ag NBs), and graphene) into the conventional formulation of ECAs. To harness the characteristic properties of the nanofillers and to facilitate their homogeneous dispersion inside the epoxy, nanofillers were functionalized. In the first step of this project, spherical Ag NPs were synthesized and simultaneously functionalized with thiocarboxilic acids, resulting in the formation of NPs less than 5 nm. Two thiocarboxylic acids with the same chemical structure but different chain lengths (3 and 11 carbons) were used to functionalize the NPs. We showed that the size and the electrical properties of the NPs can be controlled by varying the chain length of their covering organic layer. The diameter of the Ag NPs functionalized with the short-chain acid was two times smaller than those with the long-chain acid. We also found that the short-chain functionalized NPs were electrically conductive while the long-chain functionalized ones were nonconductive. The short-chain functionalized NPs were incorporated into the conventional ECAs. We found that at low NPs contents (< 20 wt %) the electrical conductivity of the hybrid ECAs increased due to the filling of NPs into the interstices of the micron-sized silver flakes, bridging of the NPs among separated flakes, and sintering of the NPs at relatively low curing temperature of 150 °C. However, higher NPs contents reduced the electrical conductivity because they may cluster and increase the gaps between the silver flakes. Furthermore, at higher NPs content, the number of contact points increases, which in turn decreases the electrical conductivity of the final ECAs. The positive effect of the synthesized NPs on the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite is basically attributed to the increased number of electrical pathways inside the electrical network due to the bridging of the NPs between separated silver flakes. However, a large amount of NPs are needed to form effective bridges inside the network, which increases the number of contact points inside the filler system and also increases the cost of the final ECAs. In the second step, we implement a novel type of high aspect-ratio silver nanostructure, silver nanobelts (Ag NBs), as co-filler inside the conventional formulation of the ECAs. The Ag NBs (10 - 40 nm thick, 100 - 400 nm wide and 1 - 10 µm long) were synthesized through self-assembly and room-temperature joining of hexagonal and triangular silver unit blocks which were synthesized by chemical reduction of silver nitride in the presence of poly(methacrylic acid). The incorporation of a small amount of the Ag NBs (2 wt%, NBs to flakes weight-ratio, K = 0. 03) into a conventional ECA with 60 wt% silver flakes resulted in an electrical conductivity enhancement of 1550 % in comparison to that of the conventional ECAs with the same total silver weight fraction, while addition of 2 wt% (K = 0. 03) NBs into the conventional ECA with 80 wt% silver flakes enhanced the electrical conductivity of the hybrid ECA approximately 240 %. These results imply high aspect-ratio NBs are more effective to improve the electrical conductivity of ECAs at concentrations close to percolation threshold. Considering the importance of the aspect-ratio of the nanofillers, in the next step, we implemented graphene, which is known for its exceptional electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, to further reduce the amount of silver flakes while maintaining a high electrical conductivity. Graphene, possessing the highest aspect-ratio among all the nanostructures and also due to its 2 D structure, can provide extremely high surface area for electron transformation inside the electrical network. However, to exploit the interesting properties of the graphene, their single layer structure must be preserved inside the polymeric matrix. To achieve this goal, we applied two types of surface modification to exfoliate and stabilize graphene layers. First, we decorated graphene surface with Ag NPs, functionalized with a short chain length thiocarboxylic acid, and introduced this 2 D nanostructure into the conventional ECAs. The electrical conductivity measurements revealed that the decorated graphene significantly improves the electrical conductivity of the conventional ECAs only at low filler concentrations, while to achieve high electrical conductivity, elevated curing temperatures are needed. This situation is a result of the increased number of contact points because of Ag NPs on graphene surface. Second, we used a non-covalent approach to stabilize graphene using the surfactant; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Our results showed that the stabilization of graphene with SDS noticeably enhance the electrical conductivity of the ECAs, which is attributed to the role of SDS in exploiting the high aspect-ratio of graphene. In order to examine this hypothesis, we used a larger size graphene and applied the same SDS modification protocol. The electrical resistivity measurements showed that the electrical conductivity enhancement in the case of hybrid ECAs with large SDS–modified graphene was more significant than that with small SDS–modified graphene. The percolation threshold for the hybrid ECA with 1. 5 wt% of both large and small graphene was reduced to an interestingly low value of 10 wt% while this value for conventional ECAs, and hybrid ECAs with non-modified graphenes was 40 wt%. Furthermore, adding 1. 5 wt% of large SDS-modified graphene into the conventional ECA with 80 wt% <b>silver</b> <b>flake</b> content resulted in a very low electrical resistivity of 1. 6 × 10 - 5 Ω. cm which is lower than that of eutectic lead-based solders...|$|E

40|$|Stretchable {{conductive}} ink {{is a key}} enabler for stretchable electronics. This thesis research focuses {{on the development of}} a new stretchable and screen printable {{conductive ink}}. After print and cure, this ink would be capable of being stretched by at least 500 cycles at 20 % strain without increasing its resistance by more than 30 times the original resistance, while maintaining electrical and mechanical integrity. For a stretchable and screen-printable conductive ink, the correct morphology of the metal powder selected and the ability of the binder to be stretched after the sintering process, are both indispensable. This research has shown that a bi-modal mixture of fine and large-diameter <b>silver</b> <b>flakes</b> will improve stretchability. While the smaller flakes increase the conductivity and lower the sintering temperature, the larger flake particles promote ohmic connectivity during stretching. The bi-modal flake distribution increases connection points while enhancing packing density and lowering the thermal activation barrier. The polymer binder phase plays a crucial role in offering stretchability to the stretchable conductive inks. The <b>silver</b> <b>flakes</b> by themselves are not stretchable but they are contained within a stretchable binder system. The research demonstrates that commonly used printable ink binder when combined with large-chain polymers through a process known as ‘elastomeric chain polymerization’ will enable the conductive ink to become more stretchable. This research has shown that the new stretchable and screen printable silver conductive ink developed based upon the two insights mentioned above; (1) bi modal flakes to improve ohmic connectivity during stretching and (2) elastomeric chain polymerized binder system which could stretch even after the ink is sintered to the substrate, can exhibit an ink stretchability of at least 500 cycles at 20 % strain while increasing the resistance by less than 30 times the original resistance. Wavy print patterns can enhance the stretchability of stretchable conductors.

For comparison, ECAs produced using commercial silver particles, e. g. <b>silver</b> <b>flakes</b> and <b>silver</b> nanoparticles, were prepared at a constant filler loading, and the electrical conductivity was observed. It was found that the as-synthesized AgNPs showed the highest electrical conductivity (2. 53 x 10 1 S/cm) in comparison to the ECAs prepared using commercial particles...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the viability of}} screen printing stretchable silver conductive paste directly onto fabric and how the resistance changed under cyclic mechanical loading. The paste tested was DuPont™ PE 873 stretchable silver conductive paste, which forms a stretchable conductive path by suspending <b>silver</b> <b>flakes</b> in elastomer that can be elastically strained along with the underlying substrate. The silver pastes were printed directly onto two different high-density synthetic fabrics of different weaves. Other samples were prepared by first printing a base layer between the silver paste and the fabric. One base layer was a solvent-based dielectric (DuPont™ ME 776) and a stretchable carbon conductor (DuPont™ PE 671). This project determined that printing onto either base layer had a significantly smaller change in resistance under cyclic tensile tests than printing onto the fabric directly. Bend tests also revealed {{the possibility that the}} rate of change of strain had a higher impact on the change in resistance than the strain itself...|$|R

Measuring and quantifying the diffusion of fission products in reactor materials is a critical element of the future success of Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTRs). While the extreme temperatures, which may be in excess of 1000 °C, allow for a potentially very high efficiency, they also can be problematic due to the increase in fission product transport. The aim of this work was to explore a repeatable, accurate, and cost effective process to measure the diffusion coefficients of fission products in VHTR materials. This work focuses on the diffusion of silver in graphite. We constructed graphite cells which could be filled with a silver diffusant. This diffusant may take the form of <b>silver</b> <b>flakes,</b> <b>silver</b> power, or a silver-laden graphite powder. The cells were hermetically sealed and heated to temperatures comparable to those found in VHTRs. These cells were imaged using microtomography and electron microscopy. Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) was used to determine actual diffusion profiles in the cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} reduction {{process has been}} used for the synthesis of silver powder in ethylene glycol. The mechanism for the formation of flake powder has been proposed on the basis of analysis of the main factors influencing the morphology of silver powder. The results showed that the key factor for the formation of <b>flake</b> <b>silver</b> powder was the heterogeneous seeds of platinum firstly reduced. It offered a plane for precipitation and reduction of silver later. The concentration of free silver ion was controlled by polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) by the formation of complex. And more PVP was absorbed on the surface of silver ion selectively. Thus the nucleation and growth of silver was influenced and <b>flake</b> <b>silver</b> powder formed.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{isotropic}} {{conductive adhesive}} containing different fillers, which shows better properties at high temperature compared with traditional ones, {{was developed and}} the properties of various fillers were investigated. <b>Silver</b> <b>flakes</b> as the main filler and secondary materials such as silver nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes (CNT) with different volume ratios are combined to form bi-modal or tri-modal systems for electrical or thermal conduction. The curing behavior of the adhesive was investigated by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The properties such as glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus were detected by Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA). Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) {{was used to determine}} the decomposition behavior. The distribution of the carbon nanotubes used in the adhesive was also characterized by SEM. The glass transition temperature of the formulated adhesives is above 200 °C. The in-plane bulk electrical resistivity (lower than 5. 2 * 10 - 5 Ω*cm) as well as the shear strength (up to 15 MPa) of the adhesives with different volume percentages of various fillers were also obtained...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{alternative}} material compositions for flexible silicone-based dry electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes {{to improve the}} performance lifespan while maintaining high-fidelity transmission of EEG signals. Electrode materials were fabricated with varying concentrations of silver-coated silica and <b>silver</b> <b>flakes</b> to evaluate their electrical, mechanical, and EEG transmission performance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the initial electrode development identified some weak points in the sensors’ construction, including particle pull-out and ablation of the silver coating on the silica filler. The newly-developed sensor materials achieved significant improvement in EEG measurements while maintaining the advantages of previous silicone-based electrodes, including flexibility and non-toxicity. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} proposed electrodes maintained suitable performance even after exposure to temperature fluctuations, 85 % relative humidity, and enhanced corrosion conditions demonstrating improvements in the environmental stability. Fabricated flat (forehead) and acicular (hairy sites) electrodes composed of the optimum identified formulation exhibited low impedance and reliable EEG measurement; some initial human experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using these silicone-based electrodes for typical lab data collection applications...|$|R

Thermomechanical analysis of ICAs was used with the goal to find influence of addition of two types of nanoparticles, silver nanoballs and carbon nanotubes, and two types of curing processes, on air and in vacuum, on the glass transition temperature and storage modulus of bisphenol epoxy adhesives filled with <b>silver</b> <b>flakes</b> (70 to 80 % by weight). Specimens were formed as blocks. Three groups of specimens were fabricated: specimens of adhesives used as received and cured according to the recommendation of a supplier in air; specimens of adhesives used as received and cured according to the recommendation of a supplier in vacuum, specimens of the same adhesives added with low fraction (0, 3 to 10 % by weight) of silver nanoballs, colloidal dispersion of silver, or carbon nanotubes. There were found differences in the glass transition temperatures and storage and loss moduli in dependence {{on the type of}} particles added into adhesive. It was also found that the adhesive cured in vacuum had lower thermal expansion coefficient and higher the storage and loss modulus in comparison with adhesive cured in air...|$|R
