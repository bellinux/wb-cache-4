Perhaps Nan Shelley and Agatha Lord were no less surprised than Irene; also they were deeply chagrined. But O'Gorman's slip in calling Sarah Judd [...] "Josie" [...] had conveyed to his associates information that somewhat modified their astonishment at the girl's cleverness, for everyone who knew O'Gorman had often heard of his daughter Josie, of whom he was accustomed to speak with infinite pride. He always said he was training her to follow his own profession and that when the education was complete Josie O'Gorman would make a name for herself in the detective service. So Nan and Agatha exchanged meaning glances and regarded the freckled-faced girl with new interest.|$|E

The apparatus has a movable <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> sandwiched between two fixed parallel support plates. Pressurized air is supplied to the movable <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> which employs a tri-arm air bearing vent structure which allows the <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> to float and to translate between the parallel support plates.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} upgrade the seismic {{resistibility}} of structures and enhance the functionality of an isolator, a new base isolator called the multiple trench friction pendulum system (MTFPS) is proposed in this study. The proposed MTFPS isolator is composed of a trench concave surface and several intermediate <b>sliding</b> <b>plates</b> in two orthogonal directions. Mathematical formulations have been derived to examine {{the characteristics of the}} proposed MTFPS isolator possessing multiple intermediate <b>sliding</b> <b>plates.</b> By means of mathematical formulations, it can be inferred that the natural period and damping effect of the MTFPS isolator with several intermediate <b>sliding</b> <b>plates</b> can be altered continually and controllably during earthquakes. Furthermore, results obtained from shaking table tests demonstrate that the proposed isolator provides good protection to structures for prevention of damage from strong earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{different}} quality of alumina are taken along with different metals {{as the starting}} materials. Different compositions are formulated taking single or combination of metals which are mixed with phenol formaldehyde resin and pressed with a specific pressure of 2000 kg/cm 2. The bricks are cured at 240 °C for 12 hours. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated. Also the bricks are fired at 1100 °C in reducing atmosphere. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated and correlated with the mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Based on these findings carbon bearing plates are made {{with the addition of}} carbon black or carbon black and graphite. The addition is restricted up to 5 %. Properties are evaluated and correlated with mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Plates containing aluminium metal shows superior thermal and thermo-mechanical properties than silicon metal containing Al 2 O 3 <b>slide</b> <b>plates.</b> However plate containing metal in combination has the best thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. Fused alumina based plates has comparatively superior properties for all grade of metal addition. Plate containing both carbon black and graphite flake was having comparatively efficient properties in carbon bonded <b>slide</b> <b>plates.</b> To improve the thermal shock resistance, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance, along with mechanical properties, in situ synthesised plasma fused ZrO 2 -SiC was incorporated in the Al 2 O 3 –C <b>slide</b> gate <b>plates.</b> Apart from mechanical properties, thermal spalling resistance, erosion resistance and oxidation resistance of these <b>slide</b> <b>plates</b> were compared with the normal ones.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the effects of a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{morphology}} of the epiphyseal plate in goat distal femur.

40|$|A Monsanto Automatic Capillary Rheometer and a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> {{rheometer}} {{were used}} to study the spurt phenomenon and to discover {{whether it is the}} result of a system instability or a material property. The capillary rheometer has been the only instrument able to operate at spurt stresses up to present time, because capillary rheometers operate at shear stresses that are out of the range of rotational shear rheometers. However, a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> rheometer can generate shear stresses in the spurt range. A comparative study using two linear polybutadiene samples at 50 °C was carried out using these two rheometers. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of the actual pressure drop in the capillary in order to determine the true shear stress at the wall. It was found that spurt occurs only in the capillary rheometer. In other words, the flow curve generated by the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> rheometer is continuous in the shear stress range where spurt is observed in the capillary rheometer. Slip velocities were determined using data from the two rheometers, and the slip velocities for the post-slip capillary flow all fall on the smooth curve based on <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> data, provided that the pressure drop in the capillary, and not the overall driving pressure, is used to calculate the wall shear stress...|$|E

We further show how the obtained non-linear relation of the slip velocity to the constant stresses of the plane Couette flow in the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> configuration of the FMR allows predicting and explaining the inhomogeneous stress distribution and partial yielding behaviour in a rotational cone-and-plate geometry. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} description of friction between steel and wood materials, specifically laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and pine wood with two types of annual rings. It studies {{the influence of a}} number of different parameters on the coefficient of friction such as contact pressure, moisture content, fiber orientation in relation to the load direction, steel surface roughness, and horizontal load rate. First, the theoretical mechanical and physical properties as well as the coefficient of friction itself are described. This is followed by the description of the test setup including the test method and how the obtained data is exported, handled and processed and how the coefficient of friction is determined. The results study the influence of different parameters and show that the coefficients of friction for the smooth <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> tests vary in between 0. 1 and 0. 3, whereas tests with the rough <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> vary around 0. 7. Factors influencing the coefficient of friction were found to be the different moisture content under all tested pressures, the different fiber direction under low contact pressure, the contact pressure itself, though under higher pressures the influence was found to be low, and the horizontal load rate under low pressures. The outcomes are further discussed in the discussion chapter...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheology}} of many materials {{relevant to}} consumer products and biomedical applications often depends strongly on the characteristic length {{scale of the}} device or flow of interest. For these highly structured fluids, the flows occurring during the actual application of the product are often confined to geometries with dimensions of a few micrometers. Examples include the spreading of skin lotions, or the organoleptic perception of food and pharmaceutical products. In this study, we measure the nonlinear rheology of microgel particle dispersions in narrow gaps from 1 - 100 micrometers. We use an interferometry-based <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> microrheometer to impose large shearing deformations on microliter fluid samples confined between parallel optical flats. The macrorheological response is compared with the flow in the micro-confined geometry. Whereas the bulk rheology {{is typical of the}} broad class of soft solid materials with a pronounced yield stress followed by strong shear-thinning, the flow in the confined geometry is dominated by wall slip and the apparent viscosity depends on the degree of confinement, the mass concentration and the volumetric swelling ratio of the microgel particles. The evolution in the slip velocity and extrapolation length of the confined microgel can be systematically determined in this <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> rheometer as a function of degree of confinement and shear stress. Thixotropy in the confined samples can also be determined by repeated shearing using periodic large amplitude oscillations. status: publishe...|$|E
