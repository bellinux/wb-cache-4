50|$|Traditionally, live pigeon {{shooting}} {{guns were}} heavier than a regular field gun (greater than 7 pounds). Characteristics {{of them were}} longer barrels (30 inch with ventilated ribs give better <b>sight</b> <b>plane),</b> tighter chokes (full/fuller), no safety, beavertail forend, single triggers, clipped fences, a third bite, 2 3/4 12 gauge shells (as opposed to the more common 2 1/2 inch shells). These extra features were in place to handle the higher pressure loads used for live pigeon competitions where the bird had to be dropped inside the ring. Today, these pigeon guns command a higher premium at auction.|$|E
50|$|The bullet {{dwell time}} is the time between {{cartridge}} ignition, and the time the bullet leaves the barrel. Like lock time, dwell time is a window for error, and can be minimized with a faster bullet or a shorter barrel. In some cases, a shorter barrel is desired to reduce dwell time, but without losing the sight radius of a longer barrel. In this case, a sight extension tube, or bloop tube, can be used. This is a tube that fits on the muzzle end of the barrel, providing support for the front sight, but that is bored to much larger than bore diameter. This provides the <b>sight</b> <b>plane</b> of a long barrel with less weight and dwell time.|$|E
50|$|Carbines {{were usually}} less {{accurate}} and less {{powerful than the}} longer muskets (and later rifles) of the infantry, due to a shorter <b>sight</b> <b>plane</b> and lower velocity of bullets fired from the shortened barrel. With the advent of fast-burning smokeless powder, the velocity disadvantages of a shorter barrel became less of an issue (see internal ballistics). Eventually, the use of horse-mounted cavalry would decline. But carbines continued to be issued and used by many who preferred a lighter, more compact weapon even {{at the cost of}} reduced long-range accuracy and power, such as artillery troops, who might need to defend themselves from attack but would be hindered by keeping full-sized rifles around; thus, a common title for many short rifles in the late 19th century was artillery carbine.|$|E

5000|$|The Official Police was {{machined}} of fine carbon steel, {{with bright}} royal Colt blued {{as well as}} nickel-plated finishes, and was offered in 4 , 5 and 6 in barrels. Built on Colt’s [...]41 or “I” frame, it was manufactured {{in a variety of}} chamberings including [...]22 LR, [...]32-20 (discontinued in 1942), [...]41 Long Colt (discontinued in 1938), and the most common and popular, the [...]38 Special. Colt’s “Positive Lock” firing pin block safety was a standard feature of the revolver, preventing the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. The pistol’s sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s top strap. The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the <b>sight</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15 is a {{derivative}} {{of the classic}} 1899 K-frame (medium frame) Military and Police [...]38 S&W Special (aka [...]38 Special) six-shot double-action revolver. The M&P underwent steady evolution throughout the 20th century and S&W spun off several variations as separate models in the post World War II years. One of these was the K-38 Target Masterpiece, which began production in 1947. The Target Masterpiece included {{a number of new}} and/or special features, including a six-inch barrel with a narrow rib to provide a level <b>sight</b> <b>plane,</b> a Patridge front sight, a micrometer click rear sight, S&W’s [...]375” short-throw hammer, a trigger adjustment for overtravel, and improved grips. Noting the accuracy of the Target Masterpiece, a number of police departments and the FBI soon requested the same revolver with a four-inch barrel and a Baughman Quick Draw front sight. The result was the K-38 Combat Masterpiece. The major distinction between the K-38 Target Masterpiece and the K-38 Combat Masterpiece is the barrel length and the front sight.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960, Perazzi met Ivo Fabbri, a young {{automotive}} engineer {{who worked for}} Fiat. The two joined together to create high class, yet affordable shotguns. They were inspired by the British gun makers Boss & Co. and Woodward, who made firearms by hand with extravagant prices. Perazzi and Ivo believed {{there was a way}} to create such high class firearms that would be affordable for the average Italian. The pair then began to work with Italian shooting star and gun designer, Ennio Mattarelli. From this partnership the first Olympic grade Perazzi shotgun was born, which Mattarelli used to win the gold medal in Olympic trap at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics with a world record score of 198/200 targets. A year later Fabbri separated from Perazzi to establish his own firearm company, Fabbri Arms. Perazzi continued to work with Mattarelli. The two focused on developing a new shotgun for Mattarelli to shoot at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. The model MX8 shotgun was born, built specifically for the conditions of shooting in Mexico City. The gun featured a higher rib and respective higher stock to reduce heat distortion along the <b>sight</b> <b>plane</b> in the hot climate. Doing so lowered to the placement of the stock on the shoulder, resulting in the recoil being directed horizontally back into the shooter, rather than vertical muzzle jump. A pistol grip was included to increase the control over traditional straight English stocks. The MX8 {{was also one of the}} first guns to have interchangeable screw in chokes in the bottom barrel. This feature is now found in nearly every modern shotgun. Also included was the revolutionary detachable v-springs trigger assembly. Perazzi preferred v-springs over the traditional coil trigger assembly due to their better trigger pulls. The draw back of v-springs was their unreliability. When worn out they can break without warning, unlike the coil trigger assemblies they slowly wear down with age. Since the v-spring assembly was detachable, they could be changed at any time by the competitor for peace of mind. This innovation along with slanted hammers reduced misfires significantly.|$|E

50|$|The {{projectile}} path {{crosses the}} horizontal <b>sighting</b> <b>plane</b> two times. The point {{closest to the}} gun occurs while the bullet is climbing through the line of sight and is called the near zero. The second point occurs as the projectile is descending through the line of sight. It is called the far zero and defines the current sight in distance for the gun. Projectile path is described numerically as distances above or below the horizontal <b>sighting</b> <b>plane</b> at various points along the trajectory. This {{is in contrast to}} projectile drop which is referenced to the plane containing the line of departure regardless of the elevation angle. Since each of these two parameters uses a different reference datum, significant confusion can result because even though a projectile is tracking well below the line of departure it can still be gaining actual and significant height with respect to the line of sight as well as {{the surface of the earth}} in the case of a horizontal or near horizontal shot taken over flat terrain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{optional}} spatial 3 D material solid reality picture may be showed on a 2 D showing plane, {{its surface}} is commonly consisted {{of too many}} sub-surfaces of the 3 D solid reality picture in both dispersal and continuation. It was a difficult problem to express all exact visibilities of solids sub-surfaces; because of some numerals computational error properties of visibilities are always unknown. So far, we cannot choose but select a proper dispersal degree of materials sub-surfaces, an approaching function of an optional material sub-surfaces B-Rep (Bound Representation), and numerals computation without any perturbation motion, etc. A novel numeral computational method of expressing exact visibilities of 3 D spatial materials solids reality pictures with intelligent properties of VCR is given in this paper.

50|$|When the Browning Superposed was {{introduced}} in 1931, American sportsmen soon {{fell in love with}} the concept of a stacked barrel double gun. Unlike traditional side-by-side double barrel shotguns that have issues with aiming points and recoil, a shotgun with two barrels stacked one on top of the other offers a single <b>sighting</b> <b>plane</b> and lighter recoil. The Superposed became the first mass produced Over/Under (O/U) shotgun. By the 1970s the Belgian-made Browning Superposed, and other other over and under shotguns imported from Europe had become so expensive that they were out of reach of most American shooters, and there were no domestically produced over and under shotguns that didn't cost more.|$|R
50|$|Projectile path {{values are}} {{determined}} by both the sight height, or {{the distance of the}} line of sight above the bore centerline, and the range at which the sights are zeroed, which in turn determines the elevation angle. A projectile following a ballistic trajectory has both forward and vertical motion. Forward motion is slowed due to air resistance, and in point mass modeling the vertical motion is dependent on a combination of the elevation angle and gravity. Initially, the projectile is rising with respect to the line of sight or the horizontal <b>sighting</b> <b>plane.</b> The projectile eventually reaches its apex (highest point in the trajectory parabola) where the vertical speed component decays to zero under the effect of gravity, and then begins to descend, eventually impacting the earth. The farther the distance to the intended target, the greater the elevation angle and the higher the apex.|$|R

5000|$|The M1917 was well-suited to the rimless [...]30-06 Springfield round {{which came}} closer in overall length and muzzle {{energy to the}} {{original}} [...]276 Enfield high-velocity round for which the rifle had been designed than the rimmed, less powerful [...]303 British round of the P14. The M1917's barrel had a 1 in 10 in (254 mm) twist rate and retained the 5-groove left hand twist Enfield-type rifling of the P14, {{in contrast to the}} 4-groove right hand twist rifling of the M1903 Springfield and other US designed arms. The M1917 had a long 26-inch heavyweight barrel compared to the lighter 24-inch barrel of the M1903 Springfield. With the longer <b>sighting</b> <b>plane,</b> the M1917 proved generally more accurate at long distances than the M1903, at the expense of greater weight. The M1917 weighed 9 lb empty - the M1903 Spingfield weighed 8 lb empty - and a rifle with sling, oiler, and fixed bayonet weighed over 11 lb. The M1917's long barrel and issued 16.5 in blade bayonet proved too lengthy and cumbersome for trench fighting, while its weight and overall length made the rifle difficult to use for some smaller-statured soldiers.|$|R
