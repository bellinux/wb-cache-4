However, numerous factors in addition to exposure magnitude influence biomarker {{concentrations in}} <b>spot</b> <b>samples,</b> including temporal variation in <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> because of elimination kinetics.

Repeated exposures were modeled for each individual in the simulation with exposure amounts drawn from lognormal distributions with varying geometric standard deviations.

When using field instruments, the data generated represents a snapshot in time and space. Often, as with a PID or FID, data {{is presented as a}} total of contaminates present at that time and place. More sophisticated field equipment such as GC/MS can provide speciation, but still suffer from poor spatial and temporal resolution. As an alternative, investigators can choose methods such as Summa canisters that sample for a fixed period, say 24 hours, followed by lab analysis.

Background:  The use of early morning sputum samples (EMS) to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) can result in treatment delay given the need for the patient to return to the clinic with the EMS, increasing the chance of patients being lost during their diagnostic workup. However, there is little evidence to support the superiority of EMS over <b>spot</b> sputum <b>samples.</b> In this new analysis of the REMoxTB study, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of EMS with <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> for identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis pre- and post-treatment. Methods:  Patients who were smear positive at screening were enrolled into the study. Paired sputum samples (one EMS and one spot) were collected at each trial visit pre- and post-treatment. Microscopy and culture on solid LJ and liquid MGIT media were performed on all samples; those missing corresponding paired results were excluded from the analyses. Results:  Data from 1115 pre- and 2995 post-treatment paired samples from 1931 patients enrolled in the REMoxTB study were analysed. Patients were recruited from South Africa (47 %), East Africa (21 %), India (20 %), Asia (11 %), and North America (1 %); 70 % were male, median age 31  years (IQR 24 – 41), 139 (7 %) co-infected with HIV with a median CD 4 cell count of 399 cells/μL (IQR 318 – 535). Pre-treatment <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> had a higher yield of positive Ziehl–Neelsen smears (98 % vs. 97 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 02) and LJ cultures (87 % vs. 82 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 006) than EMS, but there was no difference for positivity by MGIT (93 % vs. 95 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 18). Contaminated and false-positive MGIT were found more often with EMS rather than <b>spot</b> <b>samples.</b> Surprisingly, pre-treatment EMS had a higher smear grading and shorter time-to-positivity, by 1  day, than <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> in MGIT culture (4. 5 vs. 5. 5  days, P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

Concentrations of ten trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) were followed on these 4 campaigns and over a 4 months period. The results were interpreted in terms of reproducibility of measures over 4 months and DGT concentrations were compared with spot samples concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} using dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> to assess adherence to medication has been reported. The World Health Organisation estimates that {{only half of}} the patients in the developed world take their medication as prescribed. Additional costs to the healthcare provider include wasted medicines, avoidable additional hospital visits and non-optimum patient care. There is little evidence of information concerning medication adherence being made available to inform clinical decision making. In this article we explore the potential of the dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> collection methodology as a means of identifying medication adherence to facilitate medicines optimization for a range of disparate diseases. Furthermore, the opportunity to personalize healthcare for different patients by assessing the clinically necessary therapeutic level of the relevant drugs is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of dried}} whole blood <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> {{provides}} medical anthropological researchers—especially those working in remote, isolated communities—with several advantages over traditional methods. Anthropological research utilizing venous-drawn blood samples can create challenges {{in terms of}} phlebotomy training, personnel needs, storage and transportation requirements, and participant discomfort. Alternatively, research utilizing dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>samples,</b> via finger stick collection techniques, eliminates or reduces these problems greatly. While the use of dried blood spots is often the best sampling option for anthropologists or other population-level researchers, the method does have some limitations. Nevertheless, {{as the number of}} dried blood spot analyte protocols continues to increase, the logistical and participant advantages of dried blood spot methods assure their increased utility in biomedical anthropological research in the future...|$|R
30|$|To {{our best}} knowledge, nearly all sensitizers are uniformly {{distributed}} on TiO 2. In this study, we prepared the hybrid nanotube array films of Ag 2 S/CdS/TNTs by <b>spotting</b> <b>sample</b> method (SSM). Firstly, nanoporous TNTs were prepared using electrochemical anodization under controlled reaction conditions, which have better photoelectric properties [23]; secondly, CdS was deposited inside TNTs via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, which can widen visible light response spectrum; thirdly, Ag 2 S was {{deposited in the}} local domain of the CdS/TNTs using <b>spotting</b> <b>sample</b> method. As a narrow-bandgap (0.9  eV) semiconductor material, Ag 2 S strongly absorbs visible light. However, too much Ag 2 S deposition can lead to clog-up of nanotube inlet, which could decrease the sunlight absorption capabilities of TiO 2 nanotubes. In order to overcome this problem, a narrow-gap semiconductor material, Ag 2 S, was deposited in the local domain of CdS/TNTs by <b>spotting</b> <b>sample</b> method, which {{may result in a}} lower coverage of Ag 2 S on TNTs, and the presence of these three semiconductor materials can decrease the recombination possibilities of photoelectrons and holes. Five different films, Ag 2 S/CdS/TNTs by SSM, TNTs, CdS/TNTs, Ag 2 S/TNTs, and Ag 2 S/CdS/TNTs by SILAR, were prepared and analyzed to compare their photoelectro-chemical properties.|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{software}} {{costs money}} and better assessment costs exponentially more money. Given finite budgets, assessment resources are typically skewed towards {{areas that are}} believed to be mission critical. This leaves blind spots: portions of the system that may contain defects which may be missed. Therefore, in addition to rigorously assessing mission critical areas, a parallel activity should sample the blind spots. This paper assesses defect detectors based on static code measures as a blind <b>spot</b> <b>sampling</b> method. In contrast to previous results, we find that such defect detectors yield results that are stable across many applications. Further, these detectors are inexpensive to use and can be tuned to the specifics of the current business situations. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study evaluates HbA 1 c measure-ments from {{dried blood}} spots {{collected}} on filter paper and compares HbA 1 c from filter paper (capillary blood) with HbA 1 c measured in venous blood. Methods: Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire. The performance with the filter paper method {{was assessed by}} comparing HbA 1 c results from EDTA-blood samples obtained via dried blood spots with HbA 1 c results obtained with freshly hemo-lyzed blood (routine HbA 1 c). Adult patients visiting the outpatient clinic for HbA 1 c analyses were recruit-ed {{for the evaluation of}} dried blood <b>spot</b> <b>sampling</b> at home.

40|$|The lack of {{short-term}} temporal resolution associated with traditional <b>spot</b> <b>sampling</b> for monitoring water quality of dynamic coastal and estuarine waters {{has meant that}} many organisations are interesting in autonomous monitoring technologies to provide near real-time semi-continuous data. Such approaches enable capturing short term episodic events (which may be missed or alternatively skew datasets when using spot samples) and provide early warning of water quality problems. New policy drivers such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) provide added impetus to develop this field. Therefore, {{as part of the}} interreg IIIa funded MATSIS project the Marine Institute undertook to develop and pilot an autonomous monitoring station in Dublin Bay (North Bank Monitoring Station NBMS). This report presents the outcome for this pilot study. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dialkyl {{phosphate}} (DAP) metabolites in <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> {{are frequently}} used to characterize children’s exposures to organophosphorous (OP) pesticides. However, variable exposure and short biological half-lives of OP pesticides {{could result in}} highly variable measurements, leading to exposure misclassification. Objective: We examined within- and between-child variability in DAP metabolites in urine samples collected during 1 week. Methods: We collected <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> over 7 consecutive days from 25 children (3 – 6 years of age). On two of the days, we collected 24 -hr voids. We assessed the reproducibility of urinary DAP metabolite concentrations and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> as predictors of high (top 20 %) or elevated (top 40 %) weekly average DAP metabolite concentrations. Results: Within-child variance exceeded between-child variance {{by a factor of}} two to eight, depending on metabolite grouping. Although total DAP concentrations in single <b>spot</b> urine <b>samples</b> were moderately to strongly associated with concentrations in same-day 24 -hr samples (r ≈ 0. 6 – 0. 8, p 1 day apart and in 24 -hr samples collected 3 days apart were weakly correlated (r ≈ – 0. 21 to 0. 38). Single <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> predicted high (top 20 %) and elevated (top 40 %) full-week average total DAP excretion with only moderate sensitivity (≈ 0. 52 and ≈ 0. 67, respectively) but relatively high specificity (≈ 0. 88 and ≈ 0. 78, respectively). Conclusions: The high variability we observed in children’s DAP metabolite concentrations suggests that single-day urine samples provide only a brief snapshot of exposure. Sensitivity analyses suggest that classification of cumulative OP exposure based on <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> is prone to type 2 classification errors.

40|$|Urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) {{excretion}} {{was measured}} in 14 healthy, preterm, male neonates with gestational ages between 32 and 35 weeks. Daily NAG excretion increased significantly during the first four weeks of life. No correlation was observed between urinary NAG:creatinine ratio and postnatal age regardless of whether measurements {{were taken from the}} whole 24 hour urine collection or from an isolated urine <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> at the same time on each day. When the preterm infants were compared with a group of 20 healthy, full term, male infants at a postnatal age of 7 days the NAG:creatinine ratio was significantly higher in the preterm group, the measurements having been taken from single urine <b>spot</b> <b>samples.</b> We suggest that this variable be used in the evaluation of renal tubular integrity during the neonatal period...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was {{to evaluate the use}} of the ratio of sodium to creatinine (Na : Creat) in a <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> of urine to estimate daily sodium intake. Thirty-six Merino wethers were allocated to 1 of 4 diets with differing levels of sodium addition (0, 0. 87, 2. 18, 3. 48 mol Na/kg DM, equivalent to 0, 20, 50 and 80 g Na/kg DM). Urinary collections began 5 weeks after the sheep had been introduced to the diet. Total urine output was collected daily for 3 days to determine the pattern of sodium and creatinine excretion relative to sodium intake. Also over the 3 days, 4 <b>spot</b> <b>samples</b> of urine were taken at different times of the day. The Na : Creat ratio in urine predicted daily sodium intake with an r 2 of 0. 82. There was significant variation in the estimation of sodium intake depending on the time of <b>spot</b> <b>sample</b> collection. This variation was attributed to diurnal variation in the Na : Creat ratio due to differences in renal clearances of sodium and creatinine, possibly caused by the feeding patterns in the experiment. Despite the variation, this technique still provided a good predictor of group sodium intakes. Therefore, under field conditions the technique may be useful in estimating sodium intake...|$|R
