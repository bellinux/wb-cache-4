40|$|Abstract. The {{growing number}} of {{distributed}} information systems such as the internet has created a need for <b>security</b> <b>in</b> data <b>sharing.</b> When several autonomous parties attempt to share data, there is not necessarily any guarantee that the participants will <b>share</b> data truthfully. <b>In</b> fact, {{there is often a}} large incentive to engage in behavior that can sabotage the effectiveness of such a system. We analyze these situations in light of game theory, a mathematical model which permits us to consider behavior and choices for any autonomous party. This paper uses this theory to create a behavior enforcement method that does not need a central management system. We use a simple punishment method that is inherently available in most scenarios. Our approach is applicable to a variety of assured information sharing applications where the members of a coalition have to work together to solve a problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{computing}} {{systems are}} shared between users of various kinds. This thesis treats such systems as mathematical objects, and investigates {{two of their}} properties: refinement and security. The first is {{the analysis of the}} conditions under which one shared system can be replaced by another, the second the determination of a measure of the information flow through a shared system. Under the heading of refinement we show what it means for one shared system to be a suitable replacement for another, both in an environment of co-operating users and in an environment of independent users. Both refine- ment relations are investigated, and a large example is given to demonstrate the relation for cooperating users. We show how to represent the security of a shared system as an 'inference function', and define several <b>security</b> properties <b>in</b> terms of such functions. A partial order is defined on systems, with the meaning 'at least as secure as'. We generalise inference functions to produce 'security specifications' which can be used to capture the desired degree of <b>security</b> <b>in</b> any <b>shared</b> system. We define what it means for a shared system to meet a security specification and indicate how implementations may be derived from their specifications in some cases.

40|$|Quantum {{secret sharing}} is a scheme for {{encoding}} a quantum state (the secret) into multiple shares and distributing them among several participants. If {{a sufficient number}} of shares are put together, then the secret can be fully reconstructed. If an insufficient number of shares are put together however, no information about the secret can be revealed. In quantum ramp secret sharing, partial information about the secret is allowed to leak to a set of participants, called an unqualified set, that cannot fully reconstruct the secret. By allowing this, the size of a share can be drastically reduced. This paper introduces a quantum analog of classical strong <b>security</b> <b>in</b> ramp secret <b>sharing</b> schemes. While the ramp secret sharing scheme still leaks partial information about the secret to unqualified sets of participants, the strong security condition ensures that qudits with critical information can no longer be leaked.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical investigation on what behavioral information security governance factors drives {{the establishment of}} information <b>security</b> knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> organizations. Data was collected from organizations located in different geographic regions of the world, {{and the amount of}} data collected from two countries – namely, USA and Sweden – allowed us to investigate if the effect of behavioral information security governance factors on the establishment of security knowledge sharing differs based on national culture. The study followed a mixed methods research design, wherein qualitative data was collected to both establish the study’s research model and develop a survey instrument that was distributed to 578 information security executives. The results suggest that processes to coordinate implemented security knowledge sharing mechanisms have a major direct influence on the establishment of <b>security</b> knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> organizations; the effect of organizational structure (e. g., centralized security function to develop and deploy uniform firm-wide policies, and use of steering committees to facilitate information security planning) is slightly weaker, while business-based information security management has no significant direct effect on security knowledge sharing. A mediation analysis revealed that the reason for the non-significant direct relation between business-based information security management and security knowledge sharing is the fully mediating effect of coordinating information security processes. Thus, the results disentangles the interrelated influences of behavioral information security governance factors on security knowledge sharing by showing that information security governance sets the platform to establish security knowledge sharing, and coordinating processes realize the effect of both the structure of the information security function and the alignment of information security management with business needs. A multigroup analysis identified that national culture had a significant moderating effect on the association between four of the six proposed relations. In Sweden – which is seen as a less individualist, feminine country – managers tend to focus their efforts on implementing controls that are aligned with business activities and employees’ need; monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented controls, and assuring that the controls are not too obtrusive to the end user. On the contrary, US organizations establish <b>security</b> knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> their organization through formal arrangements and structures. These results imply that Swedish managers perceive it to be important to involve, or at least know how their employees cope with the decisions that have been made, thus favoring local participation <b>in</b> information <b>security</b> management, while US managers may feel the need to have more central control when running their information security function. The findings suggest that national culture should be taken into consideration in future studies – in particular when investigating organizations operating in a global environment – and understand how it affects behaviors and decision-making.   QC 20140520 </p...|$|R

Main difficulty in cloud computing was issues of data integrity, data privacy and data access by unauthorised users. TTA (Trusted Third Party) is used to store and <b>share</b> data <b>in</b> cloud computing. Modification and sharing of data is quite simple as a group. To verify integrity of the <b>shared</b> data, members <b>in</b> the group needs to compute signatures on all shared data blocks. Different blocks <b>in</b> <b>shared</b> data are generally signed by different users due to data modifications performed by different users. User revocation {{is one of the}} biggest <b>security</b> threats <b>in</b> data <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> groups. During user revocation shared data block signed by revoked user needs to download and re-sign by existing user. This task is very inefficacious due to the large size of shared data blocks on cloud. PANDA Plus is the new public auditing mechanism for the maintaining integrity of shared data with efficient user revocation in the cloud. This mechanism is based on proxy re-signatures concept which allows the cloud to re-sign blocks on behalf of existing users during user revocation, so that downloading of shared data blocks is not required. PANDA Plus is the public auditor which audits the integrity of shared data without retrieving the entire data from the cloud.

The {{widespread}} {{diffusion of}} wireless-enabled portable de-vices creates novel opportunities for users to share resources anywhere and anytime, but makes access control a crucial issue. User/device mo-bility and heterogeneity, together with network topology and conditions variability, complicate access control {{and call for}} novel solutions to dy-namically adapt access decisions to the different operating conditions. Several research efforts have emerged {{in recent years that}} propose to ex-ploit context-awareness to control access to resources based on context visibility and changes. Context-based access control requires, however, {{to take into account the}} quality of context information used to drive access decisions (QoC). Quality of context has in fact a profound im-pact on the correct behavior of any context-aware access control frame-work. Using context information with insufficient quality might increase the risk of incorrect access control decisions, thus leading to danger-ous <b>security</b> breaches <b>in</b> resource <b>sharing.</b> <b>In</b> this paper we propose a QoC-aware approach to access control for anywhere, anytime resource sharing.

40|$|Though {{a common}} view holds that bubbles bagan their {{formation}} from 1986, we cannot easily agree. Share prices, at least, began to contain bubbles from 1984. Though share prices during 1983 - 85 stayed within changes of so-called fundamentals, current profit of companies, {{which is one}} of the two fundamentals, contained profit from that very rise of share prices. Explaining bubbles through the concept of "fundamentals" will inevitably go around in circles. We should rather pay attention to the fact that at the end of 1984, the ratio of the total sum of shares to GNP, listed on all the stock exchanges, valued at current market prices, amounted to 56. 1 % which is an unprecedented high figure. The bubbles <b>in</b> <b>share</b> prices owed greatly to the positive absorption of overseas short-term fund by foreign exchange banks from 1984. They took advantage of the abolition, in 1984, of so-called yen-ten regulation, which had long restricted, to a degree, the banks' conversion of dollars, taken in from overseas financial centers, into yen. After the abolition some parts of the converted money were vigorously invested into domestic stock market. Greater part of the money taken in was appropriated to their own external investment, and the rest to <b>security</b> investment, particularly <b>in</b> <b>shares.</b> Consequently, share prices were raised.
