5|$|Most {{men have}} a normal sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONParagangliomas {{are rare}} tumors arising from neural crest tissue located outside the adrenal gland. Primary <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> paraganglioma is {{extremely}} rare entity. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 26 -year-old male patient presented with symptoms {{and signs of}} acute appendicitis where a CT of abdomen and pelvis showed an inflamed appendix and incidental finding of left <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> mass. The patient underwent uneventful laparoscopic appendectomy followed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> biopsies. Histopathology revealed a neuroendocrine neoplasm consistent with paraganglioma. Surgical excision of the left <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> was carried out. DISCUSSIONParaganglioma of genitourinary tract is rare. The urinary bladder {{is the most common}} site, followed by the urethra, pelvis and ureter. <b>Seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> paragangliomas were reported in association with other genitourinary organ involvement such as bladder and prostate. Isolated <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> paraganglioma is extremely rare and surgical excision remains the standard treatment for localized paraganglioma. CONCLUSIONPrimary tumors of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> are rare and represent a diagnostic challenge. Differential diagnosis includes a list of benign and malignant tumors. Primary <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> paraganglioma is a rare but important diagnosis {{to be included in the}} differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{amyloidosis}} of the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> is a {{rare disease}} entity. We report here a case of localized <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> amyloidosis with hematospermia. A 66 -year-old man visited our hospital with a chief complaint of hematospermia. T 2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hypointensity mass in the left <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle.</b> Needle biopsy revealed amyloidosis of the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle.</b> Without any specific treatment, the mass lesion disappeared on MRI, and hematospermia was improved...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} {{and maintenance of}} the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles,</b> {{as well as their}} secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. The <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> contain 5α-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.|$|E
25|$|Fertility {{is further}} {{compromised}} by the underdevelopment of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> and prostate.|$|E
25|$|DHT is biologically {{important}} for sexual differentiation {{of the male}} genitalia during embryogenesis, maturation of the penis and scrotum at puberty, growth of facial, body, and pubic hair, sebum production, and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles.</b> It is produced from the less potent testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase in select tissues, and is the primary androgen in the genitals, prostate gland, <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles,</b> skin, and hair follicles.|$|E

40|$|Adrenomedullin (ADM) may {{regulate}} <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> fluid secretion {{and this}} may affect sperm quality. In this study, we have investigated the effect of adrenomedullin on chloride secretion in the mouse <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle.</b> The presence of ADM in mouse <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> was confirmed using immunostaining and the molecular species was determined using gel filtration chromatography coupled with enzyme-linked assay for ADM. The effects of ADM on chloride secretion were studied by short-circuit current technique in a whole mount preparation of mouse <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> in an Ussing Chamber. The effects of specific ADM and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists were investigated. Whether it depended on the cAMP- and/or calcium-activated chloride channel was also studied using specific chloride channel blockers. The results showed that ADM was present in <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> epithelial cells. The major molecular species was precursor in the mouse <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle.</b> ADM increased the short circuit current through the activation of the calcium-activated chloride channel in the mouse <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle.</b> This stimulatory effect was blocked by the CGRP receptor antagonist, hCGRP 8 - 37. We conclude that ADM may regulate the chloride and fluid secretion from the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle,</b> which may affect {{the composition of the}} seminal plasma bathing the sperm and hence fertility...|$|R
