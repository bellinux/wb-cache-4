Our particular interest is to investigate the evolving role of the social sign in learning within culturally organized activities. The participants in our study were a group of teachers participating in an in-service mathematics course whose pedagogy draws on the sociocultural perspective. A specific analysis method to unravel {{the nature of the}} semiotic tool as a sign vehicle was developed for the study. The results of the study suggest that <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> making around the semiotic sign vehicle consisted of seven phases, with a shared social sign as an end result indicating collaborative learning. On the whole, the semiotic sign vehicle investigated in this study supported the understanding of <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> making and hence teacher learning in the problem solving situation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a model of}} the process through which a set of symbols, initially without any intrinsic meaning, acquires endogenously a conventional and <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meaning.</b> This model has two related aspects. The first is the cognitive aspect, represented by the process through which each agent processes the information gathered during the interactions with other agents. In this paper, the agents are endowed with the cognitive skills necessary to categorize the input in a lexicographic way, a categorization process that is implemented by the means of data mining techniques. The second aspect is the social one, represented by the process of reiterate interactions among the agents who compose a population. The framework of this social process is that of evolutionary game theory, with a population of agents who are randomly matched in each period in order to play a game that, in this paper, is a kind of signaling game. The simulations show that the emergence of a <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> associated to a combination of symbols is, under the assumptions of this model, a statistically inevitable occurrence.

40|$|This article {{presents}} research that used ethnographic and sociolinguistic methods to study ways participants learn through reflection when carried {{out as a}} “circle talk. ” The data indicate that participants in the event (a) invoked different contextual frames that (b) implicated them in various identity positions, which (c) affected how they could express their knowledge. These features worked together to generate <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> that enabled participants to jointly achieve conceptualization—the ideational role “reflection” is presumed {{to play in the}} experiential learning process. The analysis supports the claim that participants generate new knowledge in reflection, but challenges individualistic and cognitive assumptions regarding how this occurs. The article builds on situated views of experiential learning by showing how knowledge can be understood as <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> and how learning and identity formation are mutually entailing processes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how contextual (conversational) aspects and <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> {{might affect the}} participants' performance on a standardised memory test using the theoretical framework of social representations. A total of 97 members of centres for older adults located in Rome, Italy participated in a screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test. Prior to testing, a group of volunteers had organised a performance focused on events from the distant past, stimulating intergenerational reminiscence. The participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two conditions. In the first case, prior to administering the test, a psychotherapist talked to each participant about the performance, focusing on ageing and stressing the neutral aspects of its social representations, such as change and time. In the second case, performance was used to concentrate on positive aspects of the social representations of ageing, namely wisdom and experience. In line with the hypothesis, focusing on positive aspects of social representations of ageing (wisdom and experience) versus their neutral aspects (change and time) has resulted in improved performance on a standardised memory test. Practitioners (psychotherapists – experts in psycho-diagnostics) who administered the tests have been involved in the co-construction of the meaning of ageing, discussing a real-life situation: the common experience of intergenerational activity that involved the participants' memories of their urban environment...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{possibilities}} to constitute meaning in the „borderline- situations“ (Jaspers) of the social sphere, such as the loss of validity of orientation within and experience of reality in the socially shared structures of the lifeworld. On the one hand, I will refer to A. Schutz’ and his constitution-analysis of foreign understanding and of shared meaning; on the other hand, I bear onto I. Kertész literary project to narrate the biography of an Auschwitz-survivor as close to his experiential perspective as possible. I will focus both {{on the concept of}} constitution and of interpretation with respect to their enabling of the transcending of a typologized everyday’s world which suppresses subjective meaning and its individual articulation. The main guideline is the problem how identity – i. e. a life-story – is configured out of subjective meaning without recourse to everyday reality. A. Schutz’s and Th. Luckmann’s note on a range of social transcendences and on biographical categories referring to the constitution of a <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> offer a theoretical perspective for dealing with constitutive differences within the reach of understanding social meaning; Kertész’ narrative mode expandes this theoretical stance as it problematizes exemplary subjective experience...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{cognitive}} structures and <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> in communication effectiveness, focusing concretely on brand communication. Traditionally in communication sciences, ambiguity and polysemy have been considered prejudicial {{to the effectiveness of}} communication. However, we argue that in branding, the more possible meanings a brand alludes to, the more people are able to identify with it and emotionally connect to it, thus contributing to the effective communication of the brand, understood as the building or reinforcement of a positive relationship between the receiver and the brand. Our main argument is explored within a theoretical framework that is founded on the following assumptions: a) the new media are one of the main factors that shape the contemporary society; b) this shaping takes place on a cognitive level, thus originating concrete cognitive structures that are characteristic of the contemporary society; c) brands are more effective if they allude to <b>meanings</b> <b>shared</b> on a social and cultural level and if they are adjusted to contemporary cognition. We empirically test our arguments by exploring 15 cases of rebranding of Portuguese enterprises. We focused on the logotype as the main element of the brand, and we conducted a comparative visual analysis which combined the methods of content analysis and semiotic analysis. Plus, we complemented our visual analysis with qualitative interviews to one member of each organization who was involved in the rebranding process. Our findings showed that the brands which allude to more meanings and to more ambiguous meanings and which have more levels of meaning (denotation, connotation, myth) are more effective in generating identification and emotional relationships. Furthermore, they are cognitively more engaging and involving. We hope that our research contributes in an applied way to enhance creativity and communication effectiveness in brand design and in branding...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 How do {{organizational}} members <b>socially</b> {{construct the}} <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> of a mandated {{change in the}} external environment? The opportunity {{to address this question}} presented itself when President Barack Obama set forth a goal for American community colleges {{to increase the number of}} students completing certificates and degrees by 5 million by the year 2020. As an external mandate, the explicit prioritization of completion is a relatively recent phenomena. This interpretive qualitative study explored the ways in which organizational members <b>socially</b> construct the <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> of a change in the external environment by examining how community college faculty, as organizational members, construct the concept of completion. Phenomenology was employed as a guiding theoretical and methodological framework. Using saturation sampling, the self-reported perceptions of community college faculty were collected via audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcript data was subjected to a six-step process of inductive, constant comparison analysis, which yielded ten categories, or subthemes. These categories were further subjected to constant comparison, which yielded four major themes: external dictate, legitimacy, ownership, and enactment. External dictate confirmed member cognizance of changes in the external environment, and indicated that members are aware of the potential impact of those changes. Legitimacy and ownership confirmed the process of meaning making and provided insight into how that meaning is constructed. Enactment confirmed, as posited by Living Systems Theory, that system members act upon meaning in self-sustaining ways. The interdependent functioning of the four themes suggests that shared vision is system-generated as members, not only socially construct changes in the environment, but also socially construct the vision that ultimately constitutes the organization's transformation. These findings serve to inform our understanding of the role of shared vision in advancing organizational transformation. Leaders must acknowledge that system members socially construct the meaning of change in the external environment. Furthermore, rather than attempt to establish a vision, astute leaders will socially construct the vision in consort with system members...|$|R
40|$|Human beings {{construct}} meaning. We use {{meaning and}} complexes of meaning to understand ourselves, each other, {{and the world}} around us. We can coordinate our expectations, beliefs, and actions <b>socially</b> when we <b>share</b> <b>meaning</b> or a complex structure of meaning, e. g. a world-view, paradigm, theory, an interpretation, or a proposition. When everybody in a given population shares an interpretation we call it culture. Meaningfulness is a pragmatic condition not only for sharing an intersubjective understanding, but also for motivating collective action. In order to have socially robust norms and knowledge we must not only <b>share</b> <b>meaning,</b> {{it must also be}} meaningful and valid somehow in order to be useful. Philosophy has taught us that we in principle can justify and validate by establishing an introspective or intuitive relation to our own thoughts, by establishing a relation to objects in the world, or by establishing a linguistic relation to other linguistic constructs of meaning. In a pragmatic perspective all explicit justification is justifying a proposition by other propositions, etc. (Rorty 1979 : 159). In a linguistic-pragmatic perspective all references are made {{in the form of a}} proposition stating the existence of such a relationship, which accordingly may exist or not, be true or not, or be useful or not, depending on which kind of rationality test we apply. Making such a reference explicit is making it socially accessible. Making it explicit is establishing a meaningful reference or inference. Making it <b>socially</b> accessible presupposes <b>shared</b> <b>meaning.</b> We have as human beings the ability to refer to a range of things including our thoughts, each other, symbols, concepts, constructs of meanings, and objects. Without the ability to make references our world as we know it would collapse. Lacking the ability to refer, we would e. g. have a problem of interpreting, remembering, and conceptualizing the world. In fact, the ability to refer is a presupposition of our having a directed consciousness and a language. The phenomenon of referring is fundamental to subjective thought processes and intersubjective communication. The ability to establish a reference precedes the ability to share it as more or less semantically fixed. When we reflect on linguistic behavior in language a kind of pragmatic self-reference is established, this is because we cannot escape the medium, but are always already situated within it.

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} trace how Latin American {{migrants}} residing in Oslo use group categories for self- and other-identification for the negotiation {{and construction of}} identities in interaction. Identity construction is an essential process for migration and resettlement, as the relocation of the self in a new context requires a constant process of redefinition of the self {{in relation to the}} new environment and community. I consider group categorization labels such as "foreigner," "Norwegian," etc., to function as discourse strategies by which participants are able to index social relations and situations that exceed the actual interactional situation of the interview, following De Fina‘s (2003; 2006) analytical model of identity construction in interaction. Categories also function as resources for stance-taking (Jaffe 2009), by which the participants position themselves in relation to the implicit meanings of the categories, thus negotiating and constructing individual identities, which are non-reducible to single categorization labels. The goals of this thesis are to study how categorization functions as an identity construction strategy in narratives of personal experience, and to trace the schematic meanings of category labels that are implicit in the narrative sequences that thus function as a resource for the interactional construction of situated individual identities. In order to achieve these goals, I use a discourse analytic approach to categorization in narrative that can account for the functioning of categorization in the narratives and for <b>socially</b> <b>shared,</b> presupposed <b>meanings</b> of categories.

40|$|Em análise de pesquisas desenvolvidas para a compreensão da aprendizagem, encontramos diversos trabalhos que discutem as causas dos entraves emergentes no processo de escolarização. Contudo, acreditamos que as investigações devem se estabelecer nas relações que permeiam os processos de ensino e aprendizagem ao invés de buscar responsáveis pela não ocorrência. A escola é uma das instituições sociais responsáveis pela preservação da cultura e pela inclusão dos sujeitos no universo de significados compartilhados socialmente. Contudo, concepções deterministas compartilhadas na e pela escola podem revelar nessa instituição um potencial reverso, excluindo e marginalizando os sujeitos que deveriam ser acolhidos. A partir dos estudos de Vygotsky, orientados pela perspectiva histórico-cultural, realizamos pesquisa com duas professoras e uma pedagoga de um serviço interdisciplinar. Nossa pesquisa visa compreender as concepções dessas profissionais, sobre aprendizagem e desenvolvimento, diante do início do processo de escolarização de determinado aluno. As informações construídas, com o auxílio de observações, análises documentais, entrevistas e registros em áudio e vídeo, permitiram a contextualização dos fatos, reconstituindo um espaço-tempo que possibilitou a reflexão e a discussão de concepções que fundamentam a prática pedagógica. Constatamos que as práticas pedagógicas ainda estão direcionadas para uma concepção de educação que visa, sobretudo, o acúmulo de conhecimento, a repetição e reprodução de ideias. Diante do exposto, verificou-se que as práticas pedagógicas movimentam, revelam e constituem concepções históricas e culturalmente partilhadas no contexto escolar. Assim é preciso compreender as concepções que acompanham esses sujeitos a fim de ressignificá-las buscando práticas que considerem a bidirecionalidade dos processos de significação que ocorrem em meio às instituições escolares. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTAnalysis {{developed}} in the research for the understanding of learning, we found several papers that discuss the causes of emerging obstacles in the schooling process. However, we believe that investigations should establish the relationships that underlie the processes {{of teaching and learning}} rather than seek responsible for nonoccurrence. The school is one of the social institutions responsible for preservation of culture and the inclusion of subjects in the universe of <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> <b>meanings.</b> However, deterministic conceptions shared by the school and can prove this institution a reverse potential, excluding and marginalizing the subjects that should be welcomed. From the studies of Vygotsky, guided by historicalcultural perspective, research conducted with two teachers and a pedagogue of an interdisciplinary service. Our research aims to understand the conceptions of these professionals on learning and development, before the beginning of the particular student enrollment process. The information built with the help of observations, documentary analysis, interviews and records audio and video, allow the contextualization of facts, reconstructing a space-time which allowed the reflection and discussion of the concepts that underlie pedagogical practice. We found that pedagogical practices are still directed to a conception of education that seeks, above all, knowledge accumulation, repetition and reproduction of ideas. Given the above, {{it was found that the}} pedagogical practices move, reveal and constitute historical and culturally shared conceptions in the school context. So you need to understand the concepts that accompany these subjects offering new significance to them seeking practices that consider the bidirectionality of signification processes occurring among the schools...|$|R
40|$|A {{semiotic}} actor creates, {{uses and}} transfers or communicates meaning {{with the help}} of signs in order to interact with other actors and society. For a complete understanding of the cognitive and social phenomena related to this process, we state that social science and cognitive science cannot stay in their own arenas. The use of social constructivism or construction sheds light on the relationship and interaction between the individual (cognition) and society. The semiotic actor is not merely a stimulus response actor that exchanges signs; it has a cognitive system that creates new signs, modifies (the meaning of) signs, and forgets signs (cognitive limited semiosis). Secondly, the semiotic actor has the capability to incorporate and influence the environment (semiotic Umwelt or "outer'' world) as part of its cognitive "inner'' world. And thirdly, linguistic capabilities allow it to <b>socially</b> construct and <b>share</b> <b>meaning</b> with others, thereby empowering itself and others to create social structures and express social behavior (e. g., reciprocity, empathy). The contribution of our work is to emphasize that social construction needs to be grounded in cognitive science, i. e., the semiotic actor or homo semioticus enables us to reason that signs in social science are represented as signs in cognition and the other way around (semiotic resonance) ...|$|R
40|$|Meaning {{is thought}} to {{influence}} choice among alternative activities and how an occupation is performed. Since the self-organizing process of engagement and purpose of doing an activity are mechanisms bringing about systematic changes {{a greater understanding of}} children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of interest, value and social significance in the things they do is important for understanding development of occupation. Although adults create the sociocultural niches where children engage in their daily activities, adults are not the only source for learning about or <b>socially</b> <b>sharing</b> in occupational <b>meaning.</b> Peers 2 ̆ 7 activities include value-rich information that children observe, reflect on, interpret and incorporate into their definitions of situations related to their own occupations.

30|$|Among {{the studies}} {{addressing}} the issue of regulation of learning within groups, a proliferation of terms regarding metacognitive and regulatory processes is present: shared regulation (Volet et al. 2009 a), <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> regulation and <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> metacognitive regulation (Volet 2001; Khosa and Volet 2014; Iiskala et al. 2011; Volet et al. 2009 b; De Backer et al. 2015); <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> metacognition (Iiskala et al. 2004); and social regulation (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011). Social regulation can range from other-regulation to <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> regulation. The term other-regulation is applied to situations in which a ‘momentary unequal situation’ arises (Volet et al. 2009 b): one student temporarily predominates the group’s interactions and takes the guiding role in the joint activity, in a directive or facilitative way (Vauras et al. 2003; Volet et al. 2009 b; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2014; Khosa and Volet 2013, 2014; Schoor et al. 2015; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2015). The term <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> regulation—it has been used interchangeably with the term <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> metacognition, although the latter is more focused on the regulation of cognition—refers to those ‘individuals’ metacognitive processes that operate as a genuine social entity, aimed at a single objective, that is, the fully shared goal of the activity’ (Iiskala 2011, p. 379). In other words, it regards all the social processes that groups use to regulate their joint work on a task (Volet et al. 2009 b), independently of the level {{and the quality of}} the regulated object.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} in political science has uncovered evidence of a “split personality” among Americans when it comes to racial attitudes, whereby people express different attitudes in public than they personally hold. A common assumption is that people adjust their personal attitudes to conform to dominant social norms. At present, however, there is no theoretical model that could account for the emergence of racial norms that are at odds with people’s personal attitudes. This paper proposes a simple neural model of racial attitude formation that makes an important distinction between <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> and idiosyncratic racial attitudes. <b>Socially</b> <b>shared</b> attitudes reflect evaluations that are culturally transmitted and may not necessarily represent an individual’s personal views. In contrast, idiosyncratic attitudes represent a sense of interpersonal ‘chemistry’ that may be at odds with dominant social norms. A computational model based on Kimura’s (1983) Neutral Theory of Evolution predicts that <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> racist attitudes may be able to coexist with, and eventually be replaced by, more favorable idiosyncratic racial attitudes. In order to investigate racial attitudes unencumbered by considerations of social desirability and ‘political correctness,’ this study augments traditional survey measures with a number of reaction time based measures of non-conscious racial attitudes. <b>Socially</b> <b>shared,</b> non-conscious attitudes are measured using implicit racial priming based on a lexical decision task. Idiosyncratic non-conscious attitudes are measured using a timed trait rating procedure to measure feelings of implicit closeness towards African Americans and White Americans. Experimental results (N= 555) support the predictions derived from the computational model. They suggest that <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> racial attitudes (as measured by implicit priming) are biased in a pro-White and anti-Black direction, even among non-White participants. This bias is interpreted as a subconscious remnant of old racist norms. On the idiosyncratic level, however, an entirely different picture emerges. Attitudes that are measured by the timed trait rating procedure are much more favorable toward African Americans. A multivariate analysis suggests that implicit closeness to Blacks drives support for race related policies such as affirmative action. Thus, idiosyncratic racial attitudes may be able to overcome the lingering effect of <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> racist attitudes. The implications of the theoretical model and the empirical findings of this study are discussed and future research projects are proposed...|$|R

In this paper, we address the complexity of building <b>shared</b> <b>meaning.</b> We examine the communication breakdowns that occurred in two globally distributed virtual teams by providing an analytical distinction of the organizational context as the foundation for building <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> at three levels. Also we investigate communication breakdowns that can be attributed to differences in lifeworld structures, organizational structures, and work process structures within a virtual team. We find that all communication breakdowns are manifested and experienced by the participants at the work process level; however, resolving breakdowns may require critical reflection at other levels. Where previous research argues that face-to-face interaction is an important variable for virtual team performance, our empirical observations reveal that communication breakdowns related to a lack of <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> at the lifeworld level often becomes more salient when the participants are co-located than when geographically distributed. Last, we argue that creating translucence in communication structures is essential for building <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> at all three levels...|$|R
