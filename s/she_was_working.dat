5|$|Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the {{newspaper}} campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she {{not have a}} separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>working.</b> Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal.

5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, {{it took more}} than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone {{in his apartment}} in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics {{on top of the}} basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> on {{her third}} novel, Beauty's Hour, {{and it is}} likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and {{may have contributed to the}} characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
