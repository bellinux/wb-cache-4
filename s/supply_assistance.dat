Pacific Fleet's (COMNAVSURFPAC) Supply Maintenance Training Team (SMTT). The effectiveness of the SMIT program is also evaluated. Data were gathered from surveys of current and former Supply Officers of COMNAVSURFPAC ships, with the Shipboard Non-tactical Automated Data Processing II system installed and which had received all or part of an SMTT assistance visit. Interviews were conducted with selected Navy and civilian contractor members of the SMTT staff. Data were also gathered from various records and reports maintained by the SMTT staff and by COMNAVSURFPAC's <b>Supply</b> <b>Assistance</b> Center. The nature of the cost/benefit data of the SMTT program did not lend itself to a homogenous comparison of costs to benefits. The authors have determined that an attempt to "homogenize" the data with the use of economic "shadow prices" was of little value in meeting the "measurable performance" criteria of the cost/benefit analysis. Therefore, in strict terms, a cost/effectiveness analysis was accomplished. The analysis indicated that the SMTT program has resulted in positive gains in afloat supply operations. Many intangible benefits are derived from the assistance visit and there are indications of tangible benefits in the form of dollar and manhour savings. The trend of the data shows a valuable program to the fleet. Although not definitive due to data limitations, the analysis indicates a high probability that the benefits of operations of the different SMTT components exceed the costs in varying degrees.

40|$|Entering {{mathematical}} expressions into {{a computer}} {{can be done in}} a variety of ways. One favorite is a constrained input in which the human is (in more or less subtle ways) forced to enter syntactically correct formulas through the use of prompts, templates, or selections from menus. Done well, the user does not feel so much constrained as assisted. To be comfortable, the system must anticipate the nature of expressions being entered and provide sufficient flexibility to allow what appears to be natural input. An alternative is free-form input, where the user can type or (handwrite) or speak essentially anything, and the computer system must try {{to make sense of it}} or signal errors. In supporting free-form input, especially by speech or handwriting, it is logical for us to assume that some of the symbols will be misrecognized or missed. Even with keyboard input, users will often enter a syntactically erroneous or incomplete expression. We would like to preserve partial expressions or some good parts, and we should <b>supply</b> <b>assistance</b> in repairing the errors. For this purpose we would like to display the expression “as best we can ” in the nature of a constrained input form or template. With this displayed for the user, we can welcome corrections to this best guess. To do this nicely we show how to provide a framework for display of broken expressions. Tools akin to error-correction in parsers seem most relevant. However, in our experience only a small fragment of “real ” mathematics notation is unambiguous and context free, typically that used for programming languages such as Fortran. For real math, we don’t even know the full grammar, and probably do not wish to know it. For these reasons the usual error correction methods may not be quite on target. In summary, our goal is to say, “the expression you entered can be typeset as shown. But before going much further, please fix it up so there are no loose ends”. ...|$|E

Cilj mu je saniranje najtežih socijalnih problema. On obuhvaća stare i nove mjere socijalne zaštite najugroženijeg stanovništva. Prema rezultatima s kraja studenog 1993. godine pomoć iz Socijalnog programa dobilo je 241 tisuća građana Hrvatske, a potrošeno je 115 mln DEM. Socijalni program ima privremeni karakter i služi za prevladavanje kritične faze u razvoju Hrvatske, uzrokovane velikosrpskom agresijom, te problemima prelaza iz socijalističkog u demokratsko društvo. Because the Greater-Serbia-aggression, the Republic of Croatia {{has found}} itself in a very {{difficult}} situation after having gained its independence. One fourth of its territory is occupied, many settlements and industrial plants are destroyed, and some very important branches of economy, like tourism for example, have been blocked due to the cut off communications among different parts of the country. Croatia has been compelled to accommodate a large number of displaced people, refugees and other war victims. The result of all this is a significant decrease of the living standards of the citizens of Croatia. The average monthly salary today amounts to about DM 200. apart from displaced people and refugees, the most affected are the categories of citizens that even before the war used to live with difficulty: the unemployed, the retired and the low income citizens. In order to protect the most severely threatened citizens, the Government of Croatia adopted on March 11, 1993 the Social Programme and then some amendments to the same Programme on August 24, 1993. The Social Programme covers some previously existing protection measures for the poor but it has also included some new ones like the housing costs allowances, assistance in the form of food, clothing and footwear, bread and milk subsidies, free school-books for poor children and firewood <b>supply</b> <b>assistance.</b> Citizens who have been assisted by the government receive a social card on which each assistance is recorded. By the end of November 1993, the social card was given to 105. 107 families with 241. 091 members. This Programme does not cover displaced people, refugees and other war victims that are given separate attention. In {{the first nine months of}} the application of the Social Programme, 115 million DM have been spent. The Social Programme is an instrument of a defensive social policy. Its goal is to overcome the most difficult social problems during the critical period that the Republic of Croatia is undergoing.

40|$|F. Todd Smith 2 ̆ 7 s work {{provides}} the first detailed {{history of the}} Indians of Texas and the Near Southwest, an area encompassing parts of present day Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma over a seventy-four year period. Foremost, it highlights the competing efforts of the Spanish, French, American, and later Texan governments to control and maintain boundaries in the region, much of which depended {{on the ability of}} colonial powers to provide trade goods to tribes, and to <b>supply</b> <b>assistance</b> in the form of protection against then-existing enemy tribes. The Spanish inability consistently to provide trade goods and the growing intercession of illegal colonial traders in one another 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 territories 2 ̆ 2 created a pattern of shifting trade and conflict that further contributed to the political instability and frequent demographic shifts of local populations. From Dominance to Disappearance specifically highlights several European influences, including the appointment of tribal leaders by colonial governors; the importance of giving trade goods as gifts to establish and maintain alliance, friendship, and military support from tribes against other tribes and colonial powers; the use of trade as incentives to raid from competing Indian and Anglo groups; and the ways colonial powers contested boundaries and the rights to trade in specific areas. Maintaining numerical superiority over Euro-Americans through {{the first half of this}} period allowed Native populations to influence directly the economic, military, and political affairs of the region. The period after Mexican independence from Spain (1820 - 1835) and Texan independence from Mexico (1836 - 1845), however, resulted in the brutal and rapid decline of Native peoples. As their power and population quickly decreased, so did their ability to resist increased settlement and hostilities. Within twenty-five years of gaining independence from Mexico, Texas had removed all Indians except the AlabamaCoushatta from its borders. Smith addresses the numerous influences that led to Native population declines in this region, such as disease, waning subsistence bases, increased dependence on Anglo food sources, alcohol, warfare, forced indebtedness, a struggling mission experience, encroaching Anglo settlement, pressure to sell their lands, and repeated relocations. He demonstrates how varied Anglo powers strategically courted and supplied tribes when it benefited their interests, then ignored and neglected them when their support was no longer needed. He also provides examples of the greed of many traders, Indian agents, the U. S. government, the Texas Militia, and settlers, as well as how Texas presidents held alternating war and peace policies, and how the U. S. aided Indian raids into Mexico...|$|E
40|$|Dans le présent article, les auteurs tentent de situer la place de la politique de main-d'oeuvre à l'intérieur de l’éventail des différentes politiques publiques, notamment les politiques économiques et les politiques sociales. This paper {{tries to}} {{identify}} the place of manpower policy in the spectrum of public policies, and more particularly economic and social policies. A manpower policy exists {{in relation to the}} labour market and, more specifically, labour market problems. The objective of manpower policy, in such a context, is to correct labour market problems and operating difficulties in a preventive or curative manner. Many public policies can influence one or more aspects of the phenomenon of work and therefore the labour market. On the other hand, the efficiency of many specific instruments of economic or social policies depends largely on the efficiency of work and therefore of the labour market. This suggests the dynamic interdependency and complementarity between manpower policy and economic and social policies. To better distinguish between different public policies it becomes necessary to try to determine the zone of performance of each of them, in the interest of better policy making and implementation. Public policy is defined here as the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to improve the functioning of society or of a particular group of Society. Such state intervention has become necessary since it has been proven that a certain number of problems cannot find a solution by themselves. The State can intervene by a series of instruments. It has been chosen to focus on the following: economic, social and education policies. Economic policy is defined as the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to improve the economic functioning of society or of a particular group of society. The effects of such a policy are not solely economic and are not necessarily equal for everyone. Nor are they equal for all parts of the territory. There is therefore a need of more specific complementary instruments aiming at solving particular problems for given groups and/or given regions. Social policy is defined as the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to insure income protection and to <b>supply</b> <b>assistance</b> to particular groups facing particular problems, in order to allow them to function "normally" in society. To the extent that such income protection and specific assistance are sought through the labour market, the interdependency and complementarity between social and manpower policies become obvious. The education policy is defined by the set of actions and decisions taken by the State in order to encourage, for each citizen, the acquisition of knowledge and skills. To the extent that such knowledge and skills are essential ingredients for the functioning of individuals on the labour market, the interdependency and complementarity between education and manpower policies become obvious. Manpower policy is defined as the set of decisions and actions taken by the State to improve the functioning of the labour market. As such, manpower policy has economic and social dimensions. Manpower policy cannot by itself find a solution to all labour market problems since the labour market is influenced by other public policies. Manpower policy must therefore adjust to other public policies, and vice versa, in order to maximize labour market functioning. Manpower policy therefore, plays a complementary role purely in the short or medium term because of the dynamics of the labour market, and because the long term aspect of the labour market is mostly in the spectrum of other public policies. In such a context, a grey zone between manpower policy and other public policies is inevitable. The most important difference between manpower policy and economic policy is that the former aims at offering selective actions for given groups with specific characteristics. Since the most important function of social policy is income protection, its link with manpower policy is such that manpower policy seeks to insure a more equitable distribution of opportunities for individuals on the labour market and a better quality of professional life. In the matter of skill and knowledge acquisition, the education policy mainly touches the consumption aspect of education, except perhaps for skill training of youth within the normal schooling network. Because of its nature, manpower policy then mainly touches the short and medium investment aspect of adult education. However, the subjective difference between investment in education and consumption of education makes it more difficult to generalize as to the specific zones of performance of education and manpower policies. It is therefore possible to offer a certain number of general criteria to help determine if such and such public policy instrument having an effect on the labour market is part of the zone of performance of manpower policy or not. a) manpower policy instruments- correspond to a specific need in the labour market;- direct and selective;- focus in the short and medium termb) Other public policy instruments- correspond to a general need of society or of a particular group but not for labour market purposes;- mainly macro;- direct in the long term;- indirect in the medium and long term. c) Grey zone instruments- direct, intended and controled but belonging to another public policy than manpower policy...|$|E
