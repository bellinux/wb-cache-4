Psychological abuse can erode a woman’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-worth</b> and can be incredibly harmful to overall mental and physical wellbeing.

25|$|One {{example of}} {{clinical}} {{work is that}} done by music therapists who work with adolescents to increase their emotional and cognitive stability, identify factors contributing to distress and initiate changes to alleviate that distress. Music therapy may also focus on improving {{quality of life and}} building self-esteem, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-worth,</b> and confidence. Improvements in these areas can be measured by a number of tests, including qualitative questionnaires like Beck's Depression Inventory, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Relationship Change Scale. Effects of music therapy can also be observed in the patient's demeanor, body language, and changes in awareness of mood.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft {{promised her}} readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another {{philosophical}} treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled The Wrongs of Woman.

Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar Anne K. Mellor has phrased it, [...] "the wrongs done to women and the wrongs done by women" [...] (emphasis Mellor's). The wrongs done to women include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while the wrongs done by women include a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-worth</b> generated through the language of sensibility. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, [...] (1788), The Wrongs of Woman offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses class boundaries.|$|E

50|$|Narrative {{psychology}} {{proposes that}} people construct life stories {{as a way}} to understand life events and impose meaning on life, thus connecting explanation the individual to the event. Meaningfulness is a subjective evaluation of how well these stories connect to the person. Furthermore, meaningfulness is actualized through positive functioning, satisfaction with life, the enjoyment of work, happiness, positive affect and hope. Meaningfulness can also be translated into physical health and a generalized well-being. Baumeister posits that meaningfulness is divided into four needs: <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose, efficacy, value, and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> positive <b>self-worth.</b>|$|R
500|$|Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's {{personification}} of evilthe most active and self-aware villain {{in any of}} her novels. Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of {{the will of the}} masses, but his actual desire is for power over others. He controls individual victims by destroying their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-worth,</b> and seeks broader power (over [...] "the world", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the British democratic socialist Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.|$|E

The only time he recalls feeling a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-worth</b> was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E

In 1906, Rachmaninoff moved his family to Dresden, Germany and spent his time intensively composing, only to return to the Ivanovka family estate in the summer.

His first recital occurred at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts on 4 November 1909 and his first with an orchestra followed on 8 November. He conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra for his conducting debut, and premiered his Piano Concerto [...] (Op.30) with the New York Symphony Orchestra.

Infants, as they grow older, will become more adept in self-regulation of their emotions and states, while being socialised by their caregivers into what the adults deem to be culturally and socially appropriate and desirable behaviour patterns. Parents and children exert mutual influences in shaping each other.
