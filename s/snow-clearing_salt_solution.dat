Dipping in hot <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> (3 mass%NaCl in distilled water) for 105 s at 373 K increased the overweight of composite samples, whereas {{the addition of}} aluminum with dispersed powders (A 1 -addition) from zero to 40 vol%Al decreased the overweigh of the sample. Based on the experiment results and kinetic analysis, aluminum powder dispersion in nylon 6 decreased the saturated overweigh of composites at infinite time.

The Al addition apparently increased the n value of composites with less than 20 vol%Al in <b>salt</b> <b>solution,</b> {{as well as with}} less than 30 vol%Al in distilled water.
