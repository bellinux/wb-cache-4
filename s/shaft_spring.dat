As these activities are being carried out daily, there is possibilty of setting the neighbouring and adjacent buildings into vibration. In order to avert the inherent danger of building collapse, this research work, Computer aided design of dashpot for machinery with masses between 40 Kg and 2000 Kg is necessitated for. The dashpot is designed after the similitude of an automobile shock absorber. It comprises cylinder (piston housing), piston, connecting rod (<b>shaft),</b> <b>spring,</b> rubber pad or silencer rubber, plate (load carrier), fluid and rubber seal. The work done was designed using virtual engineering through Computer aided design and simulation of the dashpot in AUTOCAD together with 3 D studio max. Adobe premiere and Visual Basic 6. 0 is used to design parts of the interfaces for simulation to see {{the effect of this}} when being loaded with machinery of various tonnages. The still images are edited with adobe Photoshop and fireworks, and the text animation was done with Adobe premiere. The result of the research work is moderately perfected and the knowledge has therein could be used in designing for other machinery as the need arise...|$|E
40|$|The {{centrifugal}} clutch offers many advantages in motor and engine drive applications. Utilizing the {{centrifugal clutch}} enables {{the selection of}} normal torque motors for running loads rather than the selection of high torque motors for starting loads. The aim of this project is to be describing the torque carrying capacity at different speed which using in transmitting power. The entire work based on conventional design with ferrodo lining, driving <b>shaft,</b> <b>spring,</b> shoe, spider, cover plate, driven shaft. The detail design for various speed {{is made in the}} centrifugal clutch to select an operating range of speed under which the application are designed for torque transmission. In this project the design calculation are worked out analytically. Along with this we have introduced a compliant clutch. Compliant clutch is made from polypropylene material and there is no anyone connecting parts. it has rigid body design since revolute joints are replaced by flexible segment. The potential energy store in flexible segment can replace springs and reduction in revolute joints reduces problem with backlash and wear. The compliant clutch includes rigid body mechanism through dimensional synthesis by graphical method. A mechanism is evaluated and synthesized specific force-deflection relationship. In many applications, compliant mechanism can maintain or even improve performance relative to conventional rigid body designs. It is cost benefitted. Also conventional clutch is expensive rather than compliant clutch...|$|E

40|$|Atomically precise {{manufacturing}} systems, such {{as those}} described in Nanosystems [1], will utilize molecular motors and actuators 1 that drive components to perform useful work.

40|$|AbstractTorsion bar springs are {{dynamically}} loaded {{machine elements}} which can break due to fatigue. High strength fine-grain steel, grade VCN is normally used for <b>springs</b> or <b>shafts.</b> <b>Springs</b> {{are used as}} shock absorbers in caterpillar machines, where the diameters and lengths of the springs are limited. Springs should meet the requirements regarding spring constant (applied torque vs. twist angle), twist angle magnitude, and overcome the prescribed fatigue lifetime (number of fatigue cycles to failure). Using twist angle, {{it is possible to}} increase the elastic-plastic presetting of a torsion bar. A spring made as a torsion bar may exhibit different fatigue behaviour regarding to different elastic-plastic presetting torques. Experimentally obtained results show that fatigue lifetime strongly depends on the ratio between the preset elastic-plastic torque and the applied fatigue loading range. A model for fatigue lifetime and shear stress level is proposed in spite of relative small number of tested specimens...|$|R

50|$|Pneumatic: the {{governor}} mechanism detects air {{flow from the}} flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine's blower housing and linked to the carburetor's throttle <b>shaft.</b> A <b>spring</b> pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. Pneumatic governors are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.|$|R

Long and earnestly I had scanned {{them through the}} glasses. Now {{was the time to}} see them close, and from beneath. I soon guessed (and rightly) that I was looking at that Palma de Jagua, {246} which excited--and no wonder--the enthusiasm of the usually unimpassioned Humboldt. [...] Magnificent as the tree is when its radiating leaves are viewed from above, it is even more magnificent when you stand beneath it. The stem, like that of the Coconut, usually curves the height of a man ere it rises in a shaft for fifty or sixty feet more. From the summit of that <b>shaft</b> <b>springs</b> a crown--I had rather say, a fountain-- of pinnated leaves; only eight or ten of them; but five-and-twenty feet long each. For three-fourths of their length they rise at an angle of 45 degrees or more; for the last fourth they fall over, till the point hangs straight down; and each leaflet, which is about two feet and a half long, falls over in a similar curve, completing the likeness of the whole to a fountain of water, or a gush of rockets. I stood and looked up, watching the innumerable curled leaflets, pale green above and silver-gray below, shiver and rattle amid the denser foliage of the broad-leaved trees; and then went on to another and to another, to stare up again, and enjoy the mere shape of the most beautiful plant I had ever beheld, excepting always the Musa Ensete, from Abyssinia, in the Palm-house at Kew.

50|$|For {{certain types}} of {{electric}} motors or generators to function, the coils of the rotor must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. To accomplish this, a copper or brass commutator or 'slip rings' are affixed to the <b>shaft,</b> and <b>springs</b> press braided copper wire 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current. Such brushes provided poor commutation as they moved from one commutator segment to the next. The cure was the introduction of 'high resistance brushes' made from graphite (sometimes with added copper). Although the resistance was {{of the order of}} tens of milliohms, they were high resistance enough to provide a gradual shift of current from one commutator segment to the next. The term brush remains in use. Since the brushes wear out, they can be replaced in products intended to allow maintenance.|$|R
50|$|An Oldham {{coupling}} {{has three}} discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined {{to the first}} two by tongue and groove. The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center {{at the same speed}} as the input and output shafts. Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output <b>shafts.</b> Often <b>springs</b> are used to reduce backlash of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for John Oldham who invented it in Ireland, in 1821, to solve a problem in a paddle steamer design.|$|R

50|$|For {{situations}} that require precision, such as instrumentation and control, backlash can be minimised {{through one of}} several techniques.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common use of {{centrifugal}} switches is within single-phase, split-phase induction motors. Here, the switch is used to disconnect the starting winding of the motor once the motor approaches its normal operating speed. In this case, the centrifugal switch consists of weights mounted to the shaft of the motor and held near the <b>shaft</b> by <b>spring</b> force. At rest, levers attached to the weights press a low-friction, non-conductive plate against a set of electrical contacts mounted to the motor housing, closing the contacts and connecting the starting winding to the power source. When the motor approaches its normal operating speed, centrifugal force overcomes the spring force and the weights swing out, raising the plate away from the electrical contacts. This allows the contacts to open and disconnects the starting winding from the power source; the motor then continues operating solely using its running winding. Motors using such a centrifugal switch make a distinct clicking noise when starting and stopping as the centrifugal switch opens and closes.|$|R

5000|$|Up to 1860 Saxon {{appears to}} have mainly {{concentrated}} on engine repair work and producing mill gearing and <b>shafting.</b> <b>Spring</b> Works was extended in 1860 {{by the addition of}} an erecting shop, when engine making seems to have started in a small way, and was further expanded in 1870. An example of an early Saxon engine was one built in the 1860s for a Manchester confectionery firm which was a horizontal single cylinder non-condensing engine, 60 ihp, with a Meyer variable cut-off slide valve. The construction of larger engines had started by 1870/71 when they built a horizontal cross compound engine, possibly for an Oldham customer, which used steam at the relatively high pressure for that time of 100 lbs psi. By 1875 Saxon was building engines of between 750 and 1,000 ihp, for the new 'Oldham Limiteds'. These were mostly horizontal twin tandem compound engines - a 4-cylinder design for which Saxons became noted during {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. During 1871-80 Saxons are known to have built at least 10 engines with a capacity of about 6,800 ihp, mostly for cotton mills. [...] George Saxon engines were charactised by having a long stroke and high operating speed.They used Corliss valves on their large mill engines from around 1890 onwards, having previously used slide valves in their engines. The Saxon design dispensed with the wrist plate and unusually placed Corliss valves on both the HP (high-pressure) and LP (low-pressure) cylinders where other designers, such as McNaught and Petrie would have used piston valves. Saxons were late adopters of Corliss valve engines but were quick to adopt the efficient triple-expansion engine design. During 1891 and 1892 they converted a number of large compound engines to triple-expansion, with a saving in fuel of up to 18%, and in 1892 they built their first horizontal twin tandem triple-expansion engine, 1,260 ihp, for Rock Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne. They also continued to build large horizontal twin tandem compound engines. Near-identical engines Saxons built in 1902 for Dawn Mill, Shaw, and Magnet Mill, Chadderton, developed 1400 hp at 140 psi and 1700 hp at 160 psi. The flywheels of these engines were 26 ft in diameter and weighed between 80 and 90 tons. The speed of 60 rpm and stroke of 5 ft were standard at this time.|$|R
