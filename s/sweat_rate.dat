50|$|People have {{an average}} of two to four million sweat glands. But how much sweat is {{released}} by each gland is determined by many factors, including gender, genetics, environmental conditions, age or fitness level. Two of the major contributors to <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> are an individual's fitness level and weight. If an individual weighs more, <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> is likely to increase because the body must exert more energy to function and there is more body mass to cool down. On the other hand, a fit person will start sweating earlier and more readily. As someone becomes fit, the body becomes more efficient at regulating the body's temperature and sweat glands adapt along with the body's other systems.|$|E
40|$|Isometric {{handgrip}} exercise (IHG) increases <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> {{without changing}} core or skin temperatures. The contribution of central command resulting in increases in <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> during IHG is unknown. To investigate this question, seven subjects performed IHG (35 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 2 min) followed by 2 -min of post-exercise ischaemia (PEI), {{with and without}} partial neuromuscular blockade (PNB). PNB was performed to augment central command during the IHG bout. These trials were conducted while the subject was normothermic, mildly heated, and moderately heated. On the non-exercising arm, forearm <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> was monitored over a microdialysis membrane perfused with neostigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), and at an adjacent untreated site. In normothermia with PNB, despite reduced force production during IHG (17 ± 9 versus 157 ± 13 N; P < 0. 001), the elevation in <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> at the neostigmine-treated site was greater relative to the control IHG bout (P < 0. 05). During subsequent PEI, for the PNB trial mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> returned towards pre-IHG levels, while during the control trial these variables remained elevated. During IHG while mildly heated, the elevation in <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> was greater during the PNB trial relative to the control trial. In contrast, during moderate heating sweating increased during IHG for both trials, however the elevation in <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> during the PNB trial was not greater than during the control trial.

Estimated <b>sweating</b> <b>rates</b> were low by comparison with previously reported values, probably due to rising levels of humidity under the polythene disks during exposure to the skin. B. indicus cross-bred cows had higher <b>sweating</b> <b>rates</b> than B. taurus cows at high air temperatures but the difference between the groups was not significant statistically. <b>Sweating</b> <b>rates</b> were generally highest on the shoulder and lowest on the lumbar region. The amounts of sodium and potassium recovered from filter papers were small and very variable at low air temperatures but increased significantly with air temperature (P < 0. 01).

The International Marathon Medical Directors Association (IMMDA) advises that runners drink a sports drink that includes carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and that runners should [...] "drink to thirst" [...] instead of feeling compelled to drink at every fluid station. Heat exposure leads to diminished thirst drive and thirst may not be a sufficient incentive to drink in many situations. The IMMDA and HSL Harpur Hill give recommendations to drink fluid in small volumes frequently at an approximate rate falling between 100 - 250 ml every 15 minutes. A patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood.

In days 20, 23 and 24 after the infestation, the 10 bigger females ticks found in whole animal were weighed {{and put in}} a chamber (27 oC and 80 % RH), weighing the egg mass of each female tick fourteen days after. The <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> (SRskin, measured by Scheleger and Turner, 1963, method, in a shaved area of shoulder skin) was evaluated in 14 /Apr (2 days before the a. i.) and in 05 /May (19 days after a. i.). In 14 /Apr the Scheleger and Turner, 1963, method was done on the coat not shaved (SRcoat). The <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> was measured in the afternoon (from 2 P.

The experimental design was a non-probability sample restricted to the 10 available animals. Data from the steers’ <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> were analyzed using the General linear models of the SPSS® statistical package (version 12. 0) using SRskin as dependent variable and breed and sampling date as independent variables. For SRcoat breed was the independent variable. Nellore, a tropical cattle breed, had higher SRskin (1, 000. 82 ± 64. 59 g m- 2 h- 1, P 0. 05). This indicates that the sweat increased the fur’s humidity of Holsteins and consequently diminished the <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> difference between breeds. Perhaps, this humidity in the coat could be favorable for the surviving of the tick hidden from direct sunlight below the hairs, on the skin. Ticks, especially larvae, are very sensitive to desiccation from direct sunlight. On May, the SRskin was negatively correlated with the egg mass (r= - 0. 713, P < 0. 05), probably because of the Nellore cattle.

Objective: To investigate the consistency between 2 heat stress and strain indices, ie, <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), for the assessment of heat stress of people working outdoor in arid and semi-arid regions in Iran. Methods: During spring and summer, 136 randomly selected outdoor workers were enrolled in this study.

One membrane was perfused with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine, while the other was perfused with the vehicle. In normothermia, IHG exercise increased <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> at the neostigmine-treated site but not at the control site. <b>Sweat</b> <b>rate</b> remained elevated during post-exercise ischaemia even after mean arterial blood pressure returned to the pre-IHG exercise baseline.

The <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> sensor was compared to a medical device that, although measuring a different physiological process, provides discrete data based on the same working principle, i. e. the diffusion of the water vapour emitted from the skin. Results Our sensor has a working range up to 400 g/m 2 ·h. The statistical analysis and the Bland-Altman plot proved that our sensor is comparable to the medical device used as gold standard. At low <b>sweat</b> <b>rate,</b> the bias is 3. 4 g/m 2 ·h with a standard deviation of 7. 6 g/m 2 ·h. At maximum sweat rates, the bias is 2. 3 g/m 2 ·h with a standard deviation 6. 9 g/m 2 ·h. The p values for the Bland-Altman plots at low and maximum <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 1331 and 0. 2477 obtained by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, respectively) allow the hypothesis that there is a significant difference between our <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> sensor and the medical device to be rejected.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two Portuguese (Alentejana and Mertolenga) and two exotic (Frisian and Limousine) cattle breeds in terms of the {{relationship}} between the increase in ambient temperature and the responses of the pathways of evaporative heat loss and the effects on homeothermy. In the experiment, six heifers of the Alentejana, Frisian, and Mertolenga breeds and four heifers of the Limousine breed were used. The animals were placed in four temperature levels, the first one in thermoneutral conditions and the other ones with increase levels of thermal stress. The increase in chamber temperatures had different consequences on the animals of each breed. When submitted to severe heat stress, the Frisian animals developed high thermal tachypnea (125 mov/min) and moderate <b>sweating</b> <b>rates</b> (117 g. m- 2. h- 1), which did not prevent an increase in the rectal temperature (from 38. 4 °C to 40. 0 °C). The Alentejana and Limousine breeds showed intermediate thermoregulatory reactions, with moderate increases in rectal temperature, especially during the period of greatest heat stress (from 38. 6 °C to 39. 4 °C and from 38. 87 °C to 39. 4 °C for Limousine and Alentejana, respectively). However, the importance and the intensity of evaporative heat loss pathways were different. The Limousine breed showed moderate levels of tachypnea (101 mov/min) while showing the lowest <b>rates</b> of <b>sweating</b> (95 g. m- 2. h- 1), which had a tendency for early stabilization. The Alentejana breed showed significant increases in <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> (156 g. m- 2. h- 1) that played a major role in homeothermy under conditions of moderate heat stress. With the tendency for higher heat storage, the involvement of tachypnea (112 mov/min) became clearer. The Mertolenga breed showed a superior stability of body temperature, even in the most severe conditions of heat stress (from 38. 5 °C to 39. 1 °C). However, the evaporative heat loss occurred in an uncommon way. The maintenance of homeothermy during moderate heat stress was achieved primarily by intense tachypnea (122 mov/min). This response is quite unusual in cattle, particularly when associated with low <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> and low heat storage.

Repeat testing of an R 117 H- 5 T/F 508 del subject detected only trace responding to ivacaftor. We conclude that in vivo, R 117 H PO is strongly increased by ivacaftor, but channel number, mainly determined by variable deletion of exon 10, has a marked influence on outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The ISO 7933 Required <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> Index is {{inappropriate}} {{under conditions of}} fluctuating exposure. Time weighted average values can introduce large underestimations as, for hot conditions, the relationship between physical stress and physiological strain is not linear. Mean skin temperature and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> vary as a first order system, that is, according to an exponential averaging system, {{in response to a}} step function of the primary parameters. A very simple algorithm has been derived to take into account this exponential averaging and to predict the <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> at any time, taking into account the past exposure of the subject. It is based on time constants of 3 min for the mean skin temperature and of 25 min (up to a <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 W. m- 2) and 10 min for the <b>sweat</b> <b>rate.</b> The correlation coefficient is 0. 780 between observed and predicted sweat rates in independent experiments used for the validation of the model. This emphasises the necessity for exponential averaging as differences between individuals are very important and the precision of the observed data in these experiments was lower than for laboratory experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of active heat acclimation on the sweat osmolality and sweat sodium ion concen-tration vs. <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> relationship in humans. Eight healthy male volunteers completed 10 days of exercise in the heat. The mean exercising heart rate and core temperature were significantly de-creased (P 0. 05) by 18 beats/min and 0. 6 °C, respectively, following heat acclimation. Furthermore, sweat osmolality and the sweat sodium ion concentration vs. <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> relationships were shifted to the right. Specifically, the slopes of the relationships were not affected by heat acclimation. Rather, heat acclimation significantly reduced the y-intercepts of the sweat osmolality and sweat sodium relationships with <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> by 28 mosmol/kgH 2 O and 15 mmol/l, respectively. Thus there was a significantly lower sweat sodium ion concentration for a given <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> following heat acclimation. These results suggest that heat acclimation increases the sodium ion reabsorption capacity of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at (1) {{deriving}} the best methodology for using heat stress indices in fluctuating ambient conditions, (2) assessing various ways {{for improving the}} prediction ability of the Required <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> index (SW(req)). The data base included the results from five experimental series involving 32 volunteers; these series involved environmental variations at constant metabolic rate, work-rest cycles in constant ambient conditions and alternate periods of work in heat and rest in neutral conditions. Observed and predicted variations in <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> were compared. During exposures to rapid changes in climatic conditions, the best prediction of the body sweat loss was provided by a model involving the simulation of the response of skin temperature and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> to a step change in ambient conditions. The model used exponential weighting algorithms with time constants of 3 and 10 minutes respectively for these two variables. The study showed also that the prediction accuracy of SW(req) index can be significantly improved by adopting a new expression for the calculation of the evaporative efficiency of sweating, by predicting the mean T(sk) value {{as a function of}} the parameters of the work situation and by applying the exponential weighting to the predicted values of <b>sweat</b> <b>rate.</b> Among the various heat stress indices tested in the study, the Required <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> Index gave the best approximation of the body sweat loss...|$|E

Some of the responses include: heart <b>rate,</b> <b>sweating,</b> <b>rate</b> and depth of respiration, and electrical activity in the brain.
