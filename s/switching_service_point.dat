50|$|The {{telephone}} exchange uses Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP), Signaling Connection and Control Part (SCCP) and INAP and in IN terms is a <b>service</b> <b>switching</b> <b>point</b> (SSP). It sends an INAP Initial Detection Point (IDP) {{message to the}} <b>service</b> control <b>point</b> (SCP). The SCP returns an INAP Connect message, which contains a geographic number to forward the call to.|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} a logically {{centralized}} control plane for the network was the main contribution of policy-based networking research in the 90 ’s where control policies are established at a logically centralized Policy-Decision Point (PDP) and communicated to network switches acting as Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) through a standard protocol (IETF COPS). Earlier, Intelligent Networks introduced the concept of <b>Service</b> Control <b>Point</b> (SCP), a logically centralized node where the service logic is located, and communicating with the switches – known as <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Points</b> (SSPs) over the standard Signaling System 7 (SS 7) protocol.|$|R
50|$|SS7 {{separates}} signalling {{from the}} voice circuits. An SS7 network {{must be made}} up of SS7-capable equipment from end to end in order to provide its full functionality. The network can {{be made up of}} several link types (A, B, C, D, E, and F) and three signaling nodes - <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Points</b> (SSPs), Signal Transfer <b>Points</b> (STPs), and <b>Service</b> Control <b>Points</b> (SCPs). Each node is identified on the network by a number, a signalling <b>point</b> code. Extended <b>services</b> are provided by a database interface at the SCP level using the SS7 network.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Point</b> (SSP) {{receives}} a message (ISUP Message) {{initiated by the}} Calling Party, this could be an IAM (Initial Address Message). The SSP evaluates {{the nature of the}} message, {{in the case of the}} IAM the called and calling party numbers. From this it determines whether it can route the call or whether it needs further instructions. In this case if the SSP does require further instructions it sends an IDP to a <b>service</b> control <b>point</b> SCP via an IN protocol. The protocol may be INAP but could be CAMEL, or be spoke INAP flavours such as Ericsson INAP, Nokia INAP, Siemens INAPor Huawei INAP.|$|R
50|$|A Signal Transfer Point (STP) is {{a router}} that relays SS7 {{messages}} between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include <b>service</b> <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> (SSPs) and <b>service</b> control <b>points</b> (SCPs). The STP {{is connected to}} adjacent SEPs and STPs via signaling links. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing signaling link. Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.|$|R
50|$|When a {{toll-free}} number is dialed, each digit is analyzed and processed by the LEC. The toll-free call {{is identified as}} such by the <b>service</b> <b>switching</b> <b>point</b> (SSP). The SSP is responsible for sending call information to the <b>service</b> control <b>point</b> (SCP), routing the request through at least one signal transfer point (STP) in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network. SS7 is a digital out-of-band method of transmitting signalling (call control) information in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The SS7 network is a packet-switched network carrying signaling data (setup and tear down of the call and services) separate from the circuit-switched bearer network (the payload of the telephone call) in the AIN services network. The SSP asks the SCP where to send the call.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> Function (SSF) or <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Point</b> (SSP) is {{co-located}} {{with the}} telephone exchange, and {{acts as the}} trigger <b>point</b> for further <b>services</b> to be invoked during a call. The SSP implements the Basic Call State Machine (BCSM) which is a Finite state machine that represents an abstract view of a call {{from beginning to end}} (off hook, dialing, answer, no answer, busy, hang up, etc.). As each state is traversed, the exchange encounters Detection Points (DPs) at which the SSP may invoke a query to the SCP to wait for further instructions on how to proceed. This query is usually called a trigger. Trigger criteria are defined by the operator and might include the subscriber calling number or the dialed number. The SSF is responsible for controlling calls requiring value added services.|$|R
40|$|A new {{congestion}} control algorithm for Intelligent Networks (IN) is proposed. The control algorithm {{is based on}} economic markets, employing software agents to act {{on behalf of the}} SCP or SSP as buyers and sellers of SCP capacity.

INTRODUCTION To enable network operators to create and maintain services quickly, the Intelligent Network (IN) concept was developed. All service software resides at the <b>Service</b> Control <b>Point</b> (SCP) which controls a number of <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Points</b> (SSP).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation of an Intelligent Network (IN) which reflects the actual physical {{architecture of the}} network and models the information flows required between network entities in order to execute various IN services. An effective congestion control strategy is implemented with a suitable detection method at the <b>Service</b> Control <b>Point</b> (SCP) and Automatic Code Gapping (ACG) as a throttle mechanism in the <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Points</b> (SSPs). Non-IN traffic is then introduced to the network {{and the effects of}} this extra load at the switches on the performance of the congestion control strategy is estimated using SCP queue length, SCP throughput and user response delays as the relevant criteria. 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} paper, we address the network design and demand routing in Intelligent Networks (IN). The problem aims to, simultaneously, locate <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Points</b> (SSP), assign calls to SSP, route these calls through the {{transmission}} links and determine transmission capacities on the links, {{in order to}} design the network at the lowest cost. The costs are dominated by SSP software licenses and link capacities. To cope with specific IN constraints, we develop a graph based model by adding appropriate virtual nodes and links in order to derive a linear mathematical program that integrates the four underlying sub-problems. The integrated problem is solved by a Branch-and-cut algorithm for a real Intelligent Network which data are given by Tunisie Télécom. A Solution within 6 % of the lower bound is obtained after 24 hours of running time. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of intelligent networks (IN) and B-ISDN signalling is {{considered as a}} prominent and robust solution to the rapid deployment of multimedia application services. The main advantage {{of this approach is}} that the network can offer advanced services without significant modifications to existing broadband signalling systems. The IN/IB-ISDN signalling platform will include a set of new elements as the broadband <b>service</b> control <b>point</b> (B-SCP) and the broadband <b>service</b> <b>switching</b> <b>point</b> (B-SSP), which will provide all the functionality required for the processing of user requests for complex multimedia services. The performance of these elements and their protocols is a crucial factor for network design as it determines the total number of calls the network can admit with acceptable call set-up delay. In this paper we study the performance of an IN/B-ISDN integrated architecture by developing a set of protocol models and analysis techniques which are also applicable to other systems. Results show that the proposed architecture constitutes a promising and robust solution that can guarantee a smooth and cost effective evolution to multimedia networks. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.

5000|$|Class 3 primary {{switches}} {{provided the}} first {{layer of the}} AT&T long distance switching network. VNL routing methods preferred trunk connections between Class 3 switches to minimize class 1 and class 2 connections. Class 3 switches also act as <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Points</b> or SSP's that provide access to Intelligent Network services such as Toll-Free, Virtual Private Network, Calling Card, and Credit Card calls. If circuits to other Class 3 switches were unavailable, the call was routed to the Class 2 (and/or Class 1) switch in the same region. Calls were not routed [...] "up-chain" [...] to Class 2 or Class 1 switches in a different region. Analog circuits between AT&T long distance switches are known as Inter-Toll trunks while circuits from a long distance switch to local switches are known as Toll Completing trunks or toll switching trunks. Trunks between long distance switches in other carrier networks are known as Inter-Machine Trunks or IMT's.|$|R

SS7 accesses databases for various {{services such as}} CNAM, LIDB, Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and LNP. Calls to ported numbers are completed when a customer who calls a ported number sends the dialed number to a provider's SSP (<b>Service</b> <b>Switch</b> <b>Point),</b> where it is identified either as a local call or not. If the call is local, the switch has the NPA-NXX in its routing table as portable, so it sends a routing request to the Signal Transfer Point (STP) which accesses a local database that is updated by an LSMS (Local Service Management System) which holds all routing for all ported numbers to which the carrier is responsible for completing calls. If routing information is found, a response {{is sent to the}} [...] "query" [...] containing the information necessary to properly route the call. If it is not a local number, the call is passed on to the STP and routed until it gets to a local carrier who will perform the [...] "query" [...] mentioned earlier and route the call accordingly.|$|R

40|$|In {{distributed}} communication networks several nodes interact {{to carry}} out services. New telecommunication networks support a variety of services, much different from traditional telephony. Each service has its own so called load profile, {{which means that the}} amount of capacity needed to complete a service varies. The services may also have different priorities and quality of service requirements. This thesis discusses overload control strategies for distributed communication networks. Further, a number of overload control schemes that carry out a certain strategy are developed and examined. The main objectives of the overload control schemes are to efficiently protect a resource from overload, to maintain a high throughput and to ensure a fair distribution of the resource's capacity among the services. Two network architectures are examined; the Intelligent Network (IN) and the Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture (TINA). For IN, the thesis concentrates on the overload control of <b>Service</b> Control <b>Points</b> (SCPs), <b>Service</b> <b>Switching</b> Control <b>Points</b> (SSCPs) and Intelligent Peripherals (IPs). These nodes are examined with both simulation and analytical methods. For TINA, a performance simulation model is developed. Further, the overload control of TINA networks is discussed. The thesis also analytically analyses a feedback queuing system with control theoretic methods. A transfer function for the system is developed when a modified PD controller is used in the overload control...|$|R
