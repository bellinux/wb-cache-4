5|$|In {{order to}} gather {{research}} for the series, Hoshino once visited New York as she believes the city left a deep influence in her works. She also visited graveyards since she never had resources for the series. The ground zero of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks also left a big impression in her based on the guides' comments. Hoshino commented <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> go again as {{she did not have}} much time to stay in New York.|$|E
5|$|Quinn escapes custody while S.H.I.E.L.D. takes {{possession}} of the gravitonium. Skye finds the motivation to commit to her training, and Agent Melinda May, who had previously avoided combat operations since retiring, decides <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be fully committed than watching helplessly from the Bus. In an end tag, Hall is still alive within the gravitonium, which is sealed in an unmarked vault by S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E

50|$|In September 2010, Thomas {{announced}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> retire <b>rather</b> than seek {{reelection in}} the following month's municipal elections. She was succeeded on the council by Thomas Steen.|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|Medium Alison {{writes a}} letter to her parents but does not mention Joan or her recent {{realization}} she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison {{to put on a}} dress, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> wear a jean jacket. Bruce tells her that she would be the only girl without a dress and that the other children would laugh at her; she leaves on the dress ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning to wonder if she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
5|$|When Archie destroys Zoe's film project, {{essential}} for her graduation, lecturer Adrian P. Kennedy (Richard Lawrence) gives her an extension. Zoe finds a script belonging to Mike {{which he wrote}} 20 years ago about his decision to give Sarah up for adoption. Zoe uses the script and films it, and Adrian screens it in the SU Bar. At the screening, Sarah discovers the planned adoption and is in turmoil. Mike goes to see Adrian to tell him of the plagiarism. Adrian says that if she sleeps with him, he will not tell the university. Zoe considers Adrian's offer but later claims <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be a failure than sleep with him, leading to him failing her project. Zoe then has a brief relationship with Natty (Danny Tennant).|$|E
60|$|It was Bertie’s great opportunity, {{and he knew}} it. His {{mother was}} {{conscious}} {{of the fact that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> look <b>rather</b> ridiculous if the story got about. She was willing to pay hush-money.|$|R
60|$|She was {{not alone}} there, though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> much <b>rather</b> have been; two days after she left London her Uncle and Aunt had joined her. It was from Cramier they had {{received}} their invitation. He himself {{had not yet been}} down.|$|R
6000|$|... “Very well,” said <b>she,</b> “I <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> {{that you}} should not work then. The {{interruption}} to me to get up now, and go {{to look for a}} smaller basket, will be greater than all the good you will do in picking up chips.” ...|$|R
5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
25|$|In the December 1997 {{issue of}} Outrage, Brumby {{acknowledged}} {{that she is}} a lesbian, and although some see her as a role model, her sexuality is only one facet of her personality and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be described as a musician.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, Kostuch {{announced}} {{that she had been}} diagnosed as terminal with multiple system atrophy. She declared her intention to choose when <b>she</b> <b>would</b> die, <b>rather</b> than letting the disease decide for her — supporting the right to die cause.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm very sorry," [...] from Freda. [...] "There isn't time. He {{must come}} at once." [...] The {{conventional}} phrases dropped easily from her lips, {{but she could}} not forbear to smile inwardly at their inadequacy and weakness. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> much <b>rather</b> have shrieked.|$|R
60|$|Julia {{declared}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> much <b>rather</b> not {{have accepted the}} brooch, and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never wear it. But animosity against such articles wears itself out quickly, {{and it may be}} expected that the little ornament will be seen in the houses of the Suffolk gentry among whom Mr. Smirkie is so popular.|$|R
25|$|When {{the women}} stop, they {{call out to}} Anna {{and a few of}} them enter the vault to tell her that Maometto has been {{defeated}} by Erisso and has fled, but that her life is now in danger, since he will be seeking revenge. She tells them that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> die.|$|E
25|$|After the First Monday in October incident, Arthur then retired for good, {{retreating}} to her oceanside home in Carmel, California, steadfastly refusing interviews {{until her}} resistance was {{broken down by}} {{the author of a book}} about Capra. Arthur once famously said that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> have her throat slit than do an interview.|$|E
25|$|Megan: Megan {{is a rich}} kid who is {{not very}} {{comfortable}} in the woods. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> hold the New Midnight Society Meetings in her own, well-managed, backyard. Tucker, not being the stickler his brother was, lets Megan refurnish the campfire with some comfortable old couches. She {{seems to have a}} soft spot for Andy.|$|E
60|$|She {{said little}} to that, except that, <b>she</b> said, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> give her as little trouble as possible; {{but she was}} afraid she should {{sometimes}} be uneasy to her, which <b>she</b> hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> excuse. My Quaker told her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> much <b>rather</b> excuse her if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> forbear; for that if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> believe her, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> assure her <b>she</b> should never get any intelligence of me by her.|$|R
6000|$|... “Did {{you notice}} that I tipped the waiter a shilling? We can cross Lady Ulwight off the list; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have died <b>rather</b> than do that.” ...|$|R
60|$|The viscount moved on, uttering private chuckles as {{numerous}} as a woodpecker's taps, and Ethelberta with him. She walked as by a miracle, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> walk. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have died <b>rather</b> than not have walked then.|$|R
25|$|In 1663, Louis XIV again {{turned to}} Mademoiselle {{in order to}} arrange a match for his cousin. The {{intended}} bridegroom was Alfonso VI of Portugal, who acceded to the Portuguese throne in 1656. The proud Mademoiselle ignored the idea, saying <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> stay in France with her vast income and estates and {{that she did not}} want a husband who was rumoured to be alcoholic, impotent and paralytic. Alfonso instead married Marie Françoise of Savoy.|$|E
25|$|The king {{asked his}} {{daughter}} {{what were the}} three misfortunes that the marriage should ease. Miaoshan explained that the first misfortune the marriage should ease was the suffering people endure as they age. The second misfortune it should ease was the suffering people endure when they fall ill. The third misfortune it should ease was the suffering caused by death. If the marriage could not ease any of the above, then <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> retire {{to a life of}} religion forever.|$|E
25|$|Julia {{escapes from}} reality by marrying men {{on a whim}} and then abandoning them when things do not work out. She then runs home and wants to crawl back into the womb. She has not evolved into a mature woman {{although}} she is in her mid-thirties, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> go home to her parents and reclaim the room in which she grew up. Her energies are used in fighting for her right to return home rather than in fighting {{for a life of}} her own.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{has great}} strength; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> endure {{anything}} <b>rather</b> than give way; {{but how can}} she have borne the anxiety and silence? You are sure my aunt does not mention her?' ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{trembling}} with loathing and disgust, she had followed him, resolved that if Harry's plan {{to rescue her}} failed <b>she</b> <b>would</b> kill herself <b>rather</b> than be the wife of this man.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{do believe}} that if the whole family are {{unanimous}} in scouting the very idea, she will give it up. She is proud of Mohun blood, and the Rotherwood connection and all, {{and if there were}} a desperate opposition---well, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>rather</b> flattered, and give in; but I am not sure that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not always regret it, and pine after what she might have had.' ...|$|R
25|$|In a late-1990s interview, Page stated {{she would}} not allow any current {{pictures}} of her to be shown {{because of concerns about}} her weight. However, in 1997, Page changed her mind and agreed to a rare television interview for the aforementioned E! True Hollywood Story/Page special on the condition that the location of the interview and her face not be revealed (she was shown with her face and dress electronically blacked out). Page allowed a publicity picture to be taken of her for the August 2003 edition of Playboy. In 2006, the Los Angeles Times ran an article headlined A Golden Age for a Pinup, covering an autographing session at her current publicity company, CMG Worldwide. Once again, Page declined to be photographed, saying <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be remembered as she was.|$|E
25|$|At 2pm a 12-pound cannon and {{a company}} of militia were sent up by a special train. By afternoon, the {{shooting}} from the hotel had ceased. The police leader, Superintendent Sadleir, decided to {{set fire to the}} hotel and received permission from the Chief Secretary, Robert Ramsay. At 2:50pm a final volley was fired into the hotel, and under cover of the fire, Senior-constable Charles Johnson, of Violet Town, placed a bundle of burning straw at the hotel's west side. As the fire took hold, the police began to close in on the building. Mrs Skillion and Kate Kelly appeared on the scene at this juncture. The former endeavoured to make way to her brothers, declaring <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> see them burned than shot by the police. The police, however, ordered her to stop.|$|E
25|$|Gaston {{talks to}} Gigi {{and she tells}} him {{that she is not}} the type of girl who wants {{publicity}} and to be dumped by him one day, then having to become someone else’s mistress. Gigi wants their relationship to remain platonic but when Gaston accidentally reveals that he loves Gigi she bursts into tears, upset that he would want to expose her to the uncertainty of being his mistress if he actually loves her. Gaston leaves angered, where he later runs into Honoré, who declares the family has always been a bit odd. Gigi later calls Gaston up, admitting <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be miserable with him than without him and agrees to accompany him in public. Gigi dresses in finery for their date, and when Gaston arrives, he is entranced by her beauty.|$|E
6000|$|We {{talked a}} good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and {{somebody}} else to-morrow; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> far <b>rather</b> have wounded her own breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two? ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1962 {{film version}} of Meredith Willson's musical The Music Man, Marian Paroo the {{librarian}} asks the prudish Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife, if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>rather</b> have her daughter reading the classic Persian poetry of Omar Khayyam than Elinor Glyn, to which Mrs. Shinn replies: [...] "What Elinor Glyn reads is her mother's problem!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] David said. [...] "She is {{as close}} as wax. Over and over again, when she has been {{suspected}} of assisting in the evasion of a slave, she has been beaten and put to torture; but nothing was ever extracted from her lips, and it is certain that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> die, <b>rather</b> than reveal a secret." ...|$|R
