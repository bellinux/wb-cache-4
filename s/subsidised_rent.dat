40|$|What the {{research}} did: This report examines {{the supply of}} subsidised affordable housing via the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) in Australia and the international approaches of the  Low Income Housing Taxation Credit (LIHTC) scheme in the US and the Affordable Rents program in England. The research focusses on NRAS developments in NSW, Qld, Vic and WA {{from the perspective of}} affordability, spatial and investment return outcomes. What {{the research}} found: 	While NRAS was flawed in its administration it did achieve considerable success. 	There was an increase in the supply of subsidised affordable rental housing in Australia with 27, 606 extra dwellings as at June 2015 and 37, 583 expected in total (DSS data). 	<b>Subsidising</b> <b>rents</b> by 20 per cent below market level increased the number of suburbs accessible to income eligible households with the potential to lift a third of all eligible households out of housing stress. 	NRAS properties are predominantly in suburbs with mid-range investment potential, ie. where <b>subsidised</b> <b>rents</b> are 60 - 80 per cent of the metropolitan median. 	The model encouraged a diversity of housing delivery, unlike the US which was directed to apartments. 	The scheme assisted community housing providers to produce financially viable developments. 	The LIHTC was made permanent in the US after 7 years while NRAS was discontinued after 7 years. The US example showed that the market needs time to mature and tax reform is needed to attract large scale institutional investment. 	There is now a gap in the provision of affordable rental supply in Australia with the added concern that current NRAS properties lose their tax incentives after a staggered 10 year period and may return to full market rent...|$|R
5000|$|The South African {{government}} also offered {{a number of}} economic incentives to investors from Taiwan seeking to set up factories and businesses in the country.

50|$|Intermediate Rent (UK) is the {{practice}} of renting property at a <b>subsidised</b> <b>rent</b> from a Housing Association or Registered Social Landlord. The product was conceived to allow households without the money for a deposit to purchase a home the opportunity to obtain a home whilst still saving for a deposit. The product can be aimed at key workers (as defined by the UK government).|$|E
5000|$|Another form of Intermediate Rent {{is known}} as [...] "Rent to HomeBuy". This is where an {{applicant}} {{will be able to}} live in a property at a discounted rent for a period of three to five years at a <b>subsidised</b> <b>rent,</b> whilst keeping an option to purchase a percentage of the property at any point during the tenancy (typically 25%). This allows the household to live in the property of their choice, whilst using the money they save through the rent subsidy to save for a deposit.|$|E

The Shek Kip Mei Estate was subdivided into [...] "Upper" [...] and [...] "Lower" [...] estates, with the Upper estate being designated a [...] "low-rent estate" [...] (廉租屋邨）, and the Lower estate was designated a [...] "Resettlement estate" [...] (徙置屋邨).

5000|$|Budgetary policy under Dalton was {{strongly}} progressive, as characterised by policies such as increased food subsidies, heavily <b>subsidised</b> <b>rents</b> to council house tenants, {{the lifting of}} restrictions of house-building, the financing of national assistance and family allowances, and extensive assistance to rural communities and Development Areas. Dalton was also responsible for funding the introduction of Britain's universal family allowances scheme, doing so [...] "with a song in my heart," [...] as he later put. In one of his budgets, Dalton significantly increased spending on education (which included £4 million for the universities {{and the provision of}} free school milk), £38 million for the start (from August 1946) of family allowances, and an additional £10 million for Development Areas. In addition, the National Land Fund was established. Harold Macmillan, who inherited Dalton's housing responsibilities, later acknowledged his debt to Dalton's championing of New Towns, and was grateful for the legacy of Dalton's Town Development Bill, which encouraged urban overfill schemes and the movement of industry out of cities.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the history of housing in Ireland shows that owner {{occupancy}} and social housing were policy choices by successive governments. Owner occupancy was heavily supported through a system of grants and tax breaks and social housing was directly provided through local authorities at <b>subsidised</b> <b>rents.</b> In recent years policy has changed and tenure neutrality is now guiding the government’s attitude to housing. This is a significant change which has not been sufficiently discussed and has consequences which are not appreciated. Relying on the market to provide rental housing for people on low incomes and who may be in in precarious employment is very unlikely to be successful and housing will become a significant issue for future governments. If the government is not going to subsidise owner occupancy nor directly provide sufficient houses for the growing numbers on low incomes investment in rental housing has to come from somewhere other than non-professional landlords who dominate the current rental housing offering in Ireland. A greater understanding of underlying historical trends in housing is needed...|$|R
5000|$|One of the LCC's most {{important}} roles {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th century, was {{in the management of}} the expanding city and the re-development of its growing slums. In the Victorian era, new housing had been intentionally urban and large-scale tenement buildings dominated. Beginning in the 1930s, the LCC incentivised an increase in more suburban housing styles. A less-dense style of development, focusing on single family homes, was popular among London housing developers because it was believed that this would satisfy the working classes and provide insurance, [...] "against Bolshevism," [...] to quote one parliamentary secretary. The LCC set the standard for new construction at 12 houses per acre of land at a time when some London areas had as many as 80 housing units per acre. The passage of the Housing of the Working Classes Act in 1885 gave the LCC the power to compel the sale of land for housing development, a power that was vital to the systematic rehousing that began under the council's early Progressive leadership. The Totterdown Fields development at Tooting was the first large suburban-style development to be built under LCC authority, in 1903, and was quickly followed by developments at Roehampton, Bellingham, and Becontree. By 1938, 76,877 units of housing had been built {{under the auspices of the}} LCC in the city and its periphery, an astonishing number given the previous pace of development. Many of these new housing developments were genuinely working-class, though the poorest could rarely afford even <b>subsidised</b> <b>rents.</b> They relied on an expanding London Underground network that ferried workers en masse to places of employment in the city center. These housing developments were broadly successful, and they resisted the slummification that blighted so many Victorian tenement developments. The success of these commuter developments constructed by the LCC in the periphery of the city is, [...] "one of the more remarkable achievements in London government, and contributed much to the marked improvement of conditions between the wars for the capital's working classes." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{high street}} of Thenon (Av. de la 4eme République) passes north-south {{and is the}} scene of a weekly market and some shops. To the {{southern}} end is the cultural heart, the Place Pasteur with a church, older buildings (some medieval), marketplace (shown here) and a small château dating from the 12th century (captured briefly by the English in 1439, retaken by Charles II's troops). Only part of the castle remains. Over the last 25 years the main street has hosted at least three supermarkets, a grocer, butcher, bars, hardware store, 2 boulangeries, a bank, and 2 chemists. However, with the reduction in traffic on the D6089, the High Street has 'died' and most or its retail outlets have closed except the boulangeries and chemist. The Mairie has offered <b>subsidised</b> <b>rent</b> to businesses willing to re-occupy the vacant stores, with some success as of 2015 when the bar/cafe was again reopened as a cooperative. A medium-sized supermarket on the now-quiet D6089 west of town has become the main retail store, with the bar and bank opposite in modern premises, and local residents feel much has been lost by these closures and relocations. In addition, some commercial activity in Thenon has been lost because the 1990s/2000s boom in French second-homes, from which this region benefited through high property prices and more consumers and tax income, has now subsided. There is a primary school and middle school, the Collège Suzanne Lacore. The nearest high school is in Terrasson, 16.5 km away.|$|E

40|$|Social housing {{providers}} - {{local authorities}} and housing associations - fulfil at least three functions: building housing, acting as landlord and delivering <b>subsidised</b> <b>rent</b> levels. This report focuses on the last of these. Specifically, we analyse the consequences for tenants, social housing providers and the exchequer of changing the level of rent charged to tenants in social housing. We do not take a view as to what level is appropriate, or look at wider policy issues in the social housing system. About one-sixth {{of the population of}} Great Britain currently live in social housing, down from about one-third in the early 1980 s. On average, social tenants have much lower levels of education, employment and earnings than the population as a whole - gaps which widened dramatically during the 1980 s and early 1990 s. The average social rent in England is currently about 396 per week, which is an estimated 340 (30...|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{right to buy}} was unintended. Tenants who didn't buy their houses saw their rent rise steeply, {{this had to be}} covered by {{increased}} social benefits. Tenants who did sold them on to private investors who then let them at an artificially high rent to families unable to secure council property - these families had to have the <b>rent</b> <b>subsidised</b> by social benefits. The former tenants now also need private rented accommodation which was subsidised by social benefits. The government had choked off the supply - increased the demand for a diminishing asset.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, England has not {{experienced}} the radical neglect and demolition {{of public housing}} that We Call These Projects Home describes happening in the United States. The English social housing sector has declined in size, primarily by sales to sitting tenants, but it remains {{a significant part of}} the housing system. Nonetheless, in London, we find that the progressive commodification of housing has contributed to the dispersion and suburbanisation of the urban poor over the 2000 s, as the city as a whole prospered. As well as some demolition of inner-city housing estates, the increasing use of <b>subsidised</b> private <b>renting</b> has played a central role in this. We argue that in England, the boundary and relationship between state and market is an essential foundation to an analysis of ‘rights to the city’. This is because it both determines the actual proportion of housing allocated by market pricing (as opposed to rights or needs) and the spheres of decision where market logic (rather than claims to rights) prevails. Current changes to Housing Benefit exemplify the effects of privatisation on the socio-spatial organisation of the city...|$|R
