40|$|SIP协议是由IETF提出的应用层信令协议，用来建立、修改和终止多方参与的多媒体会话进程，具有很好的可扩展性、灵活性、互操作性和可重用性。在视频监控系统中使用SIP协议实现呼叫处理过程，可以使视频监控系统具有更好的兼容性和扩展能力。本文以网络视频监控系统为背景，介绍了视频监控系统的功能划分和SIP协议的相关内容，提出了基于SIP协议的视频监控呼叫处理方案，设计了支持节点注册、呼叫处理、用户认证、状态查询等功能的呼叫处理子系统，并且在视频监控系统中实现。为了满足运营级视频监控系统对呼叫处理能力的高要求，设计并实现了基于分布式系统的高性能SIP服务器，在集群上完成对高性能SIP服务器的性能测试。本文工作的主要贡献是：在视频监控系统中设计并实现了基于SIP协议的呼叫处理子系统；在分布式系统上设计并实现了具有高呼叫处理能力的高性能SIP服务器。SIP is an application-layer control {{protocol}} proposed by IETF. It's used to establish, modify, and terminate muti-party multimedia sessions and has strong extensibility, flexibility, interoperability and reusability. It can get better compatibility and expansion capability that implement the call process with SIP in video monitor system. In this thesis, {{based on the}} demand for network video monitor system, we introduce the video monitor system's functional division and the SIP protocol, propose a scheme for call process in video monitor system based on SIP protocol, design and implement the call process subsystem supporting node register, call process, user authentication and <b>status</b> <b>enquiry</b> in video monitor system. In {{order to meet the}} requirements of the carrier-class video monitor system, we design and implement the high-performance SIP server on the distributed system, and test the SIP server on the cluster. The thesis's major contribution is: design and implement the call process subsystem of video monitor system based on SIP protocol; design and implement the high-performance SIP server on the distributed system...|$|E
40|$|The {{forthcoming}} {{generation of}} radiotelescopes pose new and substantial challenges {{in terms of}} system monitoring. Information regarding environmental conditions, signal connectivity and level, processor utilisation, memory use, network traffic and even power consumption needs to be collected, displayed in realtime, and preserved in a permanent database. In this paper, we put forward the Ganglia monitoring system as a scalable, robust and efficient architecture that appears well-suited to the data collection aspect of radiotelescope monitoring, and we discuss approaches to the visual display of the streaming metric data produced by Ganglia. In particular, we present initial work {{in the use of}} 3 -dimensional (3 -d) multiplayer game technology for instantaneous <b>status</b> monitoring and <b>enquiry,</b> and we describe the extensions to this work required for radiotelescope monitoring.

40|$|For {{practitioners}} {{across a}} growing number of academic disciplines there is a strong sense that simulation models of complex realworld systems provide something that differs fundamentally from that which is offered by mathematical models of the same phenomena. The precise nature of this difference has been difficult to isolate and explain, but, occasionally, it is cashed out in terms of an ability to use simulations to perform “experiments”, e. g., [9]. The notion here is that empirical data derived from costly experiments in the real world might usefully be augmented with data harvested from the right kind of simulation models. We will reserve the term “artificial worlds” for such simulations. In this paper, rather than tackle the problems inherent in this type of claim head on, we will approach them obliquely by asking: what is the root of the attraction of constructing and exploring artificial worlds? By combining insights drawn from the work of Levins, Braitenberg, and Clark, we arrive at an answer that at least partially legitimises artificial worlds by allocating them a useful scientific role, without having to assign the <b>status</b> of empirical <b>enquiry</b> to their exploration...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about misfortune as {{elaborated}} in the narratives of (counter-) witchcraft practitioners and consultants. Their statements {{can be read}} from different perspectives, and I choose here {{to look at them}} specifically in terms of "passions " and their control. 1 Since {{the purpose of this paper}} is not a cross-cultural comparison in the definitions of emotions (see Lynch 1990) ready-made translations of Malayalam terms will be used, like "anger" or "wrath " for kōpam, leaving out precise delimitation of their connotations (for such a perspective see, for instance, Kakar, 1982 or Obeyesekere, 1975). Information was gathered in the upper and middle levels of society (Brahmins, nayars, īḻavar, kaṇiyān) so that remarks made here cannot be extended to groups of lower <b>status</b> without further <b>enquiry.</b> Most of the citations below will be taken from a single kaṇiyān specialist (both an astrologer and a witchcraft practitioner) living in the outskirts of Trivandrum, referred to below as "Asan". His statements are in accordance with all my information available from other sources. Before going into the heart of the subject, I will say a few words about "misfortune " and "witchcraft". Misfortune is used for events which are interpreted as involving an occult cause because they occur in series or possess an "untimely " or "striking " nature-whatever people migh...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vitamin D {{inadequacy}} {{is widespread}} {{in children and}} adolescents worldwide. The present study was undertaken to assess the vitamin D status in active children living in a sunny climate and to identify the main determinants of the serum concentration of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 -OHD). Methods: This cross-sectional study included 225 children aged 7 – 15 years practicing sports in a football academy. Anthropometric measures were performed to calculate body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and maturity <b>status.</b> A nutritional <b>enquiry</b> was performed including 3 -day food records and food frequency questionnaire. Plasma 25 -OHD and insulin were assessed by immunoenzymatic methods ensuring categorization of vitamin D status and calculation of insulin sensitivity/resistance indexes. A logistic regression model was applied to identify predictors for vitamin D inadequacy. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (25 -OHD< 12 µg/L) was observed in 40. 9 % of children and insufficiency (12 < 25 -OHD< 20 µg/L) was observed in 44 % of children. In a multivariate analysis, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were associated with a lower dietary intake of vitamin D, proteins, milk, red meat, fish, and eggs. However, no significant relationship was observed with maturation status, adiposity, or insulin resistance. Conclusions: Tunisian children and adolescents are exposed to a high risk of vitamin D inadequacy despite living in a sunny climate. Circulating 25 -OHD concentrations are related to the intake of vitamin D food sources but not to maturation status or body composition. Ensuring sufficient and safe sun exposure and adequate vitamin D intake may prevent vitamin D inadequacy in children from sunny environments...|$|R
40|$|Grace Under Pressure: Re-reading Giselle' is a {{close reading}} of the Romantic ballet Giselle (1841), {{focusing}} on the Birmingham Royal Ballet production of 3 March 1992. The Preface provides a personal introduction, and notes the status of ballet within dance studies and the academy. It also observes that in choosing Giselle as a text one is required to reassess the historical treatment of emotion and beauty within academic feminism. Chapter One gives an historical background to Giselle, a literature review and a methodological overview. Ballet has received relatively little attention from the academy in comparison with other performing arts. Whilst dance scholarship is a growth area in the university, ballet remains neglected. Hence, {{in order to bring}} theory across from areas of greater academic activity, this thesis is structured around textual juxtaposition. Thus Chapter Two compares the plot of Giselle with that of the film Blade Runner, and Chapter Three compares the movement of Giselle with that in the book SEX by Madonna. These comparative texts were also first viewed in 1992 : whilst Giselle is usually categorized as 'High' art, however, they belong in the popular domain. This thesis demonstrates that the comparative texts differ from their own genres, dystopian fiction and pornography. Consequently, Giselle is shown to be materially different from other Romantic ballets, particularly in its selfreflexive critical framework. Chapter Four concludes the discussion of the 1841 and the 1992 Giselles, and focuses on the repercussions of this study for the academy and the production and reception of ballet. Throughout this thesis runs the assumption, common in dance studies but less overt in English Literature, that academic activity is a personal and political activity, and that a study such as this requires that one engage with the <b>status</b> of academic <b>enquiry</b> both within and without the academy...|$|R
