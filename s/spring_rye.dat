40|$|Aspects of crop {{physiology}} and agronomy of <b>spring</b> <b>rye</b> were evaluated at Viikki Experimental Farm, University of Helsinki in 1996 - 1998 to get baseline information on its {{potential as a}} novel cereal crop in southern Finland. The German <b>spring</b> <b>rye</b> cultivar Ovid was fertilized with 80 kg N ha- 1. Seeding rates were 300, 500 and 700 viable seeds m- 2. Chlormequat chloride (CCC) was sprayed at the two-node stage of the main shoot {{and its effects on}} lodging and yield formation were studied. Various traits were assessed that characterised tiller and main shoot growth and productivity, growth duration and plant stand structure. <b>Spring</b> <b>rye</b> responded differently over years and among CCC treatments. CCC increased grain yield by about 200 kg ha - 1 compared with the control. <b>Spring</b> <b>rye</b> has long straw (130 - 140 cm) and tended to lodge under heavy rainfall. Thus,grain yield was maximum (ca. 5200 kg ha - 1 in 1997) when rainfall was minimum. Partly because high seeding rates enhanced lodging,no seeding rate effects on grain yield were recorded. At 300 seeds m- 2, yield formation of both main shoot and tillers was enhanced to compensate for the reduced number of main shoots m- 2. Ripening was not delayed at low seeding rates. Grain and hectolitre weights were not affected by seeding rate. Thus,spring rye is a potential crop for Finland if low seeding rates are used. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of enzyme supplementation on the bioavailable energy (AMEn) and apparent digestibilities of lipid (ALD) and protein (APD) in young broiler chicks was examined for diets containing either wheat, hulled or hulless barley, naked oats, or <b>spring</b> <b>rye.</b> Dietary AMEn, APD, and ALD values were depressed (P <. 01) for all test grains (except hulled Bedford barley) as the inclusion {{rate of the}} grain replacing wheat increased. The antinutritives, (3 -glucans (barley and oats) and pentosans (rye), had the most pronounced effect on ALD. The decreases in ALD were 43, 77, and 67 % for chicks fed diets containing 70 % Scout barley (hulless), Terra oats, and Gazelle rye, respectively, compared with those fed the control wheat diet. Enzyme supplementation increased (P <. 01) AMEn, APD, and ALD for all test cereals. The corresponding increases in the AMEn, of the enzyme-supplemented diets containing 70 % HY 320 wheat, Bedford barley, Scout barley, Terra oats, and Gazelle rye diets were 4, 7, 42, 33, and 14 %, respectively, compared with their unsupplemented counterparts. Enzyme treatment also improved (P <. 01) weight gains and feed conversion efficiencies of chicks fed diets containing each of the cereals.

40|$|Three <b>spring</b> <b>rye</b> mixtures, {{produced}} after honeycomb selection at low plant density {{for four}} years in one high input location (Thessaloniki) and their original population were evaluated under different water stress conditions in a randomized complete block design, in two locations for two years. Soil type (fertility, soil water holding capacity) and water precipitation, especially during anthesis, were different in each location and year. The initial evaluation of the three mixtures in Thessaloniki (1995), where selection was applied, revealed that selection for yield at low plant density was effective. The performance of the mixtures, however, was different when the plants were evaluated in a second location, {{in the same year}} where no response to selection was observed. During the second year of evaluation, the water precipitation was different in Thessaloniki where there was no rain at all in May, the most crucial month for rye flowering in Hellas. This lack of rainfall affected negatively the behaviour of the mixtures. Thus, the original rye population characterized by a broader variability out yielded two of the mixtures in Thessaloniki, whereas no differences were recorded in the second location. The over years and locations performance also revealed no differences. This indicates that selection at low plant density and high selection pressure in one high input-location had as a result either the development of rye populations with narrow adaptability or that honeycomb selection was not effective in this case...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the developmental stage {{during which the}} preferential inactivation of rRNA genes from the rye parent occurs in wheat x rye hybrids, nucleolar activity was evaluated in the embryo and endosperm of developing seeds of the hybrids.

The number of nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) and nucleoli present in the embryo and endosperm cells of wheat, and wheat × rye F 1 hybrids, at different times after fertilization was scored by silver staining. The inactivation of rDNA of rye origin in F 1 hybrids occurs simultaneously in the embryo and in the endosperm between 4 and 5 days after fertilization, when these have been through six and 10 cell cycles respectively. We conclude that the genomic interactions leading to the inactivation of the rye origin rDNA is a time-dependent process, related to the developmental stage and independent {{of the number of}} cell cycles (DNA replication rounds) they have been through...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{estimation}} of grain nitrogen (N; N in grain yield) {{is crucial for}} assessing N management in crop rotations, {{but there is little}} information on the performance of commonly used crop models for simulating grain N. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to (1) test if continuous simulation (multi-year) performs better than single year simulation, (2) assess if calibration improves model performance at different calibration levels, and (3) investigate if a multi-model ensemble can substantially reduce uncertainty in reproducing grain N. For this purpose, 12 models were applied simulating different treatments (catch crops, CO 2 concentrations, irrigation, N application, residues and tillage) in four multi-year rotation experiments in Europe to assess modelling accuracy. Seven grain and seed crops in four rotation systems in Europe were included in the study, namely winter wheat, winter barley, spring barley, <b>spring</b> oat, winter <b>rye,</b> pea and winter oilseed rape. Our results indicate that the higher level of calibration significantly increased the quality of the simulation for grain N. In addition, models performed better in predicting grain N of winter wheat, winter barley and spring barley compared to <b>spring</b> oat, winter <b>rye,</b> pea and winter oilseed rape. For each crop, the use of the ensemble mean significantly reduced the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between simulations and observations to less than 15 %, thus a multi–model ensemble can more precisely predict grain N than a random single model. Models correctly simulated the effects of enhanced N input on grain N of winter wheat and winter barley, whereas effects of tillage and irrigation were less well estimated. However, the use of continuous simulation did not improve the simulations as compared to single year simulation based on the multi-year performance, which suggests needs for further model improvements of crop rotation effects...|$|R

Six non-legume species; <b>spring</b> <b>rye</b> (Secale cereale L.), black oat (Avena sativa L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) were tested. Plots with organic fertiliser (50  kg N ha− 1) and without fertiliser incorporation at three locations in south-east Germany were trialled and the cover crops’ ability to produce biomass and accumulate N in plant compartments was evaluated. The N mineralisation from stem and leaf material was simulated using the STICS model. The biomass production ranged from 0. 95 to 7. 73  Mg ha− 1, with fertiliser increasing the total biomass at locations with low-N status. Sunflower consistently displayed large biomass and N accumulation at all locations and fertiliser variations, although not always significantly more than other species. Most N was stored in sunflower leaf material, which can be easily mineralised making it less suited as cover crop before no-till sown spring grain legumes. Rye, which produced slightly less biomass, but accumulated more N in the stem biomass, would be better suited than sunflower in this type of system. The N mineralisation simulation from rye biomass indicated long N immobilisation periods potentially improving weed suppression within no-till sown legume cash crops...|$|E

This study quantified {{the interaction between}} various cover crop or herbicide systems and horseweed [Conyza canadensis (L.) ] growth. Fall cover crops of winter wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.) ], winter rye [Secale cereal (L.) ], barley [Hordeum vulgare (L.) ] and annual ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum (L.) ] were seeded in November 2012 and 2013. Spring cover crop of oat [Avena sativa (L.) ] was seeded in April 2013 or rye was seeded in March 2014. All cover crops were no-till seeded into grain sorghum stubble [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Four herbicide treatments were fall or spring applied, with and without residual. The spring non-residual treatment was also applied to plots of winter rye. Cover crop plots were split and terminated with a roller crimper or glyphosate application prior to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] planting {{to determine the effect}} of termination method on treatment performance. Soybean was planted in June 2013 and May 2014 and mechanically harvested in October of both years. Horseweed density, biomass accumulation, and soybean yield data were quantified. Horseweed height, whole plant seed production, and seed subsamples were recorded in the untreated fallow control, winter wheat, and winter rye plots in 2014. Horseweed suppression by winter rye approached 90 %, levels similar to suppression by herbicide systems. In both years, herbicide plots had less than half the horseweed biomass than any of the cover crop systems. In 2013, soybean yields in herbicide plots were at least 1, 500 kg ha[superscript]- 1, nearly more than double yields in cover crop plots. Soybean yields in 2014 were more consistent across treatments; barley and <b>spring</b> <b>rye</b> plots achieved yields equal to or greater than 2, 000 kg ha[superscript]- 1. Winter rye and winter wheat reduced horseweed seed production by 60 % compared to the untreated fallow control, with no effect on individual seed weight.

During recent years the supply of agricultural products from Georgia to the FSU republics and international markets has been substantially reduced. The country has lost its position on the export markets {{and as a result}} Georgia became a net importer of food products. More than 82 percent of GDP was produced by the private sector in 2002, compared to 74 percent in 2001. Today over 80 percent of agricultural production of cereales is in private sector. Georgia is divided into so called vertical zones. There are different physical, geographic and climatic conditions on this relatively small territory. We can come across almost all kinds of soil and climate existing in the world. With a long growing season and some areas of subtropical climate, cereals, (oats) citrus and a variety of deciduous fruits, vegetables and vine crops grow well along with tea, cereals, sunflower and a variety of field crops. With the variety of climates, almost any crop can be raised, giving Georgia one of the most diverse agricultural bases in our Southern Caucasus region. The agriculture industry is concerned primarily with the production of basic foodstuffs on farms but it also includes the supply of inputs for farming such as Oats seeds, cereals, begetables, fertilizers, animal feeds, and machinery.

5000|$|Local {{folklore}} and folk practice recognized Odin {{as late as}} the 19th century in Scandinavia. In a work published in the mid-19th century, Benjamin Thorpe records that on the island of Gotland, Sweden, [...] "many traditions and stories of Odin the Old still live in the mouths of the people". Thorpe notes that in Blekinge, Sweden, [...] "it was formerly the custom to leave a sheaf on the field for Odin's horses", and cites other examples, such as in Kråktorpsgård, Småland, where a barrow was purported to have been opened in the 18th century, purportedly containing the body of Odin. After Christianization, the mound was known as Helvetesbackke (Swedish [...] "Hell's Mound"). Local legend dictates that after it was opened, [...] "there burst forth a wondrous fire, like a flash of lightning", and that a coffin full of flint and a lamp were excavated. Thorpe additionally relates that legend has it that a priest who dwelt around Troienborg had once sowed some rye, and that when the <b>rye</b> <b>sprang</b> up, so came Odin riding from the hills each evening. Odin was so massive that he towered over the farm-yard buildings, spear in hand. Halting before the entry way, he kept all from entering or leaving all night, which occurred every night until the rye was cut.|$|R

However, in the case of winter field peas, the amount of N fixed, N supply to the subsequent crop and N balance there are hardly any published data. Therefore, the pre-crop effect of six genotypes of winter pea (five regular leaf type, one semi-leafless cultivar) and one semi-leafless spring pea cultivar in single and mixed cropping (with <b>rye</b> <b>spring</b> barley respectively) was examined in three suc-cesive growing seasons (2003 / 04 - 2005 / 06). Immediately after harvest, a catch crop was sown and sampled during the first half of October to determine biomass dry matter and N uptake. In single cropping, N uptake by the catch crop was usually significantly higher after regular leaf type peas in two years, whereas in mixed cropping it was only in one (p< 0. 05). It is suggested that response of N uptake was - among other possible factors (like e. g. soil tillage after harvest) – due to the mineralized N content in soil at harvest as both correlated significantly (R² between 0. 53 * and 0. 79 ***, with exception of semi-leafless winter pea (R²= 0, 19)). It is very important to protect the large N quantities after conventional leafed winter pea cultivars as a sole crop against leaching. Results for the third experimental season will be presented at the conference. ...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable {{farming is}} an {{intensive}} practice that typically relies on several tillage passes to prepare fields for production. Repeatedly tilling the soil, however, is unsustainable {{and has been}} shown to decrease soil structure and organic matter while increasing erosion rates. A 3 -year experiment was conducted in a mixed vegetable production system in southern New England to determine how crop yield, weed abundance, and soil health were affected by conservation tillage practices. Three conservation tillage systems were compared to conventional tillage to determine the effects on yields of six vegetable crops, weed abundance, and soil health. ^ Six 50 m planting beds were created within each treatment with the four middle rows planted to vegetable crops. In every treatment group, six vegetable crops were grown. These included tomato, cabbage, carrot, melon, cucumber, and lettuce. Two of the four rows were planted with the tomato and cabbage crops while melon / cucumbers, and lettuce / carrots were planted together in the remaining rows. Drip tape, with 30 cm emitter spacing, was used to irrigate to each crop in each treatment at a rate of 2. 54 cm per week. All vegetables received one line of drip tape except the carrot / lettuce row, in which two lines were used. Crops were fertilized at recommended rates using organic fertilizers applied at planting and through fertigation. ^ Establishment of the rolled crimped zone builder (RCZB) treatment: After the fall vegetable harvest, the plots were plowed and disked prior to seeding the winter rye with a seed drill. The winter rye was seeded at a rate of 123 k 2 ̆ 6 gdot;ha- 1. In the <b>spring,</b> when the <b>rye</b> reached anthesis, it was rolled and crimped. A zone builder was then used to strip till planting beds into the treatment. The winter rye seeding rate was increased to 184 k 2 ̆ 6 gdot;ha- 1 in 2012 after a low biomass of winter rye was observed in 2011. The winter rye biomass was expected to provide adequate weed control between the strip tilled rows throughout the season. Hand weeding was used to control weeds in the strip-tilled rows. ^ Raised planting beds and a cover crop mixture of perennial ryegrass (27. 20 k 2 ̆ 6 gdot;ha- 1) and Dutch white clover (2. 72 k 2 ̆ 6 gdot;ha - 1) seeded in the aisles between the beds made up the PLM treatment. Post harvest, the raised beds were seeded with winter rye (123 k 2 ̆ 6 gdot;ha - 1). The following <b>spring,</b> the <b>rye</b> was mowed and the beds were rototilled with a walk-behind tiller to prepare them for planting. A walk behind mower was used to control weeds between the beds, while hand weeding was used in the planted rows. ^ The crimson clover (CC) treatment was established as follows: The plots were plowed and disked twice before planting the vegetable crops. Following vegetable crop planting, crimson clover seed was mixed with pelletized lime at a 1 : 2 ratio and seeded at a rate of 25 k 2 ̆ 6 gdot;ha- 1 using a drop seeder. Mowing was used to prevent the crimson clover from competing with the vegetables. Hand weeding was used to control weeds that the cover crop was unable to control. ^ Yield, weed abundance, and soil health analysis results varied by treatment. Redroot pigweed, crabgrass, purslane, and lady 2 ̆ 7 s thumb were the most abundant weeds in our fields. Soil respiration rates, nitrate levels, and soil health test results found the active carbon, nitrate, and biological activity in our soils to be lacking. Individual results between treatments varied. ^ Conclusion: Each of the conservation tillage treatments showed one or more attributes that could potentially increase on-farm sustainability. The conservation tillage treatments have a higher average soil health score, reduced weed abundance, and produced yields similar to or greater than the conventional treatment. The CC treatment, however, was the only conservation tillage treatment comparable to the CT treatment in all three categories. Further experimentation is needed to improve upon these treatments and should include a greater emphasis on nutrient cycling in conservation tillage systems. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

The experiment was conducted near Bonn, on a Fluvisol using a {{randomised complete block design}} (n= 6). Our results showed that plots which received either prepared or non-prepared FYM (30 Mg ha− 1 year− 1) had significantly increased soil pH, P and K concentrations, microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, decomposition (cotton strips), earthworm cast production and altered earthworm community composition than plots without FYM application. Application of FYM did not affect the soil C/N ratio, root length density, saccharase activity, microbial basal respiration, metabolic quotient and crop yields. The biodynamic preparation of FYM with fermented residues of six plant species (6 g Mg− 1 FYM) significantly decreased soil microbial basal respiration and metabolic quotient compared to non-prepared FYM or FYM prepared with only Achillea. The biodynamic preparation did not affect soil microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity and decomposition during 62 days. However, after 100 days, decomposition was significantly faster in plots which received completely prepared FYM than in plots which received no FYM, FYM without preparations or FYM with the Achillea preparation. Furthermore, the application of completely prepared FYM led to significantly higher biomass and abundance of endogeic or anecic earthworms than in plots where non-prepared FYM was applied...|$|R

However, regarding the amount of N fixed, there are hardly any published data for winter peas. Therefore, the N fixation of five regular leafed winter peas types and one semi-leafless spring pea cultivar in single and mixed cropping (with winter <b>rye</b> <b>spring</b> cereals respectively) was measured in four successive growing seasons (2003 / 04 – 2006 / 07) at the experimental farm of the University of Kassel and in two consecutive vegetation periods (2005 / 06 - 2006 / 07) at the experimental farm of the University of Applied Science in Osnabrueck. The amount of N fixed was calculated according to the extended difference method at the beginning of flowering and at grain harvest. N fixation was usually higher for winter peas than for spring pea. At the beginning of flowering the amount of N fixed in pure stands was with a mean value of 92 kg ha- 1 for winter peas and 29 kg ha- 1 for the spring pea higher than in mixture with a mean value of 42 and 15 kg ha- 1 respectively. At grain harvest the amount of N fixed for the spring pea in pure stands was higher than in mixtures with a mean of 65 and 33 kg ha- 1 respectively. On the other hand the N fixation for winter peas was usually comparable in pure and mixed stands with a mean of 100 and 86 kg ha- 1 respectively. This was a consequence of the higher pea grain yield in mixture than in pure stands and of a reduced biomass (leaves) loss in mixtures. Therefore, regular leaf winter peas can contribute to the N supply of the crop rotation better than spring peas...|$|R

To determine the emergence pattern and survival of horseweed, a {{study was conducted}} across six locations in eastern KS in 2014 - 2015 and 2015 - 2016. Horseweed seedlings and leaf number per seedling were recorded at two-week intervals. Cumulative GDDs required to reach 50 % horseweed emergence increased from north to south. Horseweed survival ranged from 4 to 90 %, and majority of horseweed emerged in the fall. Field studies were conducted to determine effects of cover crops and herbicide programs on Palmer amaranth near Manhattan, KS in 2014 - 2015 and 2015 - 2016. Five cover crop treatments included no cover, fall-sown winter wheat, spring-sown oat, pea, and mixture of oat and pea. Cover crops were terminated in May with glyphosate and 2, 4 -D alone or with residual herbicides of flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone. By 10 weeks after termination in 2014 - 2015, Palmer amaranth biomass and density, averaged across cover crops. was 95 and 69 % less with residual herbicides than without, respectively, and Palmer amaranth biomass was 98 % less in winter wheat and 91 % less in spring oat, averaged across termination methods, compared to no cover. Time to 50 % Palmer amaranth emergence was delayed with winter wheat, spring oat, and spring oat/pea mix without residual herbicide. Soybean yields were greater with residual herbicide and greater with winter wheat or spring oat cover crop in 2014 - 2015. A field {{study was conducted to}} determine suppression effects of cover crop and herbicide programs on horseweed and Palmer amaranth near Manhattan, KS in 2015 - 2016. Three fall treatments included fall-sown rye, a residual herbicide tank mix of glyphosate, dicamba, chlorimuron-ethyl, tribenuron-methyl, and AMS, and no fall application. Four spring treatments included no spring application or three herbicide tank mixes: glyphosate, dicamba, and AMS alone or with flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone as early preplant, or as split applied with 2 / 3 preplant and 1 / 3 at soybean planting.

To determine the conservation tillage treatments effects on yield, marketable yields were harvested throughout the season. Marketable yield totals were used to establish kg·ha- 1 estimates for all crops in all years. These estimates were used to gauge the conservation tillage treatments 2 ̆ 7 ability to produce yields comparable to the conventional treatment. Due to large amount variability across replications, marketable yields were transformed using a log(x) + 1 transformation to normalize the data. To determine differences in weed abundance among treatments, counts were taken four times in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Tallies determined total weed populations and species compositions within each treatment. In 2012, dried biomass measurements were collected for broadleaf and grass weeds, in addition to cover crops. Soil samples were collected in April every year and sent to the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Laboratory for the comprehensive Soil Health Test to measure the effects of the treatments on soil health. Additionally, in 2011 and 2012 soil respiration and nitrate levels were measured biweekly during the growing season. Six 15 cm soil cores were collected from four locations in each replication of each treatment. The soil was dried and then analyzed for soil respiration and nitrate levels The conventional tillage (CT) system was managed as follows: In the spring, fall seeded (123 kg·ha- 1) winter rye was incorporated using a moldboard plow and disked twice. Weeds within the treatment were controlled with tractor-mounted and walk-behind rototillers. In the fall, plots were disked twice before seeding winter rye.

40|$|Winter cereal rye (Secale cereal L.), a {{commonly}} used cover crop in corn (Zea mays L.) systems has potential to scavenge soil NO 3 –N through a fibrous root system. The {{objective of this}} study was to quantify root and shoot biomass, C, and N partitioning in rye cover crop at the time of termination in spring. This was a one–year study conducted at a site with a no-till corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] rotation, rye drilled following grain crop harvest, and three N rates applied to corn (0, 135, and 225 kg N ha– 1). Rye root biomass to 60 -cm depth following corn and 30 -cm depth following soybean was estimated using ingrowth tubes installed in the fall after rye seeding and removed at the time of rye termination in the <b>spring.</b> For <b>rye</b> following corn and soybean, 48 and 62 %, respectively, of the total root biomass was present in the top 15 -cm depth. Overall, the shoot biomass, C, and N was significantly greater than for roots, with approximately two times more shoot than root material and only 33 – 36 % of total plant C and 17 – 18 % of total plant N in the root biomass. The C:N ratio of root biomass was consistently high (47 – 52), and at least double the shoot (16 – 23). With high C, low N, and high C:N ratio of the rye roots, inorganic-N from soil or degrading shoot biomass could be immobilized with root degradation and reduce potential N recycling. Cereal rye (Secale cereal L.) cover crops (RCC) have good potential to take up residual NO 3 between grain crops and reduce loss to surface waters. However, studies in Iowa have shown a 5 – 6 % corn (Zea mays L.) yield reduction when grown following a RCC. The objective of this research was to study agronomic practices that have potential to improve corn yield in a RCC system. This study was conducted at four sites in 2013 through 2015 with corn grown in rotation with soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr. ]. Treatments included cereal rye aerially broadcast into soybean before leaf drop and no RCC, tillage or no-till, and starter N fertilizer (34 kg N ha– 1) or no starter. The aerial RCC sowing, especially with dry fall conditions the first year and planned RCC termination in the spring at 15 – 20 cm height, resulted in non-uniform RCC stand and low biomass and N uptake at termination (154 – 335 kg ha– 1 and 6 – 14 kg N ha– 1). Across site-years, V 6 corn plant height and V 10 sensing indexes were greater with the tilled system and starter N. Overall, corn yield was slightly reduced with the RCC (2. 4 %), however, tillage (3. 3 %) and the high N starter (1. 6 %) consistently increased yield. Soybean yield was not influenced by the aerial seeded RCC or the prior year treatments for corn. While the RCC generally resulted in lower corn yield, starter N and tillage did help offset that reduction and would be expected to help improve corn production in a RCC system...|$|R
40|$|Since {{being built}} in 1990, the {{rhizotron}} facility in Wageningen, the Wageningen Rhizolab, {{has been used for}} experiments on crops (e. g. Alfalfa, Brussels sprouts, common velvet grass, field bean, fodder radish, leeks, lupins, maize, potato, beetroot, ryegrass, spinach, <b>spring</b> wheat, winter <b>rye</b> and winter wheat). In the experiments, horizontal glass minirhizotron tubes combined with auger sampling were used to assess rooting characteristics. For this paper we took the root data from these experiments and looked for a general relationship between thermal time/time after planting and rooting depth, the velocity of the root front and root proliferation. For certain depths (fixed by the depth at which the horizontal minirhizotrons were installed) a simple linear regression was established between the average root number per cm 2 minirhizotron surface area and thermal time after planting. The compartments selected for each crop were those in which there had been a control treatment and/or in which conditions for rooting were considered to be optimal. We performed regression analyses per compartment and per depth, but only for the period after planting in which a linear increase of root numbers vs. thermal time was observed. After averaging the results, the regression procedure yielded two parameters of rooting for each crop: (a) the actual or thermal time at which the first root appeared at a certain depth and (b) the root proliferation rate after the first root had appeared. In this way, inherent crop differences in rooting behaviour (rooting depth and root proliferation) became apparent. For each crop, the velocity of the root front after planting could be established (calculated in cm(°C day) - 1). This parameter differed greatly between crops. Some crops (such as leeks and common velvet grass) explored the soil profile slowly: the root front moved at a velocity of only 0. 07 cm(°C day) - 1. Among the crops whose roots grew down much faster (0. 18 - 0. 26 cm (°C day) - 1) were cereals and fodder radish. For a day with an average temperature of 15 °C these rates would have corresponded with the root front travelling approximately 1 - 4 cm per day. In the crops studied the root front velocity did not correlate with the root proliferation rat...|$|R
