This paper attempts to obtain both analytically and experimentally the efficiency of <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> in HSC columns with hybrid confinement of transverse reinforcement and <b>steel</b> <b>fibers.</b> Toughness ratio (TR) to quantify the confinement efficiency of HSC columns with hybrid confinement is proposed through a regression analysis by involving sixty-nine TRs of HSC without <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> and twenty-seven TRs of HSC with hybrid of transverse reinforcement and <b>steel</b> <b>fibers.</b> The proposed TR equation was further verified by compression tests of seventeen HSC columns conducted in this study, where twelve specimens were reinforced by {{high strength}} rebars in longitudinal and transverse directions.

30|$|According to {{the results}} of {{experimental}} models, all of them fail in the flexural mode. However, the addition of <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> to concrete results in the concentration of damage at the zone of maximum displacement of specimens, whereas in the specimen without <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> the cracks spread in the total length of the beam and finally the model fails at the zone of imposed force. The <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> bridge the microcracks and prevent their opening. At the midspan by increasing displacement, the <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> in the mouth of the crack elongate, yield and finally tear at the ultimate state of the beams. This mechanism results in the increase of capacity of ultimate load and displacement but it seems by increasing the content of fibers from 2 to 4 % the efficiency of <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> is affectless, it can relate to the reduction of workability of concrete and local behavior of concrete. Reinforcing concrete with <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> does not affect the stiffness considerably, but the stability of models in loading and unloading increases. As expected, by the addition of <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> to the concrete mix, the absorption and dissipation of energy increase, but because of the limitation of damage at the length of the specimens the viscous damping decreases.|$|R

50|$|A {{large coal}} seam was first found in Moweaqua on October 3, 1889, {{after two months}} of {{drilling}} by the Samuel Warner and Son firm {{as reported in the}} Moweaqua Call-Mail, the local newspaper. Two years later in November the first mining shaft site was commissioned {{a few blocks from the}} railroad depot, but under a new drilling company called the Cochran Coal and Mining Company under James G. Cochran. Ground was broken for mine construction on December 21, 1891, on land bought from Mrs. M.K. Duncan and the Moweaqua Coal and Manufacturing Company was officially formed. The Moweaqua Call-Mail urged people living in the town to hold out for the coal they hoped to find because then they could buy the coal locally and it would be much cheaper for farmers and manufacturers. On August 30, 1892, three six-foot veins of coal were found in the mine 570 feet below the Earth’s surface and were sold in the market a few days later. The success of the mine increased over the coming months and by February 9, 1893, 25-30 tons of coal was being raised per day and sold at $1.25 for nut coal and $1.50 for lump coal. The mine also introduced plans to have <b>steel</b> <b>fiber</b> cables installed so they could lift eleven tons of coal at once. On August 8, 1894, the first mule was taken into the mine which allowed the mine to hire more workers to watch over the animals in the mine. By 1897, over 100 miners were working in the mine as cage men, motor men, mule drivers, shot firers, blacksmiths and miners. With the increasing number of workers in the mine, Catholic families began to express interest to build a church in Moweaqua and four lots were purchased from a man named Mr. Prescott to start a church. Many single men as well as families were drawn to Moweaqua over the years leading up to the 1932 Disaster because of the prosperous mine and the growing sense of community in the town, but the migrant workers ended up being disconnected from the community and everyone kept to themselves.|$|E

30|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>fibers</b> {{were clearly}} {{observed}} {{to restrict the}} width of the shear cracks, as shown in Fig.  15. Generally, it was observed that as the fiber-factor increased the shear crack width for a given load decreased. Also, the load at which first visible shear crack appeared increased as the fiber-factor increased. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that with the use of higher fiber-factor, more <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> are available in bridging and intersecting the shear crack. The stresses across the shear crack will therefore be shared by a larger number of <b>steel</b> <b>fibers,</b> thereby reducing the tensile strain across the crack. As the strains across the crack and in the <b>steel</b> <b>fibers</b> are reduced, the crack widths will be less.|$|R
