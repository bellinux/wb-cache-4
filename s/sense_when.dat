5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical <b>sense.</b> <b>When</b> Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
25|$|A posteriori {{concepts}} have <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> {{they are}} derived from a mental image {{that is based on}} experienced sense impressions. Kant's a priori concepts, on the other hand, are alleged to have <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> they {{are derived from}} a nonexperienced mental schema, trace, outline, sketch, monogram, or minimal image. This is similar to a Euclidean geometrical diagram.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{supporters}} of Aramaic primacy—of {{the view that}} the Christian New Testament or its sources were originally written in the Aramaic language—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing Greek text of the New Testament make much better <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> back-translated to Aramaic: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.|$|E
25|$|Truth {{tables for}} if-then {{statements}} identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. Strict conditionals assign a positive truth-value to every case except {{the case of}} a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.|$|E

25|$|Unlike median, {{the concept}} of mode makes sense for any random {{variable}} assuming values from a vector space, including the real numbers (a one-dimensional vector space) and the integers (which can be considered embedded in the reals). For example, a distribution of points in the plane will typically have a mean and a mode, but {{the concept of}} median does not apply. The median makes <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> there is a linear order on the possible values. Generalizations {{of the concept of}} median to higher-dimensional spaces are the geometric median and the centerpoint.|$|E
25|$|Koch and Barraud explain such {{apparently}} peculiar {{numbers as}} making more <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> {{seen as part}} of Mughal geometric understanding. Octagons and triangles, which feature extensively in the Taj, have particular properties in terms of the relationships of their sides. A right-angled triangle with two sides of 12 will have a hypotenuse of approximately 17 (16.97+); similarly if it has two sides of 17 its hypotenuse will be approximately 24 (24.04+). An octagon with a width of 17 will have sides of approximately 7 (7.04+), which is the basic grid upon which the mausoleum, mosque and Mihman Khana are planned.|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the four}} probes have tiny heating {{elements}} and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring {{the rate at which}} the heat is dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> the heat pulse arrives. The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E

25|$|To {{make matters}} {{easier for the}} youth, however, the Old Man that dwelt in the first cave the youth had {{discovered}} kept track {{of all of the}} youth's money and inventory items so that the youth could recover them again and take up from roughly the same position. Additionally, the Old Man was capable of telepathic communication with the hero and could grant the child magical abilities for short periods of time by researching spells in tomes of forbidden magic. The Old Man's ability to see clairvoyantly also enabled him to <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> certain plot elements were occurring such as the kidnapping of the great fairy or the washing up of useful items by the seashore. These events would be relayed to the hero telepathically.|$|E
25|$|In {{heteroecious}} species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their secondary host on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The pea aphid has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which they <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> they bump into each other too often. The heteroecious life cycle (which is mainly linked to consumption of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once heteroecious.|$|E
25|$|Thus, Deleuze {{at times}} refers to his {{philosophy}} as a transcendental empiricism (empirisme transcendantal), alluding to Kant and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. In Kant's transcendental idealism, experience only makes <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space, and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming {{the content of}} these forms and categories to be qualities {{of the world as}} it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see below, Epistemology).|$|E

25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E
25|$|The path the Ottoman army took is not known. Kritoboulos {{states that}} Mehmed crossed the Taurus Mountains, {{becoming}} one of only four generals to have crossed them. (The others being Alexander the Great, Pompey, and Tamburlane.) However, as his translator Charles Riggs points out, to Kritoboulos all of the mountain systems of Asia Minor {{were part of the}} Taurus. Doukas states that Mehmed led his soldiers across Armenia and the Phasis River, then ascended the Caucasus Mountains before reaching Trebizond. This makes no <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> one examines a map, for both the Phasis River and the Caucasus are far to the east of their destination. However, Mihailović wrote in his memoirs that the army marched into Georgia, so it is possible that Mehmed did make a show of force to intimidate the kings of Georgia from aiding their ally. Or this is further proof that the soldiers in the Sultan's army had as little idea where they were going as the hairs in the Sultan's beard.|$|E

500|$|In stanza 8 of {{the poem}} Fjölsvinnsmál, Svafrþorinn is stated {{as the father of}} Menglöð by an unnamed mother, who the hero Svipdagr seeks. Menglöð has often been theorized as the goddess Freyja, and {{according}} to this theory, Svafrþorinn would therefore be Njörðr. The theory is complicated by the etymology of the name Svafrþorinn (þorinn meaning [...] "brave" [...] and svafr means [...] "gossip") (or possibly connects to sofa [...] "sleep"), which Rudolf Simek says makes little <b>sense</b> <b>when</b> attempting to connect it to Njörðr.|$|E
