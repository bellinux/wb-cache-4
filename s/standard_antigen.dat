Serum samples from 207 patients with {{cystic fibrosis}}, 100 healthy children, and 94 healthy adults were examined. The patients responded to P. aeruginosa infection with early IgA and IgG antibody responses that {{were significantly higher than}} in controls and noncolonized patients. Analysis of paired serum samples showed that infected patients had an increase in specific IgG and IgA antibodies that was significantly higher than in noncolonized patients. The serological data were analyzed for correlation with clinical condition; poor lung function was significantly associated with increased levels of IgA and IgG antibodies to P. aeruginosa alginate and to the <b>standard</b> <b>antigen</b> and with a relative excess of IgA antibodies to the <b>standard</b> <b>antigen</b> compared with IgA antibodies to P. aeruginosa alginate. The assays showed high predictive values if positive, but a negative test did not exclude infection, and the ELISAs should not be used for diagnostic purposes. Mucoid strains were present initially in the sputa of 28 of 54 infected patients with paired serum samples. These patients had a significant increase in anti-alginate antibodies, but it was not different from the increase seen in patients infected only with nonmucoid strains. Therefore, alginate may also be produced in vivo by nonmucoid P. aeruginosa. The study showed that early formation of IgA and IgG antibodies to P. aeruginosa alginate did not prevent development of chronic infection and that P. aeruginosa-specific IgA antibodies correlate with poor lung function...|$|E

Small quantities of the antigen gp 43 were found in culture filtrates of P. lutzii strains and this molecule appeared to be more variable within P. lutzii because the synonymous-nonsynonymous mutation rate was lower, indicating an evolutionary process {{different from that of}} the remaining genotypes. The production of gp 43 also varied between isolates belonging to the same species, indicating that speciation events are important, but not sufficient to fully explain the diversity in the production of this antigen.

Gel immunodiffusion tests, with <b>standard</b> <b>antigens</b> homologous to the antisera prepared against glutaraldehyde-fixed virus of 11 strains, showed that they could be divided into three serogroups on the basis of spur formation in heterologous reactions. Two of the serogroups included either subgroup I or subgroup II isolates, whereas the third serogroup consisted of only one strain (Y(WA)) which was homologous to all the strains tested. Use of heterologous <b>standard</b> <b>antigens</b> in this test failed to show further subgrouping of the antigens. Double-antibody sandwich (DAS) -ELISA using polyclonal antibodies to distinct virus strains also placed the 14 strains in the same three serogroups. When eight different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were used in indirect ELISA, one of them distinguished subgroup-I strains and another distinguished subgroup-II strains; the Y(WA) strain fell into subgroup II. Other MAbs showed narrower or broader specificity. Thus both molecular hybridization with total RNA and specific MAbs may be useful for separating isolates of CMV into subgroups I and II.

40|$|Johne’s disease, {{caused by}} Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (Map), is a chronic infectious enteritis in clinical stage manifesting in progressive diarrhoea and emaciation. There is no effective cure against this disease. And {{due to the}} persistence of Map in {{the environment and the}} lengthy subclinical stage in which cows shed bacteria without clinical signs of disease, it easily spread within herds. It is difficult to interpret diagnostics, because of the delayed immune response against Map. Cell mediated immunity is important against this intracellular bacterium. Accordingly, it is aimed in this study to detect specific antigens that induce the cell mediated immune response, in order to detect Map infection in an early stage of disease. IFN-γ {{is one of the key}} components in the cell mediated immune response. Map-specific PPE proteins were recombinantly expressed and purified to incubate with blood cells of cows, positive on antibody-ELISA, to stimulate the T cells to secrete IFN-γ, which is measured as a criterion for the specific cell mediated immune response against the selected protein antigens. These Map-specific proteins are compared with <b>standard</b> <b>antigens</b> concerning the ability to stimulate T cells to secrete IFN-γ, resulting in the detection of cell mediated immune response against Map PPE proteins. This experiment resulted in IFN-γ production in response to the <b>standard</b> <b>antigens</b> and to the Map-specific proteins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic bronchopulmonary {{infection}} with mucoid, alginate producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs characteristically {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis. Alginate may be a virulence factor for P aeruginosa infection in such patients. METHODS: Forced vital capacity (FVC), nutritional state and the antibody response to P aeruginosa were determined at regular intervals from three years before chronic P aeruginosa infection to 10 years afterwards in 73 patients with cystic fibrosis. All patients were treated intensively with antipseudomonal chemotherapy during the study period. RESULTS: FVC was reduced in all patients who subsequently developed P aeruginosa infection before they acquired the infection, indicating significant pre-existing lung damage when compared with patients who remained free of P aeruginosa. Lung function and nutritional state remained unchanged after 10 years of infection, except in the patients who died of P aeruginosa lung infection. The FVC and height and weight of patients infected with nonmucoid strains of P aeruginosa {{were similar to those}} of uninfected patients. Patients infected with mucoid strains had poorer lung function and nutritional state for the first five years after infection compared with patients with nonmucoid strains. Such infection was also associated with greater IgG and IgA antibody responses to P aeruginosa <b>standard</b> <b>antigen</b> compared with nonmucoid infection. Concentrations of antibody to alginate were similar in patients with non-mucoid and mucoid infection. Noticeably increased concentrations of IgA antibodies to P aeruginosa <b>standard</b> <b>antigen</b> were observed early after the onset of infection in patients who subsequently died. CONCLUSION: Alginate producing P aeruginosa infection is associated with a hyperimmune response and poor clinical condition, suggesting that alginate production is a virulence factor in such infections in patients with cystic fibrosis...|$|E

Recently developed standard antigen-antibody systems for A. israelii by CIE were used as reference. The reference systems were based on standard preparations of cytoplasmic and whole cell-associated antigens of A. israelii and a standard immunoglobulin G pool purified from rabbit antisera to formalin-treated whole cells and cell lysates of A. israelii. The specificity of the <b>standard</b> <b>antigens</b> for A. israelii was evaluated in CIE studies by screening for antibodies to components of the antigens in rabbit antisera raised against related bacteria. The standard system for A. israelii based on cytoplasmic antigens formed species-specific precipitins whereas antisera raised against A. naeslundii and/or Propionibacterium acnes precipitated components of the other <b>standard</b> <b>antigens.</b> As a result of these analyses, the standard system for A. israelii based on 10 cytoplasmic antigens was used as reference for CIE studies to detect humoral antibodies to A. israelii in sera from nine patients with actinomycosis.

40|$|Quantitative {{immunoelectrophoresis}} {{allows a}} polyvalent approach to immuno-chemical problems, i. e., identification, quantitation, and thereby standardization of antigens and antibodies in complex mixtures, for example as in crude extracts of microorganisms and their corresponding antisera. This {{approach is a}} short cut to conventional standardization of single purified substances, since the polyvalent approach gives a precise quantitative impression as described in this investigation and therefore enables the immunochemist to precisely select the right substance(s) to be purified for further standardization and characterization. To secure the precision of the results, in complex systems it is a sine qua non to select a complex antibody <b>standard,</b> a complex <b>antigen</b> <b>standard,</b> and to describe the complex standard precipitate pattern which again allows a quantitative study of the reproducibility of methods and procedures. The present article describes how such a standardization was approached in this laboratory {{within the field of}} Candida albicans immunochemistry. By means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis, 78 water-soluble antigens were demonstrated and enumerated in an <b>antigen</b> <b>standard</b> prepared from one strain of C. albicans A (B 311 Hasenclever). The antibody standard consisted of purified and concentrated rabbit antibodies. The migration velocity of each antigen was indicated in relation to purified human albumin. Not all precipitates could be seen in one immunoplate; therefore a standardized procedure was worked out showing reproducibly 54 precipitates. The reproducibility of quantitation by the crossed-immunoelectrophoresis procedure was determined for each of 30 antigens by repeated measurements; the relative standard deviations ranged from 2. 4 to 15. 4 % and were below 10 % for 24 antigens. A simple standardized antigen production procedure was described in great detail, and by quantitative determinations on 30 antigens the procedure was found to be satisfactorily reproducible. By means of crossed-line immunoelectrophoresis in the modification called absorption of antibodies in situ, it was found that strain B 311 contained no specific antigens in comparison to eight other strains of C. albicans. Thirty antigens were quantitated in antigen preparations made by the standardized procedure from the eight strains, and each antigen concentration was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} <b>antigen</b> <b>standard.</b> For each <b>antigen</b> a significant inter-strain variation was observed. Of 30 antigens, fifteen were satisfactorily stable after storage at − 20 C for 1 ½ years. The laboratory methods and procedures described in this article thus work with high precision and allow a rapid collection of quantitative data concerning many individual antigens and their corresponding antibodies without purification of antigens. A new complex <b>antigen</b> <b>standard</b> can be made with satisfactory precision from strain B 311. The production of a similar complex antibody standard is a major problem; therefore the main problem in the intra-laboratory standardization seems to be the change from one complex standard to another. In inter-laboratory standardization on the complex level, there seems to be a minimum demand that the first laboratory distributes the antibody standard and that other laboratories use the methods and procedures of the first laboratory...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} analysis of serological data {{has provided the}} basis for a new serotyping routine. This paper describes the process whereby the results of agglutination reactions between the <b>standard</b> O <b>antigens</b> of Escherichia coli and rabbit antisera raised against them were used to produce a much simpler, faster, and cheaper method of serotyping. This new method for serotyping E. coli requires on average only one-fifth of the serum used in the previous method and requires less than half the laboratory time. By using this method, an efficient serotyping routine can be established for any set of comparable data regardless of the bacterial group...|$|R
40|$|Ether {{treatment}} was studied {{as a method}} of increasing the ability of type B influenza antigen to detect antibody by hemagglutination inhibition. Comparisons were made with the untreated antigen, with an eluate made from the same virus, and with a <b>standard</b> type B <b>antigen</b> of an earlier virus. Results were evaluated based on the comparative ability to detect rises in antibody titer, as well as the relative frequency of antibody prevalence determined by each method. The ether-treated antigen was far superior to the untreated antigen in both respects; it was also superior to the eluate, although the difference was less pronounced. The treated antigen performed better than the <b>standard</b> type B <b>antigen</b> in detecting antibody in children, but there was little difference in adults. This pattern was felt to be a result of the closer relation of the treated antigen to the infecting strain. The method is, therefore, proposed as a means of producing more reactive antigens of currently circulating strains of type B influenza virus...|$|R
