2500|$|The main {{condenser}} {{is a large}} cross-flow tube-and-shell {{heat exchanger}} that takes wet vapor, a mixture of liquid water and steam at saturation conditions, from the turbine-generator exhaust and condenses it back into <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> water {{so it can be}} pumped back to the reactor by the condensate and feedwater pumps. [...] This condensing process is accomplished by allowing the wet vapor turbine exhaust to come into contact with thousands of tubes that have much colder water flowing through them on the other side. [...] The cooling water will typically come from a natural body of water such as a river or lake. [...] Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, located in the desert about 60 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona, is the only nuclear facility that does not use a natural body of water for cooling, instead using treated sewage from the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. [...] The cross-flow aspect of a typical main condenser means the two fluids that are exchanging heat, turbine exhaust and the cold water from a river or other water source, are flowing in perpendicular directions. [...] This is extremely effective at allowing for phase separation, that is, the heavier, condensed water falls off of the condenser tubes into the condenser hotwell found {{at the bottom of the}} heat exchanger and awaits its turn to be pumped. [...] The water coming from the cooling body of water is either pumped back to the water source at a warmer temperature or returns to a cooling tower where it either cools for more uses or evaporates into water vapor that rises out the top of the tower.|$|E

40|$|We {{have made}} a {{detailed}} examination of the mineralogy, textures, and assemblages of six calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAI) in the Allende meteorite.

Examples of each type appear to have crystallized from a liquid rather than by agglomeration of solid nebular condensates. Some lines of evidence for a liquid origin are the presence of spherical and ovoid shapes and rims containing minerals that are more refractory than minerals inside the inclusion. Thermodynamic calculations and comparisons with liquidus phase diagrams indicate that the CAI could have been produced by direct condensation to metastable <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquids</b> that subsequently crystallized or by remelting of an equilibrium high-temperature condensate by impact.

5000|$|The term {{subcooling}} {{refers to}} a liquid existing at a temperature below its normal boiling point. For example, water boils at 373 K; at room temperature (300 K) the water is termed [...] "subcooled". A <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> is the convenient state in which, say, refrigerants may undergo the remaining stages of a refrigeration cycle. Normally, a refrigeration system has a subcooling stage, allowing technicians {{to be certain that}} the quality, in which the refrigerant reaches the next step on the cycle, is the desired one. Subcooling may take place in heat exchangers and outside them. Being both similar and inverse processes, subcooling and superheating are important to determine stability and well-functioning of a refrigeration system.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} flash-gas in the liquid line include a {{cautious}} {{design of the}} cooling system and its piping, but also the incorporation of gear that might help solve this type of difficulty. The inclusion of a refrigerant receiver is a common, cheap and simple way of decreasing the gas ratio in the liquid line. The incorporation of a subcooling stage after the receiver reduces even more the chances to observe flash gas. This subcooling may {{be done in a}} reserved portion of the main condenser, or separately with a heat exchanger. Some receivers may incorporate an internal heat exchanger that draws heat form the <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> to superheat the gas compressors suction. There are also many kinds of independent subcooling displays and applications such as refrigeration cycle optimizers; these help avoiding flash-gas in the liquid line by lowering the temperature away from the refrigerant’s saturation curves. Some systems deal with flash-gas by separating it from the refrigerant that goes to the evaporator, as that portion of the refrigerant alrealdy evaporated and will only increase superheating.|$|E
50|$|Column {{separation}} {{is a phenomenon}} that can occur during a water-hammer event. If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid, cavitation will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure). This {{is most likely to}} occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). When <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases. This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space. The liquid {{on either side of the}} vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference. The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. This pressure rise can damage hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.|$|E

This coefficient depends on the temperature, is sensitive to the conditions at the interface, and is influenced by small amounts of impurities. Even recent measurements of the accommodation coefficient for water (Hagen et al, 1989) showed a huge variation in Beta from 1 for 1 micron droplets to 0. 006 for 15 micron droplets.

5000|$|The NK-33 series {{engines are}} high-pressure, regeneratively cooled staged {{combustion}} cycle bipropellant rocket engines, and use oxygen-rich preburners {{to drive the}} turbopumps. The turbopumps require <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> oxygen (LOX) to cool the bearings. These kinds of burners are highly unusual, since their hot, oxygen-rich exhaust tends to attack metal, causing burn-through failures. The United States had not investigated oxygen-rich combustion technologies until the Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator project in the early 2000s. The Soviets, however, perfected the metallurgy behind this method. The nozzle was constructed from [...] metal, brazed to an outer and inner lining, giving a simple, light, but strong structure. In addition, since the NK-33 uses LOX and RP-1 as propellants, which have similar densities, a single rotating shaft {{could be used for}} both turbopumps. The NK-33 engine is among the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any Earth-launchable rocket engine, only NPO Energomash RD-253 and SpaceX Merlin 1D engine achieve a higher ratio. The specific impulse of the NK-33 is significantly higher than both these engines. The NK-43 is similar to the NK-33, but is designed for an upper stage, not a first stage. It has a longer nozzle, optimized for operation at altitude, where there is little to no ambient air pressure. This gives it a higher thrust and specific impulse, but makes it longer and heavier.

However, this energy use is a significant contributor to increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration and, hence, global warming. Capture and disposal Of CO 2 has received increased R&D attention in the last decade as the technology promises to be the most cost effective for large scale reductions in CO 2 emissions.

Technically, CO 2 can be transported through pipelines {{in the form of a}} gas, a supercritical. fluid or in the <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> state. Operationally, most CO 2 pipelines used for enhanced oil recovery transport CO 2 as a supercritical fluid.

Using a commercially available process simulator, ASPEN PLUS 10. 1, the results show that <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> transport maximizes the energy efficiency and minimizes the Cost Of CO 2 transport over long distances under both isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Pipeline transport of <b>subcooled</b> <b>liquid</b> CO 2 can be ideally used in areas of cold climate or by burying and insulating the pipeline.
