30|$|Se/Te NWs were {{synthesized}} by a two-step solution process. First, {{fabrication of}} Te NCs by a chemical solution process similar to our previous report [23, 24]. Typically, 2 mmol of orthotelluric acid and 0.5 g SDBS {{were added to}} 100 mL pure water. The solution was then refluxed for 1 h until a clear solution was obtained. Then, the resulting solution was heated up to 95 °C {{at a rate of}} 10 °C/min in an argon atmosphere. After 30 min, 1.5 mL of hydrazine was quickly injected into the solution through a syringe and the solution turned black and cloudy immediately. The solution was kept at 95 °C for another 15 mins and then moved to an ice bath to quench the reaction to 0 °C. The resulting solution was refluxed at room temperature for different time periods in order to get NWs with different lengths. To obtain short Te nanorods and nanoparticles, the reflux time is about 1 or 2 days while it takes at least 6 days to obtain long Te nanorods. Second, to obtain the V-shaped or U-shaped Se/Te NWs, the resulting solution, which was refluxed for about 1 day, was heated to 95 °C, and then a 15 mL solution containing 1 mmol, 2 mmol, or 4 mmol <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> was added drop by drop through a funnel into the resulting solution containing trigonal Te nanorods and colloids. The corresponding feeding ratio between Se to Te is 1 : 2, 1 : 1, and 2 : 1, respectively. The solution was refluxed at 95 °C for another 3 h and cooled down to room temperature. On the other hand, to obtain Se/Te NW with a straight morphology, the resulting solution that had been refluxed for 4 days was heated to 95 °C, and then a 15 mL solution containing 2 mmol <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> was added drop by drop through a funnel into the resulting solution which contains trigonal Te nanorods and colloids. The solution was refluxed at 95 °C for another 3 h and cooled down to room temperature.|$|E
30|$|One-dimensional (1 D) {{nanostructures}} such as nanowires (NWs), nanobelts, nanorods, and nanotubes, {{have been}} the focus of intensive research due to their novel electronic properties and potential applications in nanoscale devices [1 – 6]. Among them, semiconductor NWs is investigated in more detail due to their important roles in fabricating nanoscale electronic or optoelectronic devices [7 – 11]. The growing interest in semiconductor NWs for electronic and photonic applications makes rational control over their morphology, structure, and key properties more and more important. It also requires thorough understanding of the growth mechanisms in specific material systems and techniques. Most group IV [12, 13], III–V [14], and II–VI [15] semiconductor compounds NWs had been fabricated via the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism successfully. By this method, a liquid metal alloy initiates the growth of a solid whisker from vapor reactants. Compared to the VLS method, solution phase reactions have the advantage that seeds are not restricted to a two-dimensional (2 D) growth plane, and copious quantities of well-defined nanostructures can be obtained easily compared to methods based on vapor-phase reactions. Chemical solution NW growth for group VI semiconductor material systems was envisioned to occur via the solution–solid–solution mechanism, in which trigonal Se or Te seeds initiate the growth of solid Se, Te, or Se/Te alloy NWs from solution reactants. Traditionally, Se [16 – 18] and Te [19] NWs have been synthesized by reduced <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> or orthotelluric acid at elevated temperatures, typically at 90 – 100 °C or by the reduction of metal–salt solutions with ascorbic acid at room temperature, or by a mild bio-molecule-assisted reduction method under hydrothermal conditions. As Se and Te have similar trigonal structures, it is possible that Se/Te alloy NWs of a single crystalline nature can be obtained by reducing <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> and orthotelluric acid {{at the same time in}} solution. More importantly, as Te tends to form in the trigonal phase more readily than Se, one may fabricate Se/Te heterojunctions by using Te nanorods as crystalline seeds. Although Xia et al. [20] had synthesized Se–Te alloy nanorods successfully by reducing <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> and orthotelluric acid with hydrazine at the temperature range of 90 – 100 °C, the lateral dimensions and morphology of the Se/Te NWs could not be controlled in this case due to lack of any surfactant and exact experimental control. On the other hand, the use of a trigonal Te NCs as a crystalline seed in Se/Te NW growth has received less attention. Qian Research Group [21, 22] had previously reported that by employing sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) or other surfactants, Te nanorods with well controlled diameters and lengths could be reproducibly produced, which made the fabrication of Se/Te NWs by using Te NCs as crystalline seeds possible. Our research group [23] had further found that by using SDBS as the surfactant, the morphology and the lateral dimensions of Se/Te alloy NWs could be easily controlled. Following this, Se–Te alloy NWs with V-shaped structure has been prepared for the first time successfully by our research group with SDBS as surfactant [24].|$|E
40|$|Sodium {{selenite}} is more hygroscopic than sodium selenate. It is, therefore, {{more likely}} to dissolve when dispersed in feeds of relatively high water activity. When dissolved, it may form <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> and disperse as a vapor. This is easily demonstrated by mounting a filter paper wetted with a reagent such as ascorbic acid over the subject feed, but not in contact with it. The paper turns brown as elemental selenium is formed from reduction of the vapor. Analysis of the paper ensures that the brown is indeed selenium. Though premixes are generally low enough in moisture content to ensure stability of the selenites, {{this is not true}} of many feeds. The water activities of a number of feeds, feed premixes, and feed ingredients have been determined instrumentally and compared to those of saturated solutions of sodium selenite and sodium selenate.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} effect of selenium on experimental dyskinesia in rats. The movement disorders were produced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) in the dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 12 days. <b>Selenious</b> <b>acid</b> was administered daily 30 minutes before IDPN in the doses of 5 mumol/kg, 10 mumol/kg and 20 mumol/kg bodyweight in three different groups of rats. Animals were observed daily for any neurobehavioral changes including circling, backwalking, head weaving and twitching. Immediately after behavioral studies, blood and brain specimens were collected for analysis of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) to measure the extent of free radical production. Our results showed that concurrent use of selenium significantly inhibited IDPN-induced neurobehavioral changes in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of rats with selenium also reduced the TBARS production in blood and different regions of brain. These findings suggest that selenium attenuates the IDPN-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation...|$|E

We assessed the Niboshi and its extract as food source of the micronutrient selenium (Se). The Se content in the Niboshi was 1. 14 ± 0. 01 μg/g and up to 60 % of its total Se was found in the abdominal part. After the feeding of Niboshi-supplemented diets for 7 weeks to mice, the organ Se contents and hepatic cellular and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were comparable to those of <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> (SA) -fed mice. As the Niboshi is a processed foodstuff for extracting a base seasoning used in many Japanese dishes, the absorptivity of Se from its extract was further examined in dietary Se-depleted mice. The daily oral administration of the Niboshi extract to the mice for 7 days improved the Se contents in the blood and liver and the GPx activities. Thus, the Niboshi can serve as an efficient dietary source of Se in mice. Taking the daily intake habit of the Niboshi into consideration, it would contribute to the dietary intake of Se in Japan...|$|E
40|$|Selenium {{concentration}} in the brain tissue is far less variable than those in peripherals, such as the liver and kidneys, in rodents, when fed a selenium-deficient diet. This fact implies {{the importance of this}} element for maintaining the integrity of brain functions and the distinctive selenium metabolism and/or the regulatory mechanism in the brain. To obtain basic information concerning the homeostatically maintained selenium store in the brain, we investigated absorption and retention characteristics of selenium from <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> (SA) and seleno-l-methionine (SeMet) in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, in comparison to isolated rat hepatocytes and renal cells in vitro. When DRG neurons were cultured in an SA-free medium subsequent to an SA-supplemented one for 24 h, the DRG neurons maintained a higher selenium concentration than that before SA supplementation over a period of 96 h after removal of SA from the culture medium. The cellular glutathione peroxidase activity of the cells increased for 72 h after removal of SA from the culture medium. A similar retention characteristic of selenium was also observed for DRG neurons treated with SeMet-supplemented culture medium. Consequently, selenium from source compounds, in part, was thought to be retained in DRG neurons and then be utilized for the synthesis of selenium-containing proteins, which implied the presence of a neuron-specific selenium retention mechanism...|$|E

For osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, the aspirates were transduced using similar rAAV-mediated gene transfer conditions as those described above and then induced either toward osteogenic differentiation using the StemPro Osteogenesis Differentiation kit or adipogenic differentiation using the StemPro Adipogenesis Differentiation kit (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) (Frisch et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{labeling}} procedure was developed based on optimal conditions of anticoagulant, stannous ion concentration, incubation time, and incubation temperature. This procedure {{was used to}} investigate the effects of various agents on Tc- 99 m RBC labeling yields. These agents were inorganic ions, therapeutic agents, biochemicals, chelating agents, oxidizing agents, an enzyme poison, and methemoglobinemia agents. The experiments {{for most of the}} agents consisted of both post- and pretinning procedures. For post-tinning, the selected agent was added to the blood sample before stannous ion. For pretinning, the agent was added to blood after the addition of stannous ion. In addition, a limited in vivo study in rats was conducted. For this study, the following agents were investigated for their effect on RBC labeling yield: sodium chromate, <b>selenious</b> <b>acid,</b> ferrous sulfate, digoxin and dimercaptosuccinic acid. Agents that reduced the RBC labeling yields in post-tinning in vitro procedures were ferric, ferrous, cupric, and stannic ions. Agents that reduced the labeling yields in both post- and pretinning in vitro procedures were dimercaptosuccinic acid, dimercaprol, edetic acid, methylene blue, chromate amd selenite ions. Glucose and cysteine had no effect on the labeling yields of fresh or stored blood. Glutathione and inosine increased the labeling yields of stored blood.

The lack of certified forest soil reference materials {{led us to}} develop internal reference samples. Samples were collected from three soil horizons (Oa, B, and C) at three locations having forested, acidic soils similar to those we commonly analyze. A shatterbox was used to homogenize the nine samples. The Radiation Laboratory of the University of Massachusetts, Lowell completed neutron activation analyses (NA) on our samples. Our laboratory performed five digestion procedures: microwave [nitric acid (HNO 3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), fluoboric acid (HBF 4), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) ], block [sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4), <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 SeO 3), and H 2 O 2], hot plate ([hydrofluoric acid (HF) and perchloric acid (HClO 4) ], and flux [lithium borate (LiBO 2) and lithium treborate (Li 2 B 4 O 7) ]. Concentrations of phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), and potassium (K) were measured by direct current plasma spectrometry (DCP). The results of the digestion procedures were compared with results from the neutron activation analyses (NA) allowing us to choose the most effective digest procedure.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether selenium supplementation of parenteral nutrition with 3 micrograms/kg/day of <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> {{is safe and}} effective in improving the selenium status of preterm infants. METHODS: Thirty eight preterm infants with mean (SEM) birthweight of 1171 (38) g and gestational age 29 (0. 3) weeks were randomly allocated to a non-supplemented (PN-selenium, n = 19) or supplemented (PN+selenium, n = 19) group. The study began at 2. 8 (0. 2) (range 1 - 5) days of age. Term breastfed (n = 23) and formula fed (n = 8) infants were used as a reference group. RESULTS: Initially {{there was no difference}} between the preterm groups in plasma or erythrocyte selenium or glutathione peroxidase activity. Plasma selenium declined by a mean (SEM) of - 13. 3 (3. 2) micrograms/l from 28 (4) to 16 (3) micrograms/l over the first three weeks in the PN-selenium group, but there was no fall in the supplemented infants and no net change in either group over six weeks. Over six weeks, there was a net decline in erythrocyte selenium of - 106 (27) ng/g haemoglobin in the PN-selenium group, but no change in the PN+selenium group, such that at week 6 erythrocyte selenium was lower in the PN-selenium group (401 (17) ng/g haemoglobin) than the PN+selenium group (493 (25) ng/g haemoglobin). Urinary selenium was substantially higher in the PN+selenium group at each week. Initially term and preterm plasma selenium concentrations were similar, but they increased in term breastfed infants (+ 17 (2) micrograms/l), with both groups of preterm infants having lower plasma selenium concentrations at week 6 compared with term breastfed infants (PN-selenium 22 (3) micrograms/l; PN+selenium 23 (4) micrograms/l and term breastfed 49 (2) micrograms/l). CONCLUSIONS: Selenium supplementation of PN at 3 g/kg/day prevented depletion in newborns, but was inadequate to achieve selenium concentrations equivalent to those of breastfed term infants. Whether higher doses are more effective remains to be determined, particularly in light of the high urinary selenium secretion in supplemented infants. Selenium supplementation of both parenteral nutrition and formulas is recommended, but the optimal form and dose remain unclear...|$|E
40|$|The {{review of}} the {{chemistry}} of the benzodiazoles is largely confined to considerations of the four parent heterocyclic systems under investigation, namely, 1. 2. 3 -benzothiadiazole and 1, 2, 3 -benzoselenadiazole, 2. 1. 3 -beazothiadiazole and 2,l, 3 -benzoselenadiazole. The benzothiadiazoles and their selenium analogues only combine with one molecular proportion of quaternizing agent; while some bis- quaternaries have been prepared, di-quaternary salts are never obtained. The merits of various quaternizing agents, viz., alkyl iodides, dialkyl sulphates, alkyl p-toluenesulphonates, and alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates for the preparation of methyl and ethyl quaternary salts of these very weak bases are discussed, and the anions of such compounds are exchanged to form chlorides, bromides, iodides, perchlorates, thiocyanates and cyanides, with interesting properties. Though 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole is an unsymmetrical compound, in practice {{only one of the}} three possible isomers of alkyl- 1, 2, 3 - benzothiadiazolium salts is obtained. The position of alkylation is considered in the light of evidence from reductive cleavage (to give N-alkyl-o-aminothiophenols), reaction with alkali and spectroscopic measurements; N(3) appears the most likely site. There is little doubt about the structure of alkyl- 2,l, 3 -benzothiadiazolium and -benzoselenadiazolium salts; their decomposition in water yields sulphurous or <b>selenious</b> <b>acid</b> and the N-alkyl-o-phenylenediamine. The alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates afford the best scope for obtaining higher alkyl quaternaries. The benzothiadiazoles and their selenium analogues undergo quaternization with n-propyl, n-butyl, n-amyl, iso-butyl and iso-amyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphorates, though thermal decomposition of the iso-alkyl esters is a serious problem. Secondary or tertiary alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates are unobtainable but very small quantities of sec. -alkyl quaternary iodides of l, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole and 2, 1, 3 -benzoselenadiazole result from the use of iso-propyl iodide. Some polymethylene bis-quaternaries are prepared, especially by means of a convenient one-stage process involving heterocyclic base, ?,w-di-iodoalkane and silver 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonate. The work done establishes that the effectiveness of the alkyl 2, 4 - dinitrobenzenesulphonates as quaternizing agents decreases as the series is ascended.

At birth, 97 pigs from sows fed a vitamin E-selenium-deficient diet were divided into two groups. One group was injected with 100 IU dl-(alpha) -tocopherol acetate to ascertain the effect on pre-weaning survival. At 3 weeks of age, 72 pigs were weaned and individually fed one of five experimental diets for 4 weeks. The basal diet was a semi-purified, Torula yeast diet deficient in selenium and supplemented with 100 IU dl-(alpha) -tocopherol acetate per kilogram of diet. Treatments were the basal diet supplemented with 0,. 025,. 050,. 075, or. 10 ppm selenium as <b>selenious</b> <b>acid.</b> Pigs were weighed, bled, and feed intake was measured weekly. Pigs were killed {{at the end of the}} experiment and the pancreases were removed;Percent pre-weaning survival was significantly higher for the vitamin E-injected group compared to the untreated group (90 % vs. 70 %). After weaning, five pigs receiving no supplemental selenium and one pig receiving. 025 ppm supplemental selenium died within the first 2 weeks. In five of these, autopsy revealed gross and microscopic lesions in liver and heart typical of those observed in vitamin E-selenium deficiency. Selenium supplementation had no significant effect on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADF), or feed to gain ratio (F:G). There was a significant linear increase in these performance parameters, regardless of treatment, as time on experiment increased. As a group, unsupplemented pigs had poorer ADG, ADF, and F:G than supplemented pigs, but the difference was not significant. An increase in supplemental selenium and time on experiment produced a significant linear increase in serum selenium concentration and a significant linear and quadratic increase in serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. A significant treatment by time interaction was observed for serum selenium and GSH-Px activity. With time on experiment, the level of serum selenium and GSH-Px in unsupplemented pigs declined while increasing in supplemented pigs. A significant correlation (r =. 81) between serum selenium concentration and GSH-Px activity was observed;Supplemental selenium did not affect the weight or protein content of the pancreas. Selenium concentration of pancreatic tissue increased linearly and quadratically in response to increasing selenium supplementation. The logarithm of pancreatic selenium concentration increased linearly in response to increased selenium supplementation. A significant correlation (r =. 35) between selenium concentration and GSH-Px activity of the pancreatic tissue was observed. Selenium supplementation did not affect the activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, (alpha) -amylase, or lipase in pancreatic tissue. The activity of these enzymes was lower in the unsupplemented pigs than in the supplemented pigs but the difference was not significant. There was a significant linear improvement in apparent digestability of dry matter and nitrogen as selenium supplementation increased. There was no significant treatment effect on apparent digestibility of ether extract.
