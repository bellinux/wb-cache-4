40|$|Abstract — The grouper is {{a popular}} marine food fish of high market value in Southeast Asia. Groupers have been farmed in netcages in coastal water for a longtime. The species which have been reared in {{tropical}} countries are estuarine grouper, Epinephelus malabaricus, black <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper,</b> E. salmoides and brown <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper,</b> E. tauvina. Some countries, like Indonesia and Singapore have attempted to rear leopard grouper, Plectropomus leopardus. In southern part of China and Japan the red <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus akaara, have been cultured in floating netcage. Induced breeding trials for E. tauvina have been conducted since 1977 in Singapore. The induced spawning by hormone injection have been reported successful in Singapore, Kuwait and Thailand. However, the nursing of fry up to fingerlings are still under experiment. Therefore, uncertain supply of fingerlings from the wild has been the main problem for fish culture through out the region...|$|E

40|$|Lactoferrin (LF), {{which is}} known as a {{functional}} glycoprotein originated from mammalian fluid, was orally administrated to juvenile orange <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> (initial wt = 3. 0 g) to investigate its effects on growth response, mucus secretion, tolerance to air exposure and response in heat shock protein under low salinity condition. Test diets containing four different concentrations of LF (0, 400, 800 and 1200 mg LF / kg diet) were fed to the juvenile groupers for 30 days. At the termination of feeding trial, amounts of secreted mucus on body surface were measured, while fish were exposed to the air for 60 min to examine the recovery from respiratory distress condition. Furthermore, fish were exposed to low salinity (3. 5 ppt) seawater for 0 and 6 h, respectively. After low salinity seawater exposure, the quantitative levels of heat shock protein 70 family (HSP 70 s) in branchial lamellae were measured. Dietary LF did not affect growth rate of this species under the condition applied in this study. Mucus secretion significantly increased in all LF supplemented groups compared to that in LF-free group. Recovery rate from air exposure stress test increased with increasing dietary LF level. Under the low salinity exposure, significantly higher levels of HSP 70 s were detected in 800 and 1200 mg LF supplemented groups than that in LF-free group in both 0 and 6 h exposure.

Planning on hatching time of eggs through different incubation temperature was an option to solve that problem. This experiment was aimed to find out the optimum temperature for groupers eggs and the minimum temperature to arrange incubation time and to plan the hatching time. Fertilized eggs were incubated into three beaker glasses of 1 liter in volume with the density of ± 250 eggs/liter. The incubation was done under laboratory condition at controlled temperature, i. e.

In this study, a TRIM 13 homolog from orange <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM 13) was cloned and characterized. The full-length of EcTRIM 13 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 399 amino acids which shared 81 % identity with TRIM 13 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that EcTRIM 13 contained conserved RING finger and B-box domain. Expression patterns analysis indicated that EcTRIM 13 was abundant in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and gill. Moreover, the transcript of EcTRIM 13 in grouper spleen was differently regulated after injection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed the tubular structure in wild type EcTRIM 13 transfected cells, but the RING domain mutant resulted in the fluorescence distribution was changed and the bright punctate fluorescence was evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that the RING domain was essential for its accurate localization. Overexpression of EcTRIM 13 in vitro obviously increased the replication of red <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and the enhancing effect of EcTRIM 13 on virus replication was affected by the RING domain. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM 13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3, IRF 7, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA 5), but also decreased the expression of several interferon related factors. In addition, the overexpression of EcTRIM 13 also differently regulated the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors.

In this study, a MDA 5 homolog from orange <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus coioides) (EcMDA 5) was cloned, and its roles on grouper virus infection were characterized. The full-length EcMDA 5 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 982 amino acids with 74 % identity with MDA 5 homolog from rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus). Amino acid alignment analysis indicated that EcMDA 5 contained three functional domains: two caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARDs), a DEAD box helicase-like (DExDc) domain, a helicase superfamily C-terminal domain (HELICc), and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). Upon challenge with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), the transcript of EcMDA 5 was significantly up-regulated especially at the early stage post-injection. Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed that EcMDA 5 mostly localized in the cytoplasm of grouper spleen (GS) cells. Interestingly, during virus infection, the distribution pattern of EcMDA 5 was significantly altered in SGIV infected cells, but not in red <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infected cells, suggested that EcMDA 5 might interact with viral proteins during SGIV infection. The ectopic expression of EcMDA 5 in vitro obviously delayed virus infection induced cytopathic effect (CPE) progression and significantly inhibited viral gene transcription of RGNNV and SGIV. Moreover, over expression of EcMDA 5 not only significantly increased interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activities in a dose dependent manner, but also enhanced the expression of IRF 3, IRF 7 and TRAF 6. In addition, the transcription level of the proinflammatory factors, including TNF-alpha, IL- 6 and IL- 8 were differently altered by EcMDA 5 overexpression during SGIV or RGNNV infection, suggesting that the regulation on proinflammatory cytokines by EcMDA 5 were also important for RGNNV infection. Together, our results demonstrated {{for the first time}} that the inhibitory effect of fish MDA 5 on iridovirus replication might be mainly through the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines.

After stimulation with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or poly I:C, the relative expression of EcTRIM 25 in grouper spleen was significantly increased at the early stage of injection. Subcellular localization analysis showed that EcTRIM 25 distributed throughout the cytoplasm in grouper cells. Notably, the deletion RING domain affected its accurate localization and displayed microtubule like structures or bright aggregates in GS cells. After incubation with SGIV or red <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), overexpression of full length of EcTRIM 25 in vitro significantly decreased the viral gene transcription of SGIV and RGNNV. Consistently, the deletion of RING domain obviously affected the inhibitory effect of EcTRIM 25. Furthermore, overexpression of EcTRIM 25 significantly increased the expression level of interferon related signaling molecules, including interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, interferon-induced 35 -kDa protein (IFP 35), MXI, IRF 7 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD 88), suggesting that the positive regulation of interferon immune response by EcTRIM 25 might affected RGNNV replication directly. Meanwhile, the expression levels of pro-inflammation cytokines were differently regulated by the ectopic expression of EcTRIM 25. We proposed that the regulation of IRF 7, MyD 88 and pro-inflammation cytokines might contribute more important roles in SGIV infection. In addition, the RING domain of EcTRIM 25 also played critical roles in the regulation of interferon immune and inflammation response. Together, our results will provide new evidences that the RING domain was essential for the antiviral action of fish TRIM 25 against iridovirus and nodavirus infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The {{quality of}} a fish gamete is often defined as its ability to be fertilized and hatched, and later {{develops}} into a normal embryo (Chevassus-au-Louis and Lazard 2009; Bobe and Labbe 2010). Fertilization and hatching rates are powerful indicators {{that are used to}} predict the production of high quality fish larvae, larval survivability and economical utilization of overall hatchery operational costs. The fertilization and hatching rate of F 2 hybrid TGGG were averaged at 91.5 % and 80.7 %, respectively. This is considered relatively higher compared to the parental species recorded at 86.8 % and 87.2 %, respectively, as reported by Ch’ng and Senoo (2008) and other hybrid groupers such as: (1) spotted grouper[*]×[*]tiger grouper (E. polyphekadion × E. fuscoguttatus) at 51.0 % and 38.3 %; (2) coral grouper x tiger grouper (E. corallicola × E. fuscoguttatus) at 75.0 % and 35.4 %; (3) and orang <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> × giant grouper (E. coioides × E. lanceolatus) at 91.0 and 33.6 %, respectively (Ch’ng and Senoo 2008; Ivan et al. 2008; Addin and Senoo 2011).|$|E

The rapidly growing orange <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus coioides has experienced relatively severe bacterial disease problems. The proliferation of pathogens in fish can be suppressed by commensal microbe. In this research, probiotic seem to offer an attractive alternative. Bacillus subtilis is a probiotic bacterium that is administered in diet to suppress proliferation of pathogens. In the present study, E. coioides were fed for 6 months with diets contain B. subtilis. Percent weight gain and feed efficiency of the fish fed diets containing 0. 1 % or 1 % probiotics (w/w) were significantly better than the control. The innate cellular response, respiratory burst of the supplemental groups was significantly higher compared to the control on 10 or 20 days after feeding, and even more significant on 30 days. Probiotic B. subtilis increased the intestinal microbial diversity by stimulating the bacterial populations of Paenibacillus sp, Lactobacillus oeni strain 59 b, and Methilacidophilum infernorum strain V 4 that are beneficial for E. coioides. The best dose of probiotic B. subtilis based on growth performances, innate cellular responses and microbial profile of  fish intestines is 0. 1 %, which showed equal efficacy as the 1 % diet. </p...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{deformity}} is {{a significant}} problem in fish culture. The skeletal deformities in red <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> from yolk-sac to juvenile stages were examined through clearing and staining of the cartilage and bone using Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red S. The overall {{results showed that the}} pattern of incidence of deformities showed an increase from preflexion to juvenile stages. The rate of deformities based on ten elements of bone from preflexion to juvenile stages were as follows: vertebral (42. 6 %— 9. 0 %), dorsal proximal radials (4. 8 %— 25. 2 %), neural spine (0 %— 8. 4 %), haemal spine (0 %— 6. 8 %), hypural (1. 3 %— 5. 4 %), anal proximal radials (0 %— 5. 4 %), epural (1. 3 %— 4. 9 %), arypural (2. 0 %— 4. 5 %), lower jaw (1. 3 %— 2. 5 %), and upper jaw (0 %). Vertebral and dorsal proximal radials were recognized as the most susceptible parts to deformation. The main types of bone deformity were lordosis, scoliosis, fusion, shortening, branching, supernumerary elements, and saddleback syndrome. Development of saddleback syndrome was detected initially in preflexion stage, which was accompanied by deformity of the neural spines, dorsal proximal radials, and disposition of the distal radials and dorsal spines in later life stages. The skeletal deformity encountered during the larval rearing period could be caused by water surface tension...|$|E
40|$|According to Indonesian Standard Quality, {{the optimal}} seed {{production}} of orange <b>spotted</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus coioides) has been unsuccessful {{due to the}} problems occurred during larval rearing period. Efforts on mass rearing of larvae {{has been carried out}} in this study to optimize the natural feeding (rotifer). The purpose of this research was to obtain the information about an appropriate duration time for natural feeding (rotifer) to produce higher survival rate. The treatment for providing rotifers on larvae (days after hatching/DAH) i. e., (A) 20 days, (B) 25 days, (C) 30 days, and (D) 35 days. Rotifers were enriched with DHA Selco. Experiment used fiber tanks with 1 m 3 capacity with a completely randomized design (CRD) and three replicates. The larvae was reared to achieve the juvenile phase (D- 45). The best results from 1 m 3 tanks were then reared using concrete tanks of 6 m 3 and 10 m 3 capacities. The results showed that feeding of rotifers up to 25 DAH larvae on fiber tanks (1 m 3) produced the hughest survival rate (7. 63 %). Meanwhile, the mass reared in 6 m 3 and 10 m 3 concrete tanks produced survival rate of 4. 9 ± 3, 54 % and 8. 8 ± 2. 26 %, respectively.

Although initially cultured in Leibovitz's L- 15 medium, two of the cell lines, JSKG and PAS, exhibited optimal growth response in Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered {{with a combination of}} tris and sodium bicarbonate. These cell lines were initiated at a higher NaCl concentration of 0. 206 M but gradually adapted to the low NaCl concentration of 0. 116 M after several subcultures. Optimum growth temperature was 25 ℃ for JSKG and PAS cells, and 30 ℃ for KRE cells. The modal chromosome number is 83 for the JSKG cell line, 92 for the KRE cell line, and 96 for the PAS cell line. Results for efficiency of plating indicate that all three cell lines are composed of transformed cells. Cell lines JSKG and PAS are susceptible to nine fish viruses, including channel catfish virus (CCV) and chum salmon virus (CSV). The KRE cell line is susceptible to CCV and fish rhabdoviruses of the vesiculovirus group. None of the cells showed cytopathic effect for Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV) or Herpesvirus salmonis. Yields of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), hirame rhabdovirus (HRV), and CSV were relatively low in these cell lines...|$|E
