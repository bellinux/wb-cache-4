The IB Middle Years Program {{is intended to}} teach freshman and sophomore <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how core subjects are interrelated, how to master critical thinking processes, and to increase intercultural awareness. As juniors and seniors, students engage in the rigorous two-year IB Diploma curriculum that requires a comprehensive study of world topics, literature, languages, science, and math. City College's IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.|$|E

Those skills and practices are essential cornerstones of participation {{in a democratic society}} regardless of one’s chosen profession. The course work for the minor emphasizes {{the history and}} emergence of the non-profit sector as a national institution distinct from the private and public spheres. The practicum aspects of the minor couples with the traditional academic work encourages students to see the connection between the deeds of charitable service and the historic worth of citizens participation in the common public franchise.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} text editors, a Lisp {{program is}} written with many parentheses {{and it makes}} it difficult <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the tree structure of the program. Additionally, it is difficult for a <b>student</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the teacher's intention by watching her editing operation in programming classes. To solve these problems, we developed GTEdit (Gesture-based Tree Editor), a visual programming environment for teaching Lisp. In this system, the user can intuitively add, remove, open, and close any node in visualized tree structure using gestures. The gesture-based operation makes it easier for a <b>student</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the teacher's intention by watching her operation. We performed a user study to clarify the characteristics of GTEdit compared with a conventional text editor. The result of the user study indicates that our method can facilitate better understanding of programming compared with the conventional method...|$|R

The game has all the stages, which allow a dynamic and interactive approach <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> all processes involved in protein synthesis. The game consists of a tray with possibilities of losses or gains of amino acids. Each group of students receives a fictitious gene from a protein. Prior {{to the beginning of}} the game itself, they must do the transcription process, removing the introns at the end. Thereafter, they must already construct the anticodon (tRNA) corresponding to the mRNA codon, to facilitate the process of translation. The group, that firstly finalized the protein synthesis, wins the game. Therefore, it is a material easy to handle, with high academic potential and low cost...|$|R
