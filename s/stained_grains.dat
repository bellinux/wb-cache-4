Hematite <b>stained</b> <b>grains</b> exhibit similar repetitive down-core variations within the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 8 and 4 - 2 intervals, but little cyclic variability within the MIS 6 section. There is also no petrologic evidence, in terms of detrital carbonate-rich (Heinrich) layers, for surging of the Laurentide Ice Sheet through the Hudson Strait during MIS 6. Rather, very high background concentration of ice-rafted debris (IRD) indicates near continuous glacial meltwater input that likely increased thermohaline disruption sensitivity to relatively weak forcing events, such as expanded sea ice over deepwater formation sites. Altered (sub) tropical precipitation patterns and Antarctic warming during high orbital precession and low 65 ° N summer insolation appears related to high abundance of Icelandic glass shards and southward sea ice expansion.

Red and purple rocks owe their color to pervasive hematite grain coatings and crystals intergrown with clay; brown rocks owe their color to faint or localized iron-oxide grain coatings; and gray rocks to organic matter and authigenic iron sulfide. Green rocks owe their color to chlorite and illite and to the absence of hematite, organic matter and sulfides. Olive and yellow claystone colors are imparted by color mixing of green clay and black organic matter.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} growth of {{bacteria}} and fungi in the Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) toe webs and to correlate with the glycemic control and to frequent feet washing. Methods: Sixty one NIDDM patients (28 males, 33 females) {{with a mean age}} of 51. 7 years, and mean diabetes duration of 7 years (0. 5 - 30 years). Compared with 29 non-diabetic healthy subjects as a control group with mean age 45. 5 years, were ran-domly selected, evaluated and examined in the Endocrine Clinic- KHMC for skin peripheral pulse status. Skin scrapings were taken from both 4 th toe webs regardless of the presence or absence of any lesion. These were cultured on Sabouraud’s dextrose and blood agar media. <b>Grain</b> <b>stain</b> and lactophenol cotton blue stain were also obtained. Venous blood for blood sugar and HbA 1 c was also extracted. HbA 1 c was considered as a measure of control. Levels 9. 5 % poor control.

40|$|In plant cells, {{mitochondria}} and plastids contain {{their own}} genomes {{derived from the}} ancestral bacteria endosymbiont. Despite their limited genetic capacity, these multicopy organelle genomes account for a substantial fraction of total cellular DNA, raising {{the question of whether}} organelle DNA quantity is controlled spatially or temporally. In this study, we genetically dissected the organelle DNA decrease in pollen, a phenomenon that appears to be common in most angiosperm species. By <b>staining</b> mature pollen <b>grains</b> with fluorescent DNA dye, we screened Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants in which extrachromosomal DNAs had accumulated. Such a recessive mutant, termed defective in pollen organelle DNA degradation 1 (dpd 1), showing elevated levels of DNAs in both plastids and mitochondria, was isolated and characterized. DPD 1 encodes a protein belonging to the exonuclease family, whose homologs appear to be found in angiosperms. Indeed, DPD 1 has Mg²⁺-dependent exonuclease activity when expressed as a fusion protein and when assayed in vitro and is highly active in developing pollen. Consistent with the dpd phenotype, DPD 1 is dual-targeted to plastids and mitochondria. Therefore, we provide evidence of active organelle DNA degradation in the angiosperm male gametophyte, primarily independent of maternal inheritance; the biological function of organellar DNA degradation in pollen is currently unclear. 7604...|$|R
40|$|Pollen {{hydration}} {{is usually}} tightly regulated and occurs in vivo only when desiccated pollen grains acquire {{water from the}} female, thus enabling pollen tube growth. Pollen tubes are easily visualized by staining with decolorized aniline blue, a stain specific for callose. We identified a mutant, raring-to-go, in which pollen <b>grains</b> <b>stained</b> for callose before anther dehiscence. When raring-to-go plants are transferred to high humidity, pollen tubes dramatically elongate within the anther. As early as the bicellular stage, affected pollen grains in raring-to-go plants acquire or retain water within the anther, and precociously germinate. Thus, the requirement for contact with the female is circumvented. We used pollen tetrad analysis to show that raring-to-go is a gametophytic mutation, to our knowledge the first gametophytic mutation in Arabidopsis that affects early events in the pollination pathway. To aid in identifying raring-to-go alleles, we devised a new technique for screening pollen in bulk with decolorized aniline blue. We screened a new M 1 mutagenized population and identified several additional mutants with a raring-to-go-like phenotype, demonstrating the usefulness of this technique. Further, we isolated other mutants (gift-wrapped pollen, polka dot pollen, and emotionally fragile pollen) with unexpected patterns of callose staining. We suggest that raring-to-go and these other mutants may help dissect components of the pathway that regulates pollen hydration and pollen tube growth...|$|R
40|$|It was {{generally}} accepted {{for many years}} that diurnal birds experience color vision, but that they are blind to violet and blue. Hess (1912), sprinkled grain on a spectrum projected on a white floor and found that birds ate the grain from the red {{end of the spectrum}} up to the junction of the green and blue, but would not eat grain in the blue or violet. Honigman (1921), and others did not confirm Hess; they found chickens did eat <b>grain</b> <b>stained</b> blue and violet. Watson (1915) and Lashey (1916) learned that the chicken's spectral limits are 700 to 715 niju {{at one end of the}} spectrum and 395 to 405 m̂u at the other. Walls (1942) believed that except for slightly more sensitivity to red, the chicken's spectral limits are similar to those of man, but the perception of blue and violet did not appear to be well established. Welch (1946) found that House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and blackbirds, Icteridae, would not eat green seeds given as poison bait to control rodents. Dennis (1951) found [when working with nuthatches that green and blue seeds were the last eaten. Kalmbach and Welch (1946), during a study of the effects of colored rodent bait as a means of safeguarding birds, set up feeding stations of green, yellow, and uncolored grain. No dead birds were found when green alone was used, only two with yellow, and 66 at the uncolored grain. The birds poisoned were 39 Brewer'...|$|R
40|$|This light {{microscopic}} autoradiographic {{study was}} performed to test the hypotheses that (a) the density of beta adrenergic receptors (BAR) may differ in various components {{of the heart and}} (b) BAR in certain components of the heart may exhibit a selective response to pharmacologic and pathological stimuli. Blocks of canine left ventricle were frozen and tissue sections cut and incubated in (-) [3 H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) to label the BAR. For total and nonspecific binding, serial sections were incubated with and without 10 (- 5) M (+/-) propranolol. Scintillation spectrometry of sections demonstrated rapid binding, saturability, stereospecificity, a dissociation constant (KD) of 3. 2 +/- 0. 5 nM (SD) (n = 3), and a maximal binding of 31. 3 +/- 3. 1 fmol/mg of tissue protein. Isoproterenol was 12. 5 times more effective than norepinephrine in displacing DHA. Sections incubated with 10 (- 5) - 10 (- 8) M metoprolol, a beta one selective antagonist, demonstrated a KD of 0. 7 X 10 (- 6) M. For autoradiography, emulsion-coated coverslips were attached to the slides. After exposure, the slides were developed and <b>stained,</b> and <b>grain</b> density quantified. Specific BAR binding (n = 4 dogs) was 1, 047 +/- 131 (SEM) grains/ 10 (- 2) mm 2 for myocardial arterioles, 219 +/- 30 for myocardial arteries, 31 +/- 12 for the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and 231 +/- 34 for cardiac myocytes. Specific binding in the presence of 10 (- 5) M metoprolol was reduced approximately 75 % for both arterioles and myocytes. However, at 10 (- 6) M metoprolol, the percent reduction in specific DHA binding was greater for myocytes (50 %) than for arterioles (0 %), and at 10 (- 7) M metoprolol, the percent reduction in specific DHA binding was 17 % for myocytes with no reduction over arterioles. After 1 h of LAD occlusion, a selective increase (18 %) in BAR density occurred over cardiac myocytes, but not over blood vessels in the ischemic myocardium. Thus, (a) specific BAR binding was five times greater in arterioles than in small arteries and myocardium and 34 times greater than in the proximal LAD; (b) BAR of myocytes were more sensitive than those of arterioles to displacement by the beta one selective antagonist, metoprolol; and (c) a selective increase in BAR occurs in cardiac myocytes but not in blood vessels after 1 h of ischemia in this experimental model...|$|R
