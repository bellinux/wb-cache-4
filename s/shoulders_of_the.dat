5|$|The team's {{original}} alternate logo was {{the foot}} of a Sasquatch/Bigfoot and was seen on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Avalanche's home and away jerseys. The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, {{prior to the start of}} the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re-colored to match the team's color scheme. The logo will be featured on a patch located on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's uniforms, along with a 20th anniversary logo, for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|After Pete George's {{retirement}} in 1987, the upkeep of the Wreck fell directly upon the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wreck Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended {{their relationship with}} Reck Club. Since then, the Wreck has been student maintained {{with the assistance of}} local Atlanta garages. The Wreck has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors the arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E

25|$|The body rotates {{about its}} long axis with every arm stroke so that <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{recovering}} arm {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pushing/pulling arm. This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the need to turn the head to breathe. As one <b>shoulder</b> is out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the arm at end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> push to leave the water.|$|R
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that {{the best course of}} action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; {{he did not want to}} give up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E

25|$|Around 50 AD, a rod tang was introduced, and {{the hilt}} {{was no longer}} riveted through the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blade.

25|$|A pugio was {{a dagger}} used by Roman soldiers. It was {{probably}} a sidearm. Like other items of legionary equipment, the dagger underwent some changes during the 1st century. Generally, it had a large, leaf-shaped blade 18 to 28cm long and 5cm or more in width. A raised midrib {{ran the length of}} each side, either simply standing out from the face or defined by grooves on either side. It was changed by making the blade a little thinner, about 3 mm, and the handle was also made out of metal. The tang was wide and flat initially, and the grip was riveted through it, as well as through the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blade.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 season brought great {{expectation}} with Donegal as reigning All-Ireland champions. However, {{they suffered}} relegation from Division 1 of the National Football League {{early in the}} year.

Monaghan were unfancied coming into the game with most of the pressure on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tir Conaill men. Despite this Monaghan defied the odds and emerged as 0-13 to 0-07 winners. After defeating Laois in the fourth round of the qualifiers Donegal faced a Mayo team looking for revenge in the All-Ireland quarter-final.
