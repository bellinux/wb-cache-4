5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds. Some portfolio managers have expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 as an indication of its potential success.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> free market consensus even from {{some on the}} economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|Beverly Chappell founded The Dougy Center in 1982 {{in tribute}} to Dougy Turno, who died of a brain tumor at age thirteen. In August 1981, Dougy {{wrote a letter to}} {{psychiatrist}} and author Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in near-death studies, on the subject of his own death. This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence on the organization, The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross model (a series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> model.|$|E
40|$|This chapter explores four {{kinds of}} <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> {{autonomy}} {{in general and}} its applicability to psychiatric ethics in particular. It is argued that although there are valuable lessons to be learnt from each of these skeptical challenges, their overall contribution is best {{understood in terms of}} friendly correctives to an autonomy-centered normative and conceptual framework instead of viable alternatives to it. The first four sections each provide a logical reconstruction of a distinct skeptical line of reasoning about autonomy and expand on its implications for psychiatric ethics: <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> personal autonomy; <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> autonomy as an agency concept; vulnerability-grounded <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> autonomy; and paternalism-friendly <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> autonomy. <b>The</b> fifth section identifies and explores the underlying presuppositions that motivate the previously discussed forms of <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> autonomy, and <b>the</b> sixth reflects on the significance of psychiatric ethics for rebutting <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> autonomy and developing a new, more promising positive theory...|$|R

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles. She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent. Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron. In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor {{to the board of}} the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992. As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history, the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and AIDS hospices. Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective. She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, {{a report}} from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found the US {{stimulus}} to have boosted growth by as much as 4.5%. House of Representatives Minority Leader John Boehner expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> report's accuracy.|$|E
50|$|On January 27, 2015, Gauweiler {{voted against}} the Merkel government’s {{proposal}} for a four-month extension of Greece's bailout; in doing so, he joined {{a record number of}} 29 dissenters from the CDU/CSU parliamentary group who expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> whether <b>the</b> Greek government under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras could be trusted to deliver on its reform pledges.|$|R
50|$|Most anarchists {{argue that}} certain {{capitalist}} transactions are not voluntary, and that maintaining the class {{structure of a}} capitalist society requires coercion, which violates anarchist principles. David Graeber noted his <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> anarcho-capitalism along <b>the</b> same lines.|$|R
50|$|Typically, a {{transcendental}} argument {{starts from}} some accepted aspect of experience, and then deduces {{what must be}} true for that type of experience to be possible. Transcendental arguments are often used as arguments against <b>skepticism,</b> usually <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reality of the external world or other minds.|$|R
25|$|His <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{validity}} of natural religion cuts equally against deism and deism's opponents, {{who were also}} deeply involved in natural theology. But his famous Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion were not published until 1779, by which time deism had almost vanished in England.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a high level of <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{universal}} and predictable “emotional pathway” that leads from distress to “recovery” with an appreciation that grief is a more complex process of adapting to loss than stage and phase models have previously suggested.|$|E
25|$|Coleman {{was cleared}} of {{wrongdoing}} regarding allegations {{of corruption in}} receiving gifts of $100,000 from Kazeminy. Doug Grow, a MinnPost columnist, expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> findings. Coleman responded with a campaign ad in which he denied the allegations and blamed them on his opponent in the 2008 senate race, Democrat Al Franken.|$|E
25|$|Thiel's {{announcement}} of the Thiel Fellowship met with a diverse array of responses. Some, such as Jacob Weisberg, criticized Thiel's proposal for its utopianism and attack {{on the importance of}} education. Others, such as Vivek Wadhwa, expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> whether <b>the</b> success or failure of the Thiel Fellowship would carry any broader lessons regarding the value of higher education or the wisdom of dropping out.|$|R
40|$|This Spring 2003 Learning Matters {{report from}} the Education Oversight Committee {{identifies}} a general feeling among teachers that improvements are being made and will continue. Most teachers feel the paperwork required under the new system has taken away from teaching and planning time. In previous research, teachers and other groups expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> achieving <b>the</b> state’s education goals. Although teachers have an impression that schools have improved, they remain skeptical of these goals...|$|R

25|$|Tolliver {{argues that}} drama both {{reflects}} and foreshadows social change. It {{is likely that}} there was already much <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gods in Plautus' era. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but reflected ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus' plays would have been banned, had they been too risqué.|$|E
25|$|<b>Skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> axiom {{of choice}} was {{reinforced}} by recently discovered paradoxes in naive set theory. Cesare Burali-Forti (1897) {{was the first to}} state a paradox: the Burali-Forti paradox shows that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot form a set. Very soon thereafter, Bertrand Russell discovered Russell's paradox in 1901, and Jules Richard (1905) discovered Richard's paradox.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, he {{constructed}} a narrative from Creation to his present, again similar to Herodotus or the Hebrew Bible. Within this construction, the sacred myths blended with history. Whether he shared Hellenistic <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{existence of the}} gods and their tales is unknown, though it is likely he believed them more than the satirist Ovid, for example. The naturalistic attitude found in Syncellus' transmission is probably more representative of the later Greek authors who transmitted the work than of Berossus himself.|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{visualization}} is very useful, by enabling people to understand that masses of data and information otherwise hidden inside of computers.

5000|$|Some Tea Party Caucus {{and other}} Republicans, however, (including, {{but not limited}} to, Senators Jim DeMint, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee, and Representatives Michele Bachmann, Ron Paul, and Allen West) {{expressed}} <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> raising <b>the</b> debt ceiling (with some suggesting the consequences of default are exaggerated), arguing that the debt ceiling should not be raised, and [...] "instead the federal debt should be 'capped' at the current limit," [...] "although that would oblige the government to cut spending by almost half overnight." ...|$|R
25|$|If {{we accept}} pains as special qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view {{of the self and}} consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.|$|E
25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E
25|$|There has {{traditionally}} been <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> psychological treatment of personality disorders, but several specific types of psychotherapy for BPD have developed in recent years. There is growing evidence {{for the role of}} psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD, with indications that both comprehensive and non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions may have a beneficial effect. Supportive therapy alone may enhance self-esteem and mobilize the existing strengths of individuals with BPD. Specific psychotherapies may involve sessions over several months or, as is particularly common for personality disorders, several years. Psychotherapy can often be conducted either with individuals or with groups. Group therapy can aid the learning and practice of interpersonal skills and self-awareness by individuals with BPD, though drop-out rates may be problematic.|$|E
40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{autonomy}} that is being built into today’s control systems, coupled with their vulnerability to attack at the computer network level, mandates a recasting of the man-machine social contract.

50|$|Some {{historian}}s, {{for example}} Dr. Abraham Fuchs and Prof. David Kranzler, accept Weissmandl's {{opinion that the}} ransom and bribes were successful. Israeli historian Prof. Yehuda Bauer wrote in 1981 book that he thought the bribes influenced Germany's position regarding deportation, but in a 1996 book he expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> whether <b>the</b> bribes were {{a key factor in}} stopping the deportations. However, later in a 2002 book Bauer writes that it was not the bribing of Wisliceny that stopped the deportations, but the bribing of the Slovak officials by the Working Group that stopped it.|$|R
25|$|After {{the initial}} report of {{apparent}} superluminal velocities of neutrinos, most physicists {{in the field}} were quietly skeptical of the results, but prepared to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Experimental experts {{were aware of the}} complexity and difficulty of the measurement, so an extra unrecognized measurement error was still a real possibility, despite the care taken by the OPERA team. However, because of the widespread interest, several well-known experts did make public comments. Nobel laureates Steven Weinberg, George Smoot III, and Carlo Rubbia, and other physicists not affiliated with the experiment, including Michio Kaku, expressed <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the experiment on the basis that the results challenged a long-held theory consistent with the results of many other tests of special relativity. Nevertheless, Ereditato, the OPERA spokesperson, stated that no one had an explanation that invalidated the experiment's results.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it seems}} that the results of the raid were a lot more {{effective}} than the press had led people to believe. All of the bombs were dropped into the correct target box, except for one string of bombs which had missed the area completely because of a radar failure. After about a week, US Army teams began to enter the area and reported almost total destruction of all life in the area. Additional missions were cancelled and did not resume until July. There was initially some <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> usefulness of a high-altitude radar bomb drop against guerrilla forces. Nevertheless, within a few months there was universal acceptance {{of the power of the}} B-52 raids as a new type of artillery. By November 1965, the B-52s were able to support the 1st Air Cavalry Division in mopping up operations near Pleiku.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Eagle At Work {{was highly}} {{anticipated}} by many labor scholars, labor attorneys and {{activists in the}} labor movement. After its publication, the work was widely reviewed in the scholarly and labor press, including Labor Studies Journal, the Journal of Industrial Relations, WorkingUSA, Labor History, Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, LRA Online, Labor Research Association, British Journal of Industrial Relations, Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, Hawaii Laborer, ILCA Online, Portside, The Progressive Populist, Workday Minnesota, Religious Socialism, All Aboard, NLRB, Labour/Le Travail, Noteworthy Books in Industrial Relations and Labor Economics, Princeton University, Benson's Union Democracy Blog, University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business and Employment Law, and the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. Some of the reviews expressed greater or lesser degrees of <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of Morris' thesis being adopted but praised the work highly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skepticism</b> <b>about</b> HIV being <b>the</b> {{cause of}} AIDS began almost {{immediately}} after the discovery of HIV was announced. One of the earliest prominent skeptics was the journalist John Lauritsen, who argued in his writings for the New York Native that AIDS was caused by amyl nitrite poppers, {{and that the government}} had conspired to hide the truth. Lauritsen's The AIDS War was published in 1993.|$|R

5000|$|One pattern, {{stretching}} back {{well before}} consolidation and lasting into the 1960s, is the conflict between, on one side, Tammany Hall, the Democratic political organization largely built on political patronage with a consequent deep <b>skepticism</b> <b>about</b> Civil Service, <b>the</b> merit system of assigning government jobs, and competitive bidding for city contracts, {{and on the}} other hand, its various opponents, including Republicans, businessmen opposed to taxation or extorted bribes, middle-class reformers and labor union activists.|$|R
