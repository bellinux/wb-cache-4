25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not fool-proof, however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it about the room, {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when <b>someone</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky {{as it had been}} fortunate under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning the house down, and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E
500|$|In 1899 Pearson chose Hesketh-Prichard {{to explore}} and report on the {{relatively}} unknown republic of Haiti, wanting something dramatic with which to launch his forthcoming Daily Express. His mother accompanied him as far as Jamaica; in later years she would often travel with him to remote destinations {{in a time when}} it was uncommon for a woman of her age to do so. Hesketh-Prichard travelled extensively into the uncharted interior of Haiti, narrowly avoiding death on one occasion when <b>someone</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> poison him. No white man was believed to have crossed the island since 1803, and his trip provided the first written description of some of the secret practices of [...] "vaudoux" [...] (voodoo). He later wrote a vivid account of his travels in the popular book Where Black Rules White: A Journey Across and About Hayti.|$|E
500|$|On 11 November 1996, Oasis {{relocated}} {{to the rural}} Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey. Though the band reconvened with more energy, the early recordings were compromised by the drug intake of all involved. Morris recalled that [...] "in the first week, <b>someone</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> score an ounce of weed, but instead got an ounce of cocaine. Which kind of summed it up." [...] Noel was not present during any of Liam's vocal track recordings, typifying the high drama surrounding the sessions. Morris thought that the new material was weak, but when he voiced his opinion to Noel he was cut down: [...] " [...] I just carried on shovelling drugs up my nose." [...] Morris expressed regret at being unable to simply transfer the Mustique demos and overdub drums, vocals, and rhythm guitar, as the 8-track mixer he had employed required him to bounce tracks for overdubs, leaving him unable to remove the drum machine from the recordings.|$|E

2500|$|Then {{ignoring}} {{the objections of}} the county commissioners, the employers called a town meeting {{directly across the street}} from the WFM Union Hall in Victor. The city marshal of Victor deputized about a hundred deputies to stop the meeting, but Victor Mayor French, an ally of the mine owners, fired the marshal. An angry crowd of several thousand gathered, and anti-union speeches were made by members of the CCMOA. C.C. Hamlin, secretary of the Mine Owners' Association, urged the people to take the law into their own hands. A miner carrying a rifle challenged Hamlin, and a single shot was fired as <b>someone</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> disarm the miner. Then a number of people began shooting into the crowd. Five men were seriously wounded, two of them fatally. All those wounded were nonunion men.p.123 ...|$|E
