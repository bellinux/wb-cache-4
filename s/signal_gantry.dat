25|$|In 2003–2004 {{the former}} NYW {{elevated}} structure was demolished south of Lebanon Street. The former right-of-way was redeveloped with new buildings, and parking lots. Between 2006 and 2008, the earthen embankment from East 177th Street south to East 172nd Street at the Amtrak ROW was totally excavated {{and all that}} fill was removed to provide flat ground for redevelopment. The section between East 177th Street and East 174th Street was redeveloped into the Bronx Greenway–Starlight Park. A catenary <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> from the NYW was preserved and is located inside the park.|$|E
500|$|In 1896 the LSWR {{formally}} {{presented the}} LNC {{with a proposal}} to provide the LNC with a new station {{in return for the}} existing station. The LNC agreed to the proposals, but with a number of conditions attached. The LSWR was to allow the LNC control of the design of the new station, lease the new station to the LNC for a token rent in perpetuity, provide new rolling stock, remove any limit on the number of passengers using the Necropolis service, and provide the free carriage of machinery and equipment {{to be used in the}} cemetery. The LNC had an extremely strong negotiating position as their existing site was crucial to any expansion of Waterloo station, and in addition they had the legal right to demand the removal of the stanchion supporting Waterloo's <b>signal</b> <b>gantry.</b> Although the LSWR was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands, they had no choice but to comply. In May 1899 the companies signed an agreement, in which the LSWR gave in to every LNC demand. In addition the LSWR paid £12,000 compensation (about £ in terms of [...] consumer spending power) for the inconvenience of relocating the LNC station and offices, and agreed that mourners returning from the cemetery could travel on any LSWR train to Waterloo, Vauxhall or Clapham Junction.|$|E

Oban Station S.B. closed on 5 December 1982, when a 'no signalman' system of {{electric}} token working was introduced on the section from [...] signal box. The last remaining semaphore signals were removed at that time, including the <b>signal</b> <b>gantry.</b>|$|E

50|$|Knapford Station Yard (introduced in The Adventure Begins), {{is a large}} {{shunting}} {{area was}} added adjacent to the station. The shunting yard consists of sidings, a couple of sheds and a coal hopper. The station also got <b>signal</b> <b>gantries</b> and crossovers.|$|R
50|$|The {{enlarged}} {{layout of}} 1903 was controlled from two large wooden signal boxes, the East box having 42 levers, and the West box 56. The latter controlled the branch line junction and a <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> located nearby spanned three tracks. The <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> was replaced on 22 January 1953. Both signal boxes closed on 8 January 1967 and all signals were removed.|$|E
50|$|Two weeks later, the <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> was replaced, but {{complete}} {{services were}} not restored until 23 February 1945.|$|E
50|$|On 23 December 1999, the {{footbridge}} and <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> at {{the north}} end of the station were demolished when it was struck by a container.|$|E
50|$|During {{this time}} he re-made most {{of the line and}} carried out {{extensive}} alterations to the Belfast Terminus at Queen's Quay including new <b>signal</b> <b>gantries.</b> Towards the end of his time on the BCDR, Wise prepared drawings, specifications and estimates for the Quoile Viaduct to carry the railway over the River Quoile.|$|R
5000|$|Rugby {{once had}} the largest {{concentration}} of mechanical signalling {{in the world and}} was home {{to one of the most}} impressive <b>signal</b> <b>gantries</b> in Britain. Situated to the south of the station and erected in 1895, it spanned three tracks and carried forty-four semaphore arms. Every arm was duplicated due to sighting difficulties that resulted from the Great Central Railway's 'Birdcage' bridge crossing the WCML behind the gantry's location. The gantry acquired the nickname of [...] "the Rugby Bedstead" [...] on account of its appearance.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Bahnbetriebswerke, {{that are responsible for}} routine, everyday tasks, Ausbesserungswerke specialise in major repairs, general inspections and the refurbishment of exchangeable components. In addition they handle the conversion and modernisation of vehicles, as well as the construction of new vehicles in some cases. On top of the maintenance of vehicles, most Ausbesserungswerke also carry out the manufacture of turnouts, the construction of <b>signal</b> <b>gantries,</b> platform roofing and similar steel structures. Depending on the particular specialisation of an individual Ausbesserungswerk it may also be described as a Reisezugwagenwerk (coach works), Güterwagenwerk (goods wagon works) or Weichenwerk (turnout works).|$|R
50|$|In 1901, {{an island}} {{platform}} was built, this has since closed but remains in situ. In 1943, the line through Cootamundra was duplicated {{with the largest}} overhead <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> in the Southern Hemisphere was erected. It has since been relocated and now stands preserved in the station surrounds.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway resignalled the Rugby {{area with}} colour light signals, {{although}} the mechanical signal boxes were retained. The famous <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> became redundant, following {{which it was}} divided up into smaller pieces to form a number of smaller structures for re-use elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|Oban Goods Junction S.B. {{closed on}} 4 May 1969. Oban Station S.B. closed on 5 December 1982, when a 'no signalman' system of {{electric}} token working was introduced on the section from [...] signal box. The last remaining semaphore signals were removed at that time, including the <b>signal</b> <b>gantry.</b>|$|E
50|$|The wooden station {{building}} {{was of a}} standard design, and had a long, sealed platform. A veranda covered the platform {{in front of the}} building, and extended a short distance to either side of the building. Two semaphore <b>signal</b> <b>gantries</b> rose up through the veranda, and several loops ran through the station yard. Other facilities were provided at the station at various times, including a social hall (later a second such facility was added, west of and near to the intersection of Station Street and McLean Street), a post and telegraph office, a crossing keeper for the McLean Street level crossing, a goods shed, and a locomotive depot. There were dock sidings {{at both ends of the}} platform; the west (Palmerston North) end dock was renewed in 1921.|$|R
50|$|From 1907 until 2010, {{the station}} {{approaches}} were controlled from a 120-lever signal box named Falsgrave (at the outer {{end of platform}} 1 {{and close to the}} former excursion station at Londesborough Road). In its final years, Falsgrave box controlled a mixture of colour-light and semaphore <b>signals,</b> including a <b>gantry</b> carrying 11 semaphores. The <b>signal</b> box and <b>gantry</b> were dismantled and removed in October 2010. The new signalling is a relay-based interlocking with two- and three-aspect LED signals controlled from an extension to the existing panel at nearby Seamer. Simplification of the track layout and major renewals took place at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Ditton Junction is near Widnes on the Liverpool spur of {{the former}} London and North Western Railway. This complex {{junction}} had eight running lines and associated <b>signal</b> <b>gantries.</b> On 17 September 1912 the 17:30 Chester to Liverpool express was signalled to cross from the fast to the slow line, but the driver, Robert Hughes, age 41, from Llangwstenin, Conwy, who had little experience of the junction and had never been switched here before, misread the signals and {{thought he had a}} clear run through. The crossover had a speed limit of 15 mph but the train hit it at 60 mph. The locomotive, a 2-4-0 of the Precedent class turned on its side and travelled some distance, striking the pier of an overbridge (partially demolishing it) and breaking in two. The six carriages following ploughed over the engine and were all destroyed - forming a heap of wreckage between the station platforms. Punctured gaslighting cylinders ignited, turning the scene into an inferno. The driver, fireman and 13 passengers were killed.|$|R
5000|$|The SBB-CFF-FFS {{locomotive}} shed and the signal boxes have been operated since 2003 by the Verein Historische Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn, and since 2005 {{also by the}} Stiftung Historisches Bahnhof-Ensemble Romanshorn, as Locorama, a railway world of experience. [...] The historic <b>signal</b> <b>gantry,</b> the coaling stage and the water crane {{are also part of}} Locorama.|$|E
50|$|Also {{associated}} with signalling and safeworking in the Toowoomba yard is the A signal cabin, {{taken out of}} use mid-1993. This cabin possibly dates from the 1920s. The cabin interior is still intact, and includes signal levers, safeworking instruments and Toowoomba yard diagram. Associated with this structure are the now dismantled semaphore signals from the <b>signal</b> <b>gantry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> {{demolished}} in {{the collision}} carried shunting discs and platform indicators {{in addition to}} main aspect signals. In an emergency measure hand signallers were introduced to control main line trains using platforms 6 to 17, as well as movements {{to and from the}} locomotive yard. Suburban services were terminated and turned round at [...]|$|E
50|$|In some {{situations}} or places, {{such as in}} tunnels, where there is insufficient room for a post or <b>gantry,</b> <b>signals</b> may be mounted at ground level. Such signals may be physically smaller (termed dwarf signals). Rapid transit systems commonly use nothing but dwarf signals due to the restricted space. In many systems, dwarf signals are only used to display 'restrictive' aspects such as low speed or shunt aspects, and do not normally indicate 'running' aspects.|$|R
50|$|Around 1880 {{the station}} {{building}} {{was built to}} a design of the architect Hans Kleinschmidt. A relay interlocking in a <b>gantry</b> <b>signal</b> box spanning two tracks was put into operation in 1937. The Bingen Stadt signal box (Bnb) and the three signal boxes of Bingerbrück Ostturm (Bot), Bingerbrück Kreuzbach (Bkb) and Bingerbrück Westturm (Bwt) in the nearby Bingen Hbf were decommissioned on 3 February 1996 and replaced by the central interlocking Bf on the railway bridge at Bingen Hbf. Today, the Bingen Stadt Bnb signal box is protected as a monument.|$|R
50|$|The Bingerbrück Kreuzbach (Bkb) {{signal box}} is located {{to the north}} of Bingen Hbf near the former {{southern}} hump of the marshalling yard. It is a <b>gantry</b> <b>signal</b> box, which increased the available room for operations by extending over the railway facilities. This signal box was designed by the architect Hans Kleinschmidt as a steel skeleton and was designed and completed in 1936. The western end of the building is built of broken stone. The actual signal tower is 15 metres long and in addition it has operating rooms and a pedestrian bridge. The interlocking system, which it housed, was a 10-metre-long electro-mechanical interlocking system of class E 43 made by the Siemens company. At its peak, the signal box was staffed by five people who were particularly responsible for the marshalling and operation of trains at the freight yard. In 1996, after 60 years of operations, the signal box, together with the other signal boxes, was removed from service and replaced by the central interlocking Bf on the Nahe bridge. The <b>gantry</b> <b>signal</b> box was listed as a historic landmark on 8 November 2005. In addition, it {{is now one of the}} cultural monuments listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. After an inspection of the bridge carried out in 2006 found structural defects, access to the bridge was blocked. In April 2009, Bingen town council requested that the federal and state governments allocate funds for the preservation of the World Heritage Site towards the restoration of the signal box.|$|R
50|$|The {{dual system}} did cause some problems. Failure to retract the shoes when {{entering}} France caused severe damage to trackside equipment, leading to SNCF installing {{a pair of}} concrete blocks at the Calais end of both tunnels to break off the third rail shoes {{if they had not}} been retracted. An accident occurred in the UK when a Eurostar driver failed to retract the pantograph before entering the third rail system, damaging a <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> and the pantograph.|$|E
50|$|In 2003-2004 {{the former}} NYW&B {{elevated}} structure was demolished south of Lebanon Street. The former right-of-way was redeveloped with new buildings, and parking lots. Between 2006 and 2008, the earthen embankment from East 177th Street south to East 172nd Street at the Amtrak ROW was totally excavated {{and all that}} fill was removed to provide flat ground for redevelopment. The section between East 177th Street and East 174th Street was redeveloped into the Bronx Greenway-Starlight Park. A catenary <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> from the NYW&B was preserved and is located inside the park.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{accident report}} {{stated that the}} front carriage of the London Bridge train telescoped onto the second coach, forcing both vehicles {{into the air and}} onto their sides. The leading coach struck a heavy <b>signal</b> <b>gantry,</b> causing it to collapse, landing away from the coaches. The underframe of the third coach was slightly bent. The steam locomotive derailed and the front end and smokebox were damaged but the leading coach was buffer locked with the tender, although some vans towards the rear of the sleeper train did suffer some damage by derailing and bent buffers.|$|E
25|$|Paddington {{approaches}} {{had been}} resignalled by British Rail {{in the early}} 1990s to allow bidirectional working. The number of signals and limited trackside space meant that most <b>signals</b> were in <b>gantries</b> over the tracks; the curvature of the lines meant {{that it was not}} always obvious which signal was for which track. Reflective line identification signs had therefore been added but, the inquiry report noted, they were closer to the signal to the right hand side than to the signal for the line to which they related. However, misreading of which signal related to which track cannot have caused the fatal crash, because at the time all the other <b>gantry</b> 8 <b>signals</b> were also showing red.|$|R
5|$|The station's track layout was rearranged in 1883 with {{platform}} extensions, a fifth {{platform for}} use by the Blackwall services and a new <b>gantry</b> <b>signal</b> box (which lasted until the 1935 re-modelling). The GER used the station as an alternative to Liverpool Street station during the late-19th and early-20th centuries for former ECR routes. The GER took over operation of the NLR shuttle from Bow in 1869, which it operated until April 1892 when the second Bow Road railway station opened along with a passenger foot connection to the NLR station. Subsequent services into Fenchurch Street were operated by the GER and the LTSR, and three years later the viaduct from Stepney to Fenchurch Street was widened to accommodate a fourth track.|$|R
50|$|Paddington {{approaches}} {{had been}} resignalled by British Rail {{in the early}} 1990s to allow bidirectional working. The number of signals and limited trackside space meant that most <b>signals</b> were in <b>gantries</b> over the tracks; the curvature of the lines meant {{that it was not}} always obvious which signal was for which track.

However, misreading of which signal related to which track cannot have caused the fatal crash, because at the time all the other <b>gantry</b> 8 <b>signals</b> were also showing red.The spacing between signals and points was designed to allow fast through running by freight trains and meant that gantry 8 was less than 100 m to the west of a road bridge; this compromised the distance from which the signal could be seen by drivers of trains leaving Paddington. To allow the higher ('proceed') aspects to be seen sooner, the standard signals (with the four aspects arranged vertically) were replaced with non-standard 'reverse L' signals, with the red aspect {{to the left of the}} lower yellow. The Paddington resignalling scheme had been implemented ahead of formal HMRI approval; this had still not been received at the time of the crash.|$|R
50|$|The pocket track, {{which would}} be long enough to fit a full 12-car train. The project is {{expected}} to cost $19.6 million. Construction is on schedule to begin in April 2014 and should be completed by March 2016. As of September 2015, a <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> frame was erected at the East end of the now newly completed platform, and the tracks and ties for the pocket track along with switches had been installed in the ballast. It might be completed ahead of schedule {{if there are no}} delays. All that is left is to electrify, straighten, smooth, and install signals and wire them to either Babylon Tower.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the signals and points (switches) at the station were still {{controlled}} by signal boxes equipped with mechanical lever frames made by the Braunschweig firm of Jüdel in 1912. [...] The southern station throat was spanned by the last <b>signal</b> <b>gantry</b> in Switzerland. Also, the public facilities were outdated, and access to tracks 5 and 6 was via a level crossing, which was secured by the legendary [...] "Chetteli", i.e. chains and a roller shutter. To enable interchange with the ferries, trains to and from Zürich had to be moved during their layovers, make the pathway to the ferry terminal accessible.|$|E
50|$|He {{was killed}} in the King's Cross railway {{accident}} on Sunday 4 February 1945, having boarded the 6pm express to Leeds. Shortly after leaving the station and entering Gasworks Tunnel, the locomotive's wheels started slipping on a newly replaced section of rail laid on the rising gradient. However, in the darkness, the driver failed to realise that the train was no longer moving forward and had started to roll back at a speed of some 6 or 7 mph. The signalman noticed this and attempted to avert a collision with another train in the station by switching the points to an empty platform, but was too late. The rear carriage was derailed, rolled onto its side and was crushed against the steel support of the main <b>signal</b> <b>gantry.</b> The first-class compartment where Kimber had been sitting was demolished and one other passenger was killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} disaster was identified as the Turbo train passing signal SN109 (located on an overhead gantry—gantry 8—with four other signals serving other tracks) at which {{it should have been}} held. It was established that the signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the Thames Turbo driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, {{it was not possible to}} establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective, whilst the signalling in the Paddington area was known to have caused problems – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects. Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other <b>signal</b> on the <b>gantry)</b> was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect. Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol HST drivers were re-routed as not to pass this signal.|$|R
5000|$|The South Side Railroad of Long Island in the 1860s built {{what was}} to become the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The Babylon Branch as a {{separate}} operational entity began as the electrification of the Montauk Branch between Valley Stream and Babylon on May 20, 1925. Eventually, this would also include the former [...] "Springfield Branch" [...] which the Montauk Branch was relocated to northeast of Springfield Junction. The tracks were elevated from ground-level between 1950 and 1980. Elevation of the line sparked grass-roots efforts to preserve the previous versions of Wantagh and Lindendurst Stations, the former of which resulted {{in the creation of the}} Wantagh Railroad Museum. The last station to be elevated on the branch was Massapequa Park on December 13, 1980.Since the 1990s, many station houses along the branch have been rebuilt, including the entire platforms at Seaford from July 2008 to July 2009, and Massapequa from late 2013 to mid 2015. Additionally, from July 2007 to April 10, 2011 the <b>signals,</b> switches, and <b>gantries</b> were replaced between the Wantagh Interlocking and Amityville Station, with color light signals replacing the old PRR-style position-light signals installed during the elevation of that section in 1973, and work is underway is well into the closing stages of a pocket track East of the Massapequa station that will run in between the two running tracks, this will be completed by Spring 2016. It was announced that immediately after Massapequa's platform was rebuilt that starting in August or September 2016 that Wantagh's platform would be demolished and rebuilt with new signage, escalators, stairwells, and for the first time an elevator will be installed to meet with ADA standards, all of that will replace the original structure which has been in use since the elevated station opened in 1968, the project will be completed by mid 2017 and has already started. Plans for the future include the modernization of Babylon Interlocking, viaduct track replacement at certain stations, replacement of platforms, escalators, and elevators at Babylon. There is also the possibility of Massapequa Park, Amityville, Copiague, and Lindenhurst receiving elevators to make them ADA accessible.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the points}} behind the train (no. 145) {{had been set}} for the next departure, {{which was to be}} from Platform 10. The coaches for this service, the 19:00 Aberdonian to , were already in the platform. The {{signalman}} became aware of the 18:00 train rolling back and operated the points again in order to route it into unoccupied platform 15, but he was too late; the first bogie of the rear coach (BCK no. 1889) had already passed. This caused the two bogies to take different tracks. The rear of the train collided with the front of the coaches in platform 10. The rear coach rose into the air and struck a <b>signal</b> <b>gantry,</b> crushing one of the two first-class compartments {{in the middle of the}} coach. Two passengers were killed, one of whom was Cecil Kimber, a former controller of the MG car company.|$|E
