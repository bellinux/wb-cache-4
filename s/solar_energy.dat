5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> {{potential}} because {{areas that}} are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> potential in {{areas that are}} farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, {{engineer}} and <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> onto square boxes filled with ether, {{which has a}} lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company {{with the intent of}} building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.|$|E
