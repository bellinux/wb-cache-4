40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how members of Australian superannuation funds can manage risks arising from uncertain security returns and unpredictable mortality so as to ensure a steady income stream during retirement. In chapter 2 we note {{that the proportion of}} superannuation assets invested in foreign assets has increased over the past two decades, exposing investors to currency risk. Surveys of superannuation funds verify that most international bond holdings, but not equity holdings, have been hedged for currency risk. We test the mean-variance efficiency of this practice against two alternative hedging strategies: a conventional forward hedge and a <b>selective</b> <b>hedge</b> conditioned on the domestic-foreign interest differential. Implementing optimal hedging results in portfolios whose returns stochastically dominate portfolios constructed under restricted equity hedging, according to our new adaptation of Barrett-Donald (2003) tests. Selective hedging works best for equities and conventional hedging for bonds. Chapter 3 applies a discrete-time Merton (1971) model to questions of optimal decumulation and asset allocation for self-funded retirees drawing down lump-sum retirement benefits. Risk management is taken to revolve around protecting a pre-specified minimum consumption stream. Risk tolerances and lifetimes are allowed to span a range of possibilities. In the case of an agent living to age 90, ideal investment in equity-type assets increases gradually from 27 - 43 % over remaining life. This is much lower than the 55 - 60 % observed among retirees. Conservative investment strategies are needed to meet consumption goals over long lifetimes. Milevsky and Young (2002, 2003) attribute the reluctance to voluntarily annuitise to a valuable real option to delay annuitisation (RODA). Chapter 4 extends the RODA analysis to the case of HARA preferences. A formula for the optimal timing of annuitisation is derived from the solution to a dynamic stochastic consumption and investment problem with uncertain lifetime. The effect of introducing a consumption floor is to reduce the delay before annuity purchase. As in the CRRA case, delayed annuitisation is associated with optimistic predictions of the Sharpe ratio and divergence between annuity purchaser and provider predictions of mortality...|$|E

The analysis suggests that variance-minimizing hedging strategies are very close in economic terms to optimal, value-maximizing hedging strategies for most firms. Furthermore, the marginal gains from shifting to nonlinear hedging strategies are often small enough to be neglected.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the risk reduction effectiveness of currency hedging international portfolios {{from the perspective}} of an average Dutch pension fund and insurer during the period 1999 - 2004. Several portfolios and approaches to hedging are analyzed. Passive hedging seems to be efficient in reducing the volatility of a foreign bond portfolio whereas the risk reduction achieved for a foreign equity portfolio is not significant. The case of mixed (bonds and equities) portfolios and hedging is also analyzed. No significant risk reduction (at the same level of returns as that of an unhedged portfolio) was attained using a static hedging approach and portfolio optimization under short sale constraints. Using a <b>selective</b> (dynamic) <b>hedging</b> approach based on the forward premium, showed similar results; the volatility of an unhedged and hedged portfolio was virtually the same.

In order to lock in profits a hedge increase is recommended in favorable states of nature, while in bad states the firm should decrease the hedge and wait.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the economic performance and statistical forecasting accuracy of some major agricultural futures markets relative to production and marketing decisions. The objectives were to: analyze the intertemporal price relationships between cash and futures markets; develop strategies associated with production and marketing decisions which incorporate both cash and futures prices; {{and evaluate the}} performance of alternative strategies to reduce unfavorable price fluctuations and increase realized profits. ^ To achieve these objectives, a forecasting model, one of the forecasting approaches, was developed. The profitability of <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> by producers and marketing firms depends upon their ability to accurately forecast prices, costs and basis. Two categories of production and marketing strategies [...] forecasting strategies and forecasting-futures strategies [...] were also considered for each commodity. The futures market performance of forecasting future cash prices was evaluated by single linear regressions with futures prices as the independent variable and cash price as the dependent variable. The economic performance of each decision strategy was evaluated with respect to additional profitability, commodity by commodity. ^ Historical data supported the conclusions that for grain and livestock, the futures market provides moderately reliable estimates of the cash prices for several months into the future. If one has a more accurate econometric model {{to be used for}} forecasting future cash prices than the direct use of the futures market prices, then profits can be increased for production and marketing of grain by adopting <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies. <b>Selective</b> <b>hedging</b> also increased returns for hog feeding. However, <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> for cattle feeding resulted in lower returns than under the forecasting strategy during the study period. ^ Economic efficiency would suggest that producers and marketing firms may have the potential for increased profits from using the decision strategies to reduce price risk and increase profitability. Their performance may also be improved with inclusions of production decisions based on the potential expected revenues among competitive enterprises. Furthermore, the decision strategies could also be used as a public advisory service to each industry with model respecification and implementation. ...|$|R

We {{examine this}} {{issue at the}} firm level using comprehensive data from the prototype Longitudinal Business Database recently developed by Statistics New Zealand. We use these data to test both optimal and <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> theories. Optimal hedging theory hypothesises that firms hedging choices depend on the probability and cost of financial distress, underinvestment risks, scale, managerial risk aversion, information asymmetry, governance, ownership structures and tax rules. Recent literature suggests that some firms vary hedging positions relative to their optimal position in a selective attempt to beat the market. We examine whether hedging behaviour is consistent with hypotheses derived from optimal hedging theories, and test whether hedging positions change (possibly sub-optimally) when the NZD/AUD {{is perceived to be}} high or low relative to an historical average. Optimal and <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> theories are both supported by the data.

40|$|We {{examine a}} common {{assumption}} {{in the risk}} management literature, that derivatives transactions have zero intrinsic net worth, and add value only because they help firms mitigate market imperfections by hedging financial risk. For a sample of 92 North American gold mining firms we infer the quarterly cash flows that each firm derives specifically from its derivatives transactions. We find that these derivatives cash flows are significantly positive on average, both economically and statistically. These positive derivatives cash flows appear to translate into increases in shareholder value, since we find no evidence of an upward adjustment of firms’ systematic risk to offset the cash flow gains. The bulk of the gains {{appear to be the}} result of forward prices generally exceeding realized future spot prices in the gold market. Consistent with anecdotal evidence on <b>selective</b> <b>hedging,</b> we find that hedge ratios and derivatives cash flows are too volatile to be explained purely by changes in firms’ hedging fundamentals. However, the gains from <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> are small at best. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that corporate derivatives use can be intrinsically valuable.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> {{strategy}} for managing {{foreign exchange risk}} which calls for hedging when a foreign currency is over-valued and the forward contract is trading at a premium but leaves the exposure uncovered otherwise. As empirical researches find that exchange rate deviations from the purchasing power parity (PPP) are self-correcting and exchange rates often move to the opposite directions as implied in forward rate premiums or discounts, the intuitions of the strategy are to avoid predictable depreciations of over-valued currencies and to capture the benefits of forward premiums. Based on daily data of eight free-floating currencies over the period 1986 to 2004, the strategy outperformed the un-hedged strategy in terms of higher realized single-period returns, lower return volatilities and improved risk-adjusted returns. Except for the US perspective, this strategy could realize 0. 42 to 2. 18 percent more value to long positions of three-month foreign exchange receivables. The strategy’s superior performance is also confirmed by the second order stochastic dominance analysis which finds 44 out of 56 dominance of the proposed strategy over un-hedged strategy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} option-based risk management from corporate finance and investment perspectives. ^ The first chapter {{focuses on a}} corporate finance issue: understanding dynamic hedge ratios of gold mining firms. An understanding of the hedging activities of a firm is critical to developing a thorough picture of risk exposures. In this paper we provide an alternative explanation for the dynamic nature of hedge ratios of mining firms. While the extant hedging literature is voluminous, it often errs by directly or indirectly assuming that <b>Selective</b> <b>Hedging</b> (in which managers base their hedging decisions on their expectations of future prices) {{is the source of}} dynamic hedge ratios. In contrast, we argue that the dynamic hedging activities of gold producers may not be indicative of <b>Selective</b> <b>Hedging,</b> but rather a form of hedging driven by the firm’s cost structure whereby the managers attempt to dynamically replicate a protective put position on the value of their future production to ensure a minimum threshold profit margin (similar to Portfolio Insurance). Informational asymmetries relating to the details of the firms cost structure may allow such managers to add value to the firm through their hedging activities. Thus, this model of hedging activity does not suffer from the persistence paradox of the <b>Selective</b> <b>Hedging</b> model. ^ The second essay focuses on option-based risk management from an investment perspective. The majority of the extant literature on option-based risk management focuses on equity investments. This is the first study to examine collar strategies on such a wide range of asset classes (17 exchange traded funds representing currencies, commodities, fixed income, and real estate). By considering the performance of collar strategies on a diverse set of assets, we draw insights into the unique characteristics of each asset class and the implications of these differences for risk management. We find significant differences across asset classes with respect to implied and realized volatility levels, volatility skew, transaction costs, liquidity and the effectiveness of collar strategies. This research provides valuable insight into the implementation of risk management strategies for retail and institutional investors in the rapidly evolving financial markets. ...|$|R

40|$|Soybean {{prices have}} fluctuated {{dramatically}} since 1972. Old marketing methods followed by producers were often found to yield inconsistent and inferior results during this period. The primary focus {{for this research}} was to examine a set marketing strategies (including cash sales, static <b>hedges,</b> and <b>selective</b> <b>hedges)</b> available to producers over the years 1972 to 1983 and identify dominant (high return) portfolios of strategies at various levels of riskiness. Two definitions of risk were operationalized in the portfolio selection process. ^ Risk was first defined as a variation of actual income from expected returns. MOTAD (minimization of total absolute deviations), a linear programming technique was used to select optimal soybean marketing strategy mixes for a given amount of absolute income deviations. Subsequently, risk was redefined as the occurrence of actual returns falling below a targeted return level. Target MOTAD was employed to identify dominant strategy mixes which maximized income subject to this risk restriction. ^ Diversification of marketing methods {{was found to be}} preferred. All dominant portfolios contained <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies as a portion of the preferred mix, indicating substantial returns to active marketing. Preharvest pricing, though restricted, was found to benefit the producer. Two limitations to this process were noted.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether there}} is a {{relationship}} between corporate governance and derivatives, whether corporate governance influence in firms impacts the association between derivatives and firm value, and whether corporate governance influence affects the association between derivatives and cash flow volatility, stock return volatility and market risk. This study uses two different data samples of publicly traded firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first sample comprises a panel of 6900 firm year observations and the other consists of a panel of 6234 firm year observations both over the eight-year period from 2004 - 2011. With regard to {{whether there is}} a relationship between corporate governance and derivatives, the findings from the empirical results show that corporate governance does influence derivatives and therefore is an important determinant in the firm’s decisions to use derivatives. Of the thirteen corporate governance variables examined, board size, institutional shareholders, CEO age, CEO bonus, CEO salary, insider shareholders and total CEO compensation show significant association with derivatives. This study finds that derivative users exhibit higher firm value on account of the corporate governance influence, which is correspondingly largely insignificant for derivative non-users. Further the research indicates that the impact of corporate governance varies according to the different types of risks examined. Generally, the board of directors and CEO governance mechanisms reduce stock return volatility to achieve hedging effectiveness. This supports the view that directors and management take actions to reduce stock return volatility to protect their personal portfolios without having to bear the costs of hedging themselves. With respect to cash flow volatility, the board of directors and CEO related corporate governance mechanisms largely exhibit increased risk to show evidence of speculative behavior. It supports the perceptions that managers and directors have a strong motivation to show higher earnings to protect jobs and reputation and to enhance compensation. All the shareholder governance mechanisms encourage risk taking with respect to stock return volatility, without any increase in firm value. This is in line with research findings of market granularity by institutional and other larger block holders to indicate that these investors increase stock price volatilities and play the markets for their own financial gain. Besides they have little interest in diversifying firm risk as they already have well protected portfolios and would not want to incur additional costs of hedging. The study finds evidence of association between corporate governance and <b>hedging,</b> speculation and <b>selective</b> <b>hedging.</b> Of the thirteen corporate governance variables examined in the study board diversity consistently shows hedging effectiveness, with accompanying increase in firm value. While board meetings, institutional shareholders, block shareholders, CEO age, CEO base salary and CEO compensation exhibit exclusive speculative behavior. The remaining corporate governance mechanisms: board size, insider shareholding, CEO tenure, CEO bonus and audit committee size, show evidence of <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> behavior. The concurrent hedging and speculative behavior evidenced in this study supports literature in respect of <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> by non-financial firms.

30|$|Our {{interest}} for the current problematic of investors based in a small country leads us to push the inquiry one step further and make a comparison between hedged and unhedged returns, taking the cost of hedging into account. Our goal is to address what we perceive as the currently dominant practice of Swiss-based investors which is to form highly internationalized portfolios, if only for lack of opportunities given the limited size of the Swiss capital markets, but systematically hedge the corresponding currency risks. We observe {{that the question of}} whether it pays to hedge or not {{is directly related to the}} existence of significant and long-lasting deviations from UIP. In other words, in a world of long-lasting deviations from interest parity, currency hedging is not the free lunch; it is sometimes made to be and often hoped for at the current juncture. But the crisis behavior of the safe haven currency may render unhedged international investment portfolios (or a permanent carry trade position for that matter) excessively risky.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for managing international investment portfolios. There are two different risk factors affecting this problem; the market risk and the currency risk. We develop models that address these risk factors in an integrated manner. Our framework has three fundamental components. The first component is the scenario generation procedure. The scenarios are generated so that the first four marginal moments and correlations of our random variables, which are the asset returns and exchange rates, match prespecified target values. These target values are the historical moments and correlations. The second component is {{the development and implementation}} of scenario-based stochastic programming models for international portfolios, where <b>selective</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies are used to control the exposure to the risk factors. Forward contacts are used to hedge the currency risk, while stock options hedge the market risk of the positions.
