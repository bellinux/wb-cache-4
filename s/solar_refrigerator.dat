40|$|AbstractLarge {{areas of}} many {{developing}} countries have no grid electricity. This is a serious challenge that threatens {{the continuity of the}} vaccine cold chain. The main alternatives to electrically powered refrigerators available for many years—kerosene- and gas-driven refrigerators—are plagued by problems with gas supply interruptions, low efficiency, poor temperature control, and frequent maintenance needs. There are currently no kerosene- or gas-driven refrigerators that qualify under the minimum standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) Performance, Quality, and Safety (PQS) system. Solar refrigeration was a promising development in the early 1980 s, providing an alternative to absorption technology to meet cold chain needs in remote areas. Devices generally had strong laboratory performance data; however, experience in the field over the years has been mixed. Traditional solar refrigerators relied on relatively expensive battery systems, which have demonstrated short lives compared to the refrigerator. There are now alternatives to the battery-based systems and a clear understanding that <b>solar</b> <b>refrigerator</b> systems need to be designed, installed, and maintained by technicians with the necessary knowledge and training. Thus, the technology is now poised to be the refrigeration method of choice for the cold chain in areas with no electricity or extremely unreliable electricity (less than 4 h per average day) and sufficient sunlight. This paper highlights some lessons learned with solar-powered refrigeration, and discusses some critical factors for successful introduction of solar units into immunization programs in the future including:•Sustainable financing mechanisms and incentives for health workers and technicians are in place to support long-term maintenance, repair, and replacement parts. •System design is carried out by qualified <b>solar</b> <b>refrigerator</b> professionals taking into account the conditions at installation sites. •Installation and repair are conducted by well-trained technicians. •Temperature performance is continuously monitored and protocols are in place to act on data that indicate problems...|$|E

Introducing <b>solar</b> <b>refrigerators</b> into the cold chain indicate that <b>solar</b> <b>refrigerators</b> can provide a more sustainable vaccine cold chain. The solar photovoltaic (PV) system generates both electrical and thermal energy from solar radiation. Therefore an energy and exergy analysis of the system was carried out. Energy analysis was concerned only with the quantity of energy use and efficiency of energy processes. Exergy is the maximum work potential which can be obtained from energy. The experimental data were used for the calculation of the energy and exergy efficiencies of the PV systems. The average photovoltaic efficiency was found to be 8. 4 and 8. 2 % for no load and full load conditions while exergy efficiency was 11. 4 and 11. 2 %, respectively for May month. Photovoltaic efficiency and exergy efficiency were calculated for March and April month also. Hence it is concluded that there was no impact of load on the performance of photovoltaic panel.

Cylindrical tubes function as both the adsorber system and the solar collector (flat-plate, 2 m 2, double glazed), the condenser is air-cooled (natural convection) and the evaporator contains 40 litres of water that can freeze. This ice is a cold storage for the cabinet (320 litres). The first tests (September 2000) showed very promising performance, with a gross solar cooling COPSR of 0. 19.

The design of an absorption refrigeration system operating with solar energy was carried out. The refrigerator is used to conserve sea food.

The lowest temperature the evaporator reaches is- 10 C, {{the high and low}} system pressures are 13. 4 atm and 2. 87 atm respectively. The refrigerant-absorbent mixture is ammonia and water, where the refrigerant is ammonia.

40|$|Recent {{technology}} {{developments and}} a systems engineering design approach {{have led to}} the development of a practical battery-free <b>solar</b> <b>refrigerator</b> as a spin-off of NASA's aerospace refrigeration research. Off-grid refrigeration is a good application of solar photovoltaic (PV) power if thermal storage is incorporated and a direct connection is made between the cooling system and the PV panel. This was accomplished by integrating water as a phase-change material into a well insulated refrigerator cabinet and by developing a microprocessor based control system that allows direct connection of a PV panel to a variable speed compressor. This second innovation also allowed peak power-point tracking from the PV panel and elimination of batteries from the system. First a laboratory unit was developed to prove the concept and then a commercial unit was produced and deployed in a field test. The laboratory unit was used to test many different configurations including thermoelectric, Stirling and vapor compression cooling systems. The final configuration used a vapor compression cooling cycle, vacuum insulation, a passive condenser, an integral evaporator/ thermal storage tank, two 77 watt PV panels and the novel controller mentioned above. The system's only moving part was the variable speed BD 35 compressor made by Danfoss. The 365 liter cabinet stayed cold with as little as 274 watt-hours per day average PV power. Battery-free testing was conducted for several months with very good results. The amount of thermal storage, size of compressor and power of PV panels connected can all be adjusted to optimize the design for a given application and climate. In the commercial unit, the high cost of the vacuum insulated refrigerator cabinet and the stainless steel thermal storage tank were addressed in an effort to make the technology commercially viable. This unit started with a 142 liter, mass-produced chest freezer cabinet that had the evaporator integrated into its inner walls. Its compressor was replaced with a Danfoss DC compressor slightly larger than the one used in the laboratory unit. The control system was integrated onto a single electronics card and packaged with its starting capacitors. The water for thermal storage was placed behind a liner that was made to fit inside the original factory liner. The original condenser was also augmented with additional surface area to improve performance. PV panels with a total rated power of 180 watts were used. The unit was tested with very successful results in an outside ambient environment, demonstrating its potential for widespread use in many off-grid applications for solar refrigeration...|$|E
