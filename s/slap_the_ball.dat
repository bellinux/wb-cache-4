25|$|Killer whales usually hunt larger fish, such as salmon, {{individually}} {{or in small}} group of individuals. However, forage fish, such as herrings, are often caught using carousel feeding. The killer whales force the herrings into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then <b>slap</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with their tail flukes, either stunning or killing up to 10–15 herring with a successful slap. The herring are then eaten one at a time.

500|$|Fish-eating {{killer whales}} prey on around 30 species of fish. Some {{populations in the}} Norwegian and Greenland sea {{specialize}} in herring and follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet. About 65% of them are large, fatty Chinook. Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats [...] each day.

But Green Bay stormed right back with a 74-yard {{touchdown}} drive, featuring a 66-yard reception by Levens. On the next play, Bennett's 4-yard touchdown run gave the Packers a 27–13 lead with two minutes left in the third quarter.

5000|$|The ball {{can also}} be {{transformed}} into one of four main forms: rubber ball, ballbearing, bowling ball, and the ball's original crystal form. The rubber form gives {{the greatest amount of}} abilities for the ball. It can easily be bounced, slapped, thrown, and even float on water. The bowling ball form allows the ball to not break easily, sink in deep water, and kill enemies by slapping it. The ballbearing form gives precise control over the ball, and can be used to throw and <b>slap</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> more carefully and is also magnetic. The crystal form floats on water and is very fragile, but gives Glover double points for each obtained Garib. Other forms can be accessed through cheat codes. Throughout the stages, there are also plenty of magic potions that help Glover by giving him power-ups for a certain amount of time.|$|E

5000|$|Barr {{was named}} as the NFL's number three [...] "Making the Leap" [...] player. The {{first game of}} the season marked Barr’s first {{appearance}} in the regular season since Nov 30 because of a knee injury that stopped short his promising rookie campaign. According to press box statistics, Barr played all 73 defensive snaps against the San Francisco 49ers and recorded a career-high 12 tackles. He was credited with 10 solo stops, which tied a career-high, and made an impressive impact with Carlos Hyde for a loss of four yards in the fourth quarter. Barr surged through unblocked, making it three-plus yards behind the scrimmage as Hyde was taking the handoff from quarterback Colin Kaepernick. In Week 4 against the Denver Broncos, with Denver trying to build on a 13-3 lead late in the first half, Barr jumped in front of a short pass intended for wide receiver Andre Caldwell, recording the first interception of his career and returning it 32 yards to the Denver 27-yard line. Barr broke his left hand in Week 8 against the St. Louis Rams. In Week 12 at Atlanta, Barr became the first Viking to collect eight tackles, two forced fumbles, and a sack in the same game since Chris Doleman accomplished the feat in 1992. The first fumble came with the Vikings leading 7-0 in the first quarter, when rookie running back Tevin Coleman burst down the right sideline and cut across the grain to elude safety Antone Exum for what would have been a 46-yard gain, but then Barr chased Coleman down from behind and <b>slapped</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> out of his right arm. In the fourth quarter, with the Falcons trailing 13-3, they went for a first down on fourth and 1 at their 48 with 4:39 left. Barr burst through the line unblocked and sacked quarterback Matt Ryan, causing him to fumble and sealing the game for the Vikings. Barr totaled 68 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, 8 quarterback hurries, 1 interception, 7 passes defensed and 3 forced fumbles in his second season, playing a key role on a Vikings' defense that ranked 5th in the NFL and allowed 18.9 points per game. On January 25, 2016, Barr was named to his first Pro Bowl as an injury replacement for linebacker Jamie Collins, who was injured in the Patriots' loss in the conference title game.|$|R

5000|$|As {{they had}} in Super Bowl VI, Miami won the toss and elected to receive. Most {{of the first quarter}} was a {{defensive}} battle with each team punting on their first two possessions. The Dolphins would, however, get two key breaks. Howard Kindig appeared to mishandle the snap on their first punt from the Miami 27 and lose <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to <b>the</b> Redskins' Harold McLinton, but McLinton was called for <b>slapping</b> at <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while it was being snapped, for a 5-yard penalty. On the replay of the down, Larry Seiple got the kick away safely. Later, after stopping Washington for the second time, safety Jake Scott did not call for a fair catch, as he had not been told to do so by Dick Anderson. He fumbled, but fortunately Anderson made the recovery. Miami then started this drive on its own 37-yard line with 2:55 left in the first quarter. Running back Jim Kiick started out the drive with two carries for eleven yards. Then quarterback Bob Griese completed an 18-yard pass to wide receiver Paul Warfield to reach the Washington 34-yard line. After two more running plays, on third and four Griese threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to receiver Howard Twilley (his only catch of the game). Twilley fooled Pat Fischer by faking a route to the inside, then broke to the outside and caught <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at <b>the</b> five-yard line, dragging Fischer into the end zone. [...] "Griese read us real good all day", said Fischer. Yepremian's extra point gave the Dolphins a 7-0 lead with one second remaining in the period. (Yepremian noticed that the kick was too low, just like his practice kicks).|$|R
50|$|Both {{defenses}} dominated {{during the}} final nine minutes of the game, as both offenses struggled to move the ball. With {{less than five minutes}} remaining in the game, Michigan State received the ball at their own 28-yard line. After an offsides penalty was called against Michigan, Cook was sacked by Willie Henry for a loss of 10. Cook found Aaron Burbridge for 25 yards for the first down. Several plays later, after MSU had advanced the ball into Michigan territory, Henry sacked Cook again on first down for a loss of 9 yards. Several plays later, facing a fourth and 19 with less than two minutes left on the clock, Cook was forced to throw an errant pass due to pressure from Michigan's d-line, failing to convert on fourth down for a third time. Michigan received the ball on downs and forced MSU to use their final timeout with 1:42 remaining in the game. On third and three, the Spartan defense stopped Michigan, preventing them from running out the clock with a first down. What followed was {{perhaps one of the most}} bizarre and unlikely endings to a football game. Facing a fourth and two, Michigan lined up to punt the ball with 10 seconds left on the game clock. Punter Blake O'Neill earlier had booted an 80-yard punt and had played well all game. However, after receiving a low snap, O'Neill fumbled the ball, and as he tried to recover it in a last ditch effort to punt the ball away, MSU Safety Grayson Miller hit him, forcing his arm to <b>slap</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the air where it was caught by redshirt Freshman Jalen Watts-Jackson, who returned the ball to the endzone as time expired to give Michigan State the win, 27-23.|$|E
50|$|After {{ten minutes}} of {{sustained}} pressure on Australia's defence England were through, Burgess again charging over under the posts from close range. Sinfield's kick added the Extras so once again England had the lead at 16-14. A little over three minutes later it was Australia attacking England's line when their fullback Billy Slater dove over from dummy-half, the lead changing again {{to be back with}} the Kangaroos. Thurston couldn't get the conversion so Australia's lead stayed at only two points, 18-16. In the fifty-eighth minute the Kangaroos were on the attack again when Thurston chipped ahead from twenty metres out for Brett Morris to chase through and score in the corner behind the England defence. The conversion attempt by Thurston was missed so Australia lead 22-16 with twenty-one minutes of the match remaining. Shortly after the kick-off following the try England's Michael Shenton suffered a head clash when trying to tackle front-row forward Ben Hannant and the game was halted as he was stretchered unconscious from the field. Moments after the restart of play Hannant himself was concussed when tackled by James Graham but played on. Australia scored a remarkable try after sixty-six minutes when Darren Lockyer chipped over the top into England's in goal and Slater, chasing through leapt over the dead ball line to <b>slap</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back in with his hand for Cameron Smith to dive on and claim the four points. Thurston's kick from right in front did not miss so Australia lead 28-16. As the Kangaroos returned the ball after a short kick-off from England they reached the opposition's end of the field and Slater scored again after backing up a good break from Smith. The conversion from Thurston was an easy one so the score was 34-16 in favour of the visitors with under {{ten minutes of}} the match remaining. In the seventy-third minute Jarryd Hayne got a try after running through to chase a Lockyer grubber. Thurston added the extras, Australia's lead now 40-16 with a little over five minutes left to play. The Australians got one more try though when Kurt Gidley made a break around the halfway line and kicked ahead, Billy Slater winning the race to the ball to claim his hat-trick in the seventy-seventh minute. Man-of-the-match Thurston added the extras so the score was 46-16 when the final hooter sounded. It was England's heaviest loss to Australia on home soil.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the series}} {{returning}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 6, the improbable comeback continued, with Curt Schilling pitching on an ankle that had three sutures {{wrapped in a}} bloody [...] white sock (red with a blood stain). Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings to lead the team to victory. Mark Bellhorn also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run {{home run in the}} fourth inning. Originally called a double, the umpires conferred and agreed that <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> had actually gone into the stands before falling back into the field of play, which was apparent to the television audience but angered Yankees fans. A key play came {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning with Derek Jeter on first and Alex Rodríguez facing Bronson Arroyo. Rodríguez hit a ground <b>ball</b> down <b>the</b> first base line. Arroyo fielded it and reached out to tag him as he raced down <b>the</b> line. Rodríguez <b>slapped</b> at <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and it came loose, rolling down the line. Jeter scored and Rodríguez ended up on second. After conferring, however, the umpires called Rodríguez out on interference and returned Jeter to first base, the second time in the game they reversed a call. Yankees fans, upset with the calls, littered the field with debris. The umpires called police clad in riot gear to line the field in the top of the 9th inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player Tony Clark, who had played well against the Red Sox since leaving the team, to the plate as the potential winning run. Closer Keith Foulke however, struck out Clark to end the game and force a Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback on the strength of Derek Lowe's one-hit, one-run pitching and Johnny Damon's two home runs, including a grand slam in the second inning off the first pitch of reliever Javier Vázquez, and defeated the New York Yankees, 10–3. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.|$|R
