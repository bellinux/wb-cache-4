50|$|In England, {{a public}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> was {{included}} in The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, written in 1395. Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516, debated {{the benefits of the}} death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian Cesare Beccaria Dei Delitti e Delle Pene ("On Crimes and Punishments"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility {{from the point of view}} of social welfare, of torture and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, Grand Duke Leopold II of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the first permanent abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having de facto blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating Cities for Life Day.|$|E

The theme of the psalm, the need of help against raging enemies, corresponds to the Gospel. Compared to Bach's other chorale cantatas of the period, the unknown poet kept much of the original text, six of the eight stanzas, expanding two of them by recitative, to connect even closer to the Gospel. He paraphrased only stanzas 3 and 6 to an aria each. In the last aria, in a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to rationalism—the [...] "weasel words of rationalists, who would bring down the whole Lutheran theological edifice" [...] in the words of John Eliot Gardiner—the poet expands the words of the reformers' hymn, [...] "" [...] (reason cannot grasp it), appealing to reason, described as unstable and frenzied, to be silent.|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{influence}} {{has been widely}} blamed as a driving factor behind difficulties passing U. S. climate legislation and compromises in the more seriously-considered bills. This thesis will examine corporate public statements, lobbying activities, and campaign contributions as various forms of political influence, and seek to identify parallels and inconsistencies between these policy drivers. In particular, the analysis will aim to draw conclusions about how corporate lobbying activities compare to public relations statements on climate change. As detailed lobbying disclosure information is not publicly available, an analysis of campaign contribution patterns serves {{as the basis for}} inferring industry lobbying positions on climate legislation from the 109 th through 111 th Congresses. While a few energy companies made public <b>statements</b> in favor <b>of</b> binding climate legislation, most committed themselves only to vague <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> environmental stewardship without advocating for specific policy solutions. <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> overt <b>opposition</b> to climate legislation by industry officials in the press and testimony further reveal internal contradictions within these corporations. The examination of lobbying behavior, using campaign contributions as a proxy for lobbying goals, demonstrates corporate reluctance to back stated concern for climate change with support for legislation, especially bills with more significant targets. Oil companies in particular exhibited the greatest bias, most notably surrounding the only Congressional vote on a stand-alone climate bill. This could be due to the likelihood that, unlike the other industries examined, oil industry GHG emissions are likely to increase rather than decrease with fuel source diversification. These findings could be greatly supplemented and illuminated through more thorough lobbying disclosure requirements. While there are significant parallels in campaign contribution and lobbying patterns, as examined in the literature scoping, the proxy use has limitations. Disclosure of lobbying positions and contacted representatives would eliminate the need for this intermediate step, and encourage more transparent corporate positioning regarding climate change and other legislative issues...|$|R
