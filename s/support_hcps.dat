40|$|Background and objective: Misconceptions {{about the}} safety of herbal {{medicines}} and oversights of possible interactions with medicines are common. The objective was to develop and evaluate a herbal medicine formulary to aid healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the prescribing, dispensing and counselling responsibilities. Setting: Community pharmacies. Method: Monographs on every drug herb available locally were compiled into a formulary, for each including the family and medicinal parts, indications, cautions, contraindications, side-effects, drug interactions, dosage and products available. The formulary was distributed to all, 216, local pharmacies. Subsequently, a questionnaire was distributed to 55 pharmacists and 10 general practitioners (GPs). Main outcome measures: Evaluation of the usefulness and effectiveness of the developed formulary. Results: A total of 30 HCPs participated in the questionnaire, of which 22 were pharmacists and 8 GPs, {{with a mean age of}} 36 years and with the majority of the participants being female (19). All participants found the formulary useful with 19 claiming to use it frequently and 7 quite frequently; 29 participants strongly agreed that the formulary helped them learn which herbal medicinal products (HMPs) are available locally and 26 strongly agreed that the information within the formulary is useful. Participants (n = 30) agree that the formulary is user-friendly (27), the information included is up-todate and well referenced (29) and that there is the need for a formulary of this kind in Malta (28). Conclusion: The formulary was found to be a very useful tool to <b>support</b> <b>HCPs</b> in providing advice on the use of herbal medicines. It was developed in a way as to be informative, easy to follow, user friendly and attractive and from the evaluation exercise these features were confirmed by the HCPs. peer-reviewe...|$|E

By tracking the reference values established in former research conducted between 2009 and 2011, the objectives of this study are to explore trends and to measure and assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding FGM/C among health care professionals (HCPs) in The Gambia. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed to collect and analyze data from an overall stratified sample consisting of 1, 288 HCPs including health professionals and students throughout the six regions of The Gambia. Data were collected by the implementation of a self-administered written knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire between 2012 and 2014. Results: The results of this study showed that 76. 4 % of HCPs are eager to abandon FGM/C, and 71. 6 % of them regard it as a harmful practice with negative consequences on life and health. HCPs reported more knowledge and favorable attitudes towards FGM/C abandonment, being better able to identify the practice, more aware of its health complications, and more concerned in their essential role as social agents of change. However, 25. 4 % of HCPs still embraced the continuation of the practice, 24. 4 % expressed intention of subjecting their own daughters to it, and 10. 5 % declared to have performed it within their professional praxis. Conclusion: Findings confirm progress in knowledge and attitudes regarding FGM/C among HCPs, who are better skilled to understand and manage the consequences. Nevertheless, discrepancies between information, intention, and behavior unveil resistance in practice and proves that FGM/C medicalization is increasing. Thus, there is an urgent need to <b>support</b> <b>HCPs</b> in the integration of FGM/C preventive interventions within the public health system, to address arguments favoring medicalization, and to use data to design appropriate strategies.

Methods Programme development followed the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework, beginning with examination {{of theory and}} research, and consultation with experts. The programme content incorporated attachment theory, child development and family systems theory. It was piloted thrice with HCPs from a cancer centre. The evaluation involved a questionnaire, comprising open-ended questions, completed {{before and after the}} programme. Data from the questionnaire were analysed using framework analysis. Results 31 HCPs from varying disciplines participated. The programme was evaluated positively by participants. Before the programme, participants had significant concerns about their professional competence, which included: managing their own emotions; a perceived sensitivity around raising child and family matters with patients and a lack of specialist experience, skills and knowledge. After completing the programme, participants reported greater understanding and knowledge, increased confidence to approach patients about family matters, greater skill to initiate conversations and explore family concerns and guiding parent–child communication according to the child's level of understanding, and an increased engagement and resilience for caring for parents with cancer. Significance of the results <b>Supporting</b> <b>HCPs</b> to provide family-centred care is likely to reduce psychological difficulties in families where a parent has cancer.

30|$|Comprehensive {{public health}} {{response}} during HCs often requires {{the assistance of}} HCPs from external organizations. These workers must deal with constraints from both their administrations and the resource-scarce environment. Research has begun to explore the field of ethical dilemmas and challenges in healthcare work in HCs. This study indicates that HCPs in HCs experience ethical challenges {{in a variety of}} ways and that they feel negatively impacted both personally and professionally by these conflicts. More research is needed that deepens an understanding of the perceptions of the ethical decision making experienced by HCPs in HCs and the feelings of moral distress they experience as a result. This will assist in developing tools to prepare for and respond to these situations encountered in the field in a way that <b>supports</b> <b>HCPs</b> both psychologically and in care delivery. Public health service provision in HCs will be positively impacted if the HCPs that deliver care are able to work at their optimal capacity.|$|R

30|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{findings}} goes beyond the need for organizations to provide training or <b>support</b> for <b>HCPs.</b> It relates to a deeper issue of organizational ethos and expresses {{the urgent need for}} humanitarian organizations to admit to and address the direct impact of ethical challenges on HCPs in the field. This is highlighted by the participants’ commonly shared experience of being “held hostage by institutional constraints.” The current study extends the previous discussion on this issue (Schwartz et al. 2010; Hunt 2008) by elaborating on multiple ways that participants felt their organizations were restricting them: feigning ignorance, silencing them, and hiding behind bureaucracy. HCPs in the current study struggled with feelings of being silenced and ignored by their organization when they reached out for help and guidance in times of ethical challenges. As a result, participants commonly had strong and long-lasting negative emotions towards the organizations they worked for and expressed that they no longer wanted to go on missions in the field.|$|R
50|$|The <b>HCP</b> <b>supports</b> {{three major}} project groups of habitat {{protection}} measures, flow protection measures, and supporting {{measures such as}} applied research, ecological and biological, and water-quality monitoring. HCP project examples include minimization and mitigation of the impacts of low flow, by restoring native riparian zones in order to benefit the Comal Springs riffle beetle by increasing the amount functional habitat and food sources (i.e., root structures and associated biofilms). The method of riparian zone establishment will include the removal of non-native, followed by the replanting of native vegetation that may be considered representative of a healthy, functioning riparian zone.|$|R
30|$|These {{findings}} suggest that organizations have an imperative to address the ways that they both cause and exacerbate ethical challenges experienced by HCPs. Turning {{a blind eye to}} ethical issues in the field does not remove an organization’s culpability for their actions. The “feigning of ignorance” allows an organization to make public programmatic decisions that are ethically responsible {{while at the same time}} putting their workers in the position of encountering ethical challenges in the field. This raises the issue that for an organization to <b>support</b> their <b>HCPs</b> to the fullest, they must also admit that moral distress is a real issue. There is a rather large challenge of first having humanitarian organizations admit that the guidelines regarding their boundaries of moral responsibility do not necessarily encompass all of the applied decision making in the field. The authors suggest that the first step in the right direction would be to further understand the nature of how organizations respond to ethical challenges in the field and the negative fallout from the burden of these choices on HCPs.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{development}} of the National Service Framework for diabetes has increased the need for regular education of all health care professionals (HCP) involved in diabetes care. Aims To develop and evaluate an on-line course providing a multidisciplinary diabetes educational program {{and to provide a}} network for continued communication. Methods An eight unit interactive course has been developed together with a separate ‘Diabetes Education and Research Network’. Both utilize the University’s managed learning environment providing both synchronous and asynchronous communication facilities. An evaluative framework to assess educational impact utilizes on-line focus group discussion, questionnaire and reflective diaries for perceived clinical impact. Results On-line focus group discussion themes: utility, access, information load, enhanced learning through on-line interaction. Questionnaire mean overall satisfaction Likert rated at 1. 2 (n = 20). Reflective diaries indicate positive impact on diabetes care generally and enhanced use of psychosocial approaches to interventions. Discussion An interactive course has been developed to deliver a distance learning foundation course in diabetes management. Novel evaluation techniques demonstrate positive learning impact.

40|$|Background: Childhood eczema, or {{childhood}} atopic dermatitis, causes significant distress {{to children}} and their families through sleep disturbance and itch. The main cause of treatment failure is nonuse of prescribed treatments. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and test a Web-based intervention to support families of children with eczema, and to explore whether support from a health care professional (HCP) is necessary to engage participants with the intervention. Methods: We followed the PRECEDE-PROCEED model: regular emollient use was the target behavior we were seeking to promote and we identified potential techniques to influence this. LifeGuide software was used to write the intervention website. Carers of children with eczema were invited through primary care mail-out and randomized to 3 groups: (1) website only, (2) website plus <b>HCP</b> <b>support,</b> or (3) usual care. Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores were measured online by carer report at baseline and at 12 weeks. Qualitative interviews were carried out with 13 HCPs (primarily practice nurses) and 26 participants to explore their experiences of taking part in the study. Results: A total of 143 carers were recruited through 31 practices. We found a decrease of ? 2 in follow-up compared with baseline POEM score in 23 of 42 (55 %) participants in the website only group, 16 of 49 (33 %) in the usual care group, and 18 of 47 (38 %) in the website plus HCP group. Website use data showed that 75 of 93 (81 %) participants allocated to the website groups completed the core modules, but less than half used other key components (videos: 35 %; regular text reminders: 39 %). There were no consistent differences in website use between the website only or the website plus HCP groups. Qualitative feedback showed that most HCPs had initial concerns about providing support for eczema self-care because this was not a condition that they felt expert in. However, HCPs reported productive consultations and that they found it helpful to use the website in consultations, while observing that some participants seemed to need more support than others. Qualitative interviews with participants suggested that <b>HCP</b> <b>support</b> was valued highly only by a minority, generally those who were less confident in their management of eczema or less confident using the Internet. Conclusions: Our pilot trial demonstrated the potential for greater improvements in POEM scores in both website intervention groups and that a full-scale trial is feasible. Such a trial would quantify the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention to determine whether it should be widely promoted to families of children with newly diagnosed eczema. In this study population, <b>HCP</b> <b>support</b> was not strongly valued by participants and did not lead to better outcomes or website use than use of the Web-based intervention alone.

40|$|To {{identify}} {{and assess the}} level of knowledge and attitudes of health care professionals (HCP) in Qatar toward organ donation and transplantation, this cross-sectional study was carried out from October 2007 to February 2008 in the Accident and Emergency Departments and Intensive Care Units of the hospitals of the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC). A representative sample of 585 HCP working in the hospitals of the HMC was approached and 418 staff gave consent {{to participate in the}} study (71. 5 %). 36. 8 % were physicians, 48. 6 % nurses and 14. 6 % Emergency Medical Service (EMS) technicians. Of the surveyed HCP, 40. 7 % were males and 59. 3 % were females. Majority of the staff were in the age group of 30 - 39 years (58. 6 %). More than half of the physicians (59. 7 %) and technicians (57. 4 %) assumed that organs can be bought and sold in the State of Qatar. Most of the physicians (76. 6 %) and nurses (75. 9 %) knew that brain-dead persons are eligible for organ donation, whereas only 57. 4 % of the EMS technicians thought so. Majority of the <b>HCP</b> <b>supported</b> organ donation; physicians (89. 0 %), nurses (82. 3 %) and technicians (70. 5 %). The attitude of the physicians (24. 0 %) and nurses (20. 2 %) to donate a kidney to a family member was very poor compared with the attitude of the technicians (44. 3 %). Although the <b>HCP</b> <b>support</b> organ donation (83 %), more than half of the physicians (51. 3 %), nurses (61. 6 %) and technicians (54. 1 %) wanted to be buried with all their organs intact. The findings, although they give cause for hope, suggest that there is much work yet to be done before organ donation and transplantation can become fully accepted by the medical community in Qatar...|$|R

30|$|This study {{achieved}} {{its main}} objective of evolving {{an understanding of}} how HCPs perceive ethics and ethical challenges, and the impact that these issues have on them. Understanding moral distress as related by HCPs is the first step to understanding how the negative reactions can be alleviated. Being able to identify the ethical challenges experienced by HCPs and the impact they feel from them will assist organizations to plan suitable frameworks for training and guidance in ethical challenges. This will offer improved <b>support</b> for their <b>HCPs</b> and in turn improve public healthcare provision in the time of HCs. However, first humanitarian aid organizations must recognize the role they play in creating issues surrounding ethical decision making, in order to ever be able to fully support their workers. To build on this study, the next step would be to discuss these issues with a larger cohort of participants in order to gain an understanding of a wider range of experiences and perceptions in these topics.|$|R

We found the main themes influencing decision making were patient-centric, caregiver-related or related to HCPs' own beliefs, perspectives, and actions. HCPs felt patients should be, and were, in control of decision making, although caregivers and HCPs played a role. The patient's evaluation of quality of life, the desirability of prolonging life, and acceptance of the disease and its progression by both patient and caregiver were the most important factors identified by HCPs.

Pulmonary rehabilitation, a multidisciplinary treatment for COPD incorporating exercise trail. Design: A systematic review of qualitative research. Methods: Electronic databases of published, (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, ASSIA, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus), non-published data and conference proceedings (DART Europe E theses, EThOS, Open Grey, The New York Academy of Medicine, ProQuest Dissertations and theses), and trial registers (ClinicalTrials. gov and Current Controlled Trials) were searched to identify qualitative studies (interviews, focus groups) including COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation. Qualitative data relevant to the research question were synthesised using an inductive, thematic approach. Results: 14 studies (n= 12 published articles, n= 2 theses) including 167 COPD patients (male = 92, female = 75) met the inclusion criteria. Analytical themes were beliefs, motivation and social support, which encapsulated the facilitators and barriers to physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation. Facilitators included positive intentions, support from health care professionals (HCPs), positive feedback regarding health, access and opportunities to attend physical activity maintenance groups, peer and family interaction. Barriers included negative beliefs, lack of 27 <b>support</b> from <b>HCPs</b> and peers, as well as practical issues surrounding travel and home responsibilities following pulmonary rehabilitation.

40|$|Social support {{can have}} {{beneficial}} effects on psychological and physiological well-being. During acute bodily pain, however, {{the effects of}} social support on pain are mixed. This variability {{may be due to}} the multifaceted nature of both pain and social support, as well as individual differences. In this paper, we present the development, psychometric assessment, and initial validation of the first self-report measure designed to address this variability in the general population; the Responses and Attitudes to Support during Pain questionnaire (RASP). The RASP includes questions on social support from the romantic partner as well as healthcare professionals (HCPs) and addresses different types of social support and pain responses. The development and validation of the RASP comprised four studies. In Study 1, a preliminary RASP version was completed by 179 healthy individuals regarding any type of acute pain. In Study 2, the reduced RASP was completed by 256 women with experiences of menstrual pain. Principal component analysis indicated a 22 -item solution with five underlying dimensions reflecting general partner support, emotional <b>support</b> from <b>HCPs,</b> anxiety in the context of HCPs, pain behaviors during partner support, and distraction by the partner. Construct validity was assessed using a measure of adult attachment style. The RASP showed good validity and test-retest reliability. In Study 3, the 5 -factor model received initial support through confirmatory factor analysis in a new sample of 120 individuals with recent musculoskeletal pain. Study 4 provided additional validation of the RASP in a sample of 180 individuals responding in reference to acute back pain. Overall, the RASP is a valid and reliable measure for assessing individual differences in attitudes and responses to social support in relation to acute pain...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{pesticide}} poisoning (APP) {{is a major}} global {{public health}} problem, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including South Africa. However, healthcare professionals (HCPs) worldwide have limited training in handling environmental health risks such as from pesticide exposures. Most HCPs lack basic training on APP and, this presents a challenge to HCPs when diagnosing and notifying pesticide-related poisonings. With a recent increase in mobile application technology, this gives a convenient platform to provide training <b>support</b> for <b>HCPs</b> in their clinical practice. An example is the integration of a South African pesticide notification guideline into an existing Emergency Medicine (EM) mobile application. This pesticide notification guideline (PNG) within the EM mobile application aims to provide an immediate point-of-care tool to help HCPs in diagnosis and notify pesticide poisoning cases. Despite this useful platform for training HCPs, there are limited studies that have evaluated mobile applications or technologies to promote HCPs training in LMICs. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the Centre for Environmental and Occupational Health Research (CEOHR) 's PGN adapted for the EM mobile application {{as a tool for}} improving HCP's ability to diagnose and report APPs. The protocol (Part A) provides information and a justification for the research study and, describes the methods used to gather and analyse the data. The extended literature review (Part B) provides an overview of studies assessing HCPs' knowledge of and training in pesticide poisonings and the role mobile health technologies play in improving HCPs' knowledge and training in clinical practice. Furthermore, the literature review illustrates the relevant theoretical frameworks and concepts that helps to understand HCPs' behaviour changes when using clinical guidelines or algorithms.

40|$|Fathers in the United Kingdom (UK) usually {{attend the}} birth and {{immediate}} {{care of their}} baby. They also have an increasing presence during complicated and preterm childbirth, newborn resuscitation and early neonatal unit(NNU) care. However, there is limited evidence {{about the effect of}} these experiences on them. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain an understanding of the experiences of fathers encountering these situations. The study consisted of three phases and was undertaken in one National Health Service trust in the UK. Qualitative semi-structured interviews using a phenomenological approach were undertaken with 20 first-time fathers present at the delivery, resuscitation and/or admission of their baby to the NNU. Direct observations were made of 22 normal and complicated deliveries and initial newborn care and qualitative semi-structured interviews using the critical incident approach were undertaken with 37 health care professionals (HCPs). The study generated qualitative and quantitative data that were analysed accordingly. The findings show that most fathers were involved for at least some of the time and often spontaneously initiated their involvement. Their most important need was for information. They were usually more concerned about their partner, irrespective of the baby?s need for resuscitation and NNU care. To facilitate their involvement, fathers needed guidance and <b>support</b> from <b>HCPs,</b> particularly delivery suite midwives. Most HCPs recognised the needs of fathers and ways in which they could be helped to connect with their experience. However, these needs were not always met, usually because of inadequate staffing levels, a lack of resources or a mother-centred philosophy of care. The findings suggest the service often determines the extent to which fathers are involved. It is anticipated that these findings will inform HCP education and training and the development of both policy and health education thereby enhancing the quality of care provision for fathers.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) overlay networks {{is how to}} efficiently find a node that shares a requested object. The Chord protocol is a distributed lookup protocol addressing this problem using hash keys to identify the nodes in the network and also the shared objects. However, when a node joins or leaves the Chord ring, object references have to be rearranged {{in order to maintain}} the hash key mapping rules. This leads to a heavy traffic load, especially when nodes stay in the Chord ring only for a short time. In mobile scenarios storage capacity, transmission data rate and battery power are limited resources, so the heavy traffic load generated by the shifting of object references can lead to severe problems when using Chord in a mobile scenario. In this paper, we present the Hybrid Chord Protocol (HCP). HCP solves the problem of frequent joins and leaves of nodes. As a further improvement of an efficient search, <b>HCP</b> <b>supports</b> the grouping of shared objects in interest groups.

Methods: we searched 7 databases using the terms ‘self-management’, ‘group’ and ‘qualitative’. Full text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved for review. A thematic synthesis approach was used to analyse the studies. Results: 2126 articles were identified and 24 were included for review. Group participants valued being with similar others and perceived peer <b>support</b> benefits. Facilitators (<b>HCP</b> and lay) had limited group specific training, were uncertain of purpose and prioritised education and medical conformity over supportive group processes and the promotion of self-management agency and engagement. Overall, studies prioritised positive descriptions. Conclusion: group programmes’ medical self-management focus may reduce their ability to contribute to patient-valued outcomes. Further research is needed to explore this disconnect.

40|$|Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has {{the highest}} {{prevalence}} of HIV globally, and {{this is due to}} persistent new HIV infections and decline in HIV/AIDS-related mortality from improved access to antiretroviral therapy. There is a limited body of work on perspectives of healthcare providers concerning disclosing outcomes of HIV investigations to children and adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies are country-specific, indicating a need for a regional scope. Objective: To review the current literature on the perspectives of healthcare providers and caregivers of children and adolescents on age group-specific and culture-sensitive HIV disclosure practice. Methods: Electronic database search in PubMed, Google scholar and the University of South Florida (USF) Library Discovery Tool (January 2006 up to February 2016). Further internet search was conducted using the Journal Author Name Estimator (JANE) search engine and extracting bibliographies of relevant articles. Search terms included ‘disclosure*’, ‘HIV guidelines’, ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’, ‘clinical staff’, ‘ART’, ‘antiretroviral adherence’, ‘People living with HIV’, ‘pediatric HIV’, ‘HIV’, ‘AIDS’, ‘healthcare provider’ (HCP), ‘caregiver’, ‘adolescent’, ‘primary care physicians’, ‘nurses’, ‘patients’. Only studies related to HIV/AIDS disclosure, healthcare providers, caregivers that clearly described perspectives and interactions during disclosure of HIV/AIDS sero-status to affected children and adolescents were included. Independent extraction of articles was conducted by reviewers using predefined criteria. Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria. Most studies were convenience samples consisting of combinations of children, adolescents, HCPs and caregivers. Key findings were categorized into disclosure types, prevalence, facilitators, timing, process, persons best to disclose, disclosure setting, barriers and outcomes of disclosure. Conclusions: Partial disclosure is appropriate for children in SSA up to early adolescence. Caregivers should be directly involved in disclosing to children but they require adequate disclosure <b>support</b> from <b>HCPs.</b> Full disclosure is suitable for adolescents. Adolescents prefer disclosure by HCPs and they favor peer-group support from committed peers and trained facilitators, to reduce stigma.

40|$|Text in EnglishInteractive health {{communication}} between the health-care professional (HCP) and patient relationship for diabetes health-care positively contributes to patient-centred care. Hence individual patient concerns are addressed and catered for in the medical system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse in-depth how HCP-patient relationships and HCP-HCP teamwork dynamics positively contribute to effective diabetes patient care and treatment adherence. Different health communication models and theories were reviewed and a conceptual framework was developed from the literature. A qualitative case study approach was used to collect data at Stanger Hospital’s diabetes clinic. Data was collected using three different methods, namely in-depth interviews with HCPs and patients individually, observations conducted at the clinic analysing both the HCPs and patients, and finally, documentation that emerged as a third data collection method where patient files and diabetes educational material were analysed at the clinic. Triangulation by means of the three methods ensured that reliable, valid and credible data was collected in the field. Diabetes health-care and treatment management are affected by the social context/social system which includes family and culture. These social factors are acknowledged as core in the literature. However, a single comprehensive health communication model did not exist solely in this regard. The data indicated that at the Stanger Hospital’s diabetes clinic, patient-centred (individual tailor-made treatment plans) care was only implemented after patients had defaulted treatment for reasons linked to their social circumstances. The findings of the study indicate that teamwork was favoured in the HCP-HCP relationship at the diabetes clinic, and that this made a positive contribution to effective diabetes patient care. HCPs were overburdened at the clinic since patient numbers were high and there were staff shortages. The patients’ empirical data indicated that interactive communication positively contributed to their medical concerns being catered for at the diabetes clinic, but this tended to occur only after non-adherence. Patients required care and <b>support</b> from <b>HCPs</b> in order to learn to accept diabetes and manage their illness. SociologyD. Litt. et Phil. (Sociology...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this qualitative study were {{to describe the}} perceptions and needs of pediatric health care professionals (HCPs) taking care of children with palliative care needs {{and to develop a}} concept for the first Center of Competence for Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) in Switzerland. Within two parts of the study, 76 HCPs were interviewed. The main interview topics were: (1) definition of and attitude toward PPC; (2) current provision of PPC; (3) the <b>support</b> needs of <b>HCPs</b> in the provision of PPC; and (4) the role of specialized PPC teams. HCPs expressed openness to PPC and reported distinctive needs for support in the care of these patients. The main tasks of specialized PPC teams in Switzerland would encompass the coaching of attending teams, coordination of care, symptom control, and direct support of affected families during and beyond the illness of their child. Conclusion: This study indicates the need for specialized PPC in Switzerland both inside and outside of centers providing top quality medical care (Spitzenmedizin). Specialized PPC teams could {{have a significant impact on}} the care of children and families with PPC needs. Whether hospices are an option in Switzerland remains unanswered; however, a place to meet other families with similar destinies was emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{current number}} of {{healthcare}} providers (HCP) {{caring for children}} with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) across Canadian tertiary-care centres is underinvestigated. The aim of this survey {{was to assess the}} number of healthcare providers (HCP) in ambulatory pediatric IBD care across Canadian tertiary-care centres. Methods. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we examined available resources in academic pediatric centres within the Canadian Children IBD Network. The survey evaluated the number of HCP providing ambulatory care for children with IBD. Results. All 12 tertiary pediatric gastroenterology centres participating in the network responded. Median full-time equivalent (FTE) of allied health professionals providing IBD care at each site was 1. 0 (interquartile range (IQR) 0. 6 – 1. 0) nurse, 0. 5 (IQR 0. 2 – 0. 8) dietitian, 0. 3 (IQR 0. 2 – 0. 8) social worker, and 0. 1 (IQR 0. 02 – 0. 3) clinical psychologists. The ratio of IBD patients to IBD physicians was 114 [*]:[*] 1 (range 31 [*]:[*] 1 – 537 [*]:[*] 1), patients to nurses/physician assistants 324 [*]:[*] 1 (range 150 [*]:[*] 1 – 900 [*]:[*] 1), dieticians 670 [*]:[*] 1 (range 250 [*]:[*] 1 – 4500 [*]:[*] 1), social workers 1558 [*]:[*] 1 (range 250 [*]:[*] 1 – 16000 [*]:[*] 1), and clinical psychologists 2910 [*]:[*] 1 (range 626 [*]:[*] 1 – 3200 [*]:[*] 1). Conclusions. There was a wide variation in <b>HCP</b> <b>support</b> among Canadian centres. Future work will examine variation in care including patients’ outcomes and satisfaction across Canadian centres...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To measure {{support for}} {{seasonal}} influenza vaccination requirements among US healthcare personnel (HCP) and its associations with attitudes regarding influenza and influenza vaccination and self-reported coverage by existing vaccination requirements. Design. Between June 1 and June 30, 2010, we surveyed {{a sample of}} US HCP ([Formula: see text]) recruited using an existing probability-based online research panel of participants representing the US general population as a sampling frame. Setting. General community. Participants. Eligible HCP who (1) reported having worked as medical doctors, health technologists, healthcare support staff, or other health practitioners or who (2) reported having worked in hospitals, ambulatory care facilities, long-term care facilities, or other health-related settings. Methods. We analyzed support for seasonal influenza vaccination requirements for HCP using proportion estimation and multivariable probit models. Results. A total of 57. 4 % (95 % confidence interval, 53. 3 %- 61. 5 %) of US HCP agreed that HCP {{should be required to}} be vaccinated for seasonal influenza. Support for mandatory vaccination was statistically significantly higher among HCP who were subject to employer-based influenza vaccination requirements, who considered influenza to be a serious disease, and who agreed that influenza vaccine was safe and effective. Conclusions. A majority of <b>HCP</b> <b>support</b> influenza vaccination requirements. Moreover, providing HCP with information about the safety of influenza vaccination and communicating that immunization of HCP is a patient safety issue may be important for generating staff support for influenza vaccination requirements...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Access {{to smoking}} {{cessation}} treatment {{is limited in}} many countries. Digital tools could <b>support</b> healthcare professionals (<b>HCPs)</b> who have limited training and resources to deliver evidence-based cessation treatment to patients. This project aims to develop, evaluate and disseminate STAR (Smoking Treatment Advisory Resource) Programme – a novel internet-based platform acting as a support tool and expert system for data gathering, delivery of evidence-based treatment, networking, and training for HCPs, with initial focus on Poland. Material and Methods The project is conducted as part of Global Bridges RFP: European Program (2017 - 2019). Phase 1 is devoted to development of STAR, including consultations with Polish HCPs and patients and adaptation of training resources created by the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training in the UK. Phase 2 will involve mixed-methods evaluation including quantitative assessments of changes in key indicators from baseline to immediate post-training and at 6 -month follow-up, and analysis of STAR usage; as well as qualitative evaluation. Finally, during Phase 3 the STAR Programme will be refined based on results from Phase 2 and promoted among a wider community of HCPs and patients. Results The presentation will outline the project methods and the STAR Programme. Conclusions It is expected that the project {{will result in the}} development of an acceptable and sustainable Programme that will increase the number of HCPs delivering evidence-based cessation support. STAR will offer possibilities for further development, and adaptation for other settings and countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Adolescents {{with type}} 1 {{diabetes}} face demanding challenges due to conflicting priorities between psychosocial needs and diabetes management. This conflict often results in poor glycaemic control and discord between adolescents and parents. Adolescent-parent conflicts are thus a barrier for health care providers (HCPs) to overcome {{in their attempts to}} involve both adolescents and parents in improvement of glycaemic control. Evidence-based interventions that involve all three parties (i. e., adolescents, parents and HCPs) and are integrated into routine outpatient clinic visits are lacking. The Guided Self-Determination method is proven effective in adult care and has been adapted to adolescents and parents (Guided Self-Determination-Young (GSD-Y)) for use in paediatric diabetes outpatient clinics. Our objective is to test whether GSD-Y used in routine paediatric outpatient clinic visits will reduce haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) concentrations and improve adolescents' life skills compared with a control group. Methods/Design Using a mixed methods design comprising a randomised controlled trial and a nested qualitative evaluation, we will recruit 68 adolescents age 13 - 18 years with {{type 1 diabetes}} (HbA 1 c > 8. 0 %) and their parents from 2 Danish hospitals and randomise into GSD-Y or control groups. During an 8 - 12 month period, the GSD-Y group will complete 8 outpatient GSD-Y visits, and the control group will completes an equal number of standard visits. The primary outcome is HbA 1 c. Secondary outcomes include the following: number of self-monitored blood glucose values and levels of autonomous motivation, involvement and autonomy support from parents, autonomy <b>support</b> from <b>HCPs,</b> perceived competence in managing diabetes, well-being, and diabetes-related problems. Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated within and between groups by comparing data from baseline, after completion of the visits, and again after a 6 -month follow-up. To illustrate how GSD-Y influences glycaemic control and the development of life skills, 10 - 12 GSD-Y visits will be recorded during the intervention and analysed qualitatively together with individual interviews carried out after follow-up. Discussion This study will provide evidence of the effectiveness of using a GSD-Y intervention with three parties on HbA 1 c and life skills and the feasibility of integrating the intervention into routine outpatient clinic visits.

40|$|Successive “National Care of the Dying Audit for Hospitals” {{record that}} Health Care Professionals (HCPs), are {{recognising}} that patients are dying only days before their death, reducing opportunities for patient involvement in decision-making. This PhD, utilizing a mixed and iterative methodology, addresses how senior HCPs in one hospital recognise dying, and negotiate decision-making with {{patients and families}} in this process. In Study One thirteen senior HCPS undertook a Critical Incident Review. These involved the ward based senior HCP who identified dying, and the Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT) HCP(s) subsequently involved in the patient’s care. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and themed. In Study Two senior HCPs across the hospital were invited to four consecutive Participatory Action Research (PAR) workshops to critically reflect on the themed data from Study One. Ten HCPs took part (three HPCT HCPs were involved in both studies). The workshops were similarly recorded, transcribed and themed. The themed analysis yielded a model for decision-making but did not explain why dying was identified so late. A psychoanalytically informed psychosocial approach was taken to examine anomalies and contradictions in the data that pointed to less conscious undercurrents in the personal, professional, educational and institutional dynamics involved {{in the care of}} patients who are dying. Through this analysis, it is clear that identifying dying, and negotiating decision-making with the patient and their family at this time, is extremely anxiety provoking. Individual and social psychological defence mechanisms that avoid the recognition of dying come into play. HCPs’ experience of learning to care for the dying patient and their family is “chaotic” and anxiety provoking and leaves them ill-equipped. Complicating matters, at the point of recognition of dying, the institution devolves its responsibility for care (requirement for space and time for patient and family conversations, and emotional <b>support</b> for <b>HCPs</b> who sometimes have to deal with angry families) to individual HCPs. The argument is put forward that the HPCT have become part of modern NHS social defence mechanisms. Sensitively facilitated PAR workshops allow interested HCPs to mutually consider how to identify dying earlier; implications of this for the patient, family and themselves; the organisational resources available; and the role of education. Attention is paid to the HCPs emotional experience and psychological defences, and over time there is opportunity to negotiate sustainable practice change...|$|R
40|$|Self-monitoring {{of blood}} glucose (SMBG) can be {{effective}} in preventing poor outcomes associated with diabetes mellitus but previous research has identified that SMBG is not being undertaken in line with current recommendations. Guidance informs health professionals to educate patients on how they should self-monitor but very little is know about how patients self-monitor in the real world. In this thesis, a quantitative scoping study is first presented. This study used routine data sources to examine the levels and patterns of self-montoring in different population groups and then proceeded to a larger qualitative study to explore and question what patients are doing in practice in relation to self-monitoring, and why. This involved a qualitative multi-case study of patients, their support people, health care practitioners (HCPs) and patient diaries. Ten individuals and their nominated <b>support</b> people and <b>HCPs</b> formed ten cases among whom 21 in-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out and six patient diaries analysed. The exploratory work was framed around Stones’ version of structuration theory and uncovered a complex linkage of individual motives for monitoring, associated responses and behaviours {{in relation to the}} motive, and the underpinning attitudes and beliefs behind the motive. The following key points emerged from the analysis. People have differing relationships with their diabetes and this links with the level of engagement they have with their condition. Resistance to support people and health services was commonly observed. Experiences of diabetes reviews were important, with an identified need for them to feel more like collaboration and less like surveillance. A significant factor was the gaps and limitations in knowledge and understanding around diabetes for patients, relatives, support people and HCPs; and, finally, there was a noted maintenance of blood glucose levels higher than recommended through SMBG in several participants, which stemmed from a fear of hypoglycemic episode. The analysis concluded that although self-monitoring of blood glucose, in theory, and when considered in isolation, is a simple process to undertake, its application in the wider context of self-management and the individual is much more complicated. The process is influenced by many complex factors and generates a variety of responses and behaviours, some not in keeping with good diabetes self-management. There was a significant lack of person-centered approaches to managing diabetes which was, in part, due to existing health systems and processes. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} raise awareness of the gaps that exist in terms of such approaches as well as the gaps in knowledge and understanding of individuals with diabetes and those caring for and supporting them. In more specific terms, it is essential to develop and evaluate individual approaches to patients in relation to their self-monitoring and associated self-management in the context of their own lives, which involves the assessment of engagement and understanding around self-monitoring...|$|R
