5000|$|Sight setter : [...] Operates {{the sight}} <b>setting</b> <b>equipment.</b> In single mounts, he stands {{just behind the}} trainer (See the man with {{headphones}} in the Mk21 open mount picture), while in twin mounts he sits between the guns, just forward of the projectile hoists. The sight setter moves the sights' reticles relative to the barrel's axis. In early open mounts, this was done by moving the platforms to which the sights were bolted. Sights in enclosed mounts have movable prisms in their optical paths. [...] The sight setter has three dials, and two hand cranks. (pictured) The two right dials and right hand crank control the elevation reticle offset (called Sight Angle). The upper right dial is scaled in minutes of arc, and the lower right dial is in yards. The left dial and hand crank control the reticle's left and right offset (called Sight Deflection), and the dial is scaled in angular mils. When the mount is in Automatic Control, he turns his hand cranks to keep index marks on his dials matched to lines on the central disks of the dials. These disks are electrically controlled by the Fire Control System by synchro. This is called matching the pointers, and it allows the sights {{to remain on the}} target while the mount is controlled by the Fire Control System. In local control, he takes sighting orders from the Mount Captain in yards of range and mils of deflection.|$|E

40|$|In {{analyzing}} {{and evaluating}} binding methods today, {{as well as}} projecting and forcasting for the future, let us first focus our attention {{on some of the}} significant changes and developments taking place in the industry. Within the last decade, mechanization and technological advancements have made impressive gains in updating library binding. All indications are that this is just the beginning, and that we are moving into an era of accelerated automation and development. Prior to this time, of course, steady progress was realized in binding technology, but it was in far more moderate degrees than what is being experienced now. The sewing machine formerly constituted one of the main mechanized functions, and could probably be considered the most sophisticated operation in the over-all binding process. Other essential but less complex machinery consisted of stamping and type <b>setting</b> <b>equipment,</b> cutting machines, semi-automatic rounding and backing equipment and book presses.

40|$|This paper {{comments}} {{on issues of}} quality in early child care and education from an international perspective, asserting that questions about how to determine quality are as complex for early childhood programs as for all other professional services. The paper's introduction discusses the world wide trend of expansion {{in the amount of}} out-of-home care offered, the variations in training and government supervision, and the common problems of defining the objectives of early childhood provisions and of providing quality and affordability. The paper then lists five perspectives on assessing quality and states that criteria representing all of these perspectives merit consideration in determining the quality of provisions for the care and education of young children. Each perspective is discussed in detail: (1) the top-down perspective, which typically assesses selected characteristics of the program, <b>setting,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and other features, as seen from above by adults in charge of the program or by those responsibl...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Sedimentation is {{considered}} {{as an important}} process in removing turbidity produced in water and wastewater plants. Gravity sedimentation is usually the first method considered in water treatment system. However, required overflow rates (OFRs) to remove turbidity in the conventional clarifiers are too low. Therefore, the shallow depth sedimentation concept was studied remove turbidity {{in order to increase}} OFRs of gravity <b>setting</b> <b>equipment.</b> &# 13; Methods: Using a pilot with parallel plates with effect area 1. 5 m 2 and 1. 5 m depth. The independent parameters such as OFRs, sludge concentration and turbidity were evaluated for turbidity removal. The pilot is located in Isfahan Water Treatment Plant. &# 13; Results: The efficacy of pilot for turbidity 10 - 50 NTU is equal to 50 percent (P< 0. 01). The maximum removal efficiency at sludge concentration 270 ml/lit was obtained (P< 0. 01). A nonlinear relationship exists between removal efficiency (TR%), sludge concentration (Sc) over flowrates (OFR) and influent turbidity (Tu) in pilot. &# 13; Discussion: By using high rate sedimentation tank in water treatment plant, detection time reduced from 3 hours to 20 - 30 minute, turbidity removal increased up to 30 percent in compare with conventional sedimentation. Also, it has economic benefits and high efficiency...|$|E

Photographs are read as contemporary or historical documents; on the other hand, they are regarded as works of creativity addressing aesthetic and philosophical problems.

40|$|IntroductionThe World Health Organization (WHO) has {{published}} lists of essential {{equipment and supplies}} for delivering emergency care in resource-limited settings. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess material resources available for adult emergency care at a major academic tertiary care referral centre in Accra, Ghana, to determine quality improvement needs. MethodsA spot inventory of emergency centre equipment and supplies was conducted in Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) and compared to the WHO essential emergency equipment list released in 2006. ResultsMost items considered essential were available at the time of inventory. Notable exceptions included: equipment and supplies for healthcare provider safety and infection control, advanced airway management, and ophthalmologic or gynaecological examinations. Several additional items, such as glucometers and pulse oximeters, were available and often used for patient care. ConclusionBeyond pointing out specific material resource deficiencies at the Surgical Medical Emergency (SME) centre, our inventory assessment indicated a need to develop better implementation strategies for infection control policies, to collaborate with other departments on coordination of patient care, and to set a research agenda to develop emergency and acute care protocols that are both effective and sustainable in our <b>setting.</b> <b>Equipment</b> and supplies are essential elements of emergency preparedness that must be both available and ‘ready-to-hand’. Consequently, key factors in determining readiness to provide quality emergency care include supply-chain, healthcare financing, functionality of systems, and a coordinated institutional vision. Lessons learnt may be useful for others facing similar challenges to emergency medicine development...|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{examined}} an electronic nutritional self-screening procedure for feasibility and for reliability, rapidity, {{and ease of}} use by hospital outpatients. Methods One hundred sixty consecutive patients (ages 18 – 87 y) attending a gastroenterology clinic measured their weight and height using a modified digital weight and height machine, which transmitted results to a computer. Following input of reported weight loss in the previous 3 mo to 6 mo, malnutrition risk by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) was instantaneously calculated. The duration and ease of undertaking screening were noted. Screening also was undertaken by a health care professional. Results Of the patients in the study, 21. 3 % were at risk for malnutrition (medium + high risk). There was perfect agreement (kappa = 1. 00) between self-screening and health care professional screening, between test–retest self-screening, and between two methods of measuring height (facing toward and away from the stadiometer). A low within-patient coefficient of variation was found for measurement of weight (< 0. 2 %), height (< 0. 35 %) and body mass index (< 0. 4 %), except for two measurements in which height was recorded before correct positioning of the sliding headpiece. The overall time to self-screen was 1. 29 ± 0. 57 min but it was 2. 81 ± 0. 92 min in those aged ? 75 y. Of the participants, 96. 2 % rated self-screening as very easy (71. 9 %) or easy (24. 3 %) and 3. 8 % (predominantly patients ages ? 75 y) difficult.
