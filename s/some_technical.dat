5|$|The {{alignment}} of SR-103, {{outside of the}} roadway renumbering, have received <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> changes as well. In November 1992, UDOT confirmed that the interchange of I-15 and SR-103 (exit 335) was to be given traffic lights to help monitor traffic. The mayor at the time, Neldon Hamblin, approved of the project, and put the project up for bids for construction. The interchange was holding up motorists needing to turn left up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 2048 {{preserves}} <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> {{aspects of}} its predecessor Wipeout HD, including downloadable content, online multiplayer mode, and cross-platform play with PlayStation 3 owners of Wipeout HD. The game received mainly positive reviews. Critics agreed that its graphics and visuals showcased {{the power of}} the then-new PlayStation Vita, but criticised its long loading time and other technical issues.|$|E

5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians use <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> terms when {{discussing}} tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the novel, varying {{perceptions}} of reality that arise due to cultural differences between its characters are emphasized and contrasted. Carpentier explores hybridization, nature, voodoo, ethnicity, history and destiny, confusion, violence, and sexuality {{in a style}} that blends history with fiction and uses repetition to emphasize the cyclical nature of events. The novel was largely well-received with much attention paid to Carpentier's inclusion of magic realism and The Kingdom of This World {{has been described as}} an important work in the development of this genre in Caribbean and Latin American literature. However, <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> aspects of his style have been ignored by the academic community, and the novel's narrative organization has been criticized.|$|E
5|$|Ward's {{thesis is}} {{based on the fact that}} the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, is {{overwhelmingly}} influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous and more sophisticated Madonna Standing draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> difficulties that Campin was never to resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the rendering of the body beneath the robes. He also points to the architectural similarities in Campin's Marriage of Mary, although this may be a matter of influence.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} <b>some</b> <b>technical</b> errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
