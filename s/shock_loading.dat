40|$|Safe {{application}} of the anaerobic sequencing biofilm batch reactor (ASBBR) still depends on deeper insight into its behavior when faced with common operational problems in wastewater treatments such as tolerance to abrupt variations in influent concentration, so called <b>shock</b> <b>loads.</b> To this end the current work shows the effect of organic <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> {{on the performance of}} an ASBBR, with a useful volume of 5 L, containing 0. 5 -cm polyurethane cubes and operating at 30 degrees C with mechanical stirring of 500 rpm. In the assays 2 L of two types of synthetic wastewater were treated in 8 -h cycles. Synthetic wastewater I was based on sucrose-amide-cellulose with concentration of 500 mg COD/L and synthetic wastewater II was based on volatile acids with concentration ranging from 500 to 2000 mg COD/L. Organic <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> of 2 - 4 times the operation concentration were applied during one and two cycles. System efficiency was monitored before and after {{application of}} the perturbation. When operating with concentrations from 500 to 1000 mg COD/L and <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> of 2 - 4 times the influent concentration during one or two cycles the system was able to regain stability after one cycle and the values of organic matter, total and intermediate volatile acids, bicarbonate alkalinity and pH were similar to those prior to the perturbations. At a concentration of 2000 mg COD/L the reactor appeared to be robust, regaining removal efficiencies similar to those prior to perturbation at <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> twice the operation concentration lasting one cycle and stability was recovered after two cycles. However, for <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> twice the operation concentration during two cycles and <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> four times the operation concentration during one or two cycles filtered sample removal efficiency decreased to levels different from those prior to perturbation, on an average of 90 - 80 %, approximately, yet the system managed to attain stability within two cycles after shock application. Therefore, this investigation envisions the potential of full scale application of this type of bioreactor which showed robustness to organic <b>shock</b> <b>loads,</b> despite discontinuous operation and the short times available for treating total wastewater volume.

In the adsorption process, the total removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen by zeolite and ceramic was 94 %. In the release process, the ammonia nitrogen concentration increased significantly and then gradually returned to the normal level four hours after the <b>shock</b> <b>load.</b> The results indicated that the double-layer BAF had a high level of adaptability to the short-term ammonium <b>shock</b> <b>load</b> and long-term operation. The main factors influencing the dynamic process of ammonia nitrogen adsorption were the filter bed height, ammonia nitrogen concentration of influent, and flow rate.
