50|$|Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands for the Nintendo DS is a {{handheld}} 2D side-scroller installment to the franchise, {{in a similar}} fashion to the series' previous DS installment, Prince of Persia: The Fallen King. The game is entirely <b>stylus-controlled,</b> featuring no button use. To maneuver, the player must hold the stylus in the direction relative to the Prince character where the player wants to move. To climb, the player must hold the stylus part way up a wall, to jump, the player holds the stylus {{at the other end of}} the gap. Combat in the game is <b>stylus-controlled</b> as well. To defeat enemies, the player must slash them. This is done by moving the stylus diagonally across the enemy the player intends to attack. The player can also manipulate the power of the sands with the stylus; if the player rubs a streak of sand with the stylus, it becomes a pillar of sand, which the player can use to jump across gaps.|$|E

The system was designed to detect a [...] "target" [...] with radar, and then use video cameras {{to determine whether the}} radar return came from a person or vehicle, or from some benign source (such as an animal). The GAO reported that radar information was too slow to appear on screens, and was being inappropriately triggered by rain and other weather phenomena. Camera resolution was insufficient for targets beyond 3.1 miles, and the <b>stylus-controlled</b> laptops mounted on moving vehicles were not rugged enough and were difficult to use.|$|E
