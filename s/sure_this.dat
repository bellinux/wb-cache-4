She planned to take Daugavpils, but after a reconnaissance mission discovered {{that the city was}} defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack by such a small force as her own unit, that plan was abandoned. She then returned to Samogitia and headed for Panevėžys, where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski. On May 4, she fought at the battle of Prastavoniai; shortly afterwards, with Konstanty Parczewski, she fought at Maišiagala. On 5 May, she witnessed General Dezydery Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.|$|E

25|$|To be <b>sure,</b> <b>this</b> fortuitous {{takeover}} of Salin {{was backed by}} no additional Ava troops, and could not last. Sithu Kyawhtin II returned with a 7000-strong army (2000 horses, 15 elephants). Though his army was outnumbered more than two-to-one, Sithu Kyawhtin I chose to make a stand. But Salin's defenses were breached on the second day. Inside the city, Sithu Kyawhtin I fought on atop his war elephant, and even engaged Sithu Kyawhtin II, who was also on his war elephant. In the end, Toungoo troops won the battle. Sithu Kyawhtin barely escaped, fleeing to the Chin Hills.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Vice in June 2015, Sussman stated that the game would not ship with support for online play, as surveys taken prior to release, and their own tracking, showed that only about 10% of previous Rock Band players used the online feature, and thus focused on building out the local play features first for release. Sussman commented {{that it may be}} released as part of future patches to the title. The game at launch did support online leaderboards and score tracking at launch, and has added additional asynchronous features since. In April 2016, Harmonix announced that it will add in synchronous online play by the end of 2016. In December 2016, Harmonix delayed the online addition until January 25, 2017 to make <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> feature covered all edge cases that they had encountered in testing.|$|E
25|$|For 46 years, {{up until}} 778, Lourdes was possessed by Muslims of Al-Andalus. However, during the 8th century, Lourdes and its {{fortress}} {{became the focus}} of skirmishes between Mirat, the Muslim local leader, and Charlemagne, King of the Franks. Charlemagne had been laying siege to Mirat in the fortress for some time, but the Moor had so far refused to surrender. According to legend, an eagle unexpectedly appeared and dropped an enormous trout at the feet of Mirat. It was seen as such a bad omen that Mirat was persuaded to surrender to the Queen of the sky by the local bishop. He visited the Black Virgin of Puy to offer gifts, so he could make <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> was the best course of action and, astounded by its exceptional beauty, he decided to surrender the fort and converted to Christianity. On the day of his baptism, Mirat took on the name of Lorus, which was given to the town, now known as Lourdes.|$|E

25|$|Baphomet {{also serves}} as the main {{antagonist}} in the PC game Tristania 3D, and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France {{was the one who}} had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> secret will remain unearthed. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.|$|E
500|$|The overall {{presentation}} of the game was highly praised, noting that [...] "a lot of care was put into making <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> was a die-hard fan's game" [...] and praising the devotion to the motion capture work done by the band. The added features such as Metallifacts and additional behind-the-scenes videos were attributed to [...] "ensuring that this isn't just a slapped-together take on World Tour with Metallica songs". [...] It is generally regarded as the most successful Guitar Hero expansion game, as opposed to other spin offs in the series which failed to match its success and popularity.|$|E
500|$|In Arguing about Gods, Graham Oppy {{offers a}} dissent, {{acknowledging}} that [...] "any philosophers seem {{to suppose that}} [...] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" [...] but continuing [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> is a correct assessment of {{the current state of}} play". Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.” Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the problem of evil presently revolves around the evidential problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.|$|E

Sakura's never-give-up attitude may be more of a classic anime archetype, but I feel Ibuki's a character more people can empathize with." [...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge." [...] In a poll by Omar Dogan on his DeviantArt website, most of voters wanted to see Ibuki [...] "wearing something cute", and precisely something in the Harajuku-style Lolita fashion. Dogan's own favourite part of the story was [...] "the part where Ibuki and Oro battle." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer's self-titled debut album, {{also known}} as the Blue album, was {{released}} in May 1994 and became a commercial success; it was certified gold on December 1 and platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> is the life I want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, he listened to the operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E

It was his first general classification victory since the 2015 Route du Sud; he dedicated the victory to his fans and to Oleg Tinkov, the owner of the Tinkoff team. Sergio Henao said that he had tried a different tactic in the time trial – holding back early on in order to give more effort later in the stage – and said that he was pleased both with his own performance and with how his team had ridden. He said that he was feeling strong ahead of his main objectives for the season, the Ardennes classics. Quintana said that his bike change in the time trial had helped, but that it was not quite enough to win the stage. He said that he was pleased with how he had ridden the race and in particular with how he had recovered from illness earlier in the week.|$|E
