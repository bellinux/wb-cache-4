It was later adapted as The Hollows of Time by Bidmead for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in June 2010.|$|E

Instead, they chose to move on to a different project, Girls, which began in May 2005.|$|E

5|$|For {{several decades}} {{after the end of}} the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too {{sensitive}} for further film interpretation. In 1946, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer considered filming the <b>story</b> <b>but</b> ceased production after protests led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, Hasbro and IDW Publishing {{accorded to}} make a four-issue mini-series about Magic: The Gathering with a new <b>story</b> <b>but</b> heavily based on MTG {{elements}} and with a new Planeswalker called Dack Fayden, which story is mainly developed in the planes of Ravnica and Innistrad. The ongoing series started in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Metro: Last Light {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with most complimenting the graphics and <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> criticizing the linear sequences. The game {{was nominated for}} Best Shooter for Spike's 2013 VGX game awards, and Xbox 360 Game of the Year by GameSpot.|$|E

Critics {{were interested in}} the <b>story</b> <b>but</b> criticized Wall's writing style. Sharp Independent and Killer Films optioned the film rights shortly after its publication and discussed possibly creating a movie adaption of the book.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on March 19, 2015. Review aggregator Metacritic characterized TouchTone reviews as generally favorable. Critics praised the game's visual style and <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> criticized the way the game did not allow players to skip puzzles. Reviewers found the light-bending puzzle premise unoriginal, but appreciated its thematic connection.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a <b>story</b> <b>but</b> being cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Before {{publication}} of the novel, several Hollywood executives and studios declined to create a film based on it, including Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pandro Berman at RKO Pictures, and David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures. Jack L. Warner liked the <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> Warner Bros.'s biggest star Bette Davis was uninterested, and Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century-Fox did not offer enough money. Selznick changed his mind after his story editor Kay Brown and business partner John Hay Whitney urged him to buy the film rights. In July 1936—a month after it was published—Selznick bought the rights for $50,000.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E

Susanne is then captured by X, who leers at the Lone Gunmen as he departs with her. Later, the three of them meet Mulder in the convention center and explain what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E

5|$|Like the original, Drakengard 2 {{combines}} on-foot hack and slash with aerial combat {{stages and}} RPG game mechanics. The previous game's producer, writer and character designer {{returned to their}} respective roles. The game {{was designed as a}} more mainstream game in light of the previous game's dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay. A spin-off from the series, Nier, was released in 2010, while a third entry in the series, Drakengard 3, was released in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Many Puranas tell Krishna's {{life story}} or some {{highlights}} from it. Two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain {{the most elaborate}} telling of Krishna's <b>story,</b> <b>but</b> the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, {{has been the most}} popular and widely studied part of this text.|$|E

The mood changes, however, {{when one of the}} meteorite-missiles crashes through the building roof, injuring barmaid Sheila (Vera Day). Armed guards arrive and gun down Hall after he telephones the press. The villagers form a mob that marches on the complex. Rushing the gates, Quatermass, Lomax, and the villagers barricade themselves in the pressure control room.|$|E
