5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's <b>single</b> <b>most</b> {{enduring}} act was the Family Pact. It {{ensured that}} all the Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen years after her death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{smallpox}} was endemic in Europe. There {{were five}} epidemics in London between 1719 and 1746, and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities. By {{the end of}} the century about 400,000Europeans were dying from the disease each year. It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia. In the 19th century, smallpox became the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important cause of death of the Australian Aborigines.|$|E

The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including tennis and rugby. In 1979, a documentary titled Goin' Down The Road, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station'.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{diffusion}} of national and Republican ideas across France {{during the second half of}} the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was among}} those {{dissatisfied}} with the weak national government. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention {{in order to create}} a new constitution. He was an active participant at Philadelphia, and he helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of The Federalist Papers which, to this day, are the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important reference for Constitutional interpretation.|$|E

40|$|Mixed-signal {{circuit design}} on sea-of-gates arrays {{requires}} {{the use of}} composite MOSTs, combinations of in-series and in-parallel connected unit MOSTs. To avoid an increase in circuit simulation complexity these are in general replaced by artificial <b>single</b> <b>MOSTs.</b> The analysis in this paper shows that a straightforward replacement will lead to incorrect results. Series MOSTs (in-series connected unit MOSTs) are essentially different from <b>single</b> <b>MOSTs</b> due to the presence of diffusion areas interrupting the channel at regular distances. The influence of lateral diffusion, charge sharing, and series resistance needs to be reconsidered. The theoretical results are confirmed by measurements on an experimental IC. Parameter decks of existing MOST models for circuit level simulation can be modified easily to reflect the length dependences of composite MOST parameters...|$|R
5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% was put to pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E

5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry outbursts of his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The <b>single</b> <b>most</b> {{important factor in}} this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the}} most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 Roger Moore was {{appointed}} to the role of 007 for Live and Let Die and played Bond a further six times over twelve years before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in GoldenEye, released in 1995; he remained in the role for a total of four films, before leaving in 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role of Bond for Casino Royale, which rebooted the series. The twenty-third Eon produced film, Skyfall, was released on 26 October 2012. The series has grossed almost $7 billion to date, making it the third-highest-grossing film series (behind Harry Potter and the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe), and the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> successful adjusted for inflation.|$|E

5|$|Of the 21,000 civil {{aircraft}} {{registered in the}} UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The <b>single</b> <b>most</b> common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes £1.4 billion to the UK economy.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The <b>single</b> <b>most</b> erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the Chronicle is the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> important historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E
