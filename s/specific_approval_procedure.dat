As the regional wind energy feed in exceeds the regional power consumption temporarily even to a high extent, leading to an export of surplus wind power from local grids to the transmission grid and by this to distant areas, and as neither the existing distribution grids nor the transmission grids were set up for today’s requirements, the application of flexibility measures becomes vital. The required grid extension cannot keep pace with the growing share of wind energy feed in, which results in bottlenecks. Thus, other technical options to increase dynamic system operation come into focus as well, even though there remains uncertainty, if they can be an alternative to grid extension or if they merely represent an interim solution. Former investigations concerning the assessment of alternative transmission technologies were limited on the comparison of investment costs or environmental impacts against the background of transmission capability. With this dissertation, an abstract method for assessing the eco-efficiency of flexibility measures in power systems is being developed. Therefore, well known practices of ecological and economical assessment are optimised regarding technical backgrounds as well to offer an objective and abstract comparison of the different measures. In doing so, it is emphasised, that only a direct assessment of CO 2 -emissions is necessary for ecological assessment. The investigation of other ecological impacts is part of the project <b>specific</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> and will be respected as a sensitivity by varying the realisation time of the measures. Regarding monetary aspect, it will be shown, that solely costs have to be assessed, which are generated in the balance room by realising a specific measure. The application of the assessment method will be shown for a representative model of a 110 kV network area considering the implementation of overhead line temperature monitoring, the utilisation of a high temperature overhead line conductor (ACCR) and the network extension by realising a new corridor with TACSR high temperature overhead line conductors. It becomes clear that the eco-efficiency is significantly influ-enced by the possible wind energy feed in and by covering consumer loads. Investments show relatively low impacts on the results. To support the objectivity of the given comparison, a sensitivity analysis is obtained for the categories global power-mix, compensation of omitted incomes of wind energy converters, enhancement of generation management, period under observation and realisation time. Against this background, the results of the exemplary investigations for three assessed locations (strong wind, medium wind, low wind) show the highest eco-efficiency for the grid extension...|$|E

The experiences of Transmission System Operators from Netherlands, Italy, France, Austria and Germany are studied in order to generalize and pinpoint the main weaknesses and strengths of current <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Recommendations concerning how to reduce the time needed for <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> are made. The problem of consensus improvement is also analysed. Suggestions for better structuring of the decision process in transmission planning, with high involvement of stakeholders, are made. A systemic approach for speeding up authorization procedures is proposed by combining the country survey and the consensus improvement findings. Actions are defined on different time horizons...|$|R

30|$|The table {{shows that}} in the sector of railway construction, the public display of project {{documents}} is as rare as in procedures according to the Federal Immission Control Act. In road construction, public participation differs from federal state to federal state. In the state of Saxony, 216 public planning permission procedures and 205 planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> took place between 1990 and 2002.15 In the sector of road construction in Rhineland-Palatinate, there were 295 planning permission procedures and only 28 administration-internal planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> between 1994 and 2001 (Ahlborn 2006 : 303). In Thuringia, however, the proportion of planning permission <b>procedures</b> to planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> between 1992 and 2000 was 123 – 381. Generally, there is the tendency that in the Eastern states more road construction projects are approved within the administration only than in the Western states.|$|R

30|$|Formalised public {{participation}} in project <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> is rarely addressed in technology assessment. Empirical data about {{public participation}} processes {{are taken into}} account even more rarely. This article explores the practice of public participation in infrastructure projects in the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of empirical data from the period of 1990 to 2010. The author compares the empirical data about participation processes with the targets of the public participation and asks for the reasons for the lack of participation in formalised <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Furthermore, the author contrasts participation formats used in technology assessment with formalised public participation. In his conclusions, he advocates for a stronger combination of formalised and informal public participation in technology assessment.|$|R
30|$|Even though {{environment}}-relevant <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> are of high {{environment and}} socio-political importance, systematic {{research into the}} actual participation in formalised <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> was carried out only marginally in Germany over the last 20  years (Wende 2001; UfU 1993, 2002). The public debate {{on the effectiveness of}} formalised participation procedures in Germany is conducted without knowledge of the concrete practice of environment-relevant <b>approval</b> <b>procedures.</b> Even though it is important and correct to discuss and develop new formats and designs of participation and to address the question about how to combine formalised participation procedures with informal formats of participation, the current experience with formalised participation procedures should not be ignored (see Dialogics 2011; Bertelsmann-Stiftung 2011). To ensure the necessary blending of formalised participation procedures and informal formats of participation, it is important to research and analyse the practise of the formalised participation as it is now. The relevant questions in this context are how many permission procedures with public participation are taking place, what are the topics objections and comments from citizens or recognised environmental organisations in the context of technology-related permission procedures, and what effects the objections and comments have on the permission process.|$|R

30|$|Amongst the {{planning}} permission procedures, {{there is a}} larger proportion of projects with public participation, as the conditions for ruling out public participation are stricter than in the Federal Immission Control Act. A simpler planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> instead of a public planning permission procedure can take place, if rights of others are not affected or those affected have agreed to the encroachment on their property or another right in written form. 14 The proportion of planning permission procedures with public participation to planning <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> carried out within the administration varies strongly depending on sector and federal state. There are no empirical data for some sectors in which planning permission procedures take place. Thus, only certain sectors can be presented here.
