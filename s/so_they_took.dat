5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
25|$|Ahmir Khalib Thompson {{was born}} in Philadelphia on January 20, 1971. His father was Lee Andrews of Lee Andrews & the Hearts, a 50s doo-wop group. His mother, Jacquelin Thompson, {{together}} with his father, was {{also part of the}} Philadelphia-based soul group Congress Alley. His parents did not want to leave him with babysitters, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> him on tour with them. He grew up in backstages of doo-wop shows. By the age of seven, Thompson began drumming on stage at shows, and by 13, had become a musical director.|$|E
25|$|Near Paw Paw, the {{engineers}} had no good solutions. If {{they followed the}} river, {{they would have to}} cross over to West Virginia to avoid the cliffs, and an agreement with the B railroad was that the canal would avoid {{the south side of the}} river, unless it was a place where the railroad would not need it. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the more expensive decision to build a tunnel through the mountain. The initial cost estimate of $33,500 proved far too low. The tunnel was completed for $616,478.65 Among the components of the project, a kiln was built to provide bricks to line the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|According to a Coonamble {{resident}} who encountered the Kellys at Glenrowan, Ned {{had heard that}} an individual named Sullivan had given evidence, {{and that he had}} travelled by train from Melbourne to Rutherglen. The Kelly gang then followed him there, but was told that he went to Uralla across the border in New South Wales. By the time they got to Uralla, Sullivan had left for Wagga Wagga. They followed him there but lost sight of him. Kelly thought that he might have travelled to Hay, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> off in that direction but later gave up their chase. On their return home, they passed through Jerilderie, and the gang then decided to rob the bank.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

25|$|For {{the opening}} {{attack of the}} Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918, 174 Bde was given the initial {{objective}} of capturing Malard Wood. 6th and 7th Londons led the assault, with 8th Bn in support. The attack proceeded well, but all three battalions became mixed up. After reorganiation on the first objective, the four companies of 7th Bn went forward and captured the ravine behind, and supplies were brought up by supply tank and dropped by aircraft. 173 Brigade {{had been unable to}} take their objective of Chipilly Eidge, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> over the Malard Wood line to launch a second attack. On 9 August the 7th then made a hastily organised attack with tanks and American troops, which successfully cleared Chipilly Ridge and Gressaire Wood. Casualties had been heavy – over two days the 7th lost 300 men – but the results were excellent. After the Battle of Amiens, the battalion was reinforced with men from the Staffords and the Lincolns and began to train intensively for mobile warfare.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stefani and bassist Tony Kanal in Kanal's living room.

500|$|On {{their way}} back to the beach they sighted a German patrol of about seven or eight men coming from the {{direction}} of the houses <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> cover. They were discovered by the patrol's guard dog at about 00:50. The patrol opened fire on them with machine guns and hand grenades. The SSRF managed to disperse the German patrol with return fire and reach the Goatley boat. Captain Lord Howard, who had been left to guard the boat, was wounded trying to re-float the boat, and the others managed to get him aboard. The fight lasted for about 30 minutes. When the German patrol moved forward onto the beach, Lieutenant Hall tried to capture one of the Germans but was himself hit over the head and captured. The SSRF left him behind, presuming he was dead. [...] The men in the Goatley boat had managed to get about [...] out to sea when it was located and engaged by three machine gun posts above the beach. A gun emplacement to the west also starting firing towards them with heavier calibre guns. The combined fire from four positions damaged the boat, which began to sink. The commandos attempted to swim out to the MTB, which by now had also been discovered and was under fire. Unable to locate it in the darkness, they were forced to swim back to the beach. Winter was fired on again when he reached the beach and was captured. He was taken to the German headquarters where he was put into a room with Captain Lord Howard and Desgranges, who had also been captured.|$|E

500|$|RLI patrols were {{intensified}} further {{over the}} following days, with 3 Commando being brought in to assist around Sipolilo. 13 Troop, 3 Commando, under Sergeant Phil Raath, encountered the 10 cadres at a kraal near Bakasa, north of Sipolilo, on 31 January, and killed one; the other nine fled. Later that day a patrol led by Corporal Dennis Croukamp captured Phinias Majuru, the ZIPRA Director of Operations. [...] "It was only a week later after the patrol was over that we learnt who it was we had captured," [...] Croukamp writes. [...] "It was Joshua Nkomo's Chief of Operations. The equivalent of a very senior staff officer, {{he was in the}} country trying to determine why ZIPRA was being so unsuccessful and {{he was on his way}} back with recommendations, clipboard and all." [...] The remaining ZIPRA fighters scattered and escaped the area {{over the following}} week, the Rhodesian Security Forces losing track of each one. On 9 February 1970 local security force presence was reduced to police, one helicopter and one RLI Commando. A member of Gang 3 was arrested by the Portuguese in Mozambique the next day, but without further developments over the next month, Operation Birch shut down on 5 March 1970. Two more members of Gang 4 were detained by police in Mukumbura township on 21 March, and three days later the Portuguese killed one and captured another. The final account for Operation Birch, which had countered the last ZIPRA incursion for six years, was seven cadres killed, thirteen captured and two outstanding. [...] "From 1970 onward, ZAPU played no part in the terrorist war," [...] writes Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. H. Lockley. [...] "They were in a state of disarray following their decisive defeats within Rhodesia, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the opportunity of consolidating their position by sending their terrorists outside the country on extended courses to Russia, Cuba and North Korea. This situation with ZAPU continued until 1976. ... There were no incursions in 1970 worthy of note." ...|$|E
