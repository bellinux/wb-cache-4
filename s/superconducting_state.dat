Using the time-reversal symmetry, we introduce a real structure and define topological numbers of line nodes. Stability of line nodes is ensured by conservation of the topological numbers.

Although the coherence length in the a-b plane is 5 {{times greater than}} that along the c axis it is quite small compared to classic superconductors such as niobium (where ξ ≈ 40nbsp&nm). This modest coherence length means that the <b>superconducting</b> <b>state</b> is more susceptible to local disruptions from interfaces or defects {{on the order of}} a single unit cell, such as the boundary between twinned crystal domains. This sensitivity to small defects complicates fabricating devices with YBCO, and the material is also sensitive to degradation from humidity.|$|E

2500|$|Superconductivity is a {{phenomenon}} of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials, called superconductors, when [...] below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April8, 1911, in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It {{is characterized by the}} Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the <b>superconducting</b> <b>state.</b> The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.|$|E

2500|$|Oxygen {{molecules}} {{have attracted}} attention {{because of the}} relationship between the molecular magnetization and crystal structures, electronic structures, and superconductivity. Oxygen is the only simple diatomic molecule (and one of the few molecules in general) to carry a magnetic moment. This makes solid oxygen particularly interesting, as it is considered a 'spin-controlled' crystal that displays antiferromagnetic magnetic order in the low temperature phases. For papers dealing with the magnetic properties of solid oxygen we refer to magnetisation of condensed oxygen under high pressures and in strong magnetic fields by R.J. Meier, C.J. Schinkel and A. de Visser, [...] J. Phys. C15 (1982) 1015–1024, far infrared absorption dealing with the magnetic excitations or spinwaves in Meier R J, Colpa J H P and Sigg H 1984 J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 17 4501. At very high pressures, solid oxygen changes from an insulating to a metallic state; and at very low temperatures, it even transforms to a <b>superconducting</b> <b>state.</b> Structural investigations of solid oxygen began in the 1920s and, at present, six distinct crystallographic phases are established unambiguously.|$|E

In this work, through analyzing the distinctive electronic structure, and providing systematic classification of the pairing symmetry, {{we find that}} both $s$-and $p$-wave pairing with odd parity give rise to topological <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> in monolayer FeSe, and the exotic properties of $s$-wave topological <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> have close relations with the unique non-symmorphic lattice structure which induces the orbital-momentum locking.

40|$|We present {{analytical}} and numerical studies of pinned <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> of open-ended Josephson ladder arrays, neglecting inductances but taking edge effects into account. Treating the edge effects perturbatively, we find analytical approximations {{for three of}} these <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> [...] the no-vortex, fully-frustrated and single-vortex states [...] as functions of the dc bias current $I$ and the frustration $f$. Bifurcation theory is used to derive formulas for the depinning currents and critical frustrations at which the <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> disappear or lose dynamical stability as $I$ and $f$ are varied. These results are combined to yield a zero-temperature stability diagram of the system with respect to $I$ and $f$. To highlight {{the effects of the}} edges, we compare this dynamical stability diagram to the thermodynamic phase diagram for the infinite system where edges have been neglected.

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of two important theoretical observations on the interplay between l = 2 condensates; d-density wave (ddw), electronic nematic and d-wave <b>superconducting</b> <b>states.</b> (1) There is SO(4) invariance at a transition between the nematic and d-wave <b>superconducting</b> <b>states.</b> The nematic and d-wave pairing operators can be rotated into each other by pseudospin SU(2) generators, which are s-wave pairing and electron density operators. The difference between the current work and the previous O(4) symmetry at a transition between the ddw and d-wave <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> (Nayak 2000 Phys. Rev. B 62 R 6135) is presented. (2) The nematic and ddw operators transform into each other under a unitary transformation. Thus, when a Hamiltonian is invariant under such a transformation, the two states are exactly degenerate. The competition between the nematic and ddw states {{in the presence of}} a degeneracy breaking term is discussed. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figures, updated to the published versio...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} unusual {{persistence}} of superconductivity against high magnetic {{fields in the}} iron chalcogenide film FeTe:O$_{x}$ below ~ 2. 5 K. Instead of saturating like a mean-field behavior with a single order parameter, the measured low-temperature upper critical field increases progressively, suggesting a large supply of <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> accessible via magnetic field or low-energy thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> of finite momenta can be realized within the conventional theory, despite its questionable applicability.

50|$|Superconductivity is {{characterized}} both by perfect conductivity (zero resistance) {{and by the}} expulsion of magnetic fields (the Meissner effect).

The highest temperature under which the <b>superconducting</b> <b>state</b> is seen is known as the critical temperature.

40|$|Based on an {{effective}} 12 -orbital tight-binding model, {{we examine the}} <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> induced by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations for iron-vacancy-ordered A$_{y}$Fe$_{ 2 -x}$Se$_{ 2 }$. It is shown that due to the broken reflection symmetry induced by the iron vacancies, new <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> with $C_{ 4 h}$ symmetry emerge. In particular, we show that in the $C_{ 4 h}$ symmetry, symmetric axes of the pairing momenta {{do not need to}} coincide with axes of the unit cell. As a result, in addition to the magnitude of the pairing gap, the relative orientation of the pairing wave function to the lattice forms another degree of freedom for characterizing the superconducting gap and can further help in gaining the condensation energy. Nonetheless, similar to other iron-based superconductors, the singlet ground state is still dominated by s-wave or d-wave, which are nearly degenerate with anisotropic gaps. Furthermore, s-wave and d-wave <b>superconducting</b> <b>states</b> are separated by a quantum critical point controlled by the Hund's rule coupling $J_{H}$. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
