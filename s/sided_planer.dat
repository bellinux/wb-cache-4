40|$|The optical axes of snow {{crystals}} of the <b>side</b> <b>plane</b> types {{were determined by}} various methods, e. g. under a polarization microscope, from the shapes of etch pits produced on the plane, and from the apparent hexagonal shapes of the planes. As {{a result of the}} determination, it was found that {{there are two kinds of}} {{snow crystals}} in the so-called <b>side</b> <b>plane</b> type; one is a mere spatial assemblage of plates (crossed plates) whose optical axes are vertical to their planes, another is a snow crystal with true <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> which are an extension of one of the prism <b>planes</b> (<b>side</b> <b>planes)</b> of a columnar portion. Generally two <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> extend from two columnar portions respectively, then they form a polycrystal because the columnar portions stretch radially from a single original point. If two columnar portions are in parallel, the resulting snow crystal appears as a single crystal form. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} a specific problem met in woodworking practice by the company K that manufactures door frames made of MDF boards (medium density fi breboards). Visible side surfaces of MDF door frames were lacquered with white polyurethane lacquer. Thirty days after installation, longitudinal surface cracks appeared in the lacquer fi lm on <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> of the door frame. Within the research of the said appearance of cracks, testing was carried out of technical properties and free formaldehyde concentration of the original door frame made of MDF boards by the manufacturer K, MDF boards of the same manufacturer from door frame plant, MDF boards made by the manufacturer H and lacquered experimental MDF boards of both manufacturers. The lacquered surface structure was tested by applying 97 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) on 5 mm thick lattices that were cut out from <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> of experimental and original door frame samples. The action of acid destructed the lacquer final layer, and pigmented base with other additives was scraped off the surface. It was noticed that the lacquer film on the original door frame made of MDF panels by the manufacturer K had no two-component polyurethane clear base, or that it was applied {{in a very small}} quantity. Lacquer film cracking on <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> is the consequence of in-depth cracks in the structure of MDF panels that occur thirty days after lacquering. Experimental boards designated KE, produced by MDF manufacturer K, have an optimum layer of two-component polyurethane clear base, two-component polyurethane white base and two-component polyurethane semi gloss enamel paint. On <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> of these boards no distinctive cracks were observed. In lacquering MDF boards, it is necessary to apply two-component polyurethane clear base on <b>side</b> <b>planes,</b> and to fully protect the door frames with polyurethane films, and not only the visible planes. The use of load bearing MDF boards is necessary in dry conditions - MDF. LA type, and in increased relative humidity, fibreboards are required for general use in humid conditions - MDF.

They used H implantation and subsequent high temperature annealing on ZnO surface to determine the relative surface formation energies and to construct a Wulff plot. Their {{results indicate that the}} six smooth prismatic <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> are (1010), (0110), (1010), (0110), (1100), and (1100), consistent with the reports from B. Liu et al. [19] and W. Zheng et al. [24]. The six smooth prismatic <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> intersect at six < 1210 > directions. Since the etching started {{from the edge of the}} corner of top-end hexagonal surface, the remaining surfaces would be those stable facets for the microrod with zone axis along six < 1210 >. Thus, in Fig.  3 g, g', the 12 tilt surfaces can be divided into six groups belonging to six < 1210 > directions. Again K. S. Chen et al. [23] have reported the surface formation energy of ZnO nanowire with zone axis along [1210]. Their data show that the most stable facets are (1014) and (1014). Therefore, 12 tilt surfaces are the (1014) and (1014) facets of each [1210] directions as zone axis.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a careful}} scrutinization {{of a number}} of microphotographs of snow {{crystals}} taken at Syowa Station, Antarctica during the period from February 1968 to January 1969, considerable data were obtained that the snow crystal of the shape of scalelike <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> grow from sintered frozen cloud particles. And further, based on microphotographs various stages of growth from frozen cloud droplets to snow crystals were seen indicating that the crystal shapes of radiating assemblages of dendrites and radiating assemblages of plates grow from relatively large frozen cloud droplets. In an attempt to obtain supporting evidence, laboratory experiments were conducted and the growth process of snow crystals from frozen droplets were observed using a convection type cold chamber. As a result, the crystal shapes of radiating assemblages of dendrites and radiating assemblages of plates were found to be producible from frozen droplets. How-ever, {{it was very difficult to}} produce the shape of scale 1 ike <b>side</b> <b>planes.</b> As a matter of course, when a frozen droplet is a polycrystal, the crystal grown from the droplet is a polycrystal, for instance, they appear as radiating assemblages of dendrites and plates. When, however, a frozen droplet is a single crystal, the crystals grown from the droplet may become single or polycrystals. In the case of polycrystal growing from the droplet, it was attributed to temperature dependency by which supercooled droplets froze to polycrystals on a single crystal under the conditions of relatively low temperatures. However, considera-tion about the change of size of the frozen droplet with growing the crystal was impossible. 1...|$|R

It will preferably attach to the non-polar facets of the zincite crystal, by cutting off the access of Zn 2 + ions to the sides of the structure, leaving only the polar [001] face exposed to the Zn 2 + ions for further nucleation and growth. Hence, HMTA acts as a non-ionic ligand chelate on the non-polar surface of ZnO nanocrystals on the six prismatic <b>side</b> <b>planes</b> of the wurtzite crystal and induces the growth in the c-axis [38]. Therefore, HMTA acts more like a shape-inducing polymer surfactant rather than just a buffer [38].|$|R

Objective: To determine the postural deficiencies in the static bipedal body alignment and to explore gender differences in students in a private university from Bucaramanga, Colombia. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study {{in a sample of}} 123 college students aged 18 to 29 years old. An expert on posture conducted the postural examination by analyzing seven printed photographs: one posterior, two right side, two left side and two anterior.
