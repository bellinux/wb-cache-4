50|$|Updating systems {{differ in}} the types of program changes that they support. For example, Ksplice only {{supports}} code changes in functions, and does not support changes to state representation. This is because Ksplice primarily targets security changes, rather than general updates. In contrast, Ekiden can update a program to any other program capable of being executed, even one written in a different programming language. Systems designers can extract valuable performance or <b>safety</b> <b>assurances</b> by limiting the scope of updates. For example, any update safety check limits the scope of updates to updates which pass that safety check.
