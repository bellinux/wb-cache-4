50|$|In the past, when {{sandblasting}} {{was performed}} as an open-air job, the worker {{was exposed to}} risk of injury from the flying material and lung damage from inhaling the dust. The silica dust produced in the sandblasting process would cause silicosis after sustained inhalation of the dust. In 1918, the first sandblasting enclosure was built, which protected the worker with a viewing screen, revolved around the workpiece, and used an exhaust fan to draw dust away from the worker's face. Silicosis is still a risk when the operator is not completely isolated from the <b>sandblasting</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
40|$|Modifications to the {{ice holder}} {{component}} of the crushing friction apparatus, to increase its frequency response, were completed. This involved construction of new load cells and an air bearing for the ice holder. Calibration of the load cells was carried out. The final details {{of the construction of}} a <b>sandblasting</b> <b>apparatus</b> for preparing surfaces with controlled roughnesses for ice friction tests were completed.
