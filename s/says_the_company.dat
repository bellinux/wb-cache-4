25|$|In 2008, {{a report}} on the amount of public benefit {{hospitals}} returned to the community, released by the Montana Attorney General's office, said that Benefis ranked eighth out of 11 hospitals in the state.

60|$|My Lords, I will detail these {{circumstances}} no further, but will bring some collateral proofs {{to show that}} Mr. Hastings was at that very time conscious of the wicked and corrupt act he was doing. For, besides this foolish principle of policy, which he gives {{as a reason for}} defying the orders of the Company, and for insulting the country, that had never before seen a woman in that situation, and his declaration to the Company, that their government cannot be supported by private justice, (a favorite maxim, which he holds upon all occasions,) besides these reasons which he gave for his politic injustice, he gives the following. The Company had ordered that 30,000l. should be given to the person appointed. He knew that the Company could never dream of giving this woman 30,000l. a year, and he makes use of that circumstance to justify him in putting her in that place: for he <b>says,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Company,</b> in the distressed state of its affairs, could never mean to give 30,000l. a year for the office which they order to be filled; and accordingly, upon principles of economy, as well as upon principles of prudence, he sees there could be no occasion for giving this salary, and that it will be saved to the Company. But no sooner had he given her the appointment than that appointment became a ground for giving her that money. The moment he had appointed her, he overturns the very principle upon which he had appointed her, and gives the 30,000l. to her, and the officers under her, saving not one shilling to the Company by this infamous measure, which he justified only upon the principle of economy. The 30,000l. was given, the principle of economy vanished, a shocking arrangement was made, and Bengal saw a dancing-girl administering its justice, presiding over all its remaining power, wealth, and influence, exhibiting to the natives of the country their miserable state of degradation, and the miserable dishonor of the English Company in Mr. Hastings's abandonment of all his own pretences.|$|E
