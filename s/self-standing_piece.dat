50|$|Coat rack, coat {{stand or}} a {{hatstand}} is {{an item of}} furniture on which clothes may be hung. A coat rack often refers {{to a set of}} hooks that are attached to a wall and is mainly used to hang coats and jackets. In a kitchen or bathroom environment the coat rack is often used to hang towels. In some cases, a coat rack refers to a <b>self-standing</b> <b>piece</b> of furniture. The self-standing variant is more often referred to as an hatstand and is mostly used to hang coats, jackets, umbrellas and hats.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} cold gas dynamic spraying (or Cold Spray) as a novel {{surface treatment}} technology capable {{not only of}} surface modifications but also being used as bulk creating technology. This is demonstrated on numerous samples where bi-metallic powder feedstock is deposited into bulk, <b>self-standing</b> <b>pieces</b> of material that does not need the support of substrate. Mixtures from the group of Fe, Al, Ti, Ni, Cu {{were used for the}} initial bi-metallic mixtures. The deposited samples were then subjected to annealing at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1100 °C in protective atmosphere and resulting morphologies and microstructures were analysed. Generally materials with high proportion of intermetallic phase content were obtained. These are discussed as potential scaffolds for metal or polymer matrix composites or as hi temperature resistive supports for catalysts with filter functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Learning Objects (LOs) may {{be defined}} in {{multiple}} ways- such as reusable, <b>self-standing</b> <b>pieces</b> of training content. LOs provide the possibility for world-wide brokering of learning content resources. Yet the connotations about the concept of LO are multiple {{and there is a}} lack of means for LO design. A potential approach for modeling LOs from the viewpoint of semiotics has been proposed by Polsani. This paper is focused on the text-based learning content, and analyzes LOs as rhetorical constructs by utilizing the theory of genres. We define a genre-based framework for analyzing LOs, and illustrate it by two examples. The genre-based analysis implies that text-based LOs may not be totally reusable. There are problems on the way the text is constructed to convey meaning; and on the use of diverse technologies and media. These problems may prevent effective use of LOs in Learning Management Systems and in digital form in general...|$|R
40|$|To form ordered replica structures, highly ordered {{colloidal}} crystals {{must be used}} as templates. A {{variety of}} methods exists to produce such templates. [1] Here they were prepared by very slow sedimentation of monodisperse PMMA spheres (synthesized according to literature procedures) [2] with extreme care taken to minimize perturbation. In detail, the colloidal dispersion was stored in a capped crystallization dish until the PMMA spheres had assembled {{at the bottom of}} the dish (ca. 1 month, depending on the thickness of the colloidal crystal). The resulting sediment was opalescent, indicating structural ordering on a bulk scale. Then the cap was removed partially and water was allowed to evaporate at ambient temperature (ca. 1 – 2 weeks). With water evaporation, PMMA spheres tended to pack more closely due to capillary forces and finally formed <b>self-standing</b> monolithic <b>pieces</b> of the colloidal crystal...|$|R
