In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga <b>State</b> <b>School</b> rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom.

In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
