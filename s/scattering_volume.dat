40|$|Isosurface {{extraction}} is {{a standard}} visualization method for scalar volume data and has been subject to research for decades. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no isosurface extraction method exists that directly extracts surfaces from <b>scattered</b> <b>volume</b> data without 3 D mesh generation or reconstruction over a structured grid. We propose a method based on spatial domain partitioning using a kd-tree and an indexing scheme for efcient neighbor search. Our approach consists of a geometry extraction and a rendering step. The geometry extraction step computes points on the isosurface by linearly interpolating between neighboring pairs of samples. The neighbor information is retrieved by partitioning the 3 D domain into cells using a kd-tree. The cells are merely described by their index and bitwise index operations allow for a fast determination of potential neighbors. We use an angle criterion to select appropriate neighbors from the small set of candidates. The output of the geometry step is a point cloud representation of the isosurface. The nal rendering step uses point-based rendering techniques to visualize the point cloud. Our direct isosurface extraction algorithm for <b>scattered</b> <b>volume</b> data produces results of quality close to the results from standard isosurface extraction algorithms for gridded volume data (like marching cubes).

While relatively inexpensive, off the shelf instruments are available to measure Photosynthetically Active Radiation or PAR during the day, efforts to quantify light levels at night have proven more difficult. The goal of this work was to quantify nighttime light levels while simultaneously examining the movement of pelagic animals to explore correlations between light levels and the vertical movement of these animals during crepuscular periods and during the rise and set of the moon. This study explores two hypotheses about the role of light with respect to the vertical migration of animals in water. The first is that at a constant depth, light levels correlate with the <b>scattering</b> <b>volume,</b> or abundance, of animals in the water column. The experiment failed to prove this hypothesis; therefore, it is concluded that light is not a significant predictor of the amount of animal <b>scattering</b> <b>volume</b> at a constant depth.
