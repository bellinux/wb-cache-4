40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) This {{qualitative}} phenomenological study {{explores the}} experience of unforgiveness of extramarital infidelity within a Christian context. Both unforgiveness and infidelity are topics {{in the field of}} psychological research that remain relatively unexplored. Descriptions of the above-mentioned experience were sourced from three participants. In order to extrapolate the essence of their subjective experiences, semi-structured interviews comprised of openended questions were compiled. These interviews were then transcribed and analysed from an interpretive phenomenological analysis. The analysis process resulted in the emergence of themes representing the phenomenon in question. Themes found in this study included those of a difficult emotional experience, loss and grieving, the process of moving from unforgiveness towards forgiveness, and finally, personal growth and spiritual progression. The repercussions experienced by the pressure to forgive also formed {{an integral part of the}} study. This research significantly contributes to the field of research in the manner in which it is focused on the relatively unexplored topic of unforgiveness and infidelity. Attention to the topic of forgiveness has the potential to considerably influence how social <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologist</b> view unforgiveness within psychotherapy as well as within the field of research...|$|E

50|$|Affect is {{considered}} by some social <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> to be a critical building block of feelings and emotions in both conscious and non-conscious states.

40|$|Traditionally, moral {{philosophers}} have {{distinguished between}} doing and allowing harm, and have normally proceeded {{as if this}} bipartite distinction can exhaustively characterize all cases of human conduct involving harm. By contrast, cognitive <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> studying causal judgment have investigated the concept ‘enable’ as distinct from the concept ‘cause’ and other causal terms. Empirical work on ‘enable’ and its employment has generally not focused on cases where human agents enable harm. In this paper, we present new empirical {{evidence to support the}} claim that some important cases in the moral philosophical literature are best viewed as instances of enabling harm rather than doing or allowing harm. We also present evidence that enabling harm is regarded as normatively distinct from doing and allowing harm when it comes to assigning compensatory responsibility. Moral philosophers should be exploring the tripartite distinction between doing harm, allowing harm, and enabling harm, rather than simply the traditional bipartite distinction. Cognitive <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> studying moral judgment, who have so far largely adopted the bipartite distinction in this area of research, should likewise investigate the tripartite distinctio...|$|R

40|$|The {{standards}} for expressions of evaluative opinions in the forensic sciences {{are increasingly being}} challenged and refined. Where once categorical statements regarding the origin of a trace were standard practice, criminalists are now being encouraged to represent the uncertainty associated with their inferential process by using numerical or verbal likelihood ratios. Although there are valid reasons to support this shift, the approach is not without limitations. Decades of psychological research investigating the interpretation and integration of probabilistic expressions, and the equivalence of verbal and numerical formulations for uncertainty, reveals a disconnect between what is intended by experts and what is understood by decision-makers. In this paper we present an indicative review of the psychological evidence to foster communication and collaboration between forensic <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>and</b> reduce instances of miscommunication in our criminal justice system. © 2013 Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural {{approaches}} have become mainstream in economics, {{supported by the}} research of cognitive <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists,</b> yet their findings have attracted little attention from geographers. This article argues for a renewed behavioural economic geography that builds on research in behavioural economics but also addresses one of its main shortcomings: a lack of engagement with the social context of decision-making. I outline a research agenda that bridges the gap between the disciplines in the area of pension decision-making, using the example of choice in UK occupational plans to argue for a mixed methodological approach to meet the challenge of taking context seriously...|$|R

50|$|Virtual Reality offers social <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychologists</b> a {{cost-effective}} tool {{to study and}} replicate interactions in a controlled environment.

Researchers have used the immersion of virtual reality to investigate how digital stimuli can alter human perception, emotion and physiological state, and how digital interaction can enact social change in the physical world.|$|R
