5|$|The {{problem was}} further {{addressed}} in 2014 when Greyhound rolled {{out a new}} yield management computer system. With the new system, Greyhound is now able to more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound <b>still</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it <b>still</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Clemens (Charles Dance) is Fury 161's doctor. When Ripley {{crashes into}} the oil sea, he nurses {{her back to}} health and shows her around. Clemens {{performs}} an autopsy on Newt at Ripley's request, although he is annoyed at not being told why. To gain Ripley's trust, Clemens admits that he got drunk after a long shift as a resident and accidentally killed eleven men being treated after a boiler explosion by misprescribing a painkiller. Sentenced to Fiorina 161, he served his time but remained behind with the other inmates when they refused to leave. Ripley <b>still</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> reveal {{the true nature of}} the events taking place; as Clemens injects her with a serum, the Alien kills him and drags his body away.|$|E
5|$|The bridges along {{westbound}} I-270 over Washington Street {{were replaced}} and {{finished in the}} late 1990s, costing $12million. By the end of 1998, the bridges over Clear Creek near the I-76 interchange were completed. In February 2000, a connection between westbound I-270 and westbound US36 was completed, as was access between I-76 westbound and I-270 westbound. The eastbound section between US36 and I-76, including new bridges over Washington Street and Clear Creek, was completed in March 2002 and totaled $8.5million. Three years later, a flyover ramp was constructed connecting I-25 southbound to I-270 eastbound. However, access between I-270 eastbound and I-76 westbound <b>still</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist.|$|E
5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world <b>still</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E

5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob <b>still</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E
