50|$|HMRC {{have the}} legal right to stop and search any vehicle. As their main duty is to detect 'smuggled' goods (and other far more {{sinister}} imports), they can (and usually do) use their own common sense regarding unconcealed (i.e. openly-carried) goods above their 'limits', if they are happy that the goods are genuinely for personal consumption. Generally, suspicion will only be aroused if the goods start to look less like a 'personal' hoard, and more like a commercial operation. For example: importing more different brands of tobacco products than there are adult travellers in the vehicle arouses particular suspicion, as most smokers tend to remain loyal to one particular brand. However, there have been reported cases of more extreme treatment (especially where people have unnecessarily concealed extra goods in vehicle cavities, <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> etc.), with family cars and contents being confiscated on the spot and the travelers left stranded at Dover in the dead of night. This has led to legal challenges to the powers of HMRC, citing the heavy-handedness and inconsistency of some actions, and their dubious legality under European law.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover or <b>spare</b> tire {{cover is}} an {{accessory}} {{that covers the}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted on external part of a car or van. On 4x4 vehicles the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> is normally rear mounted and is often printed with a dealer's name or something more fun. Covers can be hard shells or soft vinyl covers. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover protects <b>spare</b> tires from the dirt and the sun's harmful UV rays in areas with many days of sunshine. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> covers need to be removed {{once in a while}} and cleaned.|$|R
50|$|The new rear {{suspension}} now occupied {{part of the}} space that {{was used for the}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> and led to the spare tyre being placed on the rear hatch. The RX4 rode higher with increased suspension travel and larger wheels. While these changes provided better ground clearance, the RX4 was offered with 2.0 litre petrol and 1.9 dci diesel engines, both already known from the Mégane. Production of the RX4 ceased in 2003, until the arrival of the Scénic Conquest in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{are often}} fitted {{with only one}} tank, but {{multiple}} tanks are used in a some applications. In passenger car applications, the tank is typically either a cylindrical tank, made from steel, mounted in the boot of the vehicle or a toroidal tank (also steel) or set of permanently interconnected cylinders placed in the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> In commercial vehicle applications, the tanks are generally cylindrical tanks mounted either in the cargo space or on the chassis underneath the body. Increasingly, the tank is an aluminium Conformable Tank, which is lighter, has more capacity and cannot rust.|$|E
5000|$|The Clio RS {{featured}} {{a lot more}} changes than the regular Clio. The engine was again revised and became the F4R 738. The difference between the F4R 738 and F4R 736 was a revised oil breather setup meaning the intake manifold found on a 172 would not fit a 182. Thanks {{to a number of}} other changes this engine produced [...] This increase in power was thanks to the addition of a 4-2-1 Manifold and high flow 200 cell sports catalytic converter. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> was removed and replaced with a flat floor {{to make way for the}} new dual exit exhaust featured on the 182.|$|E
50|$|The Discovery Sport will {{initially}} be sold with alloy wheels {{ranging from}} 18 in to 20 in in diameter. Various emergency <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> options are available depending on vehicle configuration: a full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted internally under {{the floor of}} the trunk, or if the 5+2 seating option is fitted it will be a 'space-saver' <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted {{on the underside of the}} car, directly under the boot. It is not possible to have a factory-fitted tow bar with a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> on 5+2 seat vehicles as they mount in the same place under the vehicle, so a tyre repair system of sealant and a compressor is supplied instead.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the market, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} is available with an under-floor mounted or rear door mounted <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> For example, UK vehicles have the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted under the floor, while in Australia and Argentina the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is mounted on}} the rear door, leaving space for an auxiliary fuel tank, which is desirable in countries where long journeys in isolated areas may be required. The fuel capacity of the dual tank series four is 150 L compared to 179 L of the series three.|$|R

5000|$|Among the {{significant}} structural {{differences between the}} Mark 2 and S-Type are: the reprofiled roof line resulted in the B-pillar being approximately 1" [...] (25.4 mm) lower and the rear window aperture being larger and more upright; the Mark 2's underbody reinforcing rails were extended {{to the rear of}} the car and enclosed, sweeping up and over the space for the rear suspension assembly; the boot floor was double-skinned and ribbed for additional strength; the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> was relocated centrally in the boot floor (it was on the right in the Mark 2); the lid of the new longer boot (trunk) was secured by two catches rather than the single catch of the Mark 2; the 12-gallon (12 imp gal) fuel tank was removed from under the boot floor and replaced by two 7-gallon (approx. 7 imp gal) tanks, one inside each rear wing; new front wings were made to carry the frontal styling changes listed above; new attachment points were made for the new wings and bumpers; and new wheelarches were made to match the new front guards and rear structure.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the second}} paper in a two part series {{presenting}} {{the development of a}} stiffness optimisation algorithm to intelligently optimise the fibre architecture of discontinuous fibre composites. A Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) strategy is used to select parameters associated with the fibre architecture, to produce components that satisfy stiffness, cost and mass criteria. The model has been successfully demonstrated using an automotive <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> geometry, which shows that a highly optimised discontinuous fibre composite solution can compete against a continuous fabric counterpart in terms of specific stiffness, whilst presenting an opportunity for significant cost reduction. This could potentially lead to the application of composite materials into new areas where cost has previously been prohibitive...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in using discontinuous carbon fibre composites for semi-structural applications within the automotive industry. The main advantages of discontinuous fibres are low material costs, low wastage and low touch labour compared with processes using carbon fibre textiles. Directed Carbon Fibre Preforming (DCFP) is an automated process for producing complex 3 D preforms for liquid moulding. DCFP offers the potential for producing highly optimised structures, with local control over tow size, fibre length and volume fraction within the component. The execution of this is challenging however, as confidence in the current library of material properties is low and existing structural optimisation packages only consider a very limited number of design variables, which are restricted to more conventional composite materials. This thesis aims to establish a structural design tool to exploit the design freedom offered by the DCFP process. A large number of parameters associated with the fibre architecture can be controlled to meet a range of design criterions such as performance, weight and cost. The optimisation tool is capable of generating locally varied fibre areal mass and thickness maps that are suitable for manufacture by the robot controlled process. The developed model adopts a multi-scaled finite element approach. Meso-scale simulations are performed to establish size effects in discontinuous fibre composites, to quantify the level of stochastic variability and to determine the representative volume element for a given fibre architecture. A DCFP material database is generated to facilitate macro-scale modelling at the component level. The macro-scale model iteratively redistributes material in order to minimise the total strain energy of the model under prescribed loading conditions. The optimised model is segmented into areas of uniform areal mass, where the zone geometries are tailored to achieve representative material properties according to the meso-scale results, whilst ensuring the design is fit for manufacture. An automotive <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> has been chosen as a demonstrator component, enabling two DCFP architectures to be compared against a continuous glass/carbon fibre NCF design. The first case offers a high performance (high specific stiffness) solution and the second offers a low cost option using high filament count tows. Following optimisation, results suggest that a 3 K 25 mm fibre length DCFP option can achieve a specific stiffness 52...|$|E
