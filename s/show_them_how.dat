Penton claims Rutherford played [...] "hard-fisted church politics" [...] and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using The Watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At {{the heart of his}} opponents' complaints was his [...] "autocratic" [...] behavior as he strove to [...] "exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs." [...] Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish The Finished Mystery—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, [...] "It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord." [...] Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and [...] "did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> contrary their course was to the Society's charter".|$|E

Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramström, the Queen's chamber maid. [...] Through Anna Sofia Ramström, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen. Munck and Ramström were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber.

The next 15 years saw the opening of 30 more chiropractic schools, including John Howard's National School of Chiropractic (now the National University of Health Sciences) that moved to Chicago, Illinois. Each school attempted to develop its own identity, while B.J. Palmer continued to develop the philosophy behind his father's discovery. Fueled by the persistent and provocative advertising of recent chiropractic graduates, local medical communities, who had {{the power of the}} state at their disposal, immediately had them arrested. There were only 12,000 practicing chiropractors with more than 15,000 prosecutions for practicing medicine without a license in the first 30 years. D.D.

Mainline published four titles: the Western Bullseye: Western Scout; the war comic Foxhole, since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics, but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans; In Love, since their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated; and the crime comic Police Trap, which claimed {{to be based on}} genuine accounts by law-enforcement officials.

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the [...] "dialogo" [...] between a group of prominent Miami Cubans, led by Bernardo Benes, and the Cuban government, secret bilateral talks were held in Mexico City in which Cuba agreed to release 2500 political prisoners at the rate of 500 per month and the US agreed to take them. The Cubans released the first tranche and an initial high-profile group, including Polita Grau and Tony Cuesta was moved to the US expeditiously. However, due to bureaucratic hangups about parole quotas, INS scheduling, and name checks it was soon apparent that the US could not process the prisoners fast enough to maintain the release schedule. The Cubans continued to release the prisoners as scheduled but the processing did not keep up mainly due to name check delays. By late August, the US was hopelessly behind in processing the released prisoners, some of whom had married after release. As the non-aligned meeting approached the Cubans threatened to set up a camp for the unprocessed prisoners in front of the Interest Section and drive the delegates to the international meeting past to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> the US lives up to its commitments. [...] Even this threat failed to accelerate the process although the Interests Section staff did all it could. Washington hang ups were slow to resolve but the Cubans did not set up the threatened camp.|$|E

In 1985, Gary Thompson and Pete Jackson rented a real Countach from an up-market Manchester car-rental company and made a glass-fiber mold of it. This mold resulted in a number of UK-based manufacturers producing their own Countach replicas. A few were able to produce remarkably good replicas, including Paul Lawrenson of Prova Cars, Alan Booth of Sienna Cars, Phil Cheetham of Mirage Replicas, and Ken Cook of Brightwheel/Classic Replicas.'Which Kit' said in their March 1988 write-up on the CR6 Stinger; [...] "Brightwheel Replicas CR6 Stinger is unquestionably the best Countach Replica we've driven" [...] Steve Cropley said in [...] "Car" [...] Feb 1989, {{is said to be the}} best available and it does set a high standard, this one will really fool them" [...] Many other praises were made about the Stinger during the time it was made (1988–1989)and all but one of the factory cars went to Japan.(Ken Cook. 2015)At the end of Brightwheel as a company, as the kit and fully built cars only sold in small numbers due to their complexity and build price, the moulds were sold to a company in Dallas.
