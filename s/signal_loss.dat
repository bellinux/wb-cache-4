25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency <b>signal</b> <b>loss</b> due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well).

40|$|When {{telemetry}} data {{is transmitted}} through a communication link, some degradation in telemetry performance occurs {{as a result}} of the imperfect frequency response of the channel. The term telemetry degradation as used here is the increase in received signal power required to offset this filtering. The usual approach to assessing this degradation is to assume that it is equal to the <b>signal</b> power <b>loss</b> in the filtering, which is easily calculated. However, this approach neglects the effects of the nonlinear phase response of the filter, the effect of any reduction of the receiving system noise due to the filter, and intersymbol interference. Here, an exact calculation of the telemetry degradation, which includes all of the above effects, is compared with the <b>signal</b> power <b>loss</b> calculation for RF filtering of NRZ data on a carrier. The <b>signal</b> power <b>loss</b> calculation is found to be a reasonable approximation when the filter follows the point at which the receiving system noise is introduced, especially if the <b>signal</b> power <b>loss</b> is less than 0. 5 dB.

[...] Copper was already in use in telegraph cables and this is the very best conductor available short of using silver. [...] Decreasing R means using more copper and a more expensive cable. [...] Decreasing C would also mean a larger cable (although not necessarily more copper). [...] Increasing G is highly undesirable; while it would reduce distortion, it would at the same time increase the <b>signal</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] Heaviside considered, but rejected, this possibility which left him with the strategy of increasing L as the way to reduce distortion.|$|E
2500|$|Interlace, no {{dependence}} upon sync, and interline reconstruction {{gives the}} AVT modes a better noise resistance {{than any of}} the other SSTV modes. Full frame images can be [...] reconstructed with reduced resolution even if as much as 1/2 of the received signal was lost in a solid block of interference or fade because of the interlace feature. For instance, first the odd lines are sent, then the even lines. If a block of odd lines are lost, the even lines remain, and a reasonable reconstruction of the odd lines can be created by a simple vertical interpolation, resulting in a full frame of lines where the even lines are unaffected, the good odd lines are present, and the bad odd lines have been replaced with an interpolation. This is a significant visual improvement over losing a non-recoverable contiguous block of lines in a non-interlaced transmission mode. Interlace is an optional mode variation, however without it, much of the noise resistance is sacrificed, although the synchronous character of the transmission ensures that intermittent <b>signal</b> <b>loss</b> does not cause loss of the entire image.|$|E

2500|$|Skywave propagation, also {{referred}} to as skip, is any of the modes that rely on reflection (actually refraction) of radio waves from the ionosphere. [...] The ionosphere is [...] a region of the atmosphere from about 60km (37mi) to 500km (310mi) that contains layers of charged particles (ions) which can refract a radio wave back toward the Earth. [...] A radio wave directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon by these layers, allowing long distance radio transmission. The F2 layer is the most important ionospheric layer for long-distance, multiple-hop HF propagation, though F1, E, and D-layers also play significant roles. The D-layer, when present during sunlight periods, causes significant amount of <b>signal</b> <b>loss,</b> as does the E-layer whose maximum usable frequency can rise to 4MHz and above and thus block higher frequency signals from reaching the F2-layer. The layers, or more appropriately [...] "regions", are directly affected by the sun on a daily diurnal cycle, a seasonal cycle and the 11-year sunspot cycle and determine the utility of these modes. During solar maxima, or sunspot highs and peaks, the whole HF range up to 30MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily solar flux 10.7cm radiation values. During solar minima, or minimum sunspot counts down to zero, propagation of frequencies above 15MHz is generally unavailable.|$|E

Order out your men, and come along with me to clear the Bridge again!" [...] Sydow hesitates, haggles; indignant Hoffman, growing loud as thunder, pulls out a pistol, fatal-looking to disobedient Sydow; who calls to his men, or whose men spring out uncalled; and shoot Hoffman down,--send two balls through him, so that he died at 8 that night.
