Our experimental treatments vary market competitiveness and consumers information on social responsibility in production. We show that irrespective of consumers information SR production reduces monopolistic <b>supplier</b> <b>s</b> profit and is therefore unlikely to emerge. With supplier competition, SR production positively influences consumers buying decisions and suppliers offering SR products achieve significantly higher profits, as long their price is not too high. Our results yield valuable insights into the possibilities and limitations of promoting SR production through consumer behavior, and provide evidence for positive effects of competition on moral behavior...|$|R

By outsourcing, a seller loses information about the costs of producing to his supplier. Then the buyer designs the procurement mechanism and sellers who outsourced production subcontract with their respective suppliers. The focal equilibrium might exhibit bilateral outsourcing although outsourcing is modeled to have no direct positive effects. When a seller is able to extract his <b>supplier</b> <b>s</b> rent ex ante, the focal equilibrium exhibits bilateral outsourcing for any distribution of production costs satisfying a regularity condition...|$|R

However, the method of selecting appropriate supplier is not straightforward as it involves number of potential suppliers with diverse criteria.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} a novel query type, the top-K assignment query (αTop-K). Consider {{a set of}} objects P {{and a set of}} <b>suppliers</b> <b>S,</b> where each object pi ∈ P must be assigned to one <b>supplier</b> sj ∈ <b>S.</b> Assume that there is a cost cij associated with every object-supplier pair 〈pi, sj〉. The matching with the smallest total cost would assign each object pi to the supplier sj with the minimum cij value. In many scenarios, however, runner-up assignments may be required too, like for example when a decision maker needs to make additional considerations, not captured by cij values. In this case, it is necessary to examine several short-listed assignments before choosing one. This motivates the αTop-K query, which computes the K best assignments, i. e., those achieving the K smallest total costs. Algorithms for the traditional assignment ranking problem could be adapted to process the query, but thei...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a procurement auction, where each supplier has private costs and submits a stepped supply function. We solve for a Bayesian Nash equilibrium {{and show that}} the equilibrium has a price instability {{in the sense that}} a minor change in a <b>supplier.</b> <b>s</b> cost sometimes result in a major change in the market price. In wholesale electricity markets, we predict that the bid price of the most expensive production unit can change by 1 - 10 % due to price instability. The price instability is reduced when suppliers have more steps in their supply functions for a given production technology. In the limit, as the number of steps increases and the cost uncertainty decreases, the Bayesian equilibrium converges to a pure-strategy NE without price instability, the Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an industry {{where one of}} the manufacturers and its <b>supplier</b> (<b>S)</b> have engaged in some specific investment in the past. We assume that this has three consequences: S has lower expected production costs than other suppliers, supplier-switching costs exist, and the manufacturer may limit its rivals’ access to S. In the case when only S knows its true production costs, we compare alternative mechanisms to induce S to reveal its private information, namely, paying informational rents, using threats of switching suppliers, and most importantly, permitting S to serve other firms. We prove that the presence of asymmetric information mitigates the manufacturer’s incentives to engage in vertical restraints. We derive several policy implications from this result. Adapting to more efficient suppliers, supplier switching costs, sharing suppliers, vertical restraints, asymmetric information...|$|R

40|$|We {{challenge}} {{the view that}} the presence of powerful buyers stiffles suppliers' incentives to innovate. Following Katz (1987), we model buyer power as buyers' ability to substitute away from a given supplier and isolate several effects that support the opposite view, namely that the presence of powerful buyers induces a supplier to invest more in cost reduction. In contrast to negotiations with smaller buyers, the outcome of negotiations with large buyers is fully determined by their more valuable alternative supply option. This increases the <b>supplier.</b> <b>s</b> incentives to reduce marginal costs, both as the supplier receives a larger fraction of the thereby generated incremental profits and as this makes buyers' alternative supply option less valuable. The latter effect is due to downstream competition between buyers and, as we show, is also stronger the larger and thus the more powerful buyers are. Buyer power; Merger; Investment incentives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ever {{since the}} {{emergence}} of the relational database model, the prob-lem of incompleteness has been studied extensively. Declarative semantics for disjunctive databases widely adopt two methodologies representing opposite ends of the spectrum- Minker’s GCWA interprets disjunctions exclusively while Ross and Topor’s DDR interprets them inclusively. We argue that the use of either one as the semantics is limiting. For example, in a blood group relation, saying that the blood group of John is A or B, BG(John,A) ∨ BG(John,B) can be in-terpreted exclusively while the statement <b>supplier</b> <b>S</b> 1 supplies part P 1 or P 2 to project J 1, supplies(S 1, P 1, J 1) ∨ supplies(S 1, P 2, J 1) need not necessarily be exclusive. In this paper, we present a model that allows the nature of the dis-junctions to be represented explicitly and show its relation to other semantics for disjunctive databases. A notable feature of this extension {{is that it does not}} require variables in order to represent indefinite information. ...|$|R

Note that this is a convex increasing monomial function. We address the general setting with R retailers and I intermediaries; the robustness result for the base case can be obtained in the special case when R = 1 and I = 1. The supplier’s profit is: pis,j = ps(qs,j) qs,j − ∫ qs,j 0 (s 1 + s 2 q θ) dq= s 2 θq θ+ 1 s,j θ+ 1 The intermediary’s decision is: max qi,l pi− s 1 + s 2 qi,l +Qi,−l S) θ]] qi,l.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a questionnaire survey sent to a sample of automobile manufacturers in the United States and Japan (including Japanese-managed plants in the United States) during the spring of 1990. The data support observations that Japanese and U.
