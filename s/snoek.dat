5|$|On 22 December 1945, {{three days}} after the start of Suske en Wiske op het eiland Amoras, {{appeared}} the first page of De Familie <b>Snoek</b> (The Family <b>Snoek),</b> a weekly series of gags revolving around a contemporary Flemish family. It lasted for 11 albums.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, two {{publishers}} {{started a}} legal battle {{for the right to}} the names of the newspapers and magazines. Vandersteen, caught in the middle, worked a while for both, but eventually switched to the new owners of De Standaard. He continued to work for Ons Volkske, which was now renamed 't Kapoentje for a few more months. The publishers of De Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske, which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947. By 1947, seven albums were available, and the first ones were already reprinted. The first albums of De Familie <b>Snoek</b> had also appeared by then. Supported by large publicity campaigns, they sold very well: the first <b>Snoek</b> album was in its third impression by 1948. The popularity of Vandersteen, and the impact comics had in Flanders, is attested by the 25,000 readers who switched to the Standaard {{at the same time as}} Vandersteen did.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen had {{to deliver}} a number of pages each week for the {{newspaper}} supplement Pats, increased to 16 pages in 1965. Eduard De Rop revived De Familie <b>Snoek</b> with {{a new series of}} gags for a few years, and other series like Karl May were published here as well. The place of Karl May in the main newspaper was taken by Biggles, yet another realistic series started by Verschuere in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Vandersteen always strived to have success beyond Flanders, {{and reduced}} the {{typically}} Flemish character of his comics soon after his debut. He already worked and published in French during the War, and already in the 1940s he expanded the reach of Suske en Wiske to the Netherlands with some newspaper publications, and to Wallonia and France through the publication in Tintin magazine. All Suske en Wiske albums, and many albums of other series like De Familie <b>Snoek,</b> were also published in French by Erasme. Bessy was even first created for a Walloon newspaper, before being translated in Dutch. By 1978, an estimated 80 million Suske en Wiske albums had been sold in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Willy Vandersteen used a wild {{variety of}} themes and {{influences}} {{in his work}} from early on. He made fairytales, historic series, westerns, but also science fiction and many contemporary comics. While some series like De Familie <b>Snoek</b> and Bessy stuck very close to their origin (an everyday Flemish contemporary family for the former, and a pioneer family in the American Old West in the latter), others were more loose. De Rode Ridder, {{the story of a}} medieval knight, wandered from Arthurian tales over the crusades until the explorations of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, thereby spanning some ten centuries, and later (when Vandersteen was less involved in the series) brought in many elements of sword and sorcery and fantasy.|$|E
25|$|Numerous South African cuisines can {{be traced}} back to Coloured people. It is said that bobotie, <b>snoek</b> based dishes, koeksisters, bredies, Malay roti are staple diets of Coloureds and other South Africans as well. Most dishes are passed down for many generations.|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} {{there was a}} fear that, despite the rationing, food {{supplies}} could run out owing {{to the effects of}} the cold on vegetables, livestock and delivery vehicles. In response, the government started a largely unsuccessful campaign to popularise <b>Snoek,</b> an inexpensive South African variety of fish; the public found the fish unpalatable and its stocks were eventually used as cat food. Many winter root vegetables could not be harvested as they were frozen into the ground, and in some areas pneumatic drills were used to excavate them. Frost destroyed [...] of potatoes and, as a result, potatoes were rationed for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Rationing was {{introduced}} in 1940 {{to cope with the}} shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas, onions and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as dried egg, dried potato, whale meat, the tinned pork product spam, and the [...] "disgusting" [...] imported fish called <b>snoek</b> appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot fudge. The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. The Ministry of Food employed home economists such as Marguerite Patten to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten {{became one of the first}} television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, <b>snoek</b> {{is caught}} and {{consumed}} {{along the west}} and southwestern coastal parts of the country.
