5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two <b>subjects,</b> <b>and</b> are given the option to retake the exams.

Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop.

However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the acquisition of <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> object wh-questions reports different results with respect to how children acquire {{these two types of}} questions. According to several studies, there is an asymmetry between the acquisition of <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> object wh-questions. Although children acquire the syntax of wh-questions very early, object questions are significantly more difficult than subject questions (O’Grady 1997 for an overview, Guasti 2002, a. o.). Stromswold (1995), on the other hand, provides longitudinal data showing that children acquire <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> object questions concurrently. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate early <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> object wh-questions in child Romanian with a view to identifying whether the asymmetry reported for other languages is also attested in Romanian. The longitudinal data investigated reveal that <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> direct object wh-questions emerge concurrently.

The ten tribes were split between the two cousins, and the western half was given to Buzhen while Mishe controlled the eastern tribes. In 685, the sons of Mishe and Buzhen were sent from the Tang capital of Chang'an, where they resided, to succeed their fathers in the west.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Transsexualism is {{a gender}} {{identity}} disorder whose symptomatology could involve cognitive, neurobiological and psychological variance from biological sex standard. Several evidences {{support the hypothesis}} of a structural and functional brain reorganization in transgender subjects, with a different impact for male-to-female <b>and</b> female-to-male (FtM) <b>subjects.</b> Here we used resting-state fMRI to understand {{the similarities between the}} spontaneous brain connectivity of an untreated FtM <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> two male and female control groups. METHODS: Both seed-voxel and atlas-based region-of-interest (ROI) approaches were used. RESULTS: Brain areas sensitive to gender dimorphism like left lingual gyrus and precuneus showed strong similarities between the FtM <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> female control group with respect to control males, with comparable extension and location of functional connectivity maps. ROI analysis confirmed this evidence, highlighting a greater pattern of differences between the FtM <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> males <b>and</b> the FtM <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> females. No difference between seed-voxel results in the FtM <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> females was found. CONCLUSION: These data partially support the idea that untreated FtM transgender shows a functional connectivity profile comparable to female control subjects...|$|R
