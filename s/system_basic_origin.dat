40|$|Recent {{materials}} {{research has}} advanced the maximum ferromagnetic transition temperature in semiconductors containing magnetic elements toward room temperature. Reaching this goal would make information technology applications {{of these materials}} likely. In this article we briefly review the status of work {{over the past five}} years which has attempted to achieve a theoretical understanding of these complex magnetic <b>systems.</b> The <b>basic</b> microscopic <b>origins</b> of ferromagnetism in the (III,Mn) V compounds that have the highest transition temperatures appear to be well understood, and efficient computation methods have been developed which are able to model their magnetic, transport, and optical properties. However many questions remain. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, review, to be published in Curr. Appl. Phy...|$|R

40|$|Properties of {{the logical}} {{reloading}} in the Euclidean geometry are considered. The logical reloading {{is a logical}} operation which replaces one <b>system</b> of <b>basic</b> concepts of a conception by another <b>system</b> of <b>basic</b> concepts of the same conception. The logical reloading does not change propositions of the conception. However, generalizations of the conception are different for different <b>systems</b> of <b>basic</b> concepts. It is conditioned by the fact, that some <b>systems</b> of <b>basic</b> concepts contain not only propositions of the conception, but also some attributes of this conception description.
