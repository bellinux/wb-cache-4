40|$|AbstractA {{hypothetical}} CO 2 {{storage site}} {{that has some}} abandoned wells located near the injection well is considered. Generally, cement plugs are set to cover or isolate porous or productive formations and to isolate usable groundwater from hydrocarbons. When CO 2 is injected into a reservoir, supercritical CO 2 or dissolved CO 2 spreads out in the reservoir. This dissolved CO 2 can react chemically with <b>cement</b> <b>seals</b> (plugs and casing cement) in abandoned wells. As a result, minerals in the <b>cement</b> <b>seals</b> (plugs and casing cement) may alter to form other minerals or mineral phases. The first simulations concerning migration of supercritical CO 2 and dissolved CO 2 in a saline aquifer and a depleted gas field reservoir, were carried out using TOUGH 2. The following temperatures and depths of reservoir were selected: 50 °C at E. L. - 1, 000 m, 60 °C at E. L. - 1, 500 m and 70 °C at E. L. - 2, 000 m.

"Aim. To ascertain if biomimetic phosphoproteins analogues (polyaspartic acid -PAS- and sodium trimetaphosphate -TMP-) improve bonding efficacy and dentine remineralization ability of a novel zinc-doped Portland-based resinous <b>sealing</b> <b>cement.</b> Methodology. Bonding procedures were performed on phosphoric acid etched dentine and several groups were established regarding biomimetic analogue application: 1) No application, 2) PAS-treated dentine and 3) dentine treated with a mixture of PAS and TMP. Raman spectroscopy and microtensile bond strength (MTBS) with fracture analysis by scanning electron microscopy were carried out. MTBS values were compared by ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls and Student t tests (P 0. 05). The novel material bonded without primers application induced bioactive crystal (calcium carbonate and Ettringite) precipitation onto the etched dentine and augmented the degree of crystallinity at the hybrid layer. Mineral to matrix ratio was increased at the hybrid layer of the PAS-treated specimens; this primer was also able to catalyze dentine remineralization, without an increase in crystallinity. Conclusions: PAS application onto demineralized dentine produced an inhibition or delay of the mineral phase crystallization, enhancing the remineralization potential of the Portland microfillers at the resin-dentine bonded interface...|$|E

40|$|A {{reference}} {{design and}} operational {{procedures for the}} disposal of high-level radioactive waste in deep boreholes have been developed and documented. The design and operations are feasible with currently available technology and meet existing safety and anticipated regulatory requirements. Objectives of the reference design include providing a baseline for more detailed technical analyses of system performance and serving {{as a basis for}} comparing design alternatives. Numerous factors suggest that deep borehole disposal of high-level radioactive waste is inherently safe. Several lines of evidence indicate that groundwater at depths of several kilometers in continental crystalline basement rocks has long residence times and low velocity. High salinity fluids have limited potential for vertical flow because of density stratification and prevent colloidal transport of radionuclides. Geochemically reducing conditions in the deep subsurface limit the solubility and enhance the retardation of key radionuclides. A non-technical advantage that the deep borehole concept may offer over a repository concept is that of facilitating incremental construction and loading at multiple perhaps regional locations. The disposal borehole would be drilled to a depth of 5, 000 m using a telescoping design and would be logged and tested prior to waste emplacement. Waste canisters would be constructed of carbon steel, sealed by welds, and connected into canister strings with high-strength connections. Waste canister strings of about 200 m length would be emplaced in the lower 2, 000 m of the fully cased borehole and be separated by bridge and <b>cement</b> plugs. <b>Sealing</b> of {{the upper part of the}} borehole would be done with a series of compacted bentonite <b>seals,</b> <b>cement</b> plugs, <b>cement</b> <b>seals,</b> <b>cement</b> plus crushed rock backfill, and bridge plugs.

This study {{is an attempt to}} find a method that can be used repeatedly with the same mussel individual and which does not affect growth and survival. From 200 mussels, Mytilus edulis, tissue was sampled in different ways, such as drilling a hole in the shell or prising apart the shell valves. Two kind of instruments were used, an injection needle and surgery forceps. Some of the drilled mussels had their holes <b>sealed</b> again with <b>cement.</b> Drilling a hole in the shell, removing tissue sample with surgical forceps and then leaving the holes open did not seriously harm the mussels during the two months the experiment lasted.

For long-term experiments and repeated sampling, opening the mussels by prizing apart the valves is a better alternative than drilling holes in the shells, but depending on the morphology of the species it could be difficult to sample the anterior part of the mussel body. For a short experiment and to sample anterior parts, drilling the shells, leaving the holes open and using surgical forceps, seems to be an acceptable compromise between the different treatments used...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a full-scale grouting {{test in the}} Törnskog Tunnel. The tunnel {{is part of the}} Nordlänken project north of Stockholm, which has two separated tunnel tubes. The test was conducted during production of the tunnel during spring 2005 in chainage from 12012 to 12112. A new concept of grouting was designed and executed based on the grouting material silica sol with the brand name Meyco MP 320. Silica sol has been succesfully tested before in field tests in Hallandåsen 2003 and in Äspö HRL 2004. This test is the first test with silica sol in full production of a tunnel in hard rock. The initiative was taken by the National Road Administration, Oden Anläggningsentreprenad and AB BESAB. Design of the grouting procedure were based on a standard tests for characterisation of the rock mass. With use of a pareto-distribution curve, the hydraulic apertures of the fractures could be computed, further the hydraulic apertures was used to estimate the inflows to the tunnel. The demands set on the allowable leakage into the tunnel resulted that hydraulic apertures down to 14 &# 956;m needed to be <b>sealed.</b> <b>Cement</b> can penetrate and seal apertures down to 0. 05 - 0. 1 mm and therefore it was necessary to use a grout material that has a better penetrability, like silica sol. The grout, named Meyco MP 320, was chosen and the design parameters were established: grout pressure, gel time, grouting time. The desired penetration was 1. 2 m in order to limit unnecessary spread of the grout. The design was different than the traditional grouting methods with demands set on the effective grouting time at a prescribed pressure. All grout fans were carefully monitored using hydraulic tests, before and after grouting as well as control of the actual grouting. Last, the result of the grouting was complemented with a drip characterisation. Two types of grout fans were used. One with the above mentioned grout procedure and one based on the grouting procedure normally used in the Törnskogs Tunnel, but with silica sol instead of cement. The first type fan was used when the rock quality was poor. The other when the rock quality was better. The test with these type fans with silica sol were conducted in one tunnel tube, T 201, the other tube was grouted with cement following the standard procedure used in the project. This enabled a comparison of the sealing effect between the cement grouted tunnel tube and silica sol grouted tube. The results of the grouting showed that 8 out of totally 9 grouting fans were successful. The designed fans were used in five cases were the rock mass were presumed to be of poor quality, that is with larger fracture zones present. The objective for this field test was to limit the inflow of water to tunnel corresponding to value of the transmissivity of 3. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s for the grouted section of 100 m. After grouting the achieved transmissivity was calculated to be 6. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s. The achieved value of the transmissivity is rather close to the desired; the achieved value considers all fans, including the unsuccessful one. No significant conclusion could be made with the comparison of the <b>sealing</b> effect using <b>cement</b> or silica sol as a grouting agent.
