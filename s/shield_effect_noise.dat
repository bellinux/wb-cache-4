40|$|Abstract. The multi-objective design {{exploration}} of the two-dimensional <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> for engine <b>noise</b> using V-tale wing has been performed. Two objective functions are con-sidered as the minimization of the sound pressure level at the side and bottom locations relative to the fuselage, which values are evaluated by using the linearized Euler equation. Two design variables are defined as the wing length and the wing cant angle to set on the fuselage. The response surface method with kriging model is employed as the optimizer to reduce the time required for design exploration. As a result, there is no tradeoff between two objective functions, i. e., the sound pressure level at the side and bottom measuring locations can be reduced, simultaneously. The wing cant angle which is set at nearly 65 deg is most effective to shield the noise. It is justly the necessary condition to reduce the sound pressure level that the wing length becomes long. Moreover, a self-organizing map as a data mining technique obtains the knowledge in the design space regarding {{the correlation between the}} objective functions and the design variables. ...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic noise becomes {{significant}} for high-speed trains but its prediction {{in an industrial}} context is difficult. The flow and aerodynamic noise behaviour of a simplified high-speed train bogie at scale 1 : 10 are studied here through numerical simulations. The bogie is situated in the bogie cavity and cases without and with a fairing are considered, allowing the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of the bogie fairing on sound generation and radiation to be investigated. A two-stage hybrid method combining computational fluid dynamics and acoustic analogy is applied. The near-field unsteady flow is obtained by solving the unsteady three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations numerically using delayed detached-eddy simulation and the data are utilized to predict far-field noise signals based on the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy. Results show that when the bogie is located inside the bogie cavity, the shear layer developed from the cavity leading edge interacts strongly with the flow separated from the bogie upstream components and the cavity wall. Therefore, a highly turbulent flow is generated within the bogie cavity due to flow impingement and recirculation within the cavity. It is found that, for noise calculated from the bogie surface sources of both cases, the directivity exhibits a lateral dipole pattern with dominant radiation in the axial direction. Compared with the no fairing case, the noise level is about 1 dB higher in the bogie symmetry plane along the axle mid-span for the fairing case where a stronger flow interaction is produced around the bogie central region. Moreover, the noise radiated to the trackside is predicted based on a permeable integration surface close to the bogie and parallel to the carbody side wall. The {{results show that the}} bogie fairing is effective in reducing the noise levels in most of the frequency range due to its <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> and a <b>noise</b> reduction around 3 dB is achieved for the current model case by mounting a fairing in the bogie area...|$|R

40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} (NSF) can induce an increased compressive force on piles, called dragload, and additional pile settlement {{caused by the}} downward pull of the soil, called downdrag. To investigate the efficiency of <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> on dragload and downdrag of piles, centrifuge tests {{have been carried out}} to study the shielding mechanisms created by installing sheet piles sleeves around an existing pile in consolidating ground. The <b>effects</b> of various <b>shielded</b> lengths have also been investigated. Comparisons between centrifuge test results and finite-element (FE) analyses are made and discussed. Based on centrifuge tests, {{it is clear that the}} <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> on the dragload decreases only gently with a decrease in the shielded length, whereas the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> on the downdrag decreases exponentially with a decrease in the shielded length. Numerical simulations of the centrifuge model tests on the sleeved center piles reveal that the observed <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> on the center pile are attributed to the stress transfer from the consolidating soft soil to the sheet pile sleeve. As consolidation proceeds, the relatively stiff sheet piles sleeve hangs up the soil, leading to a significant reduction in the vertical and horizontal effective stresses in the soil and in the NSF on the center piles. The deeper the depth, the greater the hang-up <b>effects.</b> Thus, the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> increases with the shielded length of the center pile. The reduction in the NSF on the center piles protected by the sheet pile sleeve is more significant than the reduction in the NSF from the sacrificial piles with the same shielded length.

On the basis of the time-domain simulations, the critical responses of the lifting system in various conditions are studied.

40|$|This thesis has {{as subject}} the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of piles {{on the front}} wall of quay walls. The reason for writing {{this paper is to}} find an answer to the {{difference}} between field measurements and design calculations of stresses and deflections in the front wall of a special type of quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam. The relevance of this issue concerns the optimization of a quay wall with relieving structure to investigate the behavior of this construction and possibly to reduce costs. Focus is on the behavior of prefabricated concrete bearing piles and MV-pile anchors below relieving structures. This thesis has been prepared for obtaining the degree Master of Science in Civil Engineering at the Technical University in Delft. The purpose of this research is to analyze and quantify the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of piles on the front retaining wall of quay walls. From measurements on the extension works for the EKOM quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam it can be concluded that the design calculations and field measurements do not comply. The calculated maximum front wall deflections are higher than the measured values and also the maximum calculated bending moments in the front retaining wall are higher than measured. These findings have been used in the design of a more recent quay wall project in the Amazonehaven by applying bending moment reduction factors for the front retaining wall. This research focusses on how the prefabricated concrete bearing piles and MV-pile anchors contribute to lower deformations and bending moments in the front retaining wall. For this research a literature study is conducted to determine the design aspects of an existing quay wall in the Amazonehaven in the Port of Rotterdam. Furthermore the recommendations of the handbook Quay Walls, design guidelines for horizontally loaded piles, behavior of arc forces in soils and recommendations for shell factors in soils have been studied. For the research an analytical method based on Van IJsseldijk - Loof and Begemann – De Leeuw and also a finite element method (FEM) using Plaxis 2 D have been applied. The results of the analytical method have resulted in an initial input on the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of piles on the front retaining wall of quay walls. The method makes use of simplified models and ground data. Horizontal soil stress reductions near the combi-wall over the Holocene soil layers of 20 % is considered maximum feasible. The method based on FEM is prepared to make a comparison with the analytical method and to use sophisticated models and soil data for more details. The comparison shows that the horizontal soil stress reductions near the combi-wall corresponds well, but that the bending moments and pile wall deflections differ between both methods. The conclusions reached with the FEM method has led to a <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of the piles on the maximum field bending moments in the combi-wall of 13 %. The MV-pile anchors have a small to negligible influence on the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect.</b> As conclusion {{it can be said that}} for the design of quay walls with relieving structures the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of piles on the front retaining wall is part of the design. Reductions of 13 % are achievable according to the FEM analysis. It is advised to design quay walls with relieving structures with FEM. This provides a better picture of how relieving structures work and the <b>shielding</b> <b>effect</b> of piles can be modeled in more detail. It is also recommended to conduct more field research to determine the <b>shielding</b> <b>effects</b> for different quay walls designs.
