40|$|As crowd-sourced {{curation}} of {{news and}} information become the norm, {{it is important to}} understand not only how individuals consume information through <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>Web</b> sites, but also how they contribute to their ranking systems. In the present work, we introduce and make available a new dataset containing the activity logs that recorded all activity for 309 Reddit users for one year. Using this newly collected data, we present findings that highlight the browsing and voting behavior of the study's participants. We find that most users do not read the article that they vote on, and that, in total, 73 % of posts were rated (ie, upvoted or downvoted) without first viewing the content. We also show evidence of cognitive fatigue in the browsing sessions of users that are most likely to vote. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures, 2 table...|$|E
40|$|In {{the massive}} online worlds of social media, users {{frequently}} rely on organizing themselves around specific topics {{of interest to}} find and engage with like-minded people. However, navigating these massive worlds and finding topics of specific interest often proves difficult because the worlds are mostly organized haphazardly, leaving users to find relevant interests {{by word of mouth}} or using a basic search feature. Here, we report on a method using the backbone of a network to create a map of the primary topics of interest in any social network. To demonstrate the method, we build an interest map for the <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>web</b> site reddit and show how such a map could be used to navigate a social media world. Moreover, we analyze the network properties of the reddit social network and find that it has a scale-free, small-world, and modular community structure, much like other online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. We suggest that the integration of interest maps into popular social media platforms will assist users in organizing themselves into more specific interest groups, which will help alleviate the overcrowding effect often observed in large online communities.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{looks at}} {{optimising}} the energy costs for data storage {{when the work}} load is highly skewed by {{a large number of}} accesses from a few popular articles, but whose popularity varies dynamically. A typical example of such a work load is news article access, where the most popular is highly accessed, but which article is most popular keeps changing. The properties of dynamically changing popular content are investigated using a trace drawn from a <b>social</b> <b>news</b> <b>web</b> site. It is shown that a) popular content have a much larger window of interest than non-popular articles. i. e. popular articles typically have a more sustained interest rather than a brief surge of interest. b) popular content are accessed by multiple unrelated users. In contrast, articles whose accesses spread only virally, i. e. from friend to friend, are shown to have a tendency not to be popular. Using this data, we improve upon Popular Data Concentration (PDC), a technique which is used to save energy by spinning down disks that do not contain popular data. PDC requires keeping the data ordered by their popularity, which involves significant amount of data migration, when the most popular articles keep changing. In contrast, our technique, SpinThrift, detects popular data by the proportion of non-viral accesses made, and results in lesser data migration, whilst using a similar amount of energy as PDC.

Digg {{allows users to}} submit links to news stories, as well as vote and comment on other submitted stories. It also enables users to designate other users as friends and {{makes it easy to}} track their activities, thereby creating a social network within Digg. We perform a statistical analysis of a sample of 1000 popular stories on Digg. We explore relationships and correlations between the two main ways of interacting with submissions on the website and we explain that votes (diggs) and comments constitute qualitatively different mechanisms for providing recommendations. Furthermore, we investigate the voting and commenting behavior for different content categories and discover significant differences among them.

Theoretically, <b>social</b> <b>news</b> {{in which people}} help or harm each other and violate rules should {{influence}} both prosocial and violation behaviors. In two experiments, we demonstrated the spreading effects of <b>social</b> <b>news</b> in a <b>social</b> interaction context emphasizing social conventions and a nonsocial interaction context emphasizing moral norms. Across the two studies, {{the results showed that}} positive <b>social</b> <b>news</b> increased cooperation (decreased defection) but had no effect on cheating, whereas negative <b>social</b> <b>news</b> increased cheating but with no change in cooperation (or defection). We conclude that there is a spreading impact of positive <b>social</b> <b>news</b> in the conventional norm domain and of negative <b>social</b> <b>news</b> in the moral norm domain...|$|R
