40|$|The AEC (architecture, {{engineering}} and construction) industry {{is the largest}} industry {{in the world and}} is often described as a laggard industry in adopting new products and processes. Research on this topic has almost exclusively focused on the behavior of firms. This second year CIFE Seed Grant project report presents the research completed to date on the mechanisms that impact the diffusion and implementation of <b>systemic</b> <b>innovations</b> in design and construction networks. Our research focuses primarily on product and process <b>innovations</b> of a <b>systemic</b> nature (i. e., those that require multiple specialist firms to change their process in a coordinated fashion) though we also investigated localized innovations (i. e., those that imply change only within a specific specialty type). <b>Systemic</b> <b>innovations</b> researched include integrated supply chain management, the prefabrication of building systems, and the evolution to 3 D CAD virtual design and construction tools. By gaining insight into the mechanisms that impact the diffusion and implementation of <b>systemic</b> <b>innovations</b> in the AEC industry, we can hope to bridge the innovation gap.

40|$|Although the stylized {{model of}} {{industry}} evolution suggests that firms transform from vertical integration to specialization over time, many industries still exhibit a continued persistence of integrated firms. In exploring this puzzle, I draw on detailed firm-level {{data from the}} semiconductor industry to analyze how integrated incumbents, beyond shifting to the specialized mode, reconfigured {{in the face of}} industry’s vertical disintegration so as to coexist with the specialized firms. I propose and find that the incumbents who persist with vertical integration increase their emphasis on <b>systemic</b> <b>innovations</b> and transact with specialized firms in both upstream and intermediate markets. The value-creating opportunities associated with integrated incumbents’ leveraging (a) their relative superiority in developing <b>systemic</b> <b>innovations</b> and (b) markets to pursue a broader menu of transactional choices may offset their costs of staying integrated. These firm-level factors also determine the pattern of industry’s vertical disintegration and the extent of coexistence between integrated and specialized firms...|$|R

40|$|The main {{conclusion}} of this text is {{that the development of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> in Metropolitan Bilbao is hampered by a fragmented effort. This conclusion is reached by a study of OTRI, Euskoiker, Cluster Conocimiento and BEAZ - four public-private initiatives that are set up to support innovative performance. The aims and efforts made by each initiative are positive, but they lack the necessary resources for making a real impact. Because of the complex context of government and administration in Metropolitan Bilbao, significant results from such initiatives are also hindered by lack of communication and co-ordination. The initiatives come from various directions and are small. Public-private relations are seen as important in the process of achieving <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation,</b> and future policies in Metropolitan Bilbao will need to systemise and co-ordinate the various efforts. This is particularly important in relation to the innovative performance of the Small- to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the area. The first part of the paper sums up existing literature explaining the importance of <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> in relation to economical development. How public-private relations can support innovative performance in SMEs will also be important in this part. Some particular problems that are important to be aware of in the context of Metropolitan Bilbao will also be presented.

40|$|Processes of {{designing}} for <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> {{for sustainable development}} (SD) {{through the lens of}} three long-term case studies are reported. All case studies, which originated from the SLIM (Social Learning for the Integrated Management and Sustainable Use of Water at Catchment Scale) Project, funded within the EU Fifth Framework Program (2001 – 2004), constitute inquiry pathways that are explored using a critical incident approach. The initial starting conditions for each inquiry pathway are compared; significant pathway dependencies are identified which foster the development of social learning processes locally, but constrain their uptake and embedding across the wider system of interest. In the first case study, in England & Wales, promising developments in the application of social learning approaches to river basin planning over an initial 3 -year period were subsequently marginalised, only to resurface {{towards the end of the}} 10 -year period of study. In the second, South African case study, significant spaces for social learning and innovation in integrated water resources management were opened up over a five year period but closed down again, primarily as the result of lack of policy support by national government. The third, Italian, case study was designed to assess options for adapting to climate change by opening up new learning spaces between researchers, stakeholders and policy makers. A case for investing in local level <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> through social-learning praxis design approaches and in learning processes around well contextualised case-studies is supported. However, concomitant investment by policy makers in social learning as an alternative, but complementary, governance mechanism for <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> for SD is needed...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we attempt}} to extend and nuance the debate on {{intellectual}} property (IP) strategy, appropriation, and open innovation in dynamic and <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> contexts. We present the case of four generations of mobile telecommunications systems (covering the period 1980 - 2015), and describe and analyze the co-evolution of strategic IP management and innovation ecosystems. Throughout this development, technologies and technological relationships were governed with different and shifting degrees of formality. Simultaneously, firms differentiated technology accessibility across actors and technologies to benefit from openness and appropriation of innovation. Our analysis shows that the discussion of competitiveness and appropriability needs to be expanded from the focal appropriability regime and complementary assets to {{the larger context of}} the innovation ecosystem and its cooperative and competitive actor relations, with dispersed complementary and substitute assets and technologies. Consequently, the shaping of complementary and substitute appropriability regimes is central when strategizing in dynamic and <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> contexts.

30|$|The {{focus of}} DIS is <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> by {{continuously}} re-thinking highly uncertain and path-dependent developments. It calls for experimentation and cross-fertilization, {{and may be}} hindered among others by incumbent power relations, network structures, and free-riders. Just as responsible innovation (e.g., von Schomberg, 2012, 2013; Stilgoe et al., 2013, Schlaile et al., 2017 b) seeks to involve societal demands and ethical requirements in innovative activities, a dedicated <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> needs to take all relevant actors on board for negotiating goals and solution strategies. This approach, which targets radical transformations of existing institutions and routines, would surely not reach the required high priority on a policy and research agenda if an established research community steered by current politics {{in line with the}} powerful incumbent industries takes the lead – simply because the currently powerful usually have little interest to change anything and run into danger to replace themselves. Therefore, DIS requires besides technological innovation a smart integration of social innovations to increase the extent of positively affected citizens and thereby their willingness to contribute to the transformation in order to overcome the inertia of the oil-based paradigm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an outline to {{this portion of}} the two part special volume on knowledge collaboration and learning for sustainable innovation, which is built upon papers from the ERSCP portion of the joint ERSCP/EMSU conference. This paper briefly reviews the topic of sustainable innovation, based upon the levels of niche, incremental and <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation.</b> A review of the literature on learning, knowledge collaboration and participation shows that niche innovations and <b>systemic</b> <b>innovation</b> typically require so-called ' 2 nd order learning processes', in which tacit knowledge and implicit frames have to be adjusted. This 2 nd order learning process is less needed in case of incremental innovations. Another relevant dimension that appears from the literature is the distinction about whether actors involved in change are active in niches or mainstream. Subsequently, the ten papers in {{this portion of the}} special joint volume are highlighted. They cover a broad range of relevant topics, such as learning in innovation systems, system innovations at the local level, learning and collaboration in knowledge arenas, application of design scenarios and participatory backcasting, involvement of end-users in energy saving and energy efficient refurbishment and collaboration among participants in global sustainability programs. Together, these papers provide an overview of learning, knowledge collaboration and participation for sustainable innovation and consumption. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Specifically we identify a strategic shift among the major players towards more <b>systemic</b> <b>innovations</b> that places the window {{as a part of the}} wider energy system of the house, a trend that isn’t driven by but could be reinforced by the new nanotech opportunities that so far only play a limited strategic role. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{enduring}} {{belief is}} that unleashing low-level members of an organization to explore extensively will broaden the exploration conducted by the entire organization. Using an agent-based simulation model, we show that in multilevel organizations, increased exploration at lower levels can backfire, reducing overall exploration and diminishing performance in environments that require broad search. This result arises when interdependencies cut across the domains of low-level managers. With no cross-departmental interdependencies, more extensive low-level exploration can improve firm performance. Our findings show that careful attention to information processing in multilevel organizations can shed light on whether, and when, decentralization encourages innovation.
