50|$|The {{following}} day on March 13, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio urged {{the residents of}} the region to avoid traveling at any point due to the dangerous conditions and also allowing for sanitation crews to respond faster. The New York City Department of Sanitation said that they had nearly 700 <b>salt</b> <b>spreaders</b> across the boroughs of the state, and 1,600 plows would be dispatched to clear the roadways. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo advised everyone in a statement that “I encourage all New Yorkers in affected regions to plan ahead, and avoid any unnecessary travel as the storm progresses,” and also said to expect disruptions to travel and transportation.A state of emergency was declared in New York City on March 13, in which the subway system will be shut down on March 14.

Luckily it’s not likely to last very long, only a few hours, but during the period of time that it’s coming down it’ll be extraordinarily difficult to drive. So I want to encourage everyone who can take mass transit to please do that.” To also avoid a disaster that had happened the year before where several residents were trapped even after the snow subsided due to plows being unable to access certain roads, several smaller equipment and trucks were bought in order to plow the streets in the aftermath. About 2,300 <b>salt</b> <b>spreaders</b> and plows were prepared to plow the streets as of early February 9.|$|E

40|$|Each winter, Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) {{maintenance}} {{operators are}} responsible for plowing snow off federal and state roads in Iowa. Drivers typically work long shifts under treacherous conditions. In addition to properly navigating the vehicle, drivers are required to operate several plowing mechanisms simultaneously, such as plow controls and <b>salt</b> <b>spreaders.</b> There is little opportunity for practicing these skills in real-world situations. A virtual reality training program would provide operators {{with the opportunity to}} practice these skills under realistic yet safe conditions, as well as provide basic training to novice or less-experienced operators. In order to provide such training to snowplow operators in Iowa, the Iowa DOT purchased a snowplow simulator. The Iowa DOT commissioned a study through Iowa State University designed to (1) assess the use of this simulator as a training tool and (2) examine personality and other characteristics associated with being an experienced snowplow operator. The {{results of this study suggest}} that Iowa DOT operators of all ages and levels of experience enjoyed and seemed to benefit from virtual reality snowplow simulator training. Simulator sickness ratings were relatively low, implying that the simulator is appropriate for training a wide range of Iowa DOT operators. Many reported that simulator training was the most useful aspect of training for them...|$|E
40|$|Although {{important}} answers {{regarding the}} efficient removal {{of snow and}} ice reside {{in the domain of}} good planning and the behavioral sciences, the primary thesis of this paper is that cities can significantly improve their snow and ice removal operations by improving the routing of <b>salt</b> <b>spreader</b> trucks. A dynamic routing heuristic totally different from the static routing in general use was developed. The value of this heuristic was demonstrated to the satisfaction of city officials using a discrete simulation model of a large midwestern city. In addition, the simulator was used to answer questions of salt pile location and equipment configuration and location. Although applied to only one city, this routing heuristic, together with the simulation approach, is of potential value to all city governments that experience snow and ice emergencies. ...|$|R
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, <b>salt</b> <b>spreader</b> or <b>salt</b> truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so {{commonly}} seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn today's highly {{competitive}} global economy enterprise integration (EI) {{can take a}} major role in performance improvement. The more the scope of EI is enlarged, the more users, which are not integration experts, are involved. This fact generates communication problems.

These two points are developed through a cross-analysis of the works related to EI in both the enterprisemodelling and informationsystemdesign fields.

40|$|The DMI is {{delivering}} accurate point forecasts for {{a limited}} number of places (i. e. road stations) along the Danish road network. All these locations are equipped with special measuring instruments which provide a numerical model with initial conditions for the road surface. DMI is developing a system that can make forecasts not only for these selected points but also for the whole road network. This means that instead of delivering forecasts for about 300 points this will be increased to about 17000 points. The motivation to build such a system is a vision of a fully automatic forecast system which in combination with GPS (Global Position System) technology mounted on vehicles can control the <b>salt</b> <b>spreaders.</b> Hence, it can reduce/increase the salt dose to be spreaded based on forecasted weather conditions for specific road stretches. The challenge is to provide the high accuracy of the forecasts to all multiple points. Here, {{a brief description of the}} system is presented and preliminary results of simple road stretch forecasts are shown and compared with measurements of road surface temperature at selected road stretches. These measurements (thermal mapping data) have been done from moving vehicles equipped with GPS and special sensors providing additional local information to high resolution forecasts. Verification of the road stretch forecasts showed a good agreement between observations and forecasts. At the same time it also showed that the quality of observations from moving vehicles is almost comparable to traditional observations at road stations. ...|$|E
40|$|Practices {{in winter}} road {{maintenance}} {{are dependent on}} the climate and weather impacting roads and the road users’ requirements. As in many other fields of transportation, it is of interest to investigate fuel efficiency potentials in the {{different aspects of the}} road maintenance area. The main focus of this thesis was on investigating energy use in winter road maintenance activities in southern Sweden. It is crucial to understand which parameters are of the largest significance in slipperiness, as well as to investigate the weather information that the operations are based on, since the climate is the reason for requiring winter road maintenance in the first place. The original energy use needs to be set, to be able to know whether efficiencies are made. In this thesis, two approaches were taken to understand if existing fuel consumption models for heavy-duty vehicles could be applied within winter road maintenance or whether in-vehicle fuel data such as data from vehicle manufacturers should be used instead. Finally efficiency potentials were explored {{with the use of a}} route optimisation programme for winter road maintenance practices. The climate data analyses showed that frost warnings are the most common type of slipperiness in the southern parts of Sweden. If such warnings were to be under- or overestimated, it could have a large impact on the energy used, since unnecessary slipperiness treatments could be performed. Furthermore, the mobile water depth measurements indicated that it is possible to detect differences in water depth along roads and that exit ramps could be interesting in terms of changed treatments, since the water depths were quite large on those ramps. From the use of the fuel consumption model included in the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, or VTI, winter model, it was concluded that anti-icing would not be energy efficient in terms of traffic energy use, since drivers tend to drive at higher speeds on salted roads. Snow density and amount would however, impact fuel consumption, which is why the removal of snow could save traffic energy use. The best method to evaluate energy use during winter road maintenance was the use of in-vehicle data. The existing fuel consumption model used in this thesis, underestimated the fuel use, which implied that the energy use in winter road maintenance practices depends on other aspects than what was stated in the model calculations. Such other aspects seemed to be the weather and way of work that in turn demand significant changes in speed. Changes in speed was also regarded as a potential efficiency measure, as the velocities of the heavy-duty vehicles seemed on average to be below what was estimated as the most fuel-efficient speed for this type of vehicle. Using the route optimisation programme further put a way for evaluating efficiency potentials. It was shown that installing underground heating systems or road surface–installed <b>salt</b> <b>spreaders</b> at strategic locations could save fuel use, as would changing operations from sanding to salting, as well as adding extra materials depots during the sanding operations. The analysis also indicated that additional materials depots for anti-icing measures would not result in any change in fuel use. The thesis has contributed to finding ways to evaluate energy use and efficiency potentials within the field of winter road maintenance, where the main issues to consider are what energy road maintenance vehicles use and how road maintenance practices are planned. New measuring techniques and improved accuracy in the weather information system can contribute to reducing the use of both vehicles and fuel...|$|E
