The engineering design, installation, and testing practices deemed acceptable to U. S.

40|$|Supercapacitors {{are usually}} low voltage, high {{capacity}} devices with milliohm order equivalent series resistances. They usually have time constants from fractional seconds to seconds. Due to these long time constants, {{compared to the}} time durations of power line transients {{in the range of}} few microseconds to several 100 microseconds, these devices may be able to withstand short duration surges with energy values specified in IEEE C 62 - 41 series and IEC 61400 - 4 - 5 and similar standards. However {{there is little or no}} manufacturer data sheet information on these aspects. The paper provides the details of a test procedure to test the <b>surge</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>capability</b> of supercapacitors.

40|$|The {{household}} appliances in buildings have increased {{rapidly in the}} recent years. However, the <b>surge</b> <b>withstanding</b> <b>capability</b> of these {{household appliances}} has not been increased. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} install surge protection device (SPD) to prevent serious damage of household electrical appliances caused by the in-rushing surges. In order to avoid the oscillation phenomenon, the effective protection distance of SPDs should be addressed before installing SPDs in the buildings. This paper discussed the influence of a group of common household electrical appliances connected in parallel on the effective protection distance of an SPD to a household appliance. The surges impinging on the household appliances connected to a distribution system are analyzed using electromagnetic transient analysis software. It is found that the SPD's protection distance increases when multiple household appliances are connected in parallel. The SPD's effective protection distance for one specific household appliance, which is determined from the case in which only this household appliance is used, is a conservative value; even if other household appliances are connected with this appliance, the SPD still provides an effective protection to this specific appliance.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research {{to assist in}} {{developing}} the technical basis for regulatory guidance on electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio-frequency interference (RFI) immunity and power <b>surge</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>capability</b> (SWC). Previous research has provided recommendations on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design and installation practices, endorsement of EMI/RFI immunity and SWC test criteria and test methods, and determination of ambient electromagnetic conditions at nuclear power plants. These recommendations have been incorporated into the technical basis for guidance in addressing EMI/RFI and power surges in safety-related instrumentation and control (I&C) systems in nuclear power plants. The recommendations by the ORNL staff on test criteria, test methods, and operating envelopes were significantly influenced by the military standards issued by the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD).

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a methodology to assess the possibility of equipment damages in low voltage customers due to lightning surges. The main objective is to incorporate this methodology in a computation system that supports distribution companies to determine the possible causes of equipment damages claimed by customers and to decide whether the claims are to be reimbursed or not. The proposed methodology determines whether a specific customer could be affected by a lightning strike according to his/her location and to the lightning main parameters, by using data from a lightning detection system and from the specific equipment <b>surge</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>capability.</b> A specific study using ATP (Alternative Transients Program) was carried out to assess the propagation of lightning surges in electric power distribution systems and their impact over low voltage customers. On the other hand, the withstand capability of the main household appliances was determined by a series of tests carried out in the Universityâ€™s power quality laboratory. The paper details the modeling used for simulation, such as network configuration, grounding points, and modelling of insulator flashover, distribution transformer, low voltage loads. It also presents some results regarding the evaluation of overvoltages in low voltage customers installations. A practical method is proposed for assessing the possibility of equipment damage and describes how the existing uncertainties were handled. Also, some issues regarding the withstand capability of electric household appliances to lightning surges are discussed and some results of the laboratory tests are presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} presents {{recommendations for}} electromagnetic operating envelopes to augment test criteria and test methods addressing electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio-frequency interference (RFI), and power surges that are applicable to safety-related {{instrumentation and control}} (I and C) systems in nuclear power plants. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was engaged by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research to assist in developing the technical basis for regulatory guidance on EMI/RFI immunity and power <b>surge</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>capability</b> (SWC). Previous research has provided recommendations on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design and installation practices, endorsement of EMI/RFI immunity and SWC test criteria and test methods, and determination of ambient electromagnetic conditions at nuclear power plants. The present research involves development of recommended electromagnetic envelopes that are applicable to nuclear power plant locations where safety-related I and C systems either are or may be installed. These recommended envelopes establish both emissions criteria and the levels of radiated and conducted interference that I and C systems {{should be able to}} withstand without upset or malfunction. The EMI/RFI operating envelopes are derived from conditions in comparable military environments and are confirmed by comparison with the nuclear power plant electromagnetic environment based on measured plant emissions profiles. Detailed information on specific power surge conditions in nuclear power plants is not available, so industrial guidance on representative surge characteristics for susceptibility testing is adopted. An engineering assessment of the power surge environment in nuclear power plants leads to the recommendation of operating envelopes based on location categories and exposure levels defined in IEEE Std C 62. 41 - 1991, IEEE Recommended Practice on Surge Voltages in Low-Voltage AC Power Circuits...|$|E

40|$|The Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPSs) provide {{short term}} power {{back up to}} {{electrical}} loads when the mains power fail. Usually UPSs employ battery packs as the energy storage device. However the limitations of battery packs can affect the UPS performance. As an alternative energy storage device, the supercapacitor (SC) technology is well developed over the past 30 years. Due to recent developments, single cell commercial supercapacitors are available up to about 5000 farads. Over the past 10 years, supercapacitor direct current (DC) voltage ratings have gradually increased to about 2. 7 V/cell. New lithium based supercapacitor families have DC ratings up to 3. 5 V/cell. For the high current applications, the supercapacitors have some advantages over batteries, which are the low effective series resistance (ESR), high power densities and high <b>surge</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>capability.</b> This thesis {{is a continuation of}} the work begun by Kozhiparambil, P. K. on Surge Resistant Uninterrupted Power Supply (SRUPS). The reason for this continual research is due to identify weaknesses in original of SRUPS work with regard to the design of the charger. To reduce the components contain, also achieve common mode transient rejection capability, a flayback mode high current charger with power factor correction has been developed for charging the SC banks. The prototype circuit includes multiple SC banks to transfer the energy from the 240 V, 50 Hz power line to the load maintaining high isolation level. The loads receive continuous and surge free power from the SC banks, and has electrical isolation from the main power line. An IGBT is used as a switch for the flyback charger, which has the advantage of high current capability. The experimental results show the design was valid for the SRUPS and it demonstrated the capability to transfer the energy through a flyback charger with power factor correction...|$|E
