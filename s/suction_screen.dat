Various mathematical models have been developed to derive the drawdown in each chamber and estimating water flow parameters. This thesis derives and proposes a new mathematical model that deals with packers containing asymmetrical chamber lengths. It further tests this formula by implementing in on a particular aquifer of interest and contrasting the numerical findings with those obtained in field testing and simulations as described in a Johnson and Simmon 2007 publication. In order to derive this equation we utilize the principles of superposition, the Taylor series, the Newton Raphson model, and the implementation of an error function. We also draw elements of the Hantush leaky well function and the infinity aquifer simplifications suggested by Zlotnik. The results obtain from this computation demonstrated that this developed hydrologic model yields accurate and rational measurements for drawdown and conductivity. We conclude that our modeled formulas surpass those proposed in the Johnson article, and provides experimenters with a valuable and efficient mathematical tool for aquifer characterization.

40|$|The Savannah River Remediation (SRR) Organization {{requested}} that Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) develop a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method {{to mix and}} blend the miscible contents of the blend tanks to ensure the contents are properly blended before they are transferred from the blend tank; such as, Tank 50 H, to the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) feed tank. The work described here consists of two modeling areas. They are the mixing modeling analysis during miscible liquid blending operation, and the flow pattern analysis during transfer operation of the blended liquid. The transient CFD governing equations consisting of three momentum equations, one mass balance, two turbulence transport equations for kinetic energy and dissipation rate, and one species transport were solved by an iterative technique until the species concentrations of tank fluid were in equilibrium. The steady-state flow solutions for the entire tank fluid were used for flow pattern analysis, for velocity scaling analysis, and the initial conditions for transient blending calculations. A series of the modeling calculations were performed to estimate the blending times for various jet flow conditions, and to investigate {{the impact of the}} cooling coils on the blending time of the tank contents. The modeling results were benchmarked against the pilot scale test results. All of the flow and mixing models were performed with the nozzles installed at the mid-elevation, and parallel to the tank wall. From the CFD modeling calculations, the main results are summarized as follows: (1) The benchmark analyses for the CFD flow velocity and blending models demonstrate their consistency with Engineering Development Laboratory (EDL) and literature test results in terms of local velocity measurements and experimental observations. Thus, an application of the established criterion to SRS full scale tank will provide a better, physically-based estimate of the required mixing time, and elevation of transfer pump for minimum sludge disturbance. (2) An empirical equation for a tank with no cooling coils agrees reasonably with the current modeling results for the dual jet. (3) From the sensitivity study of the cooling coils, {{it was found that the}} tank mixing time for the coiled tank was about two times longer than that of the tank fluid with no coils under the 1 / 10 th scale, while the coiled tank required only 50 % longer than the one without coils under the full scale Tank 50 H. In addition, the time difference is reduced when the pumping U{sub o}d{sub o} value is increased for a given tank. (4) The blending time for T-shape dual jet pump is about 20 % longer than that of 15 {sup o} upward V-shape pump under the 1 / 10 th pilot-scale tank, while the time difference between the two pumps is about 12 % for the full-scale Tank 50 H. These results are consistent with the literature information. (5) A transfer pump with a solid-plate <b>suction</b> <b>screen</b> operating at 130 gpm can be located 9. 5 inches above settled sludge for 2 in screen height in a 85 ft waste tank without disturbing any sludge. Detailed results are summarized in Table 13. Final pump performance calculations were made by using the established CW pump design, and operating conditions to satisfy the two requirements of minimum sludge disturbance, and adequate blending of tank contents. The final calculation results show that the blending times for the coiled and uncoiled tanks coupled with the CW pump design are 159 and 83 minutes, respectively. All the results are provided in Table 16...|$|E

The fillets increased lift coefficient and reduced induced drag without significantly affecting pitching moment.

40|$|Many {{coral reef}} {{communities}} thriving in inshore coastal waters characterised by chronically high natural turbidity (> 5 mg l- 1) {{have adapted to}} low light (10 mg cm- 2 d- 1). Yet, short (hours) acute sediment stress events driven by wind waves, dredging operations involving <b>suction</b> or <b>screening,</b> or shipping activities with vessel wake or propeller disturbance, {{can result in a}} rise in turbidity above the natural background level. Although these may not be lethal to corals given the time frame, there could be a considerable impact on photo-trophic energy production. A novel sediment delivery system was used to quantify the effects of 3 acute sediment resuspension stress events (turbidity = 100, 170, 240 mg l- 1; sedimentation rates = 4, 9, 13 mg cm- 2 h- 1) on 3 inshore turbid water corals common in the Indo-Pacific (Merulina ampliata, Pachyseris speciosa and Platygyra sinensis). Coral photo-physiology response (respiration, net photosynthesis, and maximum quantum yield) was measured immediately after 2 h of exposure. The respiration rate increased (from 0. 72 - 1. 44 to 0. 78 - 1. 76 µmol O 2 cm- 2 h- 1) as the severity of the acute sediment resuspension event increased, whereas the photosynthetic rate declined (from 0. 25 - 0. 41 to - 0. 19 - 0. 25 µmol O 2 cm- 2 h- 1). Merulina was the least tolerant to acute sediment resuspension, with a photosynthesis and respiration ratio (P/R ratio) of 170 mg l- 1, while Platygyra was most tolerant (P/R > 1. 0). Fluorescence yield data suggest that the rapid photo-acclimation ability of Platygyra enabled it to maintain a positive carbon budget during the experiments, illustrating species-specific responses to acute sediment stress events...|$|R
40|$|In the {{unlikely}} event of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in a pressurized water reactor (PWR), break jet impingement would dislodge thermal insulation from nearby piping, {{as well as other}} materials within the containment, such as paint chips, concrete dust, and fire barrier materials. Steam/water flows induced by the break and by the containment sprays would transport debris to the containment floor. Subsequently, debris would likely transport to and accumulate on the <b>suction</b> sump <b>screens</b> of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) pumps, thereby potentially degrading ECCS performance and possibly even failing the ECCS. In 1998, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) initiated a generic study (Generic Safety Issue- 191) to evaluate the potential for the accumulation of LOCA related debris on the PWR sump screen and the consequent loss of ECCS pump net positive suction head (NPSH). Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), supporting the resolution of GSI- 191, was tasked with developing a method for estimating debris transport in PWR containments to estimate the quantity of debris that would accumulate on the sump screen for use in plant specific evaluations. The analytical method proposed by LANL, to predict debris transport within the water that would accumulate on the containment floor, is to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combined with experimental debris transport data to predict debris transport and accumulation on the screen. CFD simulations of actual plant containment designs would provide flow data for a postulated accident in that plant, e. g., three-dimensional patterns of flow velocities and flow turbulence. Small-scale experiments would determine parameters defining the debris transport characteristics for each type of debris. The containment floor transport methodology will merge debris transport characteristics with CFD results to provide a reasonable and conservative estimate of debris transport within the containment floor pool and subsequent accumulation of debris on the sump screen. The complete methodology will, of course, include a means of estimating debris generation, transport to the containment floor, transport to the sump screen, and the resulting loss of NPSH...|$|R
