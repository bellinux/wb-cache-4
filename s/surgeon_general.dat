5|$|Blair House was {{constructed}} in 1824; it is {{the oldest of the}} four structures that comprise the President's Guest House. The original brick house was built as a private home for Joseph Lovell, eighth <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the United States Army. It was acquired in 1836 by Francis Preston Blair, a newspaper publisher and influential advisor to President Andrew Jackson, and remained in his family for the following century.|$|E
50|$|Inspired {{during his}} {{research}} for his thesis, Billings {{recognized the need}} for an index and a catalog of medical periodicals and books. In Billings’ late career, he developed the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Library, which later became the core of the National Library of Medicine. From 1865 to 1873, Billings expanded the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Library from 600 volumes to over 50 000 volumes. During his time as Director of the Library of the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Library, 1865-1895, he was responsible for the creation of both the Index Medicus (33 d.C.) and the Index Catalogue of the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Office (S IV a.C.).|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Nurse Training Act was passed, the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> sent a lengthy {{telegram}} outlining {{the program to}} 1,300 nursing schools in the United States and Puerto Rico. This was followed up with applications and instructions sent by mail. Hawaii's two nursing schools were not eligible for the program {{because they were in}} the war zone; Alaska did not have any nursing schools at the time.|$|E
5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, {{when they learned}} of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Security Administrator was {{required}} by law to appoint an advisory committee for federal nurse training programs. The committee, which was appointed for the Nurse Training Act, consisted of people in nursing and related fields drawn from various parts of the country. Once in place, the committee met with designated federal officials and formulated the regulations necessary to carry out the act. The agreed-upon rules were then approved by the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> and published in the Federal Register. The committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered, but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1905, American author Molly Elliot Seawell sailed for Europe on Kroonland on a {{day when}} six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, {{departed}} New York. In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted both good and bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>Surgeons</b> <b>General</b> are {{notable for}} being outspoken and/or advocating {{controversial}} proposals {{on how to}} reform the U.S. health system.

50|$|Due to the {{prestige}} of the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General’s</b> Medallion, the award is authorized for wear on active duty uniforms of the United States armed forces. When worn on the uniform of a member of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the ribbon is worn after the Public Health Service Meritorious Service Medal and before the Department of Commerce Silver Medal, the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Exemplary Service Medal and the Legion of Merit. Recipients of the <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General's</b> Medallion include RADM Jerrold Michael who was also the youngest person to become an admiral in the PHS at the age of 33.|$|R
5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Cougar Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> Dr. C. Everett Koop, Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to <b>Surgeon</b> <b>General</b> and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E
