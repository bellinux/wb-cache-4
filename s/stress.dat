5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for <b>stress</b> fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior.

The researchers found lesions like those caused by <b>stress</b> fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. <b>Stress</b> fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since <b>stress</b> fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration.

40|$|Distribution of <b>stresses</b> about {{rectangular}} openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly.

Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well.

40|$|Abstract. Residual <b>stresses</b> {{generated}} in milling process affect {{the performance of}} machined components. Milling residual <b>stresses</b> correlate closely with the cutting parameters. In this paper, the generation and distribution of surface residual <b>stresses</b> in milling of aluminum alloy 7050 -T 7451 was investigated. The cutting speed changes from 300 m/min to 3000 m/min. In the experiments, the residual <b>stresses</b> {{on the surface of}} specimen are detected by X-ray diffraction technique. The result shows that compressive residual <b>stresses</b> are generated when cutting speed is under 500 m/min. In feed and its orthogonal direction, the effect of cutting speed and feed rate on residual <b>stresses</b> is similar. The formation of the residual <b>stresses</b> can be explained by thermo-mechanical coupling effects...|$|R
