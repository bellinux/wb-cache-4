25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E

Geharty was also mentioned by a number of those that told the story, but again, there are <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of his statements.

However, from 1926 onwards, most accounts of the massacre usually referred to the archival and newspaper record and noted that there was no evidence for a massacre on the scale of that claimed by Congreve, Beviss or John Chipp Hamp. In 1936, the historian James Dugald Somerville wrote a series of articles in the Port Lincoln Times regarding early settler life on the Eyre Peninsula, in which he concluded that [...] "it is a certainty that the Waterloo Bay 'massacre', as pictured by H.J.C. ,..

The article further asserted that the university's sexual assault policies were severely lacking and that the university administration did not handle sexual assault cases appropriately.

Federal government subsidies {{have long been}} necessary to assure that residents in smaller, less profitable markets {{have access to the}} nation’s transportation network. That access is necessary for a community’s economic health, is arguably a right of all taxpayers and residents, and is in public interest.

And the present political climate raises a <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> federal government’s continued commitment to the nation’s rural air transportation system. This report focuses on the state of passenger air service in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula [U. P. ]. The U. P. is among the most geographically remote areas in the eastern half of the United States. The region’s economic, social, and cultural institutions are increasingly related to a global marketplace. These depend, in varying degrees, on access to the national and global transportation network. Scheduled, commercial passenger air service is especially critical for this area too distant from passenger rail, without adequate commercial bus service, with few four-lane highways and very limited connection to the Interstate Highway system...|$|R

In the past few decades, we have found many advance developments in wireless networks. With these developments and large number of applications that are being provided by MANETs, we still face some challenges that have to be overcome. The baseless and active nature of these networks demand new set of networking schemes that should be implemented to provide effective peer-to-peer communication. MANETs hire traditional TCP/IP structure to provide this peer-to-peer communication between nodes in the network. An important interesting research area in MANET is “Routing”. This Routing is not only a very challenging task but also has received a rattling amount of attention from researches. Because of lack of a defined central authority, security of the routing process becomes a challenging task thereby leaving MANETs vulnerable to attempt, which results in declension in the performance as well as raises a <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dependability of these such networks.
