5|$|From 11 to 14 February 1945, the Yalta Conference {{took place}} in the neighbouring, former {{imperial}} Livadia Palace; this was between representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill and part}} of his British delegation were given temporary residence within the Vorontsov Palace. Within two weeks, construction workers had restored 22 rooms in the main palace, 23 rooms in the Shuvalov wing, and even replanted the palace gardens. The palace's English-inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself: Churchill was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> by the garden's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin if he could take them home; Stalin declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
25|$|As Rebbe, Rabbi Aharon {{was said}} to be {{incredibly}} charismatic.

25|$|In January 1916, Stieglitz {{was shown}} a {{portfolio}} of charcoal drawings by a young artist named Georgia O'Keeffe. Stieglitz was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> by her art that without meeting O'Keeffe or even getting her permission to show her works he made plans to exhibit her work at 291. The first that O'Keeffe heard {{about any of this}} was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year. She finally met Stieglitz after going to 291 and chastising him for showing her work without her permission.|$|E
25|$|In Paris, Bowles {{became a}} part of Gertrude Stein's {{literary}} and artistic circle. On her advice, he made his first visit to Tangier with Aaron Copland in the summer of 1931. They took a house on the Mountain above Tangier Bay. Bowles later made Morocco his full-time home, and it inspired many of his short stories. From there he returned to Berlin, where he met British writers Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood. (Isherwood was reportedly <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with him that he named a character Sally Bowles in his novel after him.) The next year, Bowles returned to North Africa, traveling throughout other parts of Morocco, the Sahara, Algeria, and Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|The work of Lautréamont {{was equally}} {{influential}} at this time. This doomed poet's Les Chants de Maldoror became {{the seminal work}} for the Parisian Surrealists of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite {{to the extent that}} he learnt it by heart. The poetry of Lautréamont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and D'Annunzio similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through Symbolist imagery.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson was intimately {{involved}} in the university to the end, hosting Sunday dinners at his Monticello home for faculty and students until his death. <b>So</b> <b>taken</b> with the import of what he viewed the university's foundations and potential to be, and counting it amongst his greatest accomplishments, Jefferson insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his national accomplishments, such as the Louisiana Purchase and any other aspects of his presidency, in favor of his role with the young university.|$|E
25|$|He quickly {{began to}} make his mark in the fashion industry, with Alice Pollock's {{exclusive}} boutique Quorum featuring his designs in 1966. Clark had been introduced to Pollock at his RCA show by Quorum's backer {{at the behest of}} Hockney and <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with the young designer was she that she immediately decided to bring him in as co designer for Quorum. Ossie presented a collection of white and cream chiffon garments that sold fast. Pollock wanted Clark's clothes to have a more organic feel and so commissioned Celia Birtwell to produce special textiles for the next collection. In this way, one of fashions most famous collaborations was born: with Ossie Clark designing clothes and Celia Birtwell designing prints.|$|E
25|$|The mortal Lutin arrives. He {{is just as}} enchanted {{with the}} fairies as Sir Ethais and Sir Phyllon were in Act I, and they are {{similarly}} impressed with him. Lutin is <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with Fairyland that he calls it Paradise and assumes he must be dead. The fairies explain the situation, and they all vie for his attention, saying that they prefer his rugged appearance to men that are handsome. Zayda persuades all the other fairies to find food for Lutin. When they have left, she tells him {{that all of the}} other fairies have faults, and that she is the only fairy worthy of his esteem. When the other fairies return, they ask Lutin if he has a wife. He replies that he is married down below, but is a bachelor in Fairyland, which offends Zayda.|$|E

25|$|The {{village is}} named after the 6th century Irish Christian missionary Saint Buriana (also {{sometimes}} called Beriana, Buriena, or Beriena). The local legend describes how, whilst ministering to the local inhabitants from the oratory that stood {{on the site of}} the current church, Saint Buriana was abducted by the local king, Geraint (or Gereint) of Dumnonia. Saint Piran, patron saint of Cornwall and also a fellow missionary, negotiated for her release, but the reticent Geraint agreed only on the caveat that he be awoken by a cuckoo calling across the snow, something which would be highly unlikely in mid-winter. The legend states that Saint Piran prayed through the night whilst the snow fell, and in the morning Geraint was awoken by a cuckoo's song. He was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> aback by the miracle that he honoured his pledge, however, shortly afterwards he changed his mind and tried to recapture Buriana. Buriana is said to have died as Geraint tried to re-imprison her, and was purportedly buried on the site of her chapel.|$|E
500|$|Once completed, {{the palace}} was visited by {{many members of}} the Russian Empire's elite ruling class; a great number of these vastly wealthy nobles were <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with the palace and its seaboard site that they were moved to create their own summer retreats in the Crimea. By the early 20th century [...] not only many aristocrats, but also members of the Imperial Family, {{including}} the Tsar himself, had palaces in an assortment of architectural styles in the vicinity.|$|E

He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for {{literature}} and gambling. Peter asked for Olga's hand in marriage the following year, a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise: [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> aback that all I could say was 'thank you'," [...] she later explained.|$|E

500|$|The {{distinctive}} {{style of}} the animation legend Tex Avery influenced the show's artistic look. [...] Like Avery, Povermire employed geometric shapes to build both the characters and the background. The style developed almost accidentally, with Povenmire's first sketch of title character, Phineas Flynn, which he produced while eating dinner {{with his family in}} a restaurant in South Pasadena, California. He doodled a triangle-shaped child on the butcher paper covering the table. He was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and as the stylistic blueprint for the entire show.|$|E

Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!'

500|$|... a. [...] Cambridge (on the Surrey side) had {{initially}} {{gone into a}} clear lead, so that they were entitled to take Oxford's water on the Middlesex side. When the boats came up to Crabtree Tavern, Cambridge made for the Surrey side just as Oxford were about to overhaul them. Oxford refused to give way and the two boats collided. After a close fought race, Cambridge crossed the line first. Umpire Fellows called a foul citing the rule in the code of rowing laws governing collisions after one boat has taken the others' water: [...] "if they come into contact by the leading boat's departing from the water <b>so</b> <b>taken,</b> the leading boat shall be deemed to have committed a foul".|$|E
500|$|His {{notion of}} the unity of all mankind that appealed to {{everyone}} was very congruous with Sufi Islam. [...] "God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family," [...] writes Sikand. [...] "This belief was entirely in keeping with ... the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation." [...] Sai Baba urged his Hindu followers to read their holy books and find their own path. For him, all paths were equally valid, [...] "Ishwar" [...] (the Hindu God) and [...] "Allah" [...] being synonymous. People coming to his abode were <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many in-stances it changed their entire lives and belief systems.|$|E

The music video for [...] "Dammit" [...] was directed by Darren Doane and Ken Daurio, who also directed the band's first clip for [...] "M+M's" [...] in 1995. Doane allowed the musicians to improvise during the shoot. Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge were <b>so</b> <b>taken</b> with the way DeVoe portrayed his character they requested Doane work his character into more screen time.
