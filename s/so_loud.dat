The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E
5|$|<b>So</b> <b>loud</b> was {{the cheering}} that {{followed}} this address that the proas fell silent, the Dayaks apparently unnerved. In the morning however the 20 canoes were still offshore and, with the anticipated rescue overdue and supplies running low, a desperate plan {{was made to}} use the ship's boats to board and capture enough Dayak vessels to enable the entire crew to reach Batavia. However, while these plans were being formed the British East India Company's (EIC) armed brig Ternate appeared on the southern horizon.|$|E

Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, {{equalised}} in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick.

Regarding the title, Cornell said, [...] "It's sort of making fun of heavy metal bravado. Metal bands would say Louder Than Thunder or something. <b>So</b> <b>Louder</b> Than Love, what is Louder Than Love?" [...] Thayil said that the band really wanted to call the album Louder Than Fuck.|$|R

5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (<b>so</b> <b>loud,</b> it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

25|$|It's a Wonderful Life won {{just the}} one Academy Award, in the Technical Achievement {{category}} for developing a new method of creating artificial snow. Before It's a Wonderful Life, fake movie snow was mostly made from cornflakes painted white. And it was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> when stepped on that any snow-filled scenes with dialogue had to be re-dubbed afterwards. RKO studio's head of special effects, Russell Sherman, developed a new compound, utilizing water, soap flakes, foamite and sugar.|$|E
25|$|Although no Screamers {{are ever}} seen in the book, they are heard - their scream is <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> as {{to be able to}} deafen and daze people far away from it. They are also the primary method of alarm for {{sleeping}} Myrmidons - only a Screamer can wake a Myrmidon quickly. They do not travel in groups.

A band, there to play for a show of Ford Motor Company cars outside, began playing Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here and There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight. The celebration was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> that it was most likely heard by the second jury waiting inside.|$|E

However, it was unclear which color the smoke was for over an hour; some of the {{cardinals}} had personally deposited their notes and tally sheets in the stove, causing black smoke after white had already appeared. Pericle Felici, as the ranking Cardinal Deacon, then stepped onto the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered the Habemus Papam announcement in Latin, declaring Luciani's election. John Paul I then appeared on the balcony; shortly after his withdrawal, the crowd's applause remained <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> that he was compelled to appear again.|$|E

25|$|Long Way to the Top was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) six-part {{documentary}} {{on the history of}} Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. Episode 3: Billy Killed the Fish, broadcast on 29 August, featured interviews with Loyde, Michael Chugg (Thorpe's manager / promoter) and Thorpe. They described their Sunbury festival experiences and the development of pub rock in Australia. According to Chugg, an Aztec performance at Sydney's Bondi Lifesaver club in 1974 was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> as to kill a tankful of tropical fish in an upstairs area–hence the episode title. During August 2002, promoters Chugg and Kevin Jacobsen with Thorpe as co-producer, organised a related concert tour, Long Way to the Top. Concerts included Thorpe performing with the 'original' Aztecs line-up in one set and the 'Sunbury' Aztecs in a second. Performances at two Sydney concerts in September were recorded, broadcast on ABC-TV and subsequently released on DVD in December.|$|E

[...] The noise was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E
