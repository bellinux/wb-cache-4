40|$|We {{introduce}} a new cosmological diagnostic pair r,s called Statefinder. The Statefinder is dimensionless and, like the Hubble and deceleration parameters H(z) and q(z), is constructed from the scale factor of the Universe and its derivatives only. The parameter r(z) forms {{the next step in}} the hierarchy of geometrical cosmological parameters used to study the Universe after H and q, while the parameter s(z) is a linear combination of q and r chosen in such a way that it does not depend upon the dark energy density Ω_X(z). The Statefinder pair r,s is algebraically related to the the dark energy pressure-to-energy ratio w=p/ϵ and its time derivative, and sheds light on the nature of dark energy/quintessence. Its properties allow to usefully differentiate between different forms of dark energy with constant and variable w, including a cosmological constant (w = - 1). The Statefinder pair can be determined to very good accuracy from a <b>SNAP</b> <b>type</b> experiment. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures.

The hypothesis of ‘Dark energy ’ (cosmological constant, scalar field tracker potentials, braneworld models, etc.) has been advanced to explain this phenomenon.

40|$|A {{design study}} is {{currently}} in progress for a third generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector called Einstein Telescope (ET). An important kind of source for ET will be the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars (BNS) up to z ∼ 2. If BNS mergers are the progenitors of short-hard γ-ray bursts, then some fraction {{of them will be}} seen both electromagnetically and through GW, so that the luminosity distance and the redshift of the source can be determined separately. An important property of these `standard sirens' is that they are self-calibrating: the luminosity distance can be inferred directly from the GW signal, with no need for a cosmic distance ladder. Thus, standard sirens will provide a powerful independent check of the ΛCDM model. In previous work, estimates were made of how well ET would be able to measure a subset of the cosmological parameters (such as the dark energy parameter w_ 0) it will have access to, assuming that the others had been determined to great accuracy by alternative means. Here we perform a more careful analysis by explicitly using the potential Planck CMB data as prior information for these other parameters. We find that ET will be able to constrain w_ 0 and w_a with accuracies Δ w_ 0 = 0. 099 and Δ w_a = 0. 302, respectively.

Snap beans {{are thought to be}} derived predominantly from dry beans of the Andean genepool and to be of a recent European origin; however, the existence of Mesoamerican genepool characteristics especially in traditional indeterminate growth habit snap beans indicates a wider origin. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate genetic diversity within a set of 120 indeterminate (pole <b>type)</b> <b>snap</b> beans and 7 control genotypes representing each genepool using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat or microsatellite (SSR) markers. The genotypes were predominantly from Asia, Europe and the United States but included some varieties from Latin America and Africa. AFLP polymorphism ranged from 53. 2 to 67. 7 % while SSR polymorphism averaged 95. 3 % for the 32 fluorescent and 11 non-fluorescent markers evaluated and total expected heterozygosity was higher for SSR markers (0. 521) than for AFLP markers (0. 209). Both marker systems grouped the genotypes into two genepools with Andean and Mesoamerican controls, respectively, with the Mesoamerican group being predominant in terms of the number of genotypes assigned to this genepool. Phaseolin alleles were not tightly associated with genepool assignment indicating that introgression of this locus had occurred between the genepools, especially with phaseolin “S” in the Andean group (23. 5 %) and phaseolins “T” and “C” in the Mesoamerican group (12. 2 and 8. 2 %, respectively).

D. specifications for shock, vibration. and acceleration test are reported. The simulated levels {{were based on the}} anticipated environments of the Vega (J. P. L.) and WS 117 L (L. M. S. D.) systems. All four generators exhibited the same characteristic behavior pattern throughout the vibration portion of the test prograna, showing a d-c ripple in the generator output only in the Y place. This behavior of the generator is attributed to the oscillatory change in internal resistance resulting from vibratory elastic deformation of the thermoelectric elements. This produces a transient in the electrical output with a resultant reduction in generator efficiency. The maximum reduction in efficiency was noted in the 700 cps region. A resonance on the generator shell at 1845 cps was noted, but generator electrical output and efficiency were not affected. Upon discontinuance of the induced vibration, the generators returned to normal operating conditions. While undergoing shock test, a d-c transient was noted at the time of impact, resulting in a slight decrease in effi ciency. The generators immediately returned to their normal operating efficiency. In the acceleration portion of the test no d-c transient was evident in any of the three planes, therefore the generator efficiency remained constant. Steady state conditions were re-established at the start of each new test phase (i. e., changing planes of excitation, changing from shock to vibration, etc.). Thus, any variation from pretest efficiency was attributed to the external load resistance becoming umnatched due to the change in internal resistance. The important result is that complete generator recovery was consistent in all cases and normal operation continued The generator, shell, internal structure and pressure, and the hot and cold junction temperature were not affected during the test. As a result of this test program, it was concluded that the Snap III thermoelectric generator will operate reliably in the enviromnents associated with the Vega and WS 117 L vehicles. (auth...|$|R
40|$|ATP and its {{metabolites}} {{are important}} for taste signaling in taste buds, and thus a clearance system for them would play critical roles in maintenance of gustatory function. A previous report revealed that mRNAs for ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase (NT 5 E) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) were expressed by taste cells of taste buds, and NT 5 E-immunoreactivity was detected in taste cells. However, there was no information on PAP-immunoreactivity in taste buds. In this study, we examined the expression profile of PAP in rat taste buds. In the isolated rat taste buds, we detected expression of mRNA for PAP, but NT 5 E was not detected differing from the case of mouse ones (Dando et al., 2012, J Neuroscience). On immunohistochemical analysis, PAP-immunoreactivity was found predominantly in NTPDase 2 -positive <b>type</b> I and <b>SNAP</b> 25 -positive <b>type</b> III taste cells, while there were no apparent signals of it in PLC-β 2 -positive type II, α-gustducin-positive type II, AADC-positive type III and 5 HT-positive type III ones.

These findings suggest that PAP expressed by type I and one of type III taste cells of rats may contribute to metabolic regulation of the extracellular levels of adenine nucleotides in the taste buds of circumvallate papillae, and the regulating mechanisms for adenine nucleotides in taste buds might be different between rats and mice...|$|R

Specific details on the SNAP mission can be found in Aldering et al. (2004, 2005). The primary goal of the SNAP supernova program is to provide a dataset which gives tight constraints on parameters which characterize the dark-energy, e. g. w{sub 0 } and w{sub a} where w(a) = w{sub 0 } + w{sub a}(1 -a). SNAP data {{can also be used to}} directly test and discriminate among specific dark energy models. We will do so by building the Hubble diagram of high-redshift supernovae, the same methodology used in the original discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe that established the existence of dark energy (Perlmutter et al. 1998; Garnavich et al. 1998; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). The SNAP SN Ia program focuses on minimizing the systematic floor of the supernova method through the use of characterized supernovae that can be sorted into subsets based on subtle signatures of heterogeneity. Subsets may be defined based on host-galaxy morphology, spectral-feature strength and velocity, early-time behavior, inter alia. Independent cosmological analysis of each subset of ''like'' supernovae can be compared to give confidence that the results are free from significant systematics. Conversely, analysis between supernova subsets at the same redshift can identify further systematics controls. While theories of the supernova progenitor and explosion mechanism can guide the establishment of subset criteria, such understanding is not required [...] only comprehensive measurements are [...] for robustness of the cosmological results. The level of robustness is tied to the quality of data with which supernovae are distinguished.
