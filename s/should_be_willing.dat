Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that {{the interpretation of the}} creation story is difficult, and remarks that we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to change our mind about it as new information comes up.|$|E
25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E
25|$|In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote The Literal Meaning of Genesis {{in which}} he argued that Genesis should be {{interpreted}} as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to change their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in studying Indonesian as a foreign language ismastering the verb structure. This {{is due to the}} complexity of its affixation. A good and well-formed verb will ensure a good, formal, and acceptable sentence; on the contrary, a lack of affixe where it <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> <b>will</b> give a non-grammatical sentence. Indonesian verbs have two structures: simple and derived verbs...|$|R
500|$|In December, Vilsack {{embarked}} on a campaign tour beginning {{in his hometown of}} Pittsburgh. While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism. He also discussed his policy on the Iraq War, advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: [...] "It's their country, it's their future and they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to fight for it and they certainly <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to die for it." [...] He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the UNP {{struggled}} {{to deal with}} the rising force of the Sinhala-nationalist Sri Lanka Freedom Party. [...] Jayewardene pushed the party to accommodate nationalism and endorse the Sinhala Only Act, which was bitterly opposed by the island's minorities. [...] Throughout the 1960s Jayewardene clashed over this issue with party leader Dudley Senanayake. Jayewardene saw how skilfully the SLFP had played the ethnic card, and felt the UNP <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to do the same, even if it meant losing the support of ethnic minorities.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1950s Los Angeles, Sergeant Edmund [...] "Ed" [...] Exley, son of {{the legendary}} LAPD detective Preston Exley, is {{determined}} {{to live up to}} his father's reputation. His intelligence, insistence on following regulations, and cold demeanor contribute to his isolation from other officers. He exacerbates this resentment by volunteering to testify in the Bloody Christmas case against his fellow officers in exchange for a promotion to Detective Lieutenant. This goes against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith, who states that a detective <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to shoot a guilty man in the back for the greater good. Exley's ambition is fueled by the murder of his father, killed by an unknown assailant, whom Exley nicknames [...] "Rollo Tomasi".|$|E
2500|$|Thaddeus of Rome {{taught that}} Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (also known as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego) {{delivered}} {{themselves to the}} Fiery Furnace to sanctify the Divine Name in [...] because they deduced from [...] that the frogs of the plague, which had not been commanded to sanctify the Divine Name, nonetheless jumped into hot ovens at God's behest. So Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah reasoned that people, whom [...] does command to sanctify the Divine Name, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to bear hot ovens for that reason. Thaddeus of Rome deduced that the ovens into which the frogs jumped were hot from {{the proximity of the}} words [...] "ovens" [...] and [...] "kneading troughs" [...] in [...] reasoning that kneading troughs are found near ovens when ovens are hot.|$|E

2500|$|Russia {{has said}} it {{believes}} Iran {{has a right to}} enrich uranium on its soil. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested that there could be work toward an international nuclear fuel bank instead of indigenous Iranian enrichment, while Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, has said [...] "the United States <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to discuss what Iran describes as its 'right to enrich'... provided that Iran accepts both limits on its enrichment program (no HEU) and enhanced safeguards". Officials of the Iranian government and members of the Iranian public believe Iran should be developing its peaceful nuclear industry. A March 2008 poll of 30 nations found moderate support for allowing Iran to produce nuclear fuel for electricity alongside a full program of UN inspections.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1944 French forces {{continued}} to advance {{as part of the}} American armies, but during the Ardennes Offensive there was a dispute over Eisenhower's order to French troops to evacuate Strasbourg, which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack. Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in Alsace and Lorraine, and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that [...] "Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad". At a cabinet meeting he said that the French <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to die there alone if the [...] US pulled out its own troops. Churchill backed the French, and Eisenhower was so impressed with the French resolve that he eventually left his own troops in the city even at the risk of being cut off, for which de Gaulle expressed his extreme gratitude.|$|E

The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest of us <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E

2500|$|Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward {{met with}} three {{southern}} representatives {{to discuss the}} peaceful reconstruction of the Union and the Confederacy on February 3, 1865 in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The southern delegation included Confederate vice-president, Alexander H. Stephens, John A. Campbell, and Robert M. T. Hunter. The southerners proposed the Union recognition of the Confederacy, a joint Union-Confederate attack on Mexico to oust dictator Maximillian, and an alternative subordinate status of servitude for blacks rather than slavery. Lincoln flatly rejected recognition of the Confederacy, {{and said that the}} slaves covered by his Emancipation Proclamation would not be re-enslaved. He said that the Union States were about to pass the Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery. Lincoln urged the governor of Georgia to remove Confederate troops and [...] "ratify this Constitutional Amendment prospectively, so as to take effect—say in five years... Slavery is doomed." [...] Lincoln also urged compensated emancipation for the slaves as he thought the North <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to share the costs of freedom. Although the meeting was cordial, the parties did not settle on agreements.|$|E
