5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as <b>special</b> <b>paper</b> money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
25|$|In the post-communist period, {{there has}} been a switch in the {{material}} used for banknotes and coins. Banknotes have switched from <b>special</b> <b>paper</b> to special plastic, while coins switched from aluminum to more common coin alloys (probably partly due to technical limitations of coin-operated vending machines). The transition has been gradual for both, but much faster for the banknotes which are currently all made of plastic. There has been a period in which all banknotes were made of plastic and all coins were made of aluminum, a very distinctive combination.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 28 {{overhead}} gantries {{were set up}} along {{the boundaries of the}} RZ, including the areas surrounding Orchard Road. These gantries were monitored by auxiliary police officers who carried out visual checks and recorded any violations. Fines were usually S$70 and for obvious traffic management reasons, licences were not sold at the control points of the RZ. Users had to buy, in advance, a <b>special</b> <b>paper</b> licence at a cost of S$3 per day, which was sold at post offices, petrol stations, area licence sales booths or convenience stores, on a monthly or daily basis. This licence was displayed on the car windscreen or on the handle bars for motorcycles during hours of operation. Initially, they were 7.30 am to 9.30 am daily, except on Sundays and public holidays. However, it soon had to be extended to 10.15 am, to control the surge of vehicles waiting to enter just after 9.30 am. In 1989, the evening peak had to be restricted too, and in 1994, the ALS was extended from 7.30 am to 6.30 pm.|$|E
500|$|In {{the face}} of the devastation of {{smallpox}}, various smallpox gods and goddesses have been worshipped throughout parts of the Old World, for example in China and in India. In China, the smallpox goddess was referred to as T’ou-Shen Niang-Niang. Chinese believers actively worked to appease the goddess and pray for her mercy, by such measures as referring to smallpox pustules as [...] "beautiful flowers" [...] as a euphemism intended to avert offending the goddess, for example (the Chinese word for smallpox is 天花, literally [...] "heaven flower"). In a related New Year's Eve custom it was prescribed that the children of the house wear ugly masks while sleeping, so as to conceal any beauty and thereby avoid attracting the goddess, who would be passing through sometime that night. If a case of smallpox did occur, shrines would be set up in the homes of the victims, to be worshipped and offered to as the disease ran its course. If the victim recovered, the shrines were removed and carried away in a <b>special</b> <b>paper</b> chair or boat for burning. If the patient did not recover, the shrine was destroyed and cursed, so as to expel the goddess from the house.|$|E

He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at the Bournemouth Majestic Hotel (replacing future The Police guitarist Andy Summers, who had gone off to London with Zoot Money). At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxemburg where he heard the last moments of [...] "A Day in the Life".

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{its first}} year, the {{magazine}} changed its name for La Ilustración del Pacífico (Pacific Ocean Illustration). In the first issue of its second year, the editors wrote about all the issues they had to endure in the first year, and explained that they changed names because they were aimed for a broader audience since they were promised a lot of help and contributions when they first appeared, but none of that materialized and eventually the lost several sponsors due to the increasing costs generated by the economic crisis the country was undergoing at the time. The magazine was also criticized for its report about archbishop Ricardo Casanova y Estrada return -given the Positivism that ruled over the intellectuals at the time- and for publishing the financial situation of the country in 1897, which scared their readers. [...] The economic crisis affected the publisher as well, as the paper costs increased and some <b>special</b> <b>paper</b> needed for the photographs was heavily taxed by the government. [...] In spite of all these problems, they decided to continue because the magazine was used abroad to portray what was happening in Guatemala. [...] Ramón A. Salazar, a well known Guatemalan writer and politician, was the new editor in chief.|$|E
