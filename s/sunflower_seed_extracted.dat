40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of dietary dilution sources and levels on feather damage, performance, feeding behavior, and litter condition in rearing pullets. It was hypothesized that dietary dilution increases feeding-related behavior and improves feather condition, particularly if insoluble nonstarch polysaccharides are used as the dilution source. In total, 864 Lohmann Brown 1 -d-old non-beak-trimmed pullets were used until 18 wk of age. Four dietary treatments, a control diet without any dilution (R_ 0 %), 7. 5 % diluted diet with <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> extract/oat hulls (R_ 7. 5 %), 15 % diluted diet with <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> (R_ 15 %_S), and 15 % diluted diet with oat hulls (R_ 15 %_O), with 6 replicates (1 replicate is a pen with 36 pullets) per treatment were used. On 4 -wk intervals, behavioral parameters, including eating time, feather pecking, feather condition, and general behavior were evaluated. Pullets fed the control diet showed increased feather, comb, and wire pecking compared with pullets fed diluted diets. The level of feather damage decreased with increasing dietary dilution level. Pullets receiving R_ 15 %_S and R_ 15 %_O showed more feeding-related behavior than the pullets on R_ 7. 5 % and R_ 0 %. Oat hulls were more effective in preventing feather damage than <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>extract.</b> Pullets did not fully compensate their feed intake if fed a dietary dilution, resulting in a proportionally reduced available ME intake. The R_ 15 %_O pullets had 2. 9 % lower average BW gain compared with those fed R_ 0 %. Average eating duration increased by 12. 8, 33. 2, and 42. 1 % in R_ 7. 5 %, R_ 15 %_S, and R_ 15 %_O fed pullets, respectively, compared with R_ 0 %, whereas eating rate [feed intake (g) /pullet per eating min] was decreased in R_ 15 %_S and R_ 15 %_O pullets. Relative weights of empty gizzards were 3. 95, 10. 30, and 62. 72 % greater in R_ 7. 5 %, R_ 15 %_S, and R_ 15 %_O pullets compared with pullets fed R_ 0 %. It was concluded that dietary dilution affected time budgets of the pullets, as shown by more feeding-related behavior, resulting in less feather pecking behavior. Based on our results, application of this feeding strategy could improve production and welfare in pullets...|$|R
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity and}} phenolic compound profiles of six fractions (I-VI) obtained from <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> were studied.

In the three methods, the aqueous extract at 30 mu g/ml showed a higher antioxidant capacity value (FRAP, 45. 27 mu mol; DPPH, 50. 18 %; ORAC, 1. 5 Trolox equivalents) than the ethanolic extract (FRAP, 32. 17 mu mol; DPPH, 15. 21 %; ORAC, 0. 50 Trolox equivalents).

40|$|Seed storage {{proteins}} {{are both}} {{an important source}} of nutrition for humans and essential for seedling establishment. Interestingly, unusual napin-type 2 S seed storage albumin precursors in sunflowers contain a sequence that is released as a macrocyclic peptide during post-translational processing. The mechanism by which such peptides emerge from linear precursor proteins has received increased attention; however, the structural characterization of intact precursor proteins has been limited. Here, we report the 3 D NMR structure of the Helianthus annuus PawS 1 (preproalbumin with sunflower trypsin inhibitor- 1) and provide new insights into the processing of this remarkable dual-destiny protein. In seeds, PawS 1 is matured by asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) into the cyclic peptide SFTI- 1 (sunflower trypsin inhibitor- 1) and a heterodimeric 2 S albumin. The structure of PawS 1 revealed that SFTI- 1 and the albumin are independently folded into well-defined domains separated by a flexible linker. PawS 1 was cleaved in vitro with recombinant sunflower HaAEP 1 and in situ using a <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> in a way that resembled the expected in vivo cleavages. Recombinant HaAEP 1 cleaved PawS 1 at multiple positions, and in situ, its flexible linker was removed, yielding fully mature heterodimeric albumin. Liberation and cyclization of SFTI- 1, however, was inefficient, suggesting that specific seed conditions or components may be required for in vivo biosynthesis of SFTI- 1. In summary, this study has revealed the 3 D structure of a macrocyclic precursor protein and provided important mechanistic insights into the maturation of sunflower proalbumins into an albumin and a macrocyclic peptide...|$|R

SE exhibited higher <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> oil yield (42. 5 %) {{as compared with}} the CP (21. 4 %). There were significant variation observed in saponification value, iodine value and color, whereas, density, refractive index and unsaponifiable matter (%w/w) did not differ between sunflower oils produced by both the methods. The cold pressed (CP) sunflower oil had relatively good oxidation state than the Soxhelt extracted (SE) oil. The fatty acids profile of SE and CP oils showed considerable variation for the contents of palmitic, oleic and arachidic acids while the amount of the principal fatty acid (linoleic acid 61. 26 and 60. 12 g/ 100 g FA) was almost similar for both the oils.

40|$|In this paper, the {{distribution}} of sterol compounds has been analyzed in 10 samples of new <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> with high contents of phytosterols. The <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> were first <b>extracted</b> with hexane and the residual oil was then extracted {{with a mixture of}} chloroform: methanol (2 : 1). Also, the lipids from the defatted seeds and from the total seeds were analyzed after acid hydrolysis and subsequent extraction. The evaluation of the sterol compounds was performed by high temperature GC directly in the sylanized unsaponifiable matter using ¿-cholestanol as internal standard. This procedure allows for the quantification of free sterols and steryl glycosides in the oils extracted by hexane and chloroform: methanol (2 : 1) while in defatted meal and total seeds, they are determined as free sterols. The main characteristics of the fractions extracted by hexane were a variable oil content (19. 8 - 38. 7 %) with medium unsaponifiable matter (1. 4 - 4. 8 %), The major sterol compounds in the oil extracted by hexane were free sterols (4034 - 8507 mg/kg) while steryl glycosides were in low concentrations (80 - 280 mg/kg). On the contrary, the fraction extracted by chloroform: methanol had low lipid content (2. 2 - 6 - 7 %) with a high unsaponifiable matter (12. 6 ¿ 28. 2 %).

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This study {{provides}} an overview of the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry, globally and locally. This overview is, followed by measurements of the comparative and competitive advantages of the South African and Argentinean <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industries. Two indexes are used to calculate the comparative and competitive advantages namely the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index. The results show that South African <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> has a competitive advantage in their primary form, however the value added <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products show a competitive disadvantage which is opposite to that of Argentina’s <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products. The finding that South Africa is only competitive in the primary <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> market was calculated by means of trade data. Factors that affect the competitiveness of the sunflower industry were identified to indicate why value added <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products experience a competitive disadvantage. In the analysis {{it was found that the}} South African sunflower industry is price driven. Since price plays an important role in the competitiveness of the industry, imports of cheaper sunflower crude and refined oils are considered to pose a major threat to the industry. Crushing margins has increased over the last few years due to higher sunflower oil and sunflower oilcake prices. In order to increase the competitiveness of the South African <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry, it needs to; be more cost competitive; improve quality; launch new products; invest in new technologies and improve the innovativeness. Emphasis should be placed on the value added seed products as this is where South Africa has a competitive disadvantage.
