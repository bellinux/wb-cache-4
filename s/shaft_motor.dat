The points in which we make the estimations are chosen based on several criteria and the fallowing parameters are measured: airspeed, time-to-climb, altitude and the horizontal distance.

40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow <b>shaft</b> <b>motor.</b> As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, shroud, inner drum, and hollow shaft, swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation. The swirl speed was large enough to cause a significant pressure drop. The {{flow straightener}} consists of vanes on {{the back side of the}} shroud plate. These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the inner drum in such a way as to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the flow straightener and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the flow straightener...|$|E

It is gear driven off the timing chain, and therefore a new timing chain cover was designed for these balanced 4.3L V6s.
