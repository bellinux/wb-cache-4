40|$|Due {{to limited}} {{information}} in site investigation, {{it is not}} possible to obtain the actual values for the mean, standard deviation, and scale of fluctuation of a soil property of interest. The deviation between the estimated values and actual values is called the statistical uncertainty. There are two <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> on how to model the statistical uncertainty: frequentist thought and Bayesian <b>thought.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to discuss their philosophical difference, to show how to quantify the statistical uncertainty based on these two distinct <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> and to compare their performances. For the frequentist <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> the confidence interval will be used to quantify the statistical uncertainty, whereas the posterior probability distribution will be used for the Bayesian <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> Examples will be presented to compare the performances <b>of</b> these two <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> in terms <b>of</b> their consistencies. The results show that in general the Bayesian <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> performs better in terms of consistency.

5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E
