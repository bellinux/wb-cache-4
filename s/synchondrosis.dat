5000|$|Where the {{connecting}} medium is hyaline cartilage, a cartilaginous joint is termed a <b>synchondrosis.</b> An {{example of a}} <b>synchondrosis</b> joint is the first sternocostal joint (where the first rib meets the manubrium). In this example, the rib articulates with the manubrium via the costal cartilage. (The rest of the sternocostal joints are synovial plane joints.) ...|$|E
50|$|The xiphisternal joint (or xiphisternal <b>synchondrosis)</b> is a {{location}} {{near the bottom}} of the sternum, where the body of the sternum and the xiphoid process meet. It is structurally classified as a <b>synchondrosis,</b> and functionally classified as a synarthrosis. This joint can remain until the middle years of life, but usually ossifies to form a synostosis between the two sternal elements.|$|E

50|$|There {{are common}} {{pathophysiological}} ways {{that a person}} may develop coccydynia. The two main causes for this condition are sudden impact due to fall, and coccydynia caused by childbirth pressure in women. Other ways that coccydynia develops are partial dislocation of the sacrococcygeal <b>synchondrosis</b> that can possibly result in abnormal movement of the coccyx from excessive sitting, and repetitive trauma of the surrounding ligaments and muscles, resulting in inflammation of tissues and pain.|$|E
50|$|The costochondral joints are {{the joints}} between the ribs and costal {{cartilage}} {{in the front}} of the rib cage. They are hyaline cartilaginous joints (i.e. <b>synchondrosis).</b> Each rib has a depression shaped like a cup that the costal cartilage articulates with. There is normally no movement at these joints. Joints between costal cartilages of the sixth and ninth rib are plane synovial joints. Articulation between costal cartilage of the ninth rib and tenth rib is fibrous.|$|E
50|$|He {{developed}} a maxillofacial triangle {{for analysis of}} cephlometric radiograph, where he selected spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> as a midcranial landmark due to it being last suture to fuse in the skull. He {{was one of the}} first to point out the relationship between the lower incisors and the mandibular plane angle, a concept which was later adopted by Dr Charles H. Tweed. Although he was first to say that, in orthodontics not every case has to be finished at angle of 90 degrees between lower incisors and mandibular plane angle.|$|E
5000|$|The four sacral {{vertebrae}} are only partially fused: {{the first two}} are solidly fused, the third is locked in place by rib-like processes (a [...] <b>synchondrosis),</b> while the fourth has a caudal (tail-like) morphology including two ventral chevron processes. The fusion between S1 and S2 distinguished Qaisracetus from other protocetids such as Protocetus, Rodhocetus, Gaviacetus, Natchitochia, and Georgiacetus. Qaisracetus vertebrae are not dense and thick like in Eocetus. [...] In contrast to Qaisracetus, Rodhocetus has a sacrum where non of the vertebrae have fused centra, which is derived to be a protocetid, but Rodhocetus is primitive in retaining pleurapophyseal connections between all {{sacral vertebrae}}. The sacral morphology of Rodhocetus and Qaisracetus indicate protocetids represent {{a wide range of}} specializations, although which is ancestral to later whales is unclear.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between the closure stage of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> and the maturational stage of the cervical vertebrae (CVM) in growing and young adult subjects using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). CBCT images with an extended field of view obtained from 315 participants (148 females and 167 males; mean age 15. 6 ± 7. 3 years; range 6 to 23 years) were analyzed. The fusion status of the <b>synchondrosis</b> was determined using a five-stage scoring system; the vertebral maturational status was evaluated using a six-stage stratification (CVM method). Ordinal regression was used to study the ability of the <b>synchondrosis</b> stage to predict the vertebral maturation stage. Vertebrae and <b>synchondrosis</b> had a strong significant correlation (r = 0. 89) that essential was similar for females (r = 0. 88) and males (r = 0. 89). CVM stage could be accurately predicted from <b>synchondrosis</b> stage by ordinal regression models. Prediction equations of the vertebral stage using <b>synchondrosis</b> stage, sex and biological age as predictors were developed. Thus this investigation demonstrated that the stage of spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis,</b> as determined in CBCT images, is a reasonable indicator of growth maturation...|$|E

40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in FGFR 3 cause achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia, {{the most common}} human skeletal dysplasias. In these disorders, spinal canal and foramen magnum stenosis can cause serious neurologic complications. Here, we provide evidence that FGFR 3 and MAPK signaling in chondrocytes promote <b>synchondrosis</b> closure and fusion of ossification centers. We observed premature <b>synchondrosis</b> closure in the spine and cranial base in human cases of homozygous achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia {{as well as in}} mouse models of achondroplasia. In both species, premature <b>synchondrosis</b> closure was associated with increased bone formation. Chondrocyte-specific activation of Fgfr 3 in mice induced premature <b>synchondrosis</b> closure and enhanced osteoblast differentiation around synchondroses. FGF signaling in chondrocytes increases Bmp ligand mRNA expression and decreases Bmp antagonist mRNA expression in a MAPK-dependent manner, suggesting a role for Bmp signaling in the increased bone formation. The enhanced bone formation would accelerate the fusion of ossification centers and limit the endochondral bone growth. Spinal canal and foramen magnum stenosis in heterozygous achondroplasia patients, therefore, may occur through premature <b>synchondrosis</b> closure. If this is the case, then any growth-promoting treatment for these complications of achondroplasia must precede the timing of the <b>synchondrosis</b> closure...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> does not show bony displacement in response to rapid maxillary expansion (RME) therapy in youngsters. Materials and Methods: A total of 16 computed tomography (CT) records were taken from 8 growing patients (2 males and 6 females), before (TO) and after (T 1) treatment with RME. All patients had been diagnosed originally with transverse maxillary deficiency. The mean chronological age of the patients was 9. 8 +/- 1. 8 years (range, 8 to 11. 4 years). High-resolution multislice multidetector CT was used to study quantitatively {{the extent of the}} opening of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> following RME. A low-dose CT scan protocol was used (80 kV, 10 mA) and the data file of each patient was transferred to a workstation where the anteroposterior width of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> was measured on axial images. Results: Before treatment with RME (TO), the anteroposterior mean width of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> was 1. 73 +/- 0. 46 mm immediately after the active phase of expansion (T 1), and the width of the <b>synchondrosis</b> increased to 2. 30 +/- 0. 47. This difference was statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon signed rank test (P <. 05). Conclusion: Rapid maxillary expansion leads to a small immediate widening of the sphenooccipital <b>synchondrosis</b> in youngsters. (Angle Orthod. 2010; 80 : 106 - 110. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>synchondrosis</b> {{between the}} sixth and seventh costal {{cartilage}} is usually used for the base frame in autogenous ear reconstruction. If the <b>synchondrosis</b> is loose, a variety of modifications can be devised. This report introduces new methods for these problems. In cases of incomplete <b>synchondrosis,</b> only {{the surface of the}} base block margin was smoothly tapered without carving for the removal of the conchal deepening. The secure fixation of the two segments (helix and antihelix) to the base block using fine wire sutures gave stability to the unstable basal frame. After confirming that all the segments were assembled in one stable piece, the remaining conchal deepening of the basal framework was removed, and the outer lower portion of the basal cartilage was trimmed along its whole length. A total of 10 consecutive patients with microtia, ranging from 8 to 13 years old, were treated from 2008 to 2009. The follow-up period was 6 months to 2 years. Despite incomplete <b>synchondrosis,</b> the stable frameworks were constructed using the authors' method and aesthetically acceptable results were achieved.

40|$|AIM: The spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> is an {{important}} growth centre of the craniofacial skeleton. It is infl uential on the position of both the maxilla and mandible. During the post-natal period, endochondral ossifi cation of the <b>synchondrosis</b> contributes largely {{to the expansion of}} the ossifi cation centres and growth of the cranial base. Endochondral ossifi cation {{plays a major role in}} bone formation, which can be traced by the expression of stage specifi c markers. Core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa 1) is a key transcription factor and known to be associated with chondrocyte maturation and osteoblast differentiation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a regulator of vascularization, and its maximum level of expression precedes the maximum level of new bone formation during endochondral ossifi cation in the long bone and the condyle. The factors governing growth of the <b>synchondrosis</b> are not fully elucidated. Whether growth of <b>synchondrosis</b> can be affected by mechanical stress is still unclear. It is important to understand the mechanism of Cbfa 1 and VEGF underlying the development of <b>synchondrosis,</b> and to correlate their expressions. The aim of this study was to establish the temporal pattern of Cbfa 1 and VEGF expressions in response to mechanical stress, and to correlate Cbfa 1 and VEGF expression of spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty male balb/c mice were randomly divided into six experimental and six control groups corresponding to fi ve time points. The animals were sacrifi ced and cranial base synchondroses were aseptically removed. Mechanical stresses were applied on the experimental surgical explants with helical springs and incubated in organ culture for 6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours. Tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for quantitative analysis of Cbfa 1 and VEGF expression. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed that Cbfa 1 and VEGF expression reached a peak increase at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Compared with the control groups, both Cbfa 1 and VEGF were expressed consistently higher in the experimental group at all time points. CONCLUSION: Mechanical stress applied on the <b>synchondrosis</b> elicits Cbfa 1 expression, and subsequently up-regulates the expression of VEGF. These factors act in a synchondronized manner to control the maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes and also induce chondroclast invasion and osteoblast formation, resulting in more new bone leading to growth of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|The spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> in RME {{showed a}} medio-antero-inferior {{displacement}} with maximum displacement of 0.00002  mm in the transverse plane, 0.002  mm in the sagittal plane, and 0.0001  mm in the vertical plane. In {{case of the}} I-RME, a maximum displacement of 0.116  mm in the transverse plane, 0.580  mm in the sagittal plane, and 0.535  mm in the vertical plane indicates a medio-antero-inferior displacement pattern (Fig.  9 : IIA-IIB and Table  2). However, the displacement produced is negligible {{when compared to the}} amount of displacement seen in various other sutures. This suggests that the chances of bony remodeling in the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> in response to RME therapy are negligible. This supports the findings of Jafari et al [17] who noticed no displacement of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> Contrasting reports have been noted by Gardner and Kronman [32] and Gautam et al [18] who related antero-inferior maxillary displacement to the opening of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> The displacement pattern seen for whole of the craniofacial region is pyramidal in shape with the base in the inferior region and the apex at the superior region.

40|$|Bulldog-type brachycephalic {{domestic}} dog breeds {{are characterized}} by a relatively short and broad skull with a dorsally rotated rostrum (airorhynchy). Not much {{is known about the}} association between a bulldog-type skull conformation and peculiar patterns of suture and <b>synchondrosis</b> closure in domestic dogs. In this study, we aim to explore breed-specific patterns of cranial suture and <b>synchondrosis</b> closure in relation to the prebasial angle (proxy for airorhynchy and thus bulldog-type skull conformation) in domestic dogs. For this purpose, we coded closure of 18 sutures and synchondroses in 26 wolves, that is, the wild ancestor of all domestic dogs, and 134 domestic dogs comprising 11 breeds. Comparisons of the relative amount of closing and closed sutures and synchondroses (closure scores) in adult individuals showed that bulldog-type breeds have significantly higher closure scores than non-bulldog-type breeds and that domestic dogs have significantly higher closure scores than the wolf. We further found that the prebasial angle is significantly positively correlated with the amount of closure of the basispheno-presphenoid <b>synchondrosis</b> and sutures of the nose (premaxillo-nasal and maxillo-nasal) and the palate (premaxillo-maxillary and interpalatine). Our results show that there is a correlation between patterns of suture and <b>synchondrosis</b> closure and skull shape in domestic dogs, although the causal relationships remain elusive.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Synchondrosis</b> {{is defined}} as the {{development}} of a union between two bones by the formation of either hyaline cartilage or fibro-cartilage. This paper reviews the relationship between cranial base synchondroses and craniofacial development. The cranial base synchondroses are important growth centers of the craniofacial skeleton. Their abnormalities lead to numerous growth and developmental conditions in the craniofacial region. In dentofacial orthopedics, mechanical forces are commonly applied to cranial bones for growth modification to treat such conditions. Molecular biology and genetics provide tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms, genes and transcription factors responsible for <b>synchondrosis</b> and craniofacial development. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Morphology of the neurocentral synchondroses—thin {{cartilaginous}} layers between centra and neural arches—are {{documented in}} the extant crocodilian, Alligator mississippiensis (Archosauria, Crocodylia). Examination of dry skeletons demonstrates that neurocentral suture closure occurs in very late postnatal ontogeny (after reaching sexual maturity and/or body size ca. 40 % from the upper range). Before sexual maturity (body length (BL) ≥ ca. 1. 80 m), completely fused centra and neural arches are restricted to the caudal vertebral series. In contrast, the presacral vertebrae often remain unfused throughout postnatal ontogeny, retaining open sutures in very mature individuals (BL ≥ 2. 80 m). These unfused centra and neural arches are structurally supported by the relatively large surface area of the neurocentral junctions, which results from primarily horizontal (mediolateral) increases with strong positive allometry. Cleared and stained specimens show that the cartilaginous neurocentral <b>synchondrosis</b> starts to form after approximately 40 embryonic days. Histological examination of the neurocentral junction in dorsal and anterior caudal vertebrae of six individuals (BL = 0. 28 – 3. 12 m) shows : (1) neurocentral fusion {{is the result of}} endochondral ossification of the neurocentral <b>synchondrosis,</b> (2) the neurocentral <b>synchondrosis</b> exhibits bipolar organization of three types of cartilaginous cells, and (3) complex neurocentral sutures (i. e., curved, zigzagged, and/or interdigitated boundaries) come from clumping of bone cells of the neural arches and centra into the neurocentral <b>synchondrosis.</b> The last two morphological features can be advantageous for delaying neurocentral fusion, which seems to be unique in crocodilians and possibly their close relatives, including nonavian dinosaurs and other Mesozoic archosaurs.

40|$|AIM: Cranial base synchondroses are {{important}} growth centres of the craniofacial skeleton, especially the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> {{because of its}} late ossifi cation and major contribution to post-natal cranial base growth. It develops from a cartilaginous template that is eventually replaced by bone through endochondral ossifi cation. Endochondral ossifi cation is modulated by a cascade of events from various factors. SOX 9 is a key transcription factor in governing chondrocyte differentiation. It also directly activates the expression of type II collagen that acts as an early main marker of the chondrocytes and forms {{the framework of the}} cartilage matrix. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of SOX 9 and type II collagen in the development of synchondroses. The aim of this research was to establish the temporal pattern of SOX 9 and type II collagen expression, with or without tensile stress, in order to understand the role of these factors in the growth of cartilage in the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty, 1 -day-old, male balb/c mice were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Each group was subdivided again into fi ve different time frames; 6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours. Each subgroup consisted of fi ve mice. Each mouse was sacrifi ced using an intraperitoneal injection of overdose chemical anaesthetic, pentobarbitone sodium (150 - 200 mg/kg). The spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> was aseptically removed and incubated in a 24 -well plate, with or without tensile stress, in tissue culture at 37 ºC and 5 per cent CO 2. Tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for quantitative analysis of SOX 9 and type II collagen expression. RESULTS: There was a signifi cant increase (57 %; P < 0. 001) in the expression of SOX 9 between control and experimental groups at 24 hours. This was followed by a signifi cant increase (44. 4 %; P < 0. 001) of type II collagen expression in the experimental groups at 72 hours compared with the control groups in the same time frame. CONCLUSION: Tensile stress increases the expression of SOX 9 and type II collagen synthesis in the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> SOX 9 is an essential factor for early differentiation of chondrocytes, and for type II collagen synthesis during cartilage growth in spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Results: There was a statistically significant increase of 57 % (P <. 001) in the expression of SOX 9 between the experimental and control groups at 24 hours, followed by a significant increase of 44. 4 % (P <. 001) in the expression of type II collagen at 72 hours. Conclusions: SOX 9 may play an important role for early differentiation of chondrocytes and increase the expression of type II collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix, during the growth of cartilage in the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> © 2007 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the temporal pattern of core-binding factor a 1 (Cbfa 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressions in the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> in vitro {{with and without}} tensile stress. Materials and Methods: Sixty male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into an experimental group (with tensile stress) and a control group (without tensile stress) at each of five time points. Animals were sacrificed and the cranial base synchondroses were aseptically removed. In the experimental groups, mechanical stress was applied on the surgical explants with helical springs and incubated as organ culture for 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours. In the control group, the springs were kept at zero stress. Tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for quantitative analysis of Cbfa 1 and VEGF expression. Results: Quantitative analysis revealed that Cbfa 1 and VEGF expressions reached a peak increase at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Compared with the control groups, both Cbfa 1 and VEGF were expressed consistently higher in the experimental groups at all time points. Conclusion: Mechanical stress applied to the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis</b> elicits Cbfa 1 expression and subsequently up-regulates the expression of VEGF. Increased levels of expression of both factors could {{play a role in}} the growth of the spheno-occipital <b>synchondrosis.</b> © 2007 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
