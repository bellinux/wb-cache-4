500|$|Hearing {{that his}} friend and former minor league {{teammate}} Greg Montalbano had died of testicular cancer {{at the age of}} 31 late on August 21, Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend's memory. After inscribing [...] "GM" [...] in marker on his cap, he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees, while driving in six runs. Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said. [...] "There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You ... feel like there's <b>somebody</b> <b>out</b> there somewhere pushing balls out for you, and doing great things." ...|$|E
500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know there was <b>somebody</b> <b>out</b> there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't think for a minute that Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E
500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's <b>somebody</b> <b>out</b> there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|On April 15, 2013, The Black Count {{was honored}} with the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Jury members {{included}} Elmaz Abinader, professor of English at Mills College in Oakland, California; Michael Kazin, {{professor of history}} at Georgetown University; and Alan Brinkley, Allan Nevins Professor of History at Columbia University, where he also served as University Provost from 2003 to 2009. In a joint statement following their review and pronouncement of The Black Count as the 2013 Pulitzer Prize winner, the jury stated that the real-life inspiration for the Count of Monte Cristo, presented [...] "a compelling story of a forgotten swashbuckling hero". Following the announcement of the Pulitzer Prize winners, Reiss reflected on the honor, stating, [...] "For me the great thrill of this book is that I pulled <b>somebody</b> <b>out</b> of the pages of fiction, who was forgotten about in fact, and showed his exploits to be a true story. It's swashbuckling, but for a purpose. He was the highest-ranking black leader in a white society until modern times and really a very serious revolutionary." ...|$|E
