Our approach scans the database once utilizing an enhanced version of priori algorithm, Direct Hashing and Pruning algorithm (DHP). The algorithm computes {{the frequency of}} each k itemsets and discovers set of rules from frequent k itemsets. Once the expert in the application domain provides the minimum support, the pruning phase is utilized to minimize the number of k itemsets generated after completing the scanning of <b>specific</b> <b>size</b> database.

As the material is highly reactive with water, and therefore with ambient moisture, personnel safety {{and the integrity of}} the final product are of paramount importance, and special handling facilities are required. The manufacture of lithium hydride is described, and also the generation of the <b>specific</b> particle <b>size</b> fractions <b>required</b> for the fabrication of intricate shapes. The specialised handling requirements, together with the underlying chemistry, are covered in detail, the chemistry being the driver behind the need to exclude moisture and other contaminants from the production line.

40|$|Studies on porous starch {{have been}} {{directed}} to explore different industrial applications as bio-adsorbents {{of a variety}} of compounds. However, the analysis of starch digestibility is essential for food application. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of porous structure on in vitro starch digestibility. Porous starches were obtained using a range of concentrations of amyloglucosidase (AMG), α-amylase (AM), cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase (CGTase) or branching enzyme (BE). Porous starches exhibited major content of digestible starch (DS) that increased with the intensity of the enzymatic treatment, and very low amount of resistant starch (RS). Porous starches behaved differently during in vitro hydrolysis depending on their enzymatic treatment. AMG was the unique treatment that increased the digestive amylolysis and estimated glycemic index, whereas AM, CGTase and BE reduced them. A significant relationship was found between the pore size and the severity of the amylolysis, suggesting that a <b>specific</b> pore <b>size</b> is <b>required</b> for the accessibility of the digestive amylase. Therefore, pore size in the starch surface was a limiting factor for digestion of starch granules.

40|$|The {{opportunistic}} pathogen P. aeruginosa is {{the leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients. During chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis lung, P. aeruginosa undergoes conversion to a mucoid phenotype, constitutively producing the exopolysaccharide alginate, composed of the uronic acids D-mannuronate and L-guluronate. This alginate production contributes significantly to virulence in the cystic fibrosis lung. Evidence suggests that the acetylation state of the mannuronate component of the alginate influences the ability of components of the immune system to phagocytose the organism. To garner new and relevant information regarding the mechanism of alginate acetylation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a variety of approaches were undertaken. Analysis of the alginate produced by algX, algG, and algK alginate biosynthesis mutants revealed that the small oligouronides they produced were unacetylated. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the mannuronates are acetylated in periplasm, and that a polymer of at least some <b>specific</b> <b>size</b> is <b>required.</b> 	While three alginate biosynthesis gene products (AlgI, AlgJ, and AlgF) have been shown to be involved in alginate acetylation, another gene in the cluster, algX, shares 30 % identity with one of them and thus generates speculation as to its potential involvement in the process. To test this possibility, an algX mutant was complemented with a plasmid carrying a mutation at a conserved residue shown to be required for alginate acetylation in the homologous protein. Analysis of alginate from this construct suggested that AlgX is not involved in alginate acetylation. 	To determine if changes in levels of alginate acetylation are accomplished at the transcriptional level, transcript levels of several alginate biosynthesis genes in different media were determined by real-time PCR. As qRT-PCR had not been previously performed on any of the alginate biosynthesis genes, this yielded important information about the transcription of the operon. In addition, beta-galactosidase assays on upstream regions of several biosynthesis genes identified two previously unrecognized promoters, one upstream of algG and one upstream of algI. 	The remaining approach was to examine protein interactions of AlgF, the protein product of one of the three acetylation genes. 2 -D redox SDS-PAGE gels indicated that disulfide bonding may be important for interactions with this protein. While mass spectrometry was unable to identify the binding partners of AlgF, efforts are ongoing to create a mutation in the P. aeruginosa genome that changes the cysteine residue in AlgF to a serine residue. This would be a definitive method for determining the importance of disulfide bonding in AlgF...|$|R
