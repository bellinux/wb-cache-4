25|$|Before Dr Ezra {{can take}} a look at Bac-Bac, he trips over him in the dark and they both fall down his doorway stairs. After the fall, Ezra finds the dead body and assumes that he accidentally killed him. Recognizing Bac-Bac, they repeat the actions of Faisal and Safil by {{dropping}} the body down the chimney of their Chinese neighbor, Hi-Ching (Junix Inocian). Hi-Ching mistakenly believes that he is about to be robbed and attacks Bac-Bac with Kung Fu. Hi-Ching mistakenly believes that he killed Bac-Bac by hitting him <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> (like the others) he fears for his welfare. So he carries the body to a dark alcove, where Englishman Jerome Gribben (Roger Hammond) is walking home in a drunken stupor. Bac-Bac's body falls onto Jerome, who believes he is being attacked. He repeatedly hits the body against a wall, and calls the nearby guards. The guards recognize Bac-Bac and arrest Jerome for murder.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> so did the young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books {{as the man who}} led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E

Hermóðr agrees to ride to Hel to offer a ransom for Baldr's return, and so [...] "then Odin's horse Sleipnir was fetched and led forward." [...] Hermóðr mounts Sleipnir and rides away. Hermóðr rides for nine nights in deep, dark valleys where Hermóðr can see nothing. The two arrive at the river Gjöll and then continue to Gjöll bridge, encountering a maiden guarding the bridge named Móðguðr. Some dialogue occurs between Hermóðr and Móðguðr, including that Móðguðr notes that recently there had ridden five battalions of dead men across the bridge that made less sound than he. Sleipnir and Hermóðr continue [...] "downwards and northwards" [...] on the road to Hel, until the two arrive at Hel's gates. Hermóðr dismounts from Sleipnir, tightens Sleipnir's girth, mounts him, and spurs Sleipnir on. Sleipnir [...] "jumped <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> over the gate that it came nowhere near." [...] Hermóðr rides up to the hall, and dismounts from Sleipnir. After Hermóðr's pleas to Hel to return Baldr are accepted under a condition, Hermóðr and Baldr retrace their path backward and return to Asgard.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Prose Edda book Gylfaginning {{begins with}} a prose account stating that King Gylfi was once the ruler of [...] "what is now called Sweden," [...] {{and that he was}} said to have given [...] "a certain vagrant woman, as reward for his entertainment, one plough-land in his kingdom, as much as four oxen could plow up in a day and night." [...] This woman was [...] "of the race of the Æsir" [...] and her name was Gefjun. Gefjun took four oxen from Jötunheimr in the north. These oxen were her sons from a jötunn (name not provided). Gefjun's plough [...] "cut <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> deep that it uprooted the land, and the oxen drew the land out into the sea to the west and halted in a certain sound." [...] Gefjun there placed the land, and {{bestowed}} upon it the name Zealand. Where the land had been taken from a lake stands. According to Snorri, the lake is now known as Lake Mälar, located in Sweden, and the inlets in this lake parallel the headlands of Zealand; however, since this is much more true of Lake Vänern, the myth was probably originally about Vänern, not Mälaren.|$|E

[...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did."

500|$|Sometimes, Mary and George {{appear to}} have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their {{youngest}} son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his epilepsy from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: [...] "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: [...] "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death." ...|$|E

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.

500|$|One reader was Sam Simon, a {{producer}} of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded {{the development of the}} series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the [...] "guru" [...] of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would [...] "involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: [...] "It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every once in a while I get romantic notions that I should be doing something much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking." [...] He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, which he later had mixed feelings about: [...] "We worked <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> people liked it, but it still feels slapdash to me.” ...|$|E

500|$|Similarly to the club's {{successful}} campaign {{the season}} before, but in complete {{contrast to his}} first tenure at the club, the 2010–11 season saw five players joining the club, while roughly five players left the club in the close season. The club started the season inconsistently, with Westley stating the season would be a [...] "massive learning curve" [...] for both himself and the players. Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011, Stevenage found themselves in 18th position, just four points above the relegation zone. However, during a congested period throughout February and March 2011, Stevenage won nine games out of eleven, propelling the club up the league table and into the play-off positions. This included winning six games on the trot, a sequence only matched by Bury. A 3–3 draw against Bury {{on the final day}} of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place. They faced fifth place Accrington Stanley in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals, winning both legs by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. They beat Torquay United 1–0 in the Final at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. The victory meant that Westley had guided the club to back-to-back promotions, playing in League One for the first time in the club's history. On securing promotion, Westley said [...] "It's a fantastic feeling. The players work <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> they deserve everything they get". During the 2010–11 season, Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Reading 2–1. In the previous round, Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3–1 at Broadhall Way. After the match, Westley said before the game he had told the players to [...] "go out and win the match 5–0. We established that if we did just 20% of what it would take to win 5–0 then we would still win the game".|$|E
