These systems satisfy public demand by providing the necessary organic material to the forest, working on smaller operation area, working on <b>selective</b> <b>cuttings</b> and increasing labor efficiency. However, using harvesting machinery can cause damage to the residual vegetation in the forest. This study introduces specific logging machines widely used in mechanized harvesting systems and then presents the environmental impacts of these machines, focusing on the stand damage, based on previously conducted studies. Then, the possible ways of reducing the environmental impacts during the operations are presented to assist logging managers in developing and implementing environmentally friendly harvesting plans...|$|R

30|$|The low-elevation {{forest of}} the study area {{corresponds}} to the evergreen forest type, more specifically to the subtype dominated by shade tolerant species with few emergent Nothofagus trees, according to the official classification in Chile, and is part of the Valdivian Rainforest Ecoregion (Donoso and Donoso 2007). Llancahue lies between 50 and 410  m a.s.l., receives 2100  mm average annual rainfall and has an average annual temperature of 12.2  °C (Oyarzún et al. 2005; Fuenzalida 1971). Stands dominated by the shade-tolerant species Aextoxicon punctatum R. et Pav. and Laureliopsis philippiana (Looser) Schodde and the mid-tolerant species Eucryphia cordifolia Cav. and Drimys winteri J.R. et G. Forster were chosen. All stands had an uneven-aged structure and basal areas characteristic for this forest type. In the intermediate depression of south-central Chile, nearly all remnant old-growth forests show signs of illegal <b>selective</b> <b>cuttings,</b> especially since the twentieth century (Donoso and Lara 1995) and at low elevations. Signs include large stumps of few valuable species and increased cover of Chusquea spp., especially at low residual densities.

40|$|To study {{whether a}} regular {{satisfactory}} wood production {{could be achieved}} in the mountain reserve forests of Java, a study was made of natural regeneration and choice of method of selective felling on 3800 ha of the Goenoeng Gedeh complex. In 2 nearby forest areas (34 plots of 110. 8 ha in total) and in another area (6 plots of 16. 5 ha in total; parallel experiment) comparisons were made of methods of selective felling, to promote {{the best of the}} 200 timber species. At first trees for felling were selected by diameter, in later years primarily to obtain open places for regeneration. No more than 10 % should be cut, in view also of the cutting damage. The regeneration was periodically counted in 263 and 26 squares of 1 are, respectively. In the native forest, regeneration was usually inadequate except sometimes in large clearings. Clearings of less than 10 are, especially those of I are often regenerated well with a mixed stand. Larger clearings of 0. 1 - 0. 3 ha did not always regenerate well because of competition from weeds. An interval of 10 years between the <b>selective</b> <b>cuttings</b> was advised.

40|$|The {{forests of}} North Mongolia are largely {{dominated}} either by larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) or birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev). The increasing demand for timber and firewood is currently met by removal of wood from these forest stands. Therefore, silvicultural approaches {{that account for}} both utilization and protection are needed. Thinning trials were established in the research area Altansumber, in the mountain forest steppe west {{of the town of}} Darkhan. We analyzed the response of non-spatial and spatial structure and growth of birch and larch stands on thinning. Before thinning, spatial tree distribution was largely clumped. Thinning promoted regular tree distribution. Ingrowth of new stems after thinning tended to redirect stand structure towards clumping. Both relative and absolute tree growth and competition were evaluated before, directly after, and three years after the thinning. Competition {{played a significant role in}} tree growth before thinning. A reduction in competition after thinning triggered significantly increased growth of both birch and larch. The observed positive growth response was valid in absolute and relative terms. A methodically based forest management strategy, including thinning operations and <b>selective</b> <b>cuttings,</b> could be established, even under the harsh Mongolian conditions. Our findings could initiate the development of broader forest management guidelines for the light-taiga dominated stands...|$|R

In total, 46 species of algae and 72 taxa of micromycetes, represented by common soil species, were found in studied soils. Green algae (mainly Chlorophyceae and Charophyceae) prevailed both qualitatively and quantitatively among soil algae which was connected with low pH. All isolated micromycetes belonged to saprotrophic fungi.

40|$|The savanna-woodlands of West Africa {{have been}} subject to {{disturbance}} by fire, grazing and tree cutting for centuries. Often the disturbance is severe, for instance when a thick patch of 4 m tall perennial grass catches fire late in the dry season or man decides to clear-cut an area. Fortunately Mother Nature is very forgiving and the woodlands show remarkable resilience. Research plots were established in the Laba and Tiogo State forests in Burkina Faso in 1992. The plots have been monitored by research institutions from Burkina Faso and Sweden ever since. The results show great inter-annual variation in grass species richness, abundance and diversity at both sites. The combined effects of fire, grazing and tree cutting were limited and varied between life forms. Grazing tended to favor diversity of perennial grasses and fire affected the richness of annual grasses. The herbaceous biomass was reduced by the presence of livestock but the effect was not statistically significant for early fire or <b>selective</b> tree <b>cutting.</b> Fire had a homogenizing effect at the species level with increased biomass of the most abundant annual grass Loudetia togoensis and decreased biomass of the most abundant perennial grass Andropogon gayanus. Fire, grazing and <b>selective</b> tree <b>cutting</b> acted independently on the population dynamics of tree saplings. Many responses are site or species specific which accentuates the importance of landscape-level approaches to understand the impacts of disturbance on structure and function of the savanna ecosystems.

40|$|The paper aims {{to outline}} the {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} silver fir stands in Tuscan Apennines, according to a review of research activities carried out by the Silviculture Institute of Florence, nowadays Department of Forest Environmental Technologies (DISTAF), from 1960 up to today. The study cases are placed in the Vallombrosa Forest Reserve (province of Florence), in the National Park of Foreste Casentinesi Monte Falterona e Campigna (province of Arezzo) and in Amiata Mountain (province of Siena). The main research activities concern different issues linked to the dynamics of silver fir stands: 1) ecology of natural regeneration, 2) stands dynamics in time, 3) sapling growth rates in relation with different canopy cover, 4) impact of wildlife on regeneration storey, 5) forest typology according to vegetation dynamics. As regards management aspects, the decrease of the importance of silver fir pure stands for timber production, as well as the increase of their role from naturalistic, recreation and landscape point of view, encourage close-to-nature sylviculture interventions aimed to promote stand dynamics towards mixed forest. <b>Selective</b> <b>cuttings</b> are proposed in order to progressively reduce the tree canopy cover and to favour the growth of regeneration layer. Nevertheless, wherever silver fir artificial stands play an important role from an historical point of view, the conservation of pure stand by means of clear cutting and artificial regeneration is recommended.

It is {{naturally}} distributed only in the Abruzzo Region, {{near the village of}} Villetta Barrea, with a rear-edge marginal population.   A dendrochronological sampling of the population was implemented with the aim of studying its stand structure and the most probable interactions between growth trends and climate. Mensurational data were used to characterize the stand and, furthermore, the general correlation function (CF) and the moving correlation function (MCF), with a 30 years window, were used to assess the interrelation between the growth of the tree rings and the climate. The results indicated that the past forest management, mainly carried out with thinnings from below and <b>selective</b> <b>cuttings,</b> influenced the current structure of the forest (mean diameter) but no differences in growth trends were detected within the population. The survey on Villetta Barrea Black pine showed a positive and statistically significant correlation between the ring-width and the average temperatures of the months of December (before the ring formation - t- 1), February and March; but it also showed a negative correlation with the temperatures of July, September and October of the current year (t). Moreover, the analysis with moving correlation functions suggested that, in the last decades, the population has negatively reacted to very few climate factors and, in particular, to the changes in temperatures (both minimum and maximum temperatures). This is especially true for the shifts occurred in September, the year of the ring formation. </p...|$|R
