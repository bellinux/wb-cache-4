5|$|Experimental high-definition {{television}} (HDTV) broadcasting {{began in}} Zagreb in March 2007; it was expanded to Split, Rijeka and Osijek in 2008. Experimental HDTV broadcasting ended in February 2011. There were two experimental HDTV channels, operated by Croatian Radiotelevision and Nova TV. Pursuant to the digital television <b>switchover</b> {{developed by the}} Government of Croatia, broadcasting of DVB-T HDTV channels was conducted in MPEG-4. On 11 October 2011 experimental DVB-T2 broadcasting began in Zagreb, using H.264/MPEG-4 AVC coding and a conditional access system.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's home matches are {{presently}} {{covered by the}} pay-TV broadcaster Sky Sports. Television rights to away games vary; Sky Sports currently hold the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the Scottish Government, who have argued that qualifying matches {{should be included in}} the list of sporting events which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA have argued that limiting the rights to free-to-air broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson deferred a decision until the completion of the digital <b>switchover.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Government of Croatia {{decided that}} {{multicast}} (simultaneous analog and digital DVB-T broadcasting {{of the main}} channels) was to cease in 2010. The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. The analog broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital <b>switchover</b> on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or analog TV broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|All Welsh {{television}} broadcasts are digital. The {{last of the}} analogue transmitters ceased broadcasts in April 2010, and Wales {{became the}} UK's first digital nation. Cardiff {{is home to the}} television output of Wales. BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster. Based in Llandaff, Cardiff, it produces Welsh-oriented English and Welsh-language television for BBC ONE Wales, BBC TWO Wales and S4C channels. BBC Cymru Wales has also produced programmes, such as Life on Mars, Doctor Who and Torchwood, shown worldwide. ITV the UK's main commercial broadcaster has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Wales, whose studios are in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff. S4C, based in Llanishen, Cardiff, first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours, but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital <b>switchover</b> in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. BBC Cymru Wales provide S4C with ten hours of programming per week. Their remaining output is commissioned from ITV and independent producers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{television}} signal broadcast in Croatia occurred in 1939 during the Zagreb Fair, where Philips showcased its television system. The first regular broadcasts started in 1956, when Television Zagreb was established {{as the first}} TV station in the Yugoslav Radio Television system. Color broadcasts began in 1975. Coverage and number of channels grew steadily, and by the 2000s there were four channels with nationwide coverage in Croatia. DVB-T signal broadcasts began in 2002, and in 2010 a full digital <b>switchover</b> was completed. During that period the IPTV, cable and satellite television markets grew considerably, and by 2011 only 60.7 percent of households received DVB-T television only; the remainder were subscribed to IPTV, cable and satellite TV in addition, or as the sole source of TV reception. As of January 2012 DVB-T is broadcast in three multiplexes, while the territory of Croatia is divided into nine main allotment regions and smaller local allotments corresponding to major cities. High-definition television (HDTV) is broadcast only through IPTV, although HDTV DVB-T test programming was broadcast from 2007 to 2011. A DVB-T2 test broadcast was conducted in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The <b>switchover</b> {{began when}} BBC Two was {{switched}} off at 0200 on 17 October 2007. This {{was followed by}} the remaining analogue channels at 0200, on 14 November 2007. As a result of the <b>switchover,</b> all televisions in the Whitehaven area had to have a digital terrestrial receiver (Freeview) or digital satellite alternative (Freesat, Sky, etc.) The <b>switchover</b> in the Whitehaven area was not entirely successful: in nearby Eskdale, poor signal quality left viewers with blank television screens and the digital <b>switchover</b> was supposed to give over 40 channels but certain areas received fewer than 20.|$|E

40|$|Critical {{medium voltage}} {{substations}} are often fed {{by at least}} 2 transformers. When the short-circuit power reaches unacceptable levels, a system with automatic <b>switchovers</b> can provide a solution. With this system, each transformer feeds its own bus bar (see Fig. 1). The transformers are able to feed both bus bars (e. g. for maintenance). When one transformer breaks down, the other will take over its bus bar, but only after the voltage has dropped. To avoid this voltage drop, a DC coupling between both bus bars could be used. This link only adds {{a limited amount of}} short circuit power and is able to take over the other bus bar immediately, to exchange an arbitrary amount of power between the bus bars, etc [...] . The technology (back-to-back converter) already exists, but the application is unknown to the major manufacturers. The goal of this thesis is to develop the concept of this solution, to design a protection scheme, to propose boundary conditions to take over a bus bar, etc [...] . The transient behavior of the system should be modeled to provide insight on the impact of the system, e. g. during and after fault clearing.

50|$|Unlike PAL or NTSC, analog SECAM {{programming}} cannot {{easily be}} edited in its native analog form. Because it uses frequency modulation, SECAM is not linear {{with respect to}} the input image (this is also what protects it against signal distortion), so electrically mixing two (synchronized) SECAM signals does not yield a valid SECAM signal, unlike with analog PAL or NTSC. For this reason, to mix two SECAM signals, they must be demodulated, the demodulated signals mixed, and are remodulated again. Hence, post-production is often done in PAL, or in component formats, with the result encoded or transcoded into SECAM at the point of transmission. Reducing the costs of running television stations is one reason for some countries' recent <b>switchovers</b> to PAL.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} international status seeking in a two-country {{model of}} endogenous growth: utility of agents {{in developing countries}} is a 4 ected by con- sumption gaps with the average consumer in advanced economies. By distorting terms of trade, status seeking: (i) may compensate for structural gaps in physical productivity, inducing convergence; (ii) may revert the link between trade and growth; and (iii) induces divergence when interacting with technological catching- up. In particular, envy in conjunction with catching-up predicts <b>switchovers</b> of growth leadership: when the advanced economy is both status- and technology- leader in the short run, convergence in interest rates - e. g. due to R&D spillovers - implies that the initially lagging economy becomes growth-leader in the long run, due to permanent price distortions induced by envy...|$|R

As originally delivered, the Class 373 units were additionally fitted with 750 V DC collection shoes, designed for the journey in London via the suburban commuter lines to Waterloo. A switch between third-rail and overhead collection was performed while running at speed, initially at Continental Junction near Folkestone, and later on at Fawkham Junction after the opening of the first section of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Between Kensington Olympia railway station and North Pole depot further <b>switchovers</b> were necessary.|$|R
40|$|Oscillations in {{seawater}} chemistry have characterized {{at least}} the last 600 million years of earth history. Three phases of aragonite seas have been separated by two of calcite seas, the former due to high molar ratios of Mg/Ca in seawater and the latter to low ratios. During aragonite seas, inorganic marine cements and ooids are aragonitic, whereas during calcite seas they are calcitic. Recent interest {{has focused on the}} effects of this cyclical change in seawater chemistry on biomineralization, as well as on taphonomy (including diagenesis) and hence fossil preservation. Although {{there is a need for}} rigorous testing of hypotheses, data on the geological distributions of aragonite and calcite skeletons among marine invertebrates lends variable support to links between seawater chemistry and: (1) de-novo evolution of calcite vs aragonite skeletons, (2) <b>switchovers</b> in mineralogy during subsequent clade evolution, (3) the relative success of clades using calcite or aragonite as biominerals, and (4) the development of hardgrounds with associated sclerobiont communities.

40|$|Summary: It is {{most likely}} that the current reserve {{currencies}} will retain their status in the near future, given the persistence {{in the composition of}} reserve holdings. However, since we do not have complete data on the <b>switchovers</b> in lead reserve currencies, a great deal of uncertainty attends any forecasts. Hence, it is possible that new reserve currencies might appear with greater rapidity than anticipated. Of the candidates for new reserve currencies among the major emerging economies, the renminbi (RMB) is the most plausible. However, even under optimistic assumptions regarding economic growth and financial development, RMB status as a major reserve currency is some time off. A role for regional reserve currency status in the near future is much more likely. The advent of a multi‐reserve currency world is unlikely to have negative consequences for global financial stability (and might be stability‐enhancing). However, achieving the prerequisites for reserve currency status will force sacrifices in terms of policy autonomy. In addition, reserve currency status might reduce international competitiveness for individual countries, as higher currency demand appreciates their currencies...|$|R
