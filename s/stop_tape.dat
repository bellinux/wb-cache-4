25|$|While CBS would <b>stop</b> <b>tape</b> delaying its game {{broadcasts}} {{after the}} 1981 NBA Finals, many first-round playoff games were not nationally televised (and would not become so until 1995). During this era, CBS typically provided regional coverage of {{two games in}} a late Sunday afternoon time slot {{during the first three}} weekends of the playoffs. In 1986, CBS provided regional coverage of the Eastern Conferences Finals and Western Conference Finals games on May 18. This would be the last time that any NBA Conference Finals game was not nationally televised.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{standardization}} creates {{many problems}} for consumers: {{the need to}} purchase universal remotes because the original cannot control related functions on interconnected devices and to upgrade them when buying a new device, universal remotes that do not adequately control the devices, inability to control {{more than one of}} the same type unit, the inability in most consumer setups to <b>stop</b> <b>tape</b> recording when CD ends, the inability of VCRs to control cable channels, and others. This in addition to having 5+ different remotes on the coffee table.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after the}} time of Abu Zubaydah's capture in March 2002, the CIA began videotaping him at all times. Hundreds of hours of video on 92 tapes were {{eventually}} produced. The CIA <b>stopped</b> <b>taping</b> in late 2002, after Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded. Originally the CIA claimed it taped the interrogations to protect agents from a wrongful death suit if Abu Zubaydah happened to succumb to the injuries he suffered during his capture.|$|R

25|$|It {{was also}} then {{reported}} that Barker would appear on The Price is Right {{to promote his}} book. His initial appearance was scheduled for the March 2, 2009 taping. However, the taping was postponed until March 25, due to host Drew Carey's bout with pneumonia. The episode aired on April 16, during which Barker appeared during the Showcases to promote the book. Carey stated {{in an interview that}} the show <b>stopped</b> <b>taping</b> for over an hour as the crowd continued to give Barker a standing ovation, and to allow the audience to ask questions about what Barker was doing during his post-retirement.|$|R
5000|$|Early IBM tape drives, {{such as the}} IBM 727 and IBM 729, were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these u-shaped tape loops, fast start and <b>stop</b> of the <b>tape</b> at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5 ms from <b>stopped</b> <b>tape</b> to full speed of 112.5 in/s m/s. The fast acceleration is possible because the tape mass in the vacuum columns is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high inertia reels. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in movies and television.|$|R
5000|$|A disadvantageous effect termed [...] "shoe-shining" [...] {{occurs during}} read/write if the data {{transfer}} rate falls below the minimum threshold at which the tape drive heads were designed to transfer data to or from a continuously running tape. In this situation, the modern fast-running tape drive is unable to <b>stop</b> the <b>tape</b> instantly. Instead, the drive must decelerate and <b>stop</b> the <b>tape,</b> rewind it a short distance, restart it, position {{back to the point}} at which streaming stopped and then resume the operation. If the condition repeats, the resulting back-and-forth tape motion resembles that of shining shoes with a cloth. Shoe-shining decreases the attainable {{data transfer rate}}, drive and tape life, and tape capacity.|$|R

The new program, akin to Dayside, would be hosted by Jerrick and Huddy, requiring them to leave Fox News for the syndicated program. The program was initially promoted to feature elements of both programs the hosts have been a part of, Dayside and Fox & Friends. When officially launched on January 22, 2007, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet aired with both hosts, Huddy producing a video blog for the program. The show was not renewed and <b>stopped</b> <b>taping</b> new episodes in June 2009.|$|R

50|$|Language {{laboratories}} in the 1970s and 1980s {{received a}} bad reputation due to breakdowns. Common problems stem from the limitations and relative complexity of the reel to reel tape system in use at that time. Design played a part too; the simplest language laboratories had no electronic systems {{in place for the}} teacher to remotely control the tape decks, relying on the students to operate the decks correctly. Many had no way to <b>stop</b> the <b>tape</b> running off the reel in fast rewind or forward wind, which meant time wasting and greater chances of failure through misuse.|$|R

50|$|The tape {{had seven}} {{parallel}} tracks, six for data {{and one to}} maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity. (709 manual p. 20) Aluminum strips were glued several feet from {{the ends of the}} tape to serve as logical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of the}} tape reel. A ¾ inch gap between records allowed the mechanism time to <b>stop</b> the <b>tape.</b> At 200 characters per inch, a single 2400-foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 six-bit bytes).|$|R

40|$|LTO: A better {{format for}} {{midrange}} tape In {{the last two}} years, Linear Tape-Open � (LTO �) tape drives have become clear leaders in the mid-range tape marketplace. Tape drives designed to the LTO Ultrium � format were {{the first of the}} super drives to be shipped to mid-range tape customers. This paper describes some of the eclectic features designed into the LTO format. The technical emphasis is on aspects of the logical format that are new or different from preceding drives, though some aspects of the LTO roadmap and physical format are also discussed. The logical format comprises all of the data manipulations and organization involved in writing customer data to tape. This includes data compression to compact the data, appending of errorcorrection codes (ECCs) to protect the data, run-length-limited encoding of the ECC-encoded data, prepending headers to the encoded data to make it self-identifying on read-back, and storing of information about the data and the way it is stored in a cartridge memory module. Physical format aspects that are discussed include encoding data into the servo pattern and write shingling. Also discussed are the format-enabled aspects of drive functionality that have been improved over previous tape drive products, including enabling backward writing, elimination of problematic failure mechanisms, dynamic rewrite of defective data, handling servo errors without <b>stopping</b> <b>tape,</b> and enabling robust reading. Contrasts are made with previous products and competing products based on other format choices. Also discussed throughout {{is the way in which}} an eclectic format can be created by cooperation among three format-development companies...|$|R
