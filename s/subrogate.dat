If the equity is established, the court may effect the subrogation remedy by way of equitable lien, charge, or a constructive trust with a liability to account. Crucially, the claimant's rights are wholly derivative, hence the claimant has no higher rights than the person to whom he or she is <b>subrogated.</b>|$|R

50|$|In some states, PIP is subrogatable, {{meaning that}} your {{insurance}} carrier {{will pay for}} your loss, regardless of liability, and then recover (or <b>subrogate)</b> what it paid from the liable party's insurance carrier. This generally leaves the claimant/insured {{in a much better}} financial position, because his or her medical bills are paid, and the insurance carriers get to fight it out on their own, and after the fact.|$|E

50|$|Uninsured/Underinsured coverage, {{also known}} as UM/UIM, {{provides}} coverage if an at-fault party either does not have insurance, or {{does not have enough}} insurance. In effect, the insurance company pays the insured medical bills, then would <b>subrogate</b> from the at fault party. This coverage is often overlooked and very important. In Colorado, for example, it was estimated in 2009 that 15% of drivers were uninsured. Usually the limits match the liability limits. Some insurance companies do offer UM/UIM in an umbrella policy.|$|E

US car rental companies sometimes include minimum liability insurance required by law in the basic rental charge. Hertz includes it in all states except California, but will <b>subrogate</b> any damages against the driver (meaning the car is insured to the state minimum but the driver will pay for all damages paid by Hertz). Avis includes it in all states except California and Texas, at least for renters who lack their own coverage. Other companies do not publicize where they include liability insurance in the basic rental charge. Some car rental companies offer more liability insurance for a fee.|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} {{means of}} extincting a suretyship is constituted by the creditor’ act, {{in this case}} the bank, which allowed the loss of the rights and securities he had against the principal debtor and in which the surety was going to <b>subrogate.</b> The fault of the bank according to the analyzed case-law is that the bankruptcy procedure for the principal debtor was already opened and thus he was too late in lodging claims and did not gain the statute of creditor entitled to participate to the bankruptcy proceedings. The surety’s right of recourse against the principal debtor, through subrogation, in order to obtain from him the repayment of the amounts paid to the bank-creditor comes in conflict with the creditor’s act. Following the non-registration of the bank on the statement of assets and liabilities of the debtor undergoing bankruptcy, the surety is deprived of the possibility to legally <b>subrogate</b> to his rights and securities. The extinction of the suretyship consequently acts as sanction for the bank that allowed the loss of the rights and securities it had against the principal debtor and blocked the surety’s possibility to exercise the right of recourse and <b>subrogate</b> to the rights of the bank to recover from the bankrupt debtor the amounts paid to the creditor...|$|E

5000|$|Similar rules {{apply to}} {{transfers}} of contractual rights {{by way of}} subrogation. [...] Whether or not a right of subrogation arises {{as a matter of}} law depends upon the applicable law between the parties between whom the subrogation operates, and not the contract in relation to which the rights are <b>subrogated.</b> [...] So, for example: Mr X deposits property with Mr Y under a contract of bailment governed by German law, and during that period that property is damaged. Mr X claims under his policy of insurance governed by English lqw with Z Co, who pays the claim. It will be a matter of English law whether Z Co is <b>subrogated</b> to any right of action which Mr X might have had against Mr Y under the original contract of bailment.|$|R

40|$|Amalgamation incentivizes {{municipalities}} {{to increase}} public debt {{because it allows}} them to <b>subrogate</b> their repayment and interest burden on the entire municipality after amalgamation. Especially, the smaller municipality tends to accumulate public debt in order to free-ride. Previous literature has shown this kind of opportunistic behavior in countries where municipalities can issue bonds freely in the market. However, public borrowing by municipalities is strongly controlled in Japan. This study examines the relationship between regulation of local government borrowing and the free-ride behavior of Japanese municipalities on amalgamation. Difference-in-difference regression confirms the free-ride effect, which is however wholly counterbalanced by regulation...|$|E
40|$|Amalgamation offers {{municipalities}} {{an incentive}} to free ride when they can <b>subrogate</b> the load to a new municipality after amalgamation. Previous literature has clarified opportunistic behavior in local public bond issues. However, if the municipality {{does not have a}} leeway in policy decision making, it cannot adopt free-ride behavior. Although the Japanese long-term care insurance system has been so designed that the municipality does not have discretion in its working, doubts have been raised on this score. This study empirically considers this issue by examining municipality behavior before amalgamation. Difference-in-difference regression confirms a free-ride effect in the eligibility assessments for long-term care by the Japanese municipality. These results mean that the Japanese long-term care insurance system is not managed in accordance with the institutional design...|$|E

40|$|The {{past twenty}} years have seen {{more than a dozen}} cases, in which parties to letter of credit {{transactions}} have sought subrogation to the rights of the person they have paid or to the rights of the persons on behalf of whom, they have acted. 2 ̆ 7 The most obvious case arises when the issuer of a standby letter of credit pays a beneficiary on a debt that is owed to the beneficiary by a bankrupt applicant. Having failed to take 2 ̆ 7 collateral from the applicant, the issuer seeks to be <b>subrogated</b> to the security interest of the beneficiary. Failing subrogation, the issuer may be the lowest of the low, a general creditor in the applicant 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy. If it is <b>subrogated</b> to a perfected security interest, the issuer will be a perfected secured creditor in that bankruptcy. As we will see, applicants have also sought subrogation upon reimbursement of the issuer. Sometimes even confirmers have sought subrogation to the issuer 2 ̆ 7 s claim against an applicant...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{allocation of}} control rights in inter-firm collaborations {{is a widely}} emphasized issue. In this paper, I empirically identify control rights and the allocation of these rights using a unique survey data set on collaborations between biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms. Fifteen control rights are identified {{to make up the}} structure of deals with five rights being the items of contention in deal making (ownership of patents, production, further development of the technology, the right to manage the collaboration, and the right to market universally). I find that the assignment of control rights is related to the bargaining position of firms and incentive issues. Hence, goliaths -pharmaceutical incumbents- <b>subrogate</b> critical rights to the new ventures when the final outcome of the project is depending on the venture's effort...|$|E

40|$|Comparing {{abortion}} and assisted reproductive technology (ART) [...] especially controversial techniques like cytoplasm donation [...] may {{be detrimental to}} both.
