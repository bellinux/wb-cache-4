5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an {{indicator}} species for river monitoring (in Germany); however the spreading populations {{also have a}} high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity: it was found living on <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> on dead wood in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in brackish water in the Baltic Sea. The species {{can also be found}} on aggregates of Mytilus.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E

5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing <b>stones,</b> <b>and</b> linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E

5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E

5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief.
