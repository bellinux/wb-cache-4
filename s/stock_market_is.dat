25|$|A {{private equity}} fund say for example, ABC Capital II, borrows $9bn from a bank (or other lender). To this it adds $2bn of equity – money from its own {{partners}} and from limited partners (pension funds, rich individuals, etc.). With this $11bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company, XYZ Industrial (after due diligence, i.e. checking the books). It replaces the senior management in XYZ Industrial, and {{they set out to}} streamline it. The workforce is reduced, some assets are sold off, etc. The objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale. The <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> experiencing a bull market, and XYZ Industrial is sold two years after the buy-out for $13bn, yielding a profit of $2bn. The original loan can now be paid off with interest of say $0.5bn. The remaining profit of $1.5bn is shared among the partners. Taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates. Note that part of that profit results from turning the company around, and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market, the latter often being the greater component.|$|E

The co-movements can affect the balancing strategies of country market portfolios as they indicate opportunities and risks. The strategic choice of alternative market presence, such as market entry via export marketing or a full ownership and marketing may need to match {{with the type of}} financial resources. The co-movements of and the linkages between the U. S. <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> have <b>been</b> studied extensively.

2500|$|Further to this {{evidence}} that the UK <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> weak-form efficient, other studies of capital markets have pointed toward their being semi-strong-form efficient. [...] A study by Khan of the grain futures market indicated semi-strong form efficiency following the release of large trader position information (Khan, 1986). Studies by Firth (1976, 1979, and 1980) in the United Kingdom have compared the share prices existing after a takeover announcement with the bid offer. [...] Firth found that the share prices were fully and instantaneously adjusted to their correct levels, thus concluding that the UK stock market was semi-strong-form efficient. [...] However, the market's ability to efficiently respond to a short term, widely publicized event such as a takeover announcement does not necessarily prove market efficiency related to other more long term, amorphous factors. David Dreman has criticized the evidence provided by this instant [...] "efficient" [...] response, pointing out that an immediate response is not necessarily efficient, and that the long-term performance of the stock in response to certain movements are better indications.|$|E
