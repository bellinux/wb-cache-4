In the DS0 designation, each of the channels induces eight bits into the multiplex output stream, ten are utilized entirely for voice/data and two are utilized partially for voice. Hence, each of the two partial channels yields 7 x 8000 bit/s = 56 kbit/s for voice data and the remaining channels yields 8 x 8000 bit/s = 64 kbit/s.|$|E

50|$|The robbed-bit signal {{scheme is}} used in the <b>super</b> <b>frame</b> circuit (SF). It takes the least {{significant}} bit of every sixth channel and utilizes it to convey on or off hook, and busy signal status on telephone lines. The first bit of every six is called A bit, the second bit is called B bit.|$|E
5000|$|To do this, {{signaling}} equipment [...] "steals" [...] the eighth bit of each channel on every sixth frame (see <b>Super</b> <b>Frame</b> and Extended <b>Super</b> <b>Frame)</b> and replaces it with signaling information. This {{means that the}} low-order bit on every sixth sample in every DS0 carried on the T1, in either direction, is replaced by signaling information. Simple PCM-encoded voice is not very sensitive to losing these data in a few of its lower-order bits, so it doesn't cause much degradation of voice quality; however, when carrying data, the difference is significant, reducing the available usable data rate by 12.5%. With full 64 kbit/s, a voice channel has a signal-to-noise ratio of 37 decibels (dB). At 56 kbit/s, a voice channel has a {{signal to noise ratio}} of 31 dB. As only every sixth least-significant bit is robbed, the signal to noise ratio will be somewhere between 31 and 37 dB. However, since individual T1 links are not in general synchronized to one another, a DS0 passing along several concatenated, unsynchronized, T1 spans may have its lower bit stolen in more than one frame, frequently making real-world performance closer to the lower-bound than the upper bound of signal-to-noise performance.|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} in Section 3.3, compared with contention-based protocols, slotted DSA protocols can obtain better network performances, such as higher network throughput and lower access delay, {{due to the}} stringent time management. One {{of the most famous}} slotted distributed DSA protocol is the cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol [25], which is based on the well-known IEEE 802.22 standard. In the C-MAC, a rendezvous channel, which can be viewed as the best channel under current network status, is dynamically selected. The rendezvous channel acts as the CCC and can be moved to other channels when the network status changes. For each channel, the identical <b>super</b> <b>frame</b> is defined. Each <b>super</b> <b>frame</b> contains one beacon period, quiet period, and data transfer period, respectively. In the quiet period, all SUs on the same channel must stop transmitting and perform spectrum sensing. In the beacon period, each SU will be allocated a unique beacon slot and the information of each SU will be broadcast in the corresponding beacon slot. Then, the data transmissions can be performed in the data transfer period according to the schedules in the previous beacon period. Moreover, the beacon and quiet periods of different channels are non-overlapping based on the inter-channel coordination mechanism, such that the SUs staying on one certain channel can perform out-of-band measurements and obtain the traffic load information of other channels. Consequently, each SU can choose to quit current channel and join another channel with lower traffic loads and thus the total traffic loads of the entire network can be evenly distributed on all available channels.|$|E

In this network of wireless remote nodes Idle listening, Transmitting and Receiving are the major sources of power consumption.

The IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol is utilized as the communication protocols of Physical layer and MAC layer.

Earlier, for reduction of the power consumption in wireless sensor networks we used the combination of Power Saving Mechanism (PSM) and Power control (PC) techniques in IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol. We know that by using these techniques saves more power but lags in throughput. Because of the very large BO and small SO, obviously the throughput degrades.
