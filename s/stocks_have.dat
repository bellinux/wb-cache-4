5|$|Like {{other large}} whales, the {{humpback}} was {{a target for}} the whaling industry. Once hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} listed as {{vulnerable}} in 1996 and endangered as recently as 1988. Most monitored <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> rebounded {{since the end of}} commercial whaling. In the North Atlantic stocks are believed to be approaching prehunting levels. However, the species is considered endangered in some countries, including the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise {{in demand for}} shark products increases pressure on fisheries. Major declines in shark <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.|$|E

50|$|Unissued {{stock is}} <b>stock</b> that <b>has</b> been {{authorized}} in a company's charter, but {{has never been}} sold.

5|$|In recent years, {{the company}} has expanded, opening new stores of its own and {{acquiring}} competitors. In 2010, Triumph International acquired Beldona, the leading Swiss distributor of lingerie, and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States. In the latter country, Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer Journelle and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders. Since then, company <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, {{and the company is}} wholly owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

After the war, the fishing industry continued to languish, and now fish <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> fallen so low that fishing is severely restricted. Saint Pierre and Miquelon are now trying to diversify their economy into tourism and other areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} use of such types of GM soybeans in the Americas has caused problems with exports to some regions. GM crops require extensive certification {{before they can be}} legally imported into the European Union, where there is considerable supplier and consumer reluctance to use GM products for consumer or animal use. Difficulties with coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of non-GM <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> caused shipments to be rejected and have put a premium on non-GM soy.|$|E
25|$|Several cod stocks {{collapsed}} in the 1990s (declined by >95% of maximum historical biomass) and have failed to recover even with the cessation of fishing. This absence of the apex predator {{has led to a}} trophic cascade in many areas. While the north west Atlantic cod <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> not yet recovered fully from overfishing in the past, most stocks in the East Atlantic are currently in good condition and well managed, such as those at North Norway and Svalbard.|$|E

25|$|The World Bank {{lists the}} effect of {{biofuels}} as an important contributor to higher food prices. The FAO/ECMB has reported that world land usage for agriculture has declined since the 1980s, and subsidies outside the United States and EU have dropped since the year 2004, leaving supply, while sufficient to meet 2004 needs, vulnerable when the United States began converting agricultural commodities to biofuels. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), global wheat imports and <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> decreased, domestic consumption has stagnated, and world wheat production has decreased from 2006 to 2008.|$|E
25|$|The many mountains, {{streams and}} rivers form a major {{spawning}} ground for several species of trout and salmon; yet recently, in the last 50 years, some of the fish <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> fallen drastically, particularly salmon stocks. The ecoregion's rivers and streams are home to nine species of native salmonids. The depletions occur mainly because dams and clearcutting on the rugged slopes of the area contribute to large amounts of silt in the stream beds, which in turn interfere with spawning salmon, as they lay their eggs in exposed gravel beds. The notable fish species are king, kokanee, and silver salmon, brown, brook, and rainbow trout (including steelhead), and crappie, bluegill, catfish, and largemouth and smallmouth bass.|$|E

25|$|An {{article in}} Canadian {{newspaper}} National Post, based upon interviews of Cubans, finds that in reality {{even the most}} common pharmaceutical items, such as aspirin and antibiotics are conspicuously absent or only available {{on the black market}}. Surgeons lack basic supplies and must re-use latex gloves. Patients must buy their own sutures on the black market and provide bedsheets and food for extended hospital stays. The Cuban government blames the shortages on the embargo and states that those with more severe chronic diseases receive medicines. However, other sources suggest that those with such diseases lack medicines. It is also suggested that in some cases the local non-dollar <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> been shipped abroad.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{humpback}} dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is {{endemic to}} West Africa. Several <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> been identified with numbers ranging from tens {{to a few}} hundred. Abundance estimates are lacking. Gaps in the species range and hence distribution is evident. Bycatch is only documented in a few West African countries. Surveys and evaluations need to be conducted to determine the presence/ absence of humpback dolphins in their historical range. Conservation measures need to be implemented to save this species. Because many people live off the sea, it is not feasible to have complete gillnet closures. Some areas may be designated as off-limits to gillnet fisheries. Eco-tourism may be implemented successfully because of high species diversity.|$|E
25|$|The Common Fisheries Policy {{has been}} argued by certain {{commentators}} to have had disastrous consequences for the environment. This view is contradicted by historical evidence revealing that fishing <b>stocks</b> <b>have</b> been in chronic decline {{over the last century}} as a result of intensive trawl fishing. According to scientific research published in 2010, the depletion of fishing stocks is a consequence of mismanagement long before the Common Fisheries Policy came into being, a statement illustrated by the fact that British catches have declined by 94% over the last 118 years. Nonetheless, the Common Fisheries Policy has continued the trend of ineffective fisheries management in European waters. Indeed, the Common Fisheries Policy has done little if anything to reverse the decline of European fish stocks.|$|E
