Both solutions significantly compromised blood coagulation as evidenced {{by an increase in}} coagulation time and decrease in angle alpha, maximum amplitude and coagulation index (p < 0. 05). Blood coagulation was more compromised during haemodilution with potato <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> as compared with corn <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> (p < 0. 05). When taking the effect of haemodilution with 0. 9 % saline into account, haemodilution with both hydroxyethyl starch solutions also augmented clot lysis (p < 0. 05), with potato <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> having a greater effect than corn <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> hydroxyethyl <b>starch</b> (p < 0. 05).

There is the technical need to lower the filler content for decreasing the viscosity and the pressure to finally decrease the costs for the highly expensive silver.

5000|$|In {{order to}} promote millet cultivation, other {{potential}} uses have been considered recently. For example, <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> from millets {{has been shown to}} be a good substrate for fermentation and malting with grains having similar starch contents as wheat grains. A recently published study suggested that <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> from proso millet can be converted to ethanol with an only moderately lower efficiency than <b>starch</b> <b>derived</b> from corn. The development of varieties with highly fermentable characteristics could improve ethanol yield to that of highly fermentable corn. Since proso millet is compatible with low-input agriculture, cultivation on marginal soils for biofuel production could represent an important new market, such as for farmers in the High Plains of the US.The demand for more diverse and healthier cereal-based foods is increasing, particularly in affluent countries. This could create new markets for proso millet products in human nutrition. Protein content in proso millet grains is comparable with that of wheat, but the share of essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and methionine) is substantially higher in proso millet. In addition, health-promoting phenolic compounds contained in the grains are readily bioaccessible and their high calcium content favor bone strengthening and dental health. Among the most commonly consumed products are ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made purely from millet flour [...] as well as a variety of noodles and bakery products, which are, however, often produced from mixtures with wheat flour to improve their sensory quality.|$|R

This patient suffered a fatal pontine hemorrhage after subtotal transvenous occlusion of the carotid cavernous fistula with diversion of flow into cortical veins.
