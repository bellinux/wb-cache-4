25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). <b>Steeping</b> too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the <b>steeping</b> technique. Two important techniques are to warm the <b>steeping</b> container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Steep</b> {{problems}} {{are common in}} lung cancer survivors, yet {{little is known about}} the prevalence, determinants, and effects on quality of life (QoL) of these <b>steep</b> problems in tong-term Lung cancer survivors. Methods: A case-control study design comparing 76 elderly lung cancer survivors (LCS, > 5 years post diagnosis with mean survival time of 8 years +/- 2. 1 years) and 78 elderly non-cancer controls (NCC). Measurements included a standardized questionnaire for <b>steep</b> (Pittsburgh <b>Steep</b> Quality Index-PSQI), and analogue scales for dyspnea, pain, and other comorbid symptoms, as well as demographic factors and cancer history. Results: Overall, 56. 6 % of LCS had poor <b>steep</b> (PSQI global score > 5) as compared to only 29. 5 % of NCC (p < 0. 001), and 49. 2 % of LCS who did not have <b>steep</b> difficulties prior to their lung cancer diagnosis ultimately developed them. There was also evidence of significant impairments in <b>steep</b> efficiency in LCS (78. 3 %) relative to NCC (89. 6 %, p < 0. 001), predominantly due to increased nocturnal awakenings. A single-item analogue scale for <b>steep</b> quality was not as effective in identifying <b>steep</b> problems as more specific questions about <b>steep</b> duration and <b>steep</b> efficiency. Poor <b>steep</b> quality was significantly correlated with impairments in quality of life, even when controlling for other factors, such as dyspnea. Conclusions: Even 8 years after diagnosis, LCS continue to have significant <b>steep</b> difficulties. By asking specific questions about <b>steep</b> medication use, nocturnal awakenings and <b>steep</b> efficiency, health care providers can identify <b>steep</b> problems that could be treated and potentially improve the quality of life of their patients.

50|$|<b>Steepest</b> descent. Although a {{reduction}} in the sum of squares is guaranteed when the shift vector points in the direction of <b>steepest</b> descent, this method often performs poorly. When the parameter values are far from optimal the direction of the <b>steepest</b> descent vector, which is normal (perpendicular) to the contours of the objective function, {{is very different from the}} direction of the Gauss-Newton vector. This makes divergence much more likely, especially as the minimum along the direction of <b>steepest</b> descent may correspond to a small fraction of the length of the <b>steepest</b> descent vector. When the contours of the objective function are very eccentric, due to there being high correlation between parameters, the <b>steepest</b> descent iterations, with shift-cutting, follow a slow, zig-zag trajectory towards the minimum.|$|R

25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The <b>steeping</b> pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is <b>steeping</b> (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

40|$|<b>Steep</b> {{hydraulic}} gradients {{are found}} in association with <b>steep</b> monoclinal flexures. However, the physics of {{the reduction of the}} hydraulic conductivity, which is responsible for the <b>steep</b> gradients, has seldom been studied. We present results of hydrological and mechanical modeling aiming to study the effect of such <b>steep</b> hydraulic gra-dients demonstrated in the Judea Group Aquifer system, Israel. The hydrological configuration of <b>steep</b> dips and anisotropy between flows parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes was simulated using the FEFLOW code. It exhibited a situation whereby part of the flow is oblique to the bedding planes and therefore some steepen-ing of the hydraulic gradients occurred due to actual conductivity reduction. However, this reduction is not enough to account for the <b>steeper</b> gradients observed. The effect of a deep-seated reverse fault under the monocline on the permeability distribution within the structure was examined by numerical mechanical simulations. It exhibited a compressional stress distribution in the <b>steep</b> part of the monocline, which, due to shortening and closure of joints and voids, is presumably responsible for a significant pressure-induced permeability reduction. This process by it-self in a layered structure, including interlayering of thin marl layers, could be responsible for the <b>steep</b> hydraulic gradients in the <b>steep</b> part of the monocline...|$|R
25|$|Cold brewing {{has some}} {{disadvantages}} compared to hot <b>steeping.</b> Firstly, if the leaves or source water contain unwanted bacteria, they may flourish, whereas using hot water has {{the benefit of}} killing most bacteria.

40|$|The chronometric {{cosmology}} (a static, homogeneous, {{and hence}} nonevolving model proposed by Segal) {{is unable to}} explain the <b>steep</b> number versus flux law N(S) for quasars or extragalactic radio sources. The explanation given by Segal to explain the <b>steep</b> N(S) laws gives at best a small increase over a Euclidean N(S) proportional to S exp- 1. 5, and requires that the source spectral index be close to but greater than zero to create the effect. For typical radio spectral indices of roughly 0. 75, the chronometric model cannot give a quantitative fit to the excess number of 1 - 3 Jy sources that the standard cosmology attributes to evolution. Thus the chronometric model can explain a <b>steep</b> N(S) law only for flat spectrum sources, while the observations show the <b>steepest</b> N(S) law for <b>steep</b> spectrum sources. Furthermore, the observed N(S) law for ultraviolet excess quasars is <b>steeper</b> than the <b>steepest</b> possible chronometric prediction...|$|R
