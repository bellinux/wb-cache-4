25|$|The IITs have {{a common}} {{admission}} process for undergraduate admissions, the Joint Entrance Examination - Advanced, formerly called the IIT-JEE till 2012. Widely {{regarded as one of}} the toughest entrance tests, JEE Advanced admits students according to their ranks in the exam. The post-graduate level program that awards M.Tech, MS degrees, and the doctoral programme that offers Ph.D in engineering is administered by the older IITs. M.Tech and MS admissions are done on the basis of Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Additionally, IITs also award other graduate degrees such as M.Sc in Maths, Physics and Chemistry, MBA, etc. Admission to these programs of IITs is done through Common Admission Test (CAT), Joint Admission Test for M.Sc. (JAM) and Common Entrance Examination for Design (CEED). IIT Guwahati and IIT Bombay offer undergraduate design programmes as well. Joint <b>Seat</b> <b>Allocation</b> Authority conducts the joint admission process for a total of 23 IITs, that offer admission for 10,962 seats in 2017.|$|E

This article tests hypotheses regarding how smoking laws affect <b>seating</b> <b>allocations,</b> using data from a nationwide survey of restaurant and bar owners.

40|$|While extant {{research}} on the impacts of smoke-free legislation on hospitality employees and industries has centered on developed countries, the {{research on}} the effects of smoking bans in transition countries has received very little attention. Hoping to assist in filling this void, this research empirically explores the relationships among restaurant employees’ attitudes, demographics, work-related variables (WRV), and job satisfaction after the introduction of a smoke-free legislation in one transition economy, i. e. Croatia. Results revealed that gender, education, age, restaurant <b>seating</b> <b>allocation,</b> hospitality work experience, smoking status, average weekly workload, and the restaurant area served were for the most part not significant in explaining different perceptions toward a smoking ban. However, the respondents’ preferred restaurant smoking policy somewhat influenced how respondents view the smoking ban. In terms of the respondents’ preferred restaurant smoking policy, results revealed no significant differences in regards to demographics and WRV. With regard to job satisfaction, staff with more positive post-implementation attitudes towards the ban exhibit somewhat higher levels of satisfaction with the current job. Overall, respondents appear willing to make concessions for both pro- and anti-smoking patrons, staff, and owners/managers. Therefore, lawmakers should consider population characteristics, <b>seating</b> <b>allocation,</b> and the combination thereof when devising restaurant smoking policies...|$|R

50|$|Proportional {{representation}} systems aim {{to allocate}} seats to parties approximately {{in proportion to}} the number of votes received. For example, if a party wins one-third of the votes then it should gain about one-third of the seats. In general, exact proportionality is not possible because these divisions produce fractional numbers of seats. As a result, several methods, of which the D'Hondt method is one, have been devised which ensure that the parties' <b>seat</b> <b>allocations,</b> which are of course whole numbers, are as proportional as possible. In comparison with the Sainte-Laguë method, D'Hondt slightly favours large parties and coalitions over scattered small parties.|$|R
