5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio and Atlanta. The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other trunklines. The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both directions in 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor changes have been made to M-33's routing since the 1950s to <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore {{also charged}} the paratroopers to <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> the {{evacuation}} situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans {{to participate in}} Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.|$|E
5|$|When Operation Linebacker {{began in}} May 1972, American fighter jets {{returned}} to the offense in the skies over North Vietnam {{for the first time}} in nearly four years. Navy and Marine Corps fighters, reaping the benefits of their TOPGUN program, immediately enjoyed considerable success. In contrast by June, as Olds had predicted, the Air Force's fighter community was struggling with a nearly 1:1kill-loss ratio. To the new Inspector General, Lt Gen , Olds offered to take a voluntary reduction in rank to colonel so he could return to operational command and <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> the situation. Olds decided to leave the Air Force when the offer was refused (he was offered another inspection tour instead) and he retired on June 1, 1973.|$|E

25|$|Originally, this {{definition}} {{said that the}} elbow joint must not <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it {{near the top of}} the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins's erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. Finally, he hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began to <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby's 1936 hit Pennies from Heaven. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for Rudy Vallee on the CBS radio network {{and became the first}} African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the growing}} tide of {{revolution}} was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda {{ample opportunity to}} leave the country before revolutionary forces could {{have had a chance to}} overthrow the 2500-year-old monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends {{to leave the country}} as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida's decision can also be assessed from alternate angles. For one, he did not want to abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. With all these points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and that everything would eventually <b>straighten</b> <b>out,</b> allowing the country to resume its present course.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, many American {{retailers}} considered {{video games}} a passing fad, and greatly reduced sales of such products, or stopped them entirely. To avoid {{the stigma of}} video game consoles, Nintendo marketed the AVS as a full home computer, with an included keyboard, cassette data recorder, and a BASIC interpreter software cartridge. The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the Family BASIC package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the Famicom Data Recorder. The AVS also included a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a musical keyboard, and the Zapper light gun. The AVS Zapper is hinged, allowing it to <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> into a wand form, or bend into a gun form. The AVS uses a wireless infrared interface for all its components, including keyboard, cassette deck, and controllers. Most of the peripherals for the Advanced Video System are {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic grey monochrome design, with the top and bottom portions in different shades, a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The AVS also features a boxier design than the Famicom: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight. Its software carries the Nintendo Seal of Quality to communicate the company's approval.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules <b>straighten</b> <b>out,</b> lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E

At the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June, there was no serious opposition to him, and he gained a first-ballot victory. Yet Taft did not have things his own way: he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but instead [...] the convention named Congressman James S.

[...] The Mint struck over 300,000 of them, bearing the Peace dollar design and the date 1964, in May 1965 but due to a public outcry that the coins would only be hoarded, they were melted. [...] The minting had been at the direction of President Lyndon Johnson; the subsequent flip-flop on the question left Nevada Senator Alan Bible, a prominent supporter of the mining industry, unimpressed with the administration's leadership on coin matters, feeling officials were leaving the mess for Congress to <b>straighten</b> <b>out.</b> He introduced legislation to outlaw hoarding, export, and melting of U.S. coins, but the bill went nowhere.|$|E
500|$|From {{the nineteenth}} century, Ampezzo became a notable {{regional}} centre for crafts.

It became a reputable institution in teaching wood and metal work, admitted boys from the age of 13 and up to four years of study. The local handmade products were appreciated by early British and German holidaymakers as tourism emerged late nineteenth century. Some of the local items were said to have mythical qualities; the Austrian journalist and anthropologist Karl Felix Wolff, for example, stated in 1935 that according to legend a local man [...] "once made a sword that was so flexible that you could bend it over, tie it up, and then allow it to <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> again".

[...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

500|$|The {{alignment}} of the highway has changed slightly from its inception to the present day. [...] From its northern end in Lethbridge, it originally followed the railway line on a southeasterly heading before turning due east along Township Road54 at New Dayton. It then followed present-day Highway36 south through Warner, before turning back east toward the railway north of Milk River, before following it through the town and into Coutts. [...] In 1938, Lethbridge City council lobbied to the provincial government for the entire route to paved. [...] Along with other Lethbridge officials, they hoped the highway would be given priority over other projects in the area as the Coutts border crossing was {{far and away the}} busiest in Alberta, carrying more traffic than all the others combined. [...] Work began in 1945 to reconstruct and <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> the existing {{alignment of}} the highway that consisted of the numerous aforementioned 90° turns. [...] The first section to be reconstructed and paved was from Coutts to Craddock. [...] Work continued on the northern half of the highway and was mostly completed by 1947, with the official opening of the new Lethbridge–Coutts highway held in May 1948 in Coutts. [...] The road was designated as Highway4 by the following decade.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Grant {{played an}} artist who becomes {{involved}} in a court case when charged with assault in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. The film was praised by the critics, who admired the picture's slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy; it {{became one of the}} biggest-selling films at the box office that year. Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy The Bishop's Wife, playing an angel who is sent down from heaven to <b>straighten</b> <b>out</b> the relationship between the bishop (Niven) and his wife (Loretta Young). The film was a major commercial and critical success, and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Life magazine called it [...] "intelligently written and competently acted". The following year, Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings, the title-sake in the comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, again with Loy. Though the film picture lost {{a lot of money for}} RKO, Philip T.
