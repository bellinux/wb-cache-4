To fulfill the requirements of specific services, such as uRLLC, mMTC and eMBB, {{as well as to}} adapt to varying user’ channel conditions, 3 GPP introduces a flexible numerology for the 5 G PHY. The numerology of a multicarrier scheme refers to the time and frequency parametrization of the PHY waveform, i.e., the subcarrier <b>spacing,</b> <b>symbol</b> duration and CP length. In this section, an example simulation scenario, demonstrating the concept and potential of flexible numerology, is presented.|$|E
30|$|Considering short packet {{transmission}} in URLLC service or TDD systems, short pulses are desirable to enable low-latency transmission of packets spread over very few symbols and fast switching between uplink and downlink. Long symbols, on the contrary, would yield long transitions times {{due to their}} symbol tails. Given these circumstances, pulse-shaped OFDM with small overlapping factor K should be chosen, basically extending the symbol duration by up to half the symbol interval at maximum, i.e. K∈ [1; 1.5]. If K∼ 1 is chosen, the solution reduces to W-OFDM. Considering the numerology design for these cases, e.g., subcarrier <b>spacing,</b> <b>symbol</b> interval, and symbol overhead, the methodology for OFDM/W-OFDM systems described in Section 2.3 can be adopted, followed by an optimization of the designed pulse shape. It should be noted here that a larger CP length allows for improving the spectral containment, similar as increasing the symbol length characterized by the overlapping factor K, as indicated in Table 8. Hence, balancing between CP length and symbol length may be a useful consideration in some scenarios to allow finding the optimum solution.|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{method of}} quantum phase space is very useful in {{physical}} applications like quantum optics and non-relativistic quantum mechanics. However, attempts to generalize {{it for the}} relativistic case lead to some difficulties. One of problems is band structure of energy spectrum for a relativistic particle. This corresponds to an internal degree of freedom, so-called charge variable. In physical problems we often deal with such of dynamical variables that do not depend on this degree of freedom. These are position, momentum, and any combination of them. Restricting our consideration {{to this kind of}} observables we propose the relativistic Weyl–Wigner–Moyal formalism that contains some surprising differences from its non-relativistic counterpart. This paper is devoted to the phase space formalism that is specific representation of quantum mechanics. This representation is very close to classical mechanics and its basic idea is a description of quantum observables by means of functions in phase <b>space</b> (<b>symbols)</b> instead of operators in the Hilbert space of states. The first idea about this representation has been proposed {{in the early days of}} quantum mechanics in the well-known Weyl work [1]. Let us put the operator Â, which acts in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system, into correspondence to a function on the phase <b>space</b> (<b>symbol)</b> A(p, q) according with the following rule Â = A(p, q) ˆ W (p, q) dpdq, (1) where ˆ W (p, q) is an operator generalization of δ-function that is called operator of quasiprobability density.
