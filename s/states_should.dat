5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
50|$|The {{justification}} {{of the state}} refers {{to the source of}} legitimate authority for the state or government. Typically, such a justification explains why the <b>state</b> <b>should</b> exist, and to some degree scopes the role of government - what a legitimate <b>state</b> <b>should</b> or should not be able to do.|$|R

5|$|In September, Paul {{stated that}} the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> avoid {{military}} intervention in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims {{that the threat of}} military force caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead arguing that the opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1790, the United Belgian States (État-Belgiques-Unis or Verenigde Belgische Staten) {{was officially}} formed with a Treaty of Union. After negotiations, the delegates {{decided that the}} <b>states</b> <b>should</b> be unified into a single polity. A Sovereign Congress was created in Brussels which would act as a {{parliament}} for the whole union. Autonomy over almost all important matters, however, was still decided independently by the states themselves.|$|E

30|$|For his part, Mkandawire (2001 : 308) {{argues that}} the {{developmental}} <b>state</b> <b>should</b> operate {{within the context of}} ‘democratic politics”. This means that all of the activities of the <b>state</b> <b>should</b> be shaped by major democratic principles such as consultation, debate, pluralism and accountability. Importantly, the <b>state’s</b> modus operandi <b>should</b> be framed by a “development ideology” that prioritizes socio-economic development, and the resulting transformation of the lives of citizens.|$|R

5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab {{resistance}} and violence to this influx of immigrants {{came to a head}} in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two <b>states</b> <b>should</b> be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Friedman {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II. Friedman believed the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> enter the war. In 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University (headed by W. Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he {{spent the rest of}} World War II working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project's director. He {{tightened}} security, which dried up {{the flow of information}} to Britain. American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.|$|E
30|$|These {{results are}} robust to {{controlling}} for two relevant variables. As expected, those individuals that regard {{the state as}} efficient think that the <b>state</b> <b>should</b> play {{a greater role in}} reducing economic and social risks. 8 The impact of interest in politics operates according to the theory. Those that have less interest in politics tend to endorse the view that the <b>state</b> <b>should</b> play a secondary role in its social functions. However, respondents with less interest in politics also think that the <b>state</b> <b>should</b> provide jobs and this holds after controlling for their employment status and other socio-demographic characteristics. There are other consistent patterns that show in the results, all in the expected direction. Respondents who enjoy a higher socioeconomic status think that the <b>state</b> <b>should</b> play a less important role in the economy and in the provision of social welfare. The same occurs among more educated individuals.|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E
5|$|Nasser died {{unexpectedly}} in November 1970, with Gaddafi {{playing a}} prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab <b>states</b> <b>should</b> create a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, {{but it was never}} implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.|$|E
5|$|Olver {{has been}} a staunch {{opponent}} of the United States involvement in Iraq, and opposed a United States military presence in Iraq since the 2002 authorization {{for the use of}} force in Iraq. Olver has advocated for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and has consistently voted against proposals to increase funding for military operations and increased deployment. Olver stated that he believes that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such as Iran and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy based primarily on military means in order to create a stable and democratic Iraq.|$|E

5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that <b>states</b> <b>should</b> be able to control their own laws without federal intervention.|$|E
5|$|The MAUD Committee reports {{urged the}} {{co-operation}} with the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> be {{continued in the}} research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|The West German {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the high profile of the prisoners {{and the fact that the}} group had numerous sympathisers, so that terrorist acts aiming at the liberation of the Munich attackers were feared. Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified as likely targets. On 9 September, an anonymous letter was received claiming that such a hijacking was indeed imminent, which prompted the Federal Ministry of the Interior (then led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher) to consider whether citizens of Arab <b>states</b> <b>should</b> be denied boarding of Lufthansa flights.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave <b>states</b> <b>should</b> not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
