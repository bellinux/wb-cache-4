5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> official contacts, and {{the next}} morning the matter was raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed to give him a divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E

5|$|To {{relieve the}} {{garrison}} of Svetigrad, Skanderbeg continually harassed the Ottoman army. Many of these attacks had been surprise ambushes of isolated Ottoman forces. Hoping to evade Ottoman patrols, Skanderbeg moved towards the Ottoman camp. On June 22, Skanderbeg led a night {{attack on the}} Ottoman camp which disillusioned the Ottoman soldiers who had been expecting a quiet campaign. Soon after, when the besiegers were taking their afternoon naps, Skanderbeg sent Moses with some men, again dressed as peasants, inside the Ottoman camp to reconnoiter for a future assault. Skanderbeg <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> troops, encouraging them not to take booty from the camp as this might give the Ottoman forces time to react and launch a counterattack. That night, the Albanians launched their attack, but {{the noise of the}} armor and the neighing of the horses inhibited a complete surprise. The periphery of the camp was thrown into confusion, but the bulk of the Turkish troops gathered and organized themselves, pushing the Albanians out of the camp but not before suffering heavy casualties. To prevent further attacks of this sort, Murad detached a contingent of troops under Firuz Pasha to watch the Albanians but it was prone to desertion and thoroughly destroyed with its baggage train being captured. A breach in the walls of Svetigrad was made, but the following infantry assault was repulsed. The Albanians began to hope that the sultan would now be returning to Edirne.|$|E

25|$|The Apocalypse of Abraham {{told that}} Abraham argued {{to his father}} Terah that fire is more worthy of honor than idols, because its flames mock {{perishable}} things. Even more worthy of honor was water, because it conquers the fire and satisfies the earth. He called the earth more worthy of honor, because it overpowers {{the nature of the}} water. He called the sun more worthy of honor, because its rays illumine the whole world. But even the sun Abraham did not call god, because at night and by clouds it is obscured. Nor did Abraham call the moon or the stars god, because they also in their season obscure their light. Abraham argued to his father that they should worship the God who made everything, including the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth. And while Abraham thus <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father in the court of his house, the voice of God came down from heaven in a fiery cloudburst, crying to Abraham to leave his father's house so that he would not also die in his father's sins.|$|E

25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

The attack invoked a quick reaction from Lalu Prasad Yadav and his cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswan, who too hails from Bihar. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Maharashtra counterpart Vilasrao Deshmukh and urged him to provide protection to the migrants from Bihar.

500|$|General Dwight D. Eisenhower was {{nominated}} for president by the Republicans in 1952. He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate, and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a [...] "smoke-filled room" [...] and recommended Nixon to the general, who agreed to the senator's selection. Nixon's youth (he was then 39), stance against communism, and political base in California—one of the largest states—were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders. Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, New Jersey Governor Alfred Driscoll and Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen. On the campaign trail, Eisenhower <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> plans for the country, leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate.|$|E
500|$|Heraclius wintered in Caucasian Albania, {{gathering}} {{forces for}} the next year. Khosrow was not content to let Heraclius quietly rest in Albania. He sent three armies, commanded by Shahrbaraz, Shahin, and Shahraplakan, to try to trap and destroy Heraclius' forces. Shahraplakan retook lands up as far as Siwnik, aiming to capture the mountain passes. Shahrbaraz was sent to block Heraclius' retreat through Caucasian Iberia, and Shahin was sent to block the Bitlis Pass. Heraclius, planning to engage the Persian armies separately, <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> worried Lazic, Abasgian, and Iberian allies and soldiers, saying: [...] "Do not let the number of our enemies disturb us. For, God willing, one will pursue ten thousand." ...|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{approached}} Gill {{and asked}} him for a place in his chambers. Gill's chambers were full but he did suggest a well-respected barrister named F. E. Smith, and Hastings {{went to see him}} with a letter of recommendation from Gill. Smith was out and Hastings instead <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> clerk; the two did not get on, and Hastings left without securing a place. Hastings later described this as [...] "the most fortunate moment of my whole career". Directly below Smith's chambers were those of Horace Avory, one of the most noted barristers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As he prepared to return home, Hastings was informed that Chartres Biron (one of the barristers who occupied Avory's chambers) had been appointed a Metropolitan Magistrate, which freed up a space in the chambers. He immediately went to Avory's clerk and got him to introduce Hastings to Avory. Avory initially refused to give Hastings a place in the chambers, but after Hastings lost his temper and exclaimed that [...] "if he didn't want me to help him it would leave me more time to myself", Avory laughed and changed his mind.|$|E

500|$|After 17 {{months of}} development, Chahi {{was only about}} one-third {{finished}} with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began {{to take steps to}} simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, Virgin Interactive, was favourable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a point-and-click style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized [...] "the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it." [...] Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used storyboards to sketch {{out the rest of the}} game's plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: [...] "It took six days to create the Earth. Another World took two years"; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project is mirrored in the near-death of Lester at the end of the game.|$|E
500|$|Before his execution, Turpin {{frequently}} received visitors (the gaoler was {{reputed to}} have earned £100 from selling drinks to Turpin and his guests), although he refused {{the efforts of}} a local clergyman who offered him [...] "serious remonstrances and admonitions". [...] John Turpin may have sent his son a letter, dated 29March, urging him to [...] "beg of God to pardon your many transgressions, which the thief upon the cross received pardon for at the last hour". [...] Turpin bought a new frock coat and shoes, and {{on the day before}} his execution hired five mourners for three pounds and ten shillings (to be shared between them). [...] On 7April 1739, followed by his mourners, Turpin and John Stead (a horse thief) were taken through York by open cart to Knavesmire, which was then the city's equivalent of London's Tyburn gallows. [...] Turpin [...] "behav'd himself with amazing assurance", and [...] "bow'd to the spectators as he passed". [...] He climbed a ladder to the gallows and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> executioner. [...] York had no permanent hangman, and it was the custom to pardon a prisoner on condition that he acted as executioner. [...] On this occasion, the pardoned man was a fellow highwayman, Thomas Hadfield. [...] An account in The Gentleman's Magazine for 7April 1739 notes Turpin's brashness: [...] "Turpin behaved in an undaunted manner; as he mounted the ladder, feeling his right leg tremble, he spoke a few words to the topsman, then threw himself off, and expir'd in five minutes." ...|$|E
