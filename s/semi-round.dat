25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost frame member and a <b>semi-round</b> molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap hinges on the inside.|$|E
25|$|She {{made two}} more {{appearances}} at the European Championships after her world medal. The 1954 event saw France beat Austria and Italy {{to qualify for}} the final round, but they performed poorly once there, losing all five games to bottom the group in sixth. She returned to the squad for the 1956 edition and was France's top scorer in the first game (a loss to Hungary). Strong performances by Édith Tavert-Kloechner led France to wins over Germany and Romania. The pair again led the scoring for France in the <b>semi-round,</b> but heavy losses to Bulgaria and the hosts Czechoslovakia saw them eliminated from the tournament. Over the course of her international basketball career, she earned 66 selections, scored 455 points and managed a record high of 30 points in a single game. Her last international game was against Austria at the 1956 European Championships.|$|E

50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1871 in the Italianate style. The 2-1/2 story, gable front house {{originally}} contained clapboard siding with decorative window trims and a large wraparound porch with detailed wood posts. The attic also had two <b>semi-round</b> windows under the front gable.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} at 4 km {{from the small}} town of Boboshevo. It is a small one-nave edifice with internal dimension of 4,15 m to 2,66 m and height of 5,50 m. It has a <b>semi-round</b> apse which is 1,38 m wide and 0,70 m deep. On the eastern side {{to the left of the}} apse there is a <b>semi-round</b> niche (0,45 x 0,52 x 0,37 m) and on the northern side - a rectangular one (0,20 x 0,20 x 0,25 m). The entrance is to the west and is 1,85 m high and 1,25 m wide. The vault is semi-cylindrical. A narthex was added in 1864 with entrance to the north and five arched windows. The floor of the naos is covered with stone plates.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} {{is located in}} the eastern bay, and is topped with a carved panel. An identical panel also tops a slight recess located in the western bay to match the entryway.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{appearance of}} Ayaz Ata {{resembles that of}} Ded Moroz, with his coat, boots and long white beard. Specifically, Ayaz Ata is often shown wearing a heel-length fur coat, a <b>semi-round</b> fur hat, and valenki or jackboots on his feet. Unlike Santa Claus, he is often depicted as walking with a long magical staff. He is often depicted in long silver-blue robes and a snowflake-like crown.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{on a large}} platform in the cemetery {{in the small town}} of Boboshevo. It is a small one nave church with a <b>semi-round</b> apse. It is 8 m long and 5 m wide. There are two niches on the left and the right walls and another small <b>semi-round</b> niche on the northern niche. The church used to have a vault which was replaced with eaves during the reconstruction. A covered narthex was added in the 18th century and in 1926-1927 a new narthex with refectory was constructed. The walls of the church are 0,70 m thick and are made of stone. The church was fully painted from the inside and the western facade was painted from the outside as well according to the canon. According to the hardly readable ktitor inscriptions on the southern wall the church was constructed in 1590 or 1600. Up to 29 October 1862 it used to be the main church of the town. After the construction of the larger Church of St Bogoroditsa, St Athanasius was converted into a cemetery church.|$|E
50|$|Hretska Square, or Hretska Ploshcha (Грецька Площа - Greek Square) {{is one of}} {{the main}} squares of Odessa. It is on the {{crossing}} of Hretska Street and Oleksandrivskyi Prospekt. At different times it has been called Aleksandrovskaya (Александровская площадь) or Martynovskogo (Площадь Мартыновского). This {{is one of the}} biggest squares of Odessa. It is rectangular, with the oval building of Mayurov House in the center, also with <b>semi-round</b> houses on the sides.|$|E
50|$|In the Soviet {{period the}} square was an {{important}} transport centre. Here was the tram station (later the trolleybus station), also the bus terminal. The <b>semi-round</b> house which separated the square from the Bunina Street, was demolished during World War II. The place {{was used as a}} garden in the 1950s and 1960s, but later the modern restaurant building was constructed. Mayurov House was demolished in 1996 and then rebuilt with significant changes.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic {{eyeglasses}} {{mounted in}} popularity throughout the 1950s {{and into the}} 1960s, ultimately supplanting tortoiseshell as the most popular material for eyeglass frames. The trend died out in the 1970s with a backlash against 50s and 60s culture, as oversized metal glasses {{in the style of}} the Ray-Ban Aviator became popular. <b>Semi-round</b> horn-rimmed glasses came back into fashion in the 1980s, with tortoiseshell being fashionable amongst entrepreneurs and [...] "yuppies". Wayfarers were popular among New Wave musicians, which popularized them among the late 1970s anti-disco [...] "resistance".|$|E

50|$|Like another Umayyad desert castle, Qasr Mshatta, Qasr Tuba {{was built}} using a {{combination}} of limestone and bricks. Its plan consists of an oblong enclosure measuring 140 m by 72 m, almost a double square, or 2 symmetrical enclosures joined through a long central corridor. The enclosure walls are supported by <b>semi-round</b> towers, except on the north side where the two gateways are flanked by two square rooms. The northwestern section is nearly intact and several lengths of curtain-wall exist on the western side. The rest of the building, which was never completed, is not preserved.|$|E
50|$|It is one nave and one apse church without narthex with wall piers {{which form}} a swallow arc {{on the western}} facade. Its {{dimensions}} are 8,10 x 4,34 m. The vault is semi-cylindrical. The <b>semi-round</b> apse has a small narrow window. It was built of stones and white plaster. The whole interior {{as well as the}} western external wall are painted. The frescoes in the church are relatively well preserved and are an important source {{for the development of the}} late medieval painting in Bulgaria and the Balkans. The church was constructed in the 16th century.|$|E
50|$|Pearls come {{in eight}} basic shapes: round, <b>semi-round,</b> button, drop, pear, oval, baroque, circled and double bouldered. Perfectly round pearls are the rarest and most {{valuable}} shape. Semi-rounds {{are also used}} in necklaces or in pieces where {{the shape of the}} pearl can be disguised to look like it is a perfectly round pearl. Button pearls are like a slightly flattened round pearl and can also make a necklace, but are more often used in single pendants or earrings where the back half of the pearl is covered, making it look like a larger, rounder pearl.|$|E
5000|$|The cultured Tahitian pearl {{comes in}} various shapes, sizes, and colors; shapes include round, <b>semi-round,</b> button, circle, oval, teardrop, semi-baroque and baroque. Because of their darker hues, Tahitian pearls are {{commonly}} known as [...] "black pearls". However, Tahitian pearls have the ability to contain various s and s of green, pink, blue, silver and yellow. All (or any combination) of these colors may be seen in a cultured Tahitian pearl. Due to the variety of shapes and colors of the Tahitian pearl, it has been known to fit in any jewelry setting. The versatility and mixture of color give it its value.|$|E
5000|$|Shallow piers {{divide the}} front facade into three bays, each {{defining}} a storefront. The central bay has a false front rising substantially above the flanking bays and is slightly wider, containing a separate door accessing the second-floor stairs. This center bay has {{a pair of}} square windows, above which is an inset stone carved with [...] "1890 Sundberg Block". A series of five arch-top false windows runs along the upper section of the facade. The flanking bays have <b>semi-round</b> windows on the second floor, each divided in three vertically. Each bay is surmounted by an ornate cast iron cornice.|$|E
50|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost frame member and a <b>semi-round</b> molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap hinges on the inside.|$|E
5000|$|The Wright House is {{a massive}} 2-1/2 story brownish-gray {{sandstone}} Richardsonian Romanesque structure with a tiled gable and hip roof. [...] It is rectangular, measuring 67 ft by 36 ft, and sits on a stone foundation. Gables, bays, and porches decorated with balustrades, columns, and stone carving project from the exterior. The entry is through a corner porch with a flat roof and four heavy arches. A two-story gabled bay is immediately adjacent to the entry porch, and a second <b>semi-round</b> porch with heavy columns and a flat roof {{is located in the}} opposite corner. A timber porte cochere was once located near the front entry porch.|$|E
50|$|Michael Pollasky had {{a wooden}} store at this location; it burned down in 1893. Between 1897 and 1902, Pollasky had George S. Young {{construct}} this brick building, using a design from Saginaw architects Haug and Schuermann. It is a two-story brick building trimmed with sandstone, and contains five storefronts {{at the street}} level, separated into bays by vertical brick piers. A sixth, narrower bay contains an entrance to the stairway. A <b>semi-round</b> turret sits {{on the corner of}} the building; it is lacking its original upper story and conical roof. However, the remainder of the second floor retains a high degree of integrity, containing the original double-hung windows with limestone sills and lintels, as well as pressed metalwork with wreaths and garlands near the roofline.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{work is in}} the chancel and nave, {{the latter}} having originally been without aisles. Together, they formed a low narrow building, measuring {{from east to west}} about 104 ft, and about 20 ft in width. The <b>semi-round</b> respond at the east end of the north nave arcade is similar to the jambs of the chancel arch, and possibly indicates the presence of a small transept or chapel. There was a bell turret at the west end of the nave, and a porch on the south side. The 14th century builders nearly doubled the size of the fabric. They took down the north and south walls of the nave, and erected two arcades in their place; that on the north consisting of five arches, and that on the south of three; because the porch was not demolished, but allowed to stand, which piece of conservatism entailed a different proportion of the space. They rebuilt the bell turret on the older buttresses, and they built a new porch. The chancel arch is of two chamfered orders, with a chamfered hood-moulding towards the nave, and is carried on <b>semi-round</b> responds having moulded bases on square and chamfered plinths, and capitals, with square hollow chamfered abaci. It is strengthened with a buttress at the south-east angle. Between the 14th century and the renovation of circa 1845 there were other changes. Around 1845, the easternmost half of the north aisle was taken down and widened three-fold to its former dimensions. A small vestry was added in the late 1860s when a gallery at the west end was removed; the church was newly seated, and new windows were inserted. Some of the roof areas are quite low so that the appear to be roofless; examples include over the nave and an aisle.|$|E
50|$|Built {{in typical}} Welsh style, it {{consisted}} of a D-shaped tower on its western end with smaller round or <b>semi-round</b> towers surrounding a small ward and square central tower. The apsidal tower survives up to a height of 8 ft and used a different source of lime for its coursed mortar that may indicate that it was built at a different time {{than the rest of}} the structure. Two of the other towers are dry stone-built and resemble to those at Cam Fadryn and Pen y Castell. A preliminary 2015 excavation in the southern part of the castle revealed the entrance, a small half-round tower and a length of curtain wall. The excavation recovered two pieces of charcoal that radiocarbon dating yielded dates of 1170-1258 for one and 1220-1271 for the other.|$|E
5000|$|Invisible Walls was a video blog/podcast {{created and}} hosted by editor-in chief Shane Satterfield {{and run by}} the staff of GameTrailers with {{freelance}} journalist Marcus Beer, who originally came to the show on a biweekly basis as the ever-angry character [...] "Grumpy McGrump", as co-host. The podcast was eventually hosted by editorial director Ryan Stevens after Shane Satterfield left GameTrailers after Episode 238. They were often joined by a rotating panel of GT editors including Justin Speer, Daniel Bloodworth, Mike Damiani, Patrick Morales, Chris Nguyen, and (formerly) Miguel Lopez. The show's debut episode was recorded on March 13, 2008 and published the following day. The podcast was a <b>semi-round</b> table discussion show in which the GameTrailers staff members discussed various ongoings in the video game industry, including new video game releases and controversies.|$|E
