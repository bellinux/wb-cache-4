40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{availability}} of a good, complete <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> {{in the early stages}} of a project is widely recognized by industry practitioners as a key factor for overall project success. This paper presents a Project Scope Modeling Methodology for computerized decision support during the definition of a new project scope. The methodology is based on the effective reutilization of historical project <b>scope</b> <b>definitions</b> through the application of Case Based Reasoning (CBR), an Artificial Intelligence approach. In CBR, the previous experiences are reused in solving new situations reducing the complexities of modeling reasoning processes. By using CBR, the scope modeling methodology helps to find and reuse the most relevant historical information, allowing to easily consult and combine information from multiple <b>scope</b> <b>definitions</b> in a computerized environment. The resulting <b>scope</b> <b>definitions</b> are ready to serve as input information for different planning purposes. The application for conceptual cost estimating is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProject <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> is {{the process}} whereby a project is defined and {{prepared}} for execution. It helps to decide {{on whether or not}} to proceed with the project. An incomplete <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> in early stages of a project's life cycle is a common source of difficulty in construction project development process. Meanwhile, the developing of the project can effect positively or negatively a variety of interests. Construction projects in specific bring different degrees of changes on the surrounding environment and people, not only limited at the construction site. Therefore, project definitions boundaries may be redefined, or subjected to differing expectations and interpretation by different stakeholders. The literature suggests that project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> practices and stakeholders’ management are two separate domains, which are often investigated separately. However, project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> practices can benefit from stakeholders’ management theories. Using procedural justice and participation theories to bring together the two domains, this research will contribute to theory and practice in the project management field. The paper develops a conceptual framework of an ongoing PhD research that seeks to answer the main research question ‘How can the level of project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> completeness be evaluated to account for differences in stakeholders’ concerns to facilitate a better project outcome in public building projects? The research aims to develop a procedure that should help a project management team measure the completeness of project <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> with adequate consideration for stakeholders’ inputs at the pre-project planning stage of building projects, thereby facilitating a better project outcome...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} found that poor <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> is one of the {{principal}} causes of project failure in the construction industry.

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{is increasingly}} used in waste management to identify strategies that prevent or minimise negative impacts on ecosystems, human health or natural resources. However, {{the quality of}} the provided support to decision- and policy-makers is strongly dependent on a proper conduct of the LCA. How has LCA been applied until now? Are there any inconsistencies in the past practice? To answer these questions, we draw on a critical review of 222 published LCA studies of solid waste management systems. We analyse the past practice against the ISO standard requirements and the ILCD Handbook guidelines for each major step within the goal <b>definition,</b> <b>scope</b> <b>definition,</b> inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation phases of the methodology. Results show that malpractices exist in several aspects of the LCA with large differences across studies. Examples are a frequent neglect of the goal definition, a frequent lack of transparency and precision in the <b>definition</b> of the <b>scope</b> of the study, e. g. an unclear delimitation of the system boundaries, a truncated impact coverage, difficulties in capturing influential local specificities such as representative waste compositions into the inventory, and a frequent lack of essential sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Many of these aspects are important for the reliability of the results. For each of them, we therefore provide detailed recommendations to practitioners of waste management LCAs...|$|R
