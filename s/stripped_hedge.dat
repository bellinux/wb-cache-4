40|$|Definition of the problem: Evaluation of {{different}} semi-natural habitats {{in three different}} landscapes. Effects on different faunal and floral indicator groups. Project aims: •	Evaluation {{of different}} semi-natural habitats on different faunal and floral indicator groups. •	Assessment of key factors altering community of target indicator groups {{in relation to the}} landscape. Methodology: Three case studies in three different landscapes were performed in order to analyse communities of several arthropod groups (spiders, carabids, butterflies, grasshoppers). FiBL has focussed on the epigeic fauna (carabids). Results, conclusion, state of the art: Ecological compensation areas have altered and partly enhanced carabid communities in all three landscapes. Wildflower <b>strips,</b> <b>hedges</b> and low-input grassland had greatly enhanced carabid. No beneficial effects were found in grassland of high stem trees. Species diversity and abundance of specialized species (stenotopic and microclimatic specilalized) were positively influenced in all three landscapes. Endangered species were found to be enhanced directly, but they occurred most abundant and partly exclusively in ecological compensation areas. EEffects of ecological compensation areas were altered by several site and anthropogenic factors (age, history, botanical aspects) and finally also by landscape factors (e. g. distance to forest) ...|$|R
40|$|While {{interest}} rate swaps and strips of eurodollar futures can serve as substitutes for each other, use of futures necessarily fosters some degree of uncertainty {{with respect to the}} ex post results. Specifically, the practicalities of managing a strip of futures contracts designed to replicate an {{interest rate}} swap subjects the trader/hedger to 1) basis risk, and 2) an exposure relating to the dynamic transactional requirements of the futures position. Appropriate consideration of these aspects is a prerequisite for making ex ante relative value comparisons between swap rates and futures strip yields. Those seeking to convert a floating-interest rate exposure to a fixed-rate, or vice versa, have two choices: {{interest rate swaps}} or eurodollar <b>strip</b> <b>hedges.</b> Conceptually, each solution will accomplish the same end, but they do so using different institutional market mechanisms. Because the two instruments offer the same ultimate service (i. e., converting fixed to floating rates, or vice versa), the pricing of the two alternative financial vehicles should be closely related. Put more specifically, for interest rate swap contracts with maturities bounded by the length of the eurodollar futures strip, the quoted swap rate should correspond to the yiel...|$|R
50|$|Innovative {{projects}} {{at the farm}} include:- Poultry Agroforestry. The farm's organic free-range chickens live in a multi-use field system with <b>strips</b> of <b>hedge</b> habitat, rows of herbs and open pasture. This provides shelter, shade, foraging areas and natural wild food for the chickens. The ground is managed in a rotation between grazed pasture and cultivated cropping.- The Reedbed Water Treatment System. Waste water from the farm, conference centre, processing unit and houses is treated in the constructed wetland habitats of their reedbed system.|$|R
40|$|Though {{construction}} methods vary widely, use {{of physical}} or biological barriers to conserve {{soil and water}} is common throughout the world. Rock or earthen bunds are common physical barriers. Strips of perennial grass, shrubs or trees serve as biological barriers. Often these barriers are arranged on a slope in roughly parallel contour bands. The spacing between barriers has important economic consequences, because distance from the barrier may create patterns of soil fertility and water availability that influence crop yields and because the spacing determines land available for cropping. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a method for determining the optimal economic spacing of conservation barriers and apply that method to spacing of rock bunds in Burkina Faso. The steps in the optimization method include estimating a continuous yield response to distance between barriers, developing a mathematical expression to describe how costs change as spacing is altered, and optimizing using calculus. The method is general and can be applied to determining spacing of any conservation technique that is applied in bands. For example, this method could be adapted to spacing of grass <b>strips,</b> <b>hedges,</b> windbreaks, or terraces. This analysis suggests that the economically optimal spacing of rock bunds on the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso depends on the type of construction, materials transport cost, and how labor is organized...|$|R
50|$|Coal {{dealers and}} shippers during normal times ferried coal from Cumbria and south Wales to east and south-coast ports in Ireland, but the ice-bound quays and frozen coal yards {{temporarily}} stopped such trade. When in late January 1740 the traffic across the Irish Sea resumed, retail prices for coal soared. Desperate people <b>stripped</b> bare <b>hedges,</b> ornamental trees, and nurseries around Dublin to obtain substitute fuel. Also {{affected by the}} Frost were the pre-industrial town mill-wheels, which froze. The machinery was stilled that customarily ground wheat for the bakers, tucked cloth for the weavers, and pulped rags for the printers. The abrupt weather change disrupted craft employment and food processing.|$|R
50|$|Committed {{was first}} {{published}} in 1994, and was drawn and written by former Houston Post editorial cartoonist Michael Fry. The strip centered on a family composed of Liz and Joe Larsen, daughters Tracy and Zelda, and their dog, Bob. It took a single-panel format in dailies, and a typical multi-panel format on Sundays. The comic's humor was based on the two working parents and their trying to raise children. One year after the strip began, Fry began a second <b>strip,</b> Over the <b>Hedge,</b> with T. Lewis.|$|R

He would not believe you--he would hardly believe me--if we told him that this stone had been once a swarm of living things, of exquisite shapes and glorious colours. And yet he can plough and sow, and reap and mow, and fell and <b>strip,</b> and <b>hedge</b> and ditch, and give his neighbours sound advice, and take the measure of a man's worth from ten minutes' talk, and say his prayers, and keep his temper, and pay his debts,--which last three things are more than a good many folks can do who fancy themselves a whole world wiser than John in the smock-frock.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} forty years, the Swiss {{lowlands}} have {{lost much of}} their former value as habitat for wild plants and animals, {{mainly because of the}} effects of modern farming practices. One of the most prominent and charismatic species affected is the Grey Partridge Perdix perdix L. Considering the alarming decline of the Grey Partridge, the Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape (SAEFL) entrusted the Swiss Ornithological Institute in 1991 to undertake a ten year project on “Protection measures for brown hare and Grey Partridge” (Jenny et al. 2002). In this context the “Klettgau” in the canton of Schaffhausen was chosen as study area as {{it was one of the}} two regions in Switzerland where wild partridges still remained in small numbers at that time. To reverse the main cause of the partridge’s decline - habitat loss - the main activity in the early stages of the project was the promotion of ecologically enhanced habitats such as wild-flower <b>strips</b> and <b>hedges.</b> Unfortunately, the already very small partridge population went extinct shortly after the beginning of the project. However, by 1998 the area of partridge-friendly habitats had grown to such an extent that it allowed to launch a partridge re-introduction project. This was undertaken as part of the Swiss Ornithological Institute’s project “Birds as test organisms to evaluate enhanced habitat diversity in agricultural areas” which was launched in 1996. The main aims of this thesis for which the data was collected between 1998 and 2001 are to assess whether Grey Partridges: 1) are able to survive and reproduce in an ecologically enhanced landscape such as the Klettgau, 2) make use of the enhanced areas and, if so, which value they have for them, 3) are disturbed by human and predator activities within the re-introduction area, 4) to conclude if and under what conditions further partridge re-introductions in Switzerland might be successful.

40|$|Viticulture is {{characterized}} by a high use of pesticides compared to other crop industries (Gary et al., 2010),which generates concerns for human health and quality of the environment. Yet the use of pesticides, andother variables of economic importance such as yield, vary a lot among regions and farms within the same region(Meziere et al, 2009). A thorough analysis of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainabilityis then needed to assess and compare existing cropping systems or prototypes of innovative ones. To this end, DEXiPM, a qualitative multi-criteria assessment tool (Pelzer et al, 2013), was adapted to grapevine. A strong interaction with the first users (members of the FP 7 Pure project from France, Germany andItaly) has brought to significant modifications, mainly on the economic and environmental branches. Theworking group has detailed some aspects of the grapevine management such as soil cover and choice of cropprotection products. These changes have been validated by assessing some case studies. A regards the economic sustainability, the selling price considers the expected yield (that may be linked togeographical indications), the certification of specific cultivation practices and the existence of marketingstrategies. The specific case of biocontrol products is considered: they are included in the production cost butnot in the environmental assessment. In the social sustainability branch, few criteria have been modified, such as the risk of contamination by mycotoxinesand the risk of pesticide residues. The three components of the environmental sustainability have been adapted: resource use, environmentalquality and biodiversity. A major change is that the period of cover cropping and percentage of soil coveredhave been introduced as they relate to a number of criteria: water use, pesticide leaching, nitrate leaching,compaction risk, runoff risk and soil organic matter. Pesticide ecotoxicity is assessed with the TFI of a list ofhighly toxic products. The energy consumption criterion has been adapted to include cultivation practicesspecific to viticulture. The organic matter is assessed in relation to specific organic amendments used inviticulture, vine shoot management and soil cover. At last biodiversity has been adapted for both the flora(by considering cover crops, flower <b>strips</b> and <b>hedges)</b> and fauna (by considering the natural enemies in thephyllosphere and pollinators. As a result, the number of attributes of the DEXiPM model for viticulture has been reduced by 10 % comparedto the arable crop version. The assessment of contrasted strategies of crop protection provides evidence that specific features of vineyardmanagement have been captured in the new version of DEXiPM for grapevine...|$|R
40|$|In early 1997, the Malaysian {{stock market}} index began a {{downward}} spiral together with stock markets of several ASEAN countries. On 14 July 1997, Bank Negara of Malaysia gave up the defence of the Malaysian ringgit after jacking up the short rate to 50 % and spending US$ 10 billions on unsuccessful monetary operations. Two years on, much has happened and the Asian crisis appears to be history. However, in many respects, the Asian crisis has had a much greater and more adverse impact on Malaysia than the world market crash in October 1987. This paper analyses the Malaysian share of the 1997 Asian crisis. The Malaysian stock market, often classified as an emerging or developing stock market together with other Asian markets, is shown to possess characteristics distinct from the developed stock markets in the US and the UK. A strong contagion effect in the region was present although it is debatable if {{it was due to}} investor herding behavior or the interrelated cross border trade. There is no evidence that many useful techniques, such as diversification across time, <b>stripping</b> dividends and <b>hedging,</b> have been implemented in the Malaysian context. The Malaysian government has managed the crisis well under the circumstances. In some respects, South Africa has many features similar to those of Malaysia; the close tie with the neighbouring countries, the internal racial conflict, the rich natural resources and the potential for strong growths. There are many useful lessons to be learnt from the experience in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative filters {{have been}} found to {{significantly}} reduce nutrient loads in runoff. This study was conducted to: (1) evaluate the effects of a narrow wheat strip, varying manure application rates, and different overland flow rates on runoff nutrient loads following application of beef cattle manure; (2) determine the upper capacity of a narrow wheat strip to reduce nutrient loads by applying excessive amounts of manure; and (3) compare the effectiveness of narrow wheat <b>strips</b> and grass <b>hedges</b> in reducing runoff nutrient loads. A 1. 4 m wide strip of actively growing winter wheat was located at the bottom of selected 0. 75 m wide by 4. 0 m long plots. Three 30 min simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were applied at an intensity of 70 mm h- 1 to the plots. The wheat strips were effective in reducing runoff loads of NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, and total nitrogen (TN). Runoff loads of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DP), particulate phosphorus (PP), total phosphorus (TP), NH 4 -N, and TN were significantly influenced by manure application rate. The application of manure to meet a 2 -year rather than a 1 -year corn P requirement did not significantly increase DP, PP, or TP loads. However, application of manure to meet a 4 -year P requirement resulted in DP, PP, and TP loads that were significantly greater than those obtained for a 2 -year P requirement. Runoff rate significantly affected each of the measured water quality parameters. The actively growing wheat strips were much less effective than grass hedges in reducing runoff nutrient loads...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{books that}} are {{unambiguously}} Crowley's issued from Day and Seres' press in 1548, when Seres became a freeman of the Stationers' Company. These were a refutation of Nicholas Shaxton's sermon at Anne Askew's burning in 1546, in which Shaxton recanted his evangelical beliefs, a refutation of Miles Huggarde's arguments for transubstantiation in a lost ballad called The Abuse of ye blessed sacrament of the aultare, and An information and peticion, which must have been written before December 1547, since {{it refers to the}} Act of Six Articles as being unrepeated. Crowley's response to Hogarde contains the only source for Huggarde's original poem, since Crowley quotes it in full in order to refute it passage by passage. An informacion and peticion addresses parliament on behalf of economically distressed commoners, and follows an established tradition of social complaint regarding the abuses of wealthy landlords, such as rack-renting, engrossing (the consolidation of several smaller <b>strips</b> into one <b>hedged</b> farm, separated {{from the rest of the}} common land), and enclosure. Appearing in two English editions and two Latin editions translated from the English by J. Heron and possibly published by Stephen Mierdman, the full title is An informacion and peticion agaynst the oppressours of the pore commons of this real me, compiled and imprinted for this only purpose that amongst them that haue to doe in the Parliamente, some godlye mynded men, may hereat take occasion to speak more in the matter then the authoure was able to write. If the wealthy fail to reform themselves, Crowley warns that divine retribution will follow, and he looks to the crown to make things right. This is the pattern of a number of Crowley's subsequent Edwardian publications, and for that reason he has been associated with other social critics of the day, such as Thomas Lever, Thomas Beccon, and Hugh Latimer. Some influential 20th-century historians have referred to these men as constituting a [...] "commonwealth party", but G.R. Elton succeeded in sweeping away this romantic designation. The existence of a [...] "commonwealth party" [...] is now widely rejected, and its supposed members are unlikely to be described in terms of a collective movement.|$|R
