5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is <b>spreading</b> (the <b>spreading</b> rate). Magnitudes of <b>spreading</b> rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the <b>spreading</b> rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor <b>spreading</b> helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid <b>spreading</b> mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid <b>spreading</b> mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} <b>spreading</b> {{peanut butter}} on a slice of bread, then <b>spreading</b> {{an equal amount of}} {{marshmallow}} fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 21 {{emerging}} and developed country currencies, we evaluate {{the impact of the}} Asian crisis on bid-ask <b>spreads.</b> While the crisis had widespread and uniform volatility effects, the <b>spread</b> effects were not uniform across emerging and developed country currencies. For Asian emerging markets, <b>spreads</b> widened and <b>spread</b> volatility increased significantly during the crisis, while developed markets <b>spreads</b> narrowed and <b>spread</b> volatility decreased significantly. We investigate the impact of more flexible and less flexible exchange rate regimes on bid-ask <b>spreads</b> using panel data. In general, countries with tightly-managed regimes have significantly lower <b>spreads</b> than countries with more freely-floating regimes, while controlling for the influence of other factors such as volatility.

5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the <b>spreading</b> mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older <b>spreading</b> mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
