40|$|As {{parallel}} computing resources {{have been too}} expensive {{for most of the}} CAGD community, efficient implementation of algorithms outside of High Performance Computing (HPC) has {{until a few years ago}} been following the sequential programming paradigm. Floating point operations in earlier processors lasted multiple clock cycles. Thus traditional implementations of, e. g., the Cox-de Boor algorithm are tailored to minimizing the amount of floating point operations. Current CPU chips have multiple processors cores (2, 4, 8, 12) each performing multiple floating point operations in a clock cycle. In addition graphical processor units (GPUs) have become programmable <b>data</b> <b>stream</b> <b>processors</b> having up to 480 processors. As most traditional algorithms have been developed withsequential computing in mind, the sequential nature is hard-coded into the algorithm. Accordingly systems for automatic parallelization of such algorithms can not be expected to be readily available. Thereforewe should readdress the algorithmic approach to CAGD challenges to find approaches that are better suited for multi-core and <b>data</b> <b>stream</b> <b>processors.</b> The talk will look at some experiments performed using GPUs as computational resources, and look into other CAGD challenges that could benefit from parallel algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Embedded {{environment}} imposes severe {{constraints of}} system resources on embedded applications. Performance, memory footprint, and power consumption are critical factors for embedded applications. Meanwhile, {{the data in}} embedded applications demonstrate unique properties. More specifically, narrow width data are data representable in considerably fewer bits than in one word, which nevertheless occupy an entire register or memory word and <b>streaming</b> <b>data</b> are the input data processed by an application sequentially, which stay in the system for a short duration and thus exhibit little data locality. Narrow width and <b>streaming</b> <b>data</b> affect the efficiency of register, cache, and memory and {{must be taken into}} account when optimizing for performance, memory footprint, and power consumption. This dissertation proposes methods to efficiently handle narrow width and <b>streaming</b> <b>data</b> in embedded applications. Quantitative measurements of narrow width and <b>streaming</b> <b>data</b> are performed to provide guidance for optimizations. Novel architectural features and associated compiler algorithms are developed. To efficiently handle narrow width data in registers, two register allocation schemes are proposed for the ARM processor to allocate two narrow width variables to one register. A static scheme exploits maximum bitwidth. A speculative scheme further exploits dynamic bitwidth. Both result in reduced spill cost and performance improvement. To efficiently handle narrow width data in memory, a memory layout method is proposed to coalesce multiple narrow width data in one memory location in a DSP processor, leading to fewer explicit address calculations. This method improves performance and shrinks memory footprint. To efficiently handle <b>streaming</b> <b>data</b> in network <b>processor,</b> two cache mechanisms are proposed to enable the reuse of data and computation. The slack created is further transformed into reduction in energy consumption through a fetch gating mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Bioinformatics {{applications}} expression {{profile is}} a critical performance metric in high end genomic data processing. These profiles are compute intensive and offers {{a wide range of}} computation pattern ranging from data base searching applications to highly irregular phylogenetic trees. Such debilating factors lead to poor architecture-application correlation. A prior knowledge of software application would be very useful for an efficient bioinformatics embedded system design. This paper presents an integrated approach for parameterized workload characterization and trace driven simulation at a high end multimedia processor in bioinformatics applications. A set of sixteen widely used bioinformatics applications is selected as benchmark. Software monitoring techniques are used to collect execution traces. Based on the measured results, we investigate both the computation and communication behavior of these applications, including execution time, functional unit utilization, scheduling factors and cache misses. The temporal and spatial localities in gnomic data are also discussed.

40|$|Coherent read misses in shared-memory multiprocessors {{account for}} a {{substantial}} fraction of execution time in many important scientific and commercial workloads. We propose Temporal Streaming, to eliminate coherent read misses by <b>streaming</b> <b>data</b> to a <b>processor</b> {{in advance of the}} corresponding memory accesses. Temporal streaming dynamically identifies address sequences to be streamed by exploiting two common phenomena in shared-memory access patterns: (1) temporal address correlation—groups of shared addresses tend to be accessed together and in the same order, and (2) temporal stream locality—recently-accessed address streams are likely to recur. We present a practical design for temporal streaming. We evaluate our design using a combination of trace-driven and cycle-accurate full-system simulation of a cache-coherent distributed shared-memory system. We show that temporal streaming can eliminate 98 % of coherent read misses in scientific applications, and between 43 % and 60 % in database and web server workloads. Our design yields speedups of 1. 07 to 3. 29 in scientific applications, and 1. 06 to 1. 21 in commercial workloads. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} and dynamic nature of <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> may lead a query execution plan (QEP) of a long-running continuous query to become suboptimal during execution, and hence {{will need to}} be al-tered. The ability to perform an efficient and flawless transition to an equivalent, yet optimal QEP is essential for a <b>data</b> <b>stream</b> query <b>processor.</b> Such transition is challenging for plans with stateful bi-nary operators, such as joins, where the states of the QEP have to be maintained during query transition without compromising the correctness of the query output. This paper presents Just-In-Time State Completion (JISC); a new technique for query plan migration. JISC does not cause any halt to the query execution, and thus allows the query to maintain steady output. JISC is applicable to pipelined as well as eddy-based query evaluation frameworks. Probabilistic analysis of the cost and experimental studies show that JISC in-creases the execution throughput during the plan migration stage by up to an order of magnitude compared to existing solutions. 1...|$|R

A serious challenge with compiler-controlled speculative execution is to e ciently handle exceptions for speculative instructions. In this paper, a set of architectural features and compiletime scheduling support collectively referred to as sentinel scheduling is introduced. Sentinel scheduling provides an e ective framework for both compiler-controlled speculative execution and exception handling. All program exceptions are accurately detected and reported in a timely manner with sentinel scheduling. Recovery from exceptions is also ensured with the model.
