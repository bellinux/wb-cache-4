In the late 1960s the runways and some nissen huts were used by Lincolnshire Police as a driver training and <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> area. In the mid-1960s the testing track closed and the airfield was sold off to agricultural interests.|$|R

It is a {{dedicated}} 877-hectare site with 44 kilometres of road systems, including a 4.7 km 4 lane circular track (speed bowl), 5.5 km ride and handling course, a 1.8 km noise road and 98m diameter <b>skid</b> <b>pan.</b> It is also equipped with an Emissions Laboratory and Safety Test Facility with crash barrier and hyge sled.http://autospeed.com/cms/A_0791/article.html ...|$|R
25|$|It was an {{innovative}} design and used lightweight aluminium along with techniques developed in aircraft production during World War II. As {{well as a}} novel, weight-saving integral design, it also introduced {{for the first time}} on a bus independent front suspension, power steering, a fully automatic gearbox and power-hydraulic braking. This surprised some early drivers, who found the chassis unexpectedly light and nimble compared with older designs, especially as depicted on film on tests at the Chiswick Works <b>skid</b> <b>pan.</b> Footage of RM200 undergoing the skid test at Chiswick was included in the 1971 film On the Buses.|$|R
50|$|Ebisu Circuit (エビスサーキット) is an {{established}} race complex at 1 Sawamatsukura, Nihonmatsu-shi, Fukushima Prefecture, 964-0088, Japan. The complex features 7 individual tracks plus 2 <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> type circuits. The circuits are, Nishi (West), Kita (North), Higashi (East), Minami (South) {{as well as}} Drift Land, the School Course, The Touge (mountain pass) and 'KuruKuru Land' which are the skidpans. The most famous circuit is the Minami or South course which is for D1 and other drifting events. The Higashi or East circuit features a 420 metre long main straight with 20 ground floor pit garages and is used mainly for grip events.|$|R

5000|$|Unable to {{understand}} how truck-driving can be so hard, the presenters each bought a second-hand lorry for under £5,000. May bought a Scania P94D, Clarkson bought a Renault Magnum and Hammond bought an ERF EC11. Clarkson painted his truck black, resulting in multiple visibility problems. Hammond tried to Americanize his truck by attaching a dog kennel {{to the front of}} his truck. May attached many flowers and decorations {{to make it look like}} an Indian truck. After decorating their lorries, they were sent to Millbrook Proving Ground, where the first challenge was to successfully powerslide their trucks on a <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> (as demonstrated by [...] "The Stig's Lorry-driving Cousin"). None of them managed, but May and his truck came out unscathed. Clarkson got [...] "his gear shifter stuck up his arse", while Hammond's dog kennel fell off.|$|R
5000|$|The Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle turns over. This cage is covered by a heavy-gauge sheet metal. An electrical winch with a capacity of 5000 kg can be mounted {{at the front of}} the vehicle if required, and the windshield can be removed. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and two passenger seats to his right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. A full length <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> protects the hull and allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Mitsubishi A-727 fully automatic with a torque converter, there are 3F and 1R gears - the Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle is in 4 x 4 drive all the time. Limited-slip clutches, in front and rear, and inter-axle differentials automatically distribute more torque to those wheels with the most grip. The independent suspension is of a double 'A' design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic telescopic shock absorber at each station. A stabilizer bar is provided for the rear suspension.|$|R
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|R
5000|$|The 1969 Universal {{offered a}} [...] "462" [...] package. It was a limited {{production}} model that featured the V6 engine, front bucket seats and a rear bench, roll bar, heavy-duty frame and springs, a locking differential, oil <b>pan</b> <b>skid</b> plate, rear swing-out tire carrier, full wheel covers, ammeter and oil pressure gauges, padded visors were optional.|$|R
5000|$|The 'six eighty' was {{something}} of an anachronism, built in the traditional style that flagship Wolseley buyers loved, yet the underpinnings were intended to be almost cutting edge for an immediate postwar saloon. It had prewar style radiator, centre hinged bonnet, split windscreen, small oval rear window, and traditional elegant styling {{with a hint of}} running boards,& from inside the driver sat in leather seats & peered over the wolseley hallmark of a polished wood dashboard, down a long high bonnet to the flying W symbol - all dated features by the early fifties, yet it had a monocoque chassis, springless torsion bar suspension, twin telescopic shocks, column gears & powered by a feat of engineering in the shaft driven overhead camshaft big 6.Wolseley had needed to produce a new postwar engine, and turned to their own past experience adapting designs drawn from an aero engine called the Wolseley Viper V8 that started life in WW1 aircraft,latterly the Bristol SE5a,to which there is a visual similarity, the engine appearing quite vintage even for the day.However the formula worked for theres no doubt the 'six eighty' {{made a lot of money}} for Lord Nuffield's corporation, and was the longest ever running favorite of Police forces who seemed to retain cars well into the 1960s when they were a favorite for <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> and mechanical training.

50|$|Stan Butler (Reg Varney), a {{bus driver}} for the Town & District bus company, becomes worried that the {{overtime}} he is making, which his family is using to buy expensive items such as a washing machine, will soon end when the company rectifies its current lack of employees. His concerns become justified when the company decides to revoke a long-standing rule that prevent women from being employed as bus drivers, much {{to the chagrin of}} both Stan and his long time colleague and friend, Jack (Bob Grant). The loss of overtime that he was making, forces Stan to persuade his sister Olive (Anna Karen) to get employment at the company's canteen, yet despite a disastrous start, she and her husband, Arthur, soon discovers that she is pregnant, resulting in her losing her job, and forcing the Butler family to send back the items they can't afford to pay. At the same time, Stan gets into trouble with the company when, while attempting to recover something of Jack's from a woman he had been seeing, he manages to inadvertently demolish both a telephone kiosk and a bus shelter whilst trying to avoid being caught by the woman's jealous husband. Despite his efforts to lie about why he caused the damage, Blakey (Stephen Lewis), the company's Bus Inspector, takes delight that he has to undertake a driving test on a bus <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> in order to keep his job, but soon regrets supervising the test when Stan decides to get his own back on Blakey's amusement by beginning the test with him still on the bus being used for it.|$|R
5000|$|TheXR311 {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle rolls over. This cage is covered by a heavy-gauge sheet metal forming {{the skin of the}} vehicle.An internally mounted electrical extraction winch with a capacity of 5000 kgcan be mounted {{at the front of the}} vehicle if required, and the 2-piecewindshield can be removed to provide greater visibility and protect from flying glass fragments. The glass halves are stored in a mounting bracket on the hood until needed again. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and the passenger seat to the right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. The engine and transmission are at the rear of the hull and there is an external load-carrying platform above this which can take a maximum load of 386 kg. The minimum ground clearance is 11 inches, and a full length <b>skid</b> <b>pan</b> protects the hull and drivetrain, which allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Chrysler A-727 [...] "TorqueFlite" [...] torque converter automatic, with three forward and one reverse gears. The XR311 is a full-time 4WD vehicle. [...] "Trak-lok" [...] limited-slip differentials with a 5.89:1 drive ratio are used front and rear, and a lockable center differential ensures traction to all wheels. The fully independent suspension uses modified Dana 44 centersections, and used many off the shelf parts from the front wheel drive Oldsmobile Toronado / Cadillac Eldorado (e.g., CV joints and boots, spindle and bearings, and 11 inch disk brakes), and is of a double-wishbone design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic telescopic shock absorber at each station. A stabilizer baris provided for the rear suspension to limit body roll. Maximum speed is 80-90 mph for vehicles with the 318ci engine, dropping to 67 mph at full load. Acceleration was 12 seconds 0-60 mph time, falling to 10 seconds with the 360ci engine.|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} at {{temperatures}} above the Leidenfrost point, the bottom {{part of the}} water droplet vaporizes immediately on contact with the hot plate. The resulting gas suspends {{the rest of the}} water droplet just above it, preventing any further direct contact between the liquid water and the hot plate. As steam has much poorer thermal conductivity, further heat transfer between the pan and the droplet is slowed down dramatically. This also results in the drop being able to <b>skid</b> around the <b>pan</b> on the layer of gas just under it.|$|R
50|$|Unit load {{formation}} {{equipment is}} used to restrict materials so that they maintain their integrity when handled a single load during transport and for storage. If materials are self-restraining (e.g., a single part or interlocking parts), then they can be formed into a unit load with no equipment. Examples of unit load formation equipment include pallets, <b>skids,</b> slipsheets, tote <b>pans,</b> bins/baskets, cartons, bags, and crates. A pallet is a platform made of wood (the most common), paper, plastic, rubber, or metal with enough clearance beneath its top surface (or face) to enable the insertion of forks for subsequent lifting purposes. A slipsheet is a thick piece of paper, corrugated fiber, or plastic upon which a load is placed and has tabs that can be grabbed by special push/pull lift truck attachments. They are used {{in place of a}} pallet to reduce weight and volume, but loading/unloading is slower.|$|R
5000|$|Speed {{is divided}} up into {{different}} engine capacity classes and a Jet class (using pulse jet engines). As the name suggests, {{the idea is}} to have the model go as fast as possible. The model is timed over a number of laps, and the pilot must hold the handle controlling his model in a yoke on top of a pole {{in the middle of the}} circle. This is in order to stop the pilot from assisting the model to go faster by increasing the line tension and leading the model (known as whipping). Monoline control systems are common in the US, but international classes require the use of two-line control. Speeds of the fastest models - Class D [...] and Jet - have in the past exceeded 220 mi/h km/h. Current US rules limit the speeds to <200 mi/h km/h by requiring the use of larger lines if 200 mi/h km/h is exceeded. Speed models are usually launched from a [...] "dolly" [...] - a cart that permits a lengthy ground roll for takeoff, but drops away in the air to reduce drag.
