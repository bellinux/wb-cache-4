The ballad opens with the line [...] "I fought for you the hardest, it made me the strongest, <b>So</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> your secrets — I just can't stand to see you leaving" [...] sang with emotional and touching vocals by the singer. The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / So go on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated. BET'a Latifah Muhammad described Beyoncé's vocal rendition as [...] "heartbreaking yet optimistic". [...] "Heaven" [...] closes with a spoken 20-second snippet outro of the Lord's Prayer (...) recited in Spanish by Melissa Vargas, the singer's brand manager. Many critics noted how the song may {{have been inspired by}} the singer's miscarriage. Clare Lobenfeld from Complex magazine concluded that the song featured Beyoncé's coping mechanisms for the loss of her child, which included using humor to hide pain. According to Spin writer Anupa Mistry, it is in line with one of the themes touched on in the parent album, motherhood. On the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] is placed before [...] "Blue", as the penultimate track. It was noted by critics that both songs were antidotes to each other– while the former discusses notions of death, the latter celebrates birth. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle found the inclusion of those songs as the last on Beyoncé {{as a metaphor for the}} entire album [...] "Darkness always gives way to light, and heartbreak, if you hold on, is always followed by hope".|$|E
