5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and {{control of their own}} lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E

5|$|Wallace was {{strongly}} attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution).

5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru {{felt that}} Sastri was too {{sympathetic to the}} British rulers, and too co-operative with them.

The conclave only ended in the July when cardinals started to become ill from the heat, and after French cardinals agreed to vote for Pignatelli despite him coming from Spanish-controlled Naples.|$|E

5|$|On 22 January 1840, {{two days}} after the {{discovery}} of the coast west of the Balleny Islands, <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew of the 1837–40 expedition of Jules Dumont d'Urville disembarked on the highest islet of a group of rocky islands about 4km from Cape Géodésie on the coast of Adélie Land where they took some mineral, algae and animal samples.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort.

In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian nobility {{opposed the}} growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar {{publicly}} advertised this option, either because {{he took the}} offer seriously, or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled expiration date of 1562) was respected by both sides.|$|E
