It is no doubt that many members of the Foroughi Lodge, the chapter Hoveyda would eventually join, harboured and produced many influential politicians of Iran's modern era.

It is well documented that Court Minister Asadollah Alam and General Nasiri of SAVAK, Iran's domestic security and intelligence service, helped expedite the publication of key controversial books against Freemasonry, referencing Hoveyda in each piece. Rumours were also spread by his detractors that he was a Bahá'í, a persecuted religion in Iran, but both he and the Shah denied that he was a Bahá'í.|$|E

5000|$|On 28 June {{were heard}} , former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Agrarian Development; Aldo Rebelo, former Ministry of Defence; Luís Inácio Adams, former General's Office attorney; and Antônio Carlos Stangherlin Rebelo, who was {{responsible}} for analysis of <b>supplemental</b> <b>credits</b> on the National Justice Council. Maria Fernanda said that the delay in the payment of interest rate equalization of the Plan Safra (government's plan to support agriculture) for 2015, did not configure a credit operation, since the non-compliance was not subject to penalty payment in the contract terms. According to former Secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer Janaína Paschoal rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per [...] (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterated that this statement confirmed the infringement materially, she concluded. Aldo Rebelo rejected the accusations that the government spent wantonly in 2015, and that year was characterized by fiscal adjustments and efforts to reduce public spending.|$|R

Nelson Barbosa {{said that}} the {{additional}} credit decrees issued by President Rousseff from June to August 2015 did not prevent the fulfillment of the fiscal target approved by Congress in early 2015 and, {{since it was a}} <b>supplemental</b> <b>credit</b> that had no impact on the target, was not considered a target of primary balance, but to give more autonomy to the allocation of a value already available. Henrique Paim {{said that the}} decrees were essential to the functioning of various sectors of Education, including scientific research and operation of universities. Moreover, according to the former minister, the additional credits are often edited based on revenue generation, provided by [...] "budget units", linked to the Ministry. Also the technicians Zarak de Oliveira, Chatack Carmelo and Georgimar Martiniano, have not seen incompatibility of supplemental decrees with the fiscal target.|$|E

5000|$|In 1972, Berger {{began working}} through the University of Northern Colorado on a {{doctoral}} program designed to create and field test experiential, motivational, and accelerated learning programs. These programs were interdisciplinary, <b>supplemental</b> high school <b>credit</b> courses [...] In 1972, Berger wrote the non-profit corporation Crow Canyon operates under today. Then it was called I-S Education Programs. In 1974, Berger purchased 80 acres of land west of Cortez, Colorado on Crow Canyon and began designing a year round campus [...] He earned his Ed.D. in 1975. His research into learning continued and from 1975 until 1986, Berger, now joined by his wife Joanne, pioneered new and effective learning and teaching techniques. The challenge was taking a student from zero knowledge about SW history and archaeology to working alongside of an academic scholar - and being effective - in two days. The accelerated learning techniques he developed made this possible.|$|R
40|$|There are {{significant}} benefits {{of research for}} the involved undergraduate student. These include exposure to advanced topics, introduction to research methods, and direct interaction with faculty and other students. Faculty and institutions benefit as well by the increased interaction with students – fresh eyes in research projects, more energized research groups, and more engaged alumni. However, there are some challenges in designing a research program to work primarily with undergraduates. These include the students’ lack of exposure to advanced topics, short tenure on the project, and potentially lower commitment to the results. There {{are a number of}} ways to address these concerns, however. Short student tenure and limited background can be offset by breaking up a long-term project into manageable short-term goals, allocating specific deliverables to each student, and implementing a rigorous data reporting and storage system. Motivation concerns can be handled through tying performance to student grades or to an external competition. This paper presents results of applying these techniques in a multi-disciplinary vehicle sensing research project involving sixteen undergraduates over a three-year period. Although individual student time on the project ranged from only three to twelve months, all students were able to contribute to the project. Student activities were grouped into individual and small group tasks, each with specific goals and timetables. Rigorous electronic documentation and data storage techniques were employed to enable new students to come up-to-speed quickly. A mix of course <b>credits,</b> <b>supplemental</b> pay, and an intercollegiate competition were used to maintain student motivation. Project successes include high student satisfaction, conference papers, a demonstration pre-crash sensing system, and participation in an international student competition...|$|R
