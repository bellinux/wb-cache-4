5|$|Numerous climatological factors {{influence}} {{the formation of}} hurricanes in the Pacific basins. The North Pacific High and Aleutian Low, usually present between January and April, cause strong wind shear and unfavorable conditions {{for the development of}} hurricanes. During its presence, El Niño results in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear, while La Niña reduces the number of such hurricanes through the opposite. Global warming may also {{influence the}} formation of tropical cyclones in the Pacific basin. During a thirty-year period with two sub-periods, the first between 1975 and 1989 and the second between 1990 and 2004, an increase of thirteenCategory4 or 5 storms was observed from the first <b>sub-period.</b>|$|E

Archaeologically, this <b>sub-period</b> has not been well-attested to in excavations of Lower Mesopotamia, leading some researchers to abandon it altogether.|$|E
25|$|A major {{geological}} {{feature of}} the Upper Carboniferous <b>sub-period</b> in South Wales is the South Wales Coalfield syncline. The rocks comprising this important area were laid down during the Westphalian Geological Series (or epoch) approximately 314-308 million years ago (Ma), when climatic conditions were equatorial. This Westphalian succession includes a sequence with a thickness of more than 1800 m in the west. The Coal Measures were laid down on a low-lying waterlogged plain with peat mires immediately south of an ancient geological feature known as the Wales-London-Brabant High.|$|E

25|$|Daepyeong {{became a}} large central {{settlement}} in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another nucleated settlement of 115 pit-houses developed in Okbang {{at about the same}} time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. Perhaps this was due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. Interestingly, this <b>sub-period</b> sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed by those who are buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang.|$|E
25|$|The later <b>sub-period</b> can be summarily {{disposed}} of, for it {{is almost}} entirely {{accounted for by the}} delay between Zumárraga's death on June 3, 1548 and the arrival in Mexico of his successor, Archbishop Alonso de Montúfar, on June 23, 1554. During this interval there was lacking not only a bishop in Mexico City (the only local source of authority over the cult of the Virgin Mary and over the cult of the saints), but also an officially approved resident at the ermita – Juan Diego having died in the same month as Zumárraga, and no resident priest having been appointed until the time of Montúfar. In the circumstances, {{it is not surprising that}} a cult at Tepeyac (whatever its nature) should have fallen into abeyance. Nor is it a matter for surprise that a cult failed to spring up around Juan Diego's tomb at this time. The tomb of the saintly fray Martín de Valencia (the leader of the twelve pioneering Franciscan priests who had arrived in New Spain in 1524) was opened for veneration many times for more than thirty years after his death in 1534 until it was found, on the last occasion, to be empty. But, dead or alive, fray Martín had failed to acquire a reputation as a miracle-worker.|$|E
2500|$|The Lake Abert sites {{represent}} {{at least}} 11,000 years of human occupation. [...] Archeologists have divided the occupation timeline into six periods. [...] The oldest is the Initial Archaic period from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. [...] This period is {{identified by the}} Great Basin stemmed projectile points found at the Initial Archaic sites. [...] The second period is the Early Archaic which stretched from 7,000 to 4,000 years ago. [...] This period is identified by the northern side-notched points found at Early Archaic locations. [...] The Middle Archaic period covers 4,000 to 2,000 years ago and {{is divided into two}} sub-periods.

If valuations are not available when each flow occurs, the time-weighted return can only be estimated by linking returns for contiguous <b>sub-periods</b> together geometrically, using <b>sub-periods</b> {{at the end of which}} valuations are available. Such an approximate time-weighted return method is prone to overstate or understate the true time-weighted return.|$|R
50|$|During <b>sub-period</b> IA, {{the late}} Harappan {{people lived in}} houses of burnt brick and built mud {{platforms}} to protect against flooding. During <b>sub-period</b> IB, the late Harappan pottery continued, but {{a new form of}} pottery (the PGW) was introduced. Initially, the PGW people lived in thatched wattle-and-daub huts, but later they began to build mud-walled houses. One large house had thirteen rooms and a courtyard, and may have belonged to a chief. Towards the end of <b>sub-period</b> IB, the PGW people began to use burnt bricks, but no complete structures have been found. During both phases, cattle, sheep, and pig were domesticated, but horse bones have only been found in <b>sub-period</b> IB. Six oval structures from this <b>sub-period</b> may have had some ritualistic use.|$|E
50|$|Geometric Order (Retrograde) - The other {{approach}} is to arrange the sub-periods geometrically and reverse {{the direction of the}} sub-periods in line with the retrograde order of the astrological ages. For example, if applying the Aries to Pisces method, the first <b>sub-period</b> of any astrological age is Pisces, followed by Aquarius, Capricorn, and so on, until the last <b>sub-period</b> - Aries. Charles Carter indicated there was some merit to this approach. If applying the dwadasamsa <b>sub-period</b> system geometrically for example the first <b>sub-period</b> in the Aquarian Age is Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, Scorpio, and so on, until the last <b>sub-period</b> - Aquarius.

The null that the CAPM {{intercepts}} are zero is tested for ten size-based stock portfolios and for twenty five book-to-market sorted portfolios using five-year, ten-year and longer <b>sub-periods</b> during 1965 - 2004.

The conventional test rejects the null for almost all <b>sub-periods,</b> {{which is consistent with}} the evidence in the literature. By contrast, the null is not rejected for most of the <b>sub-periods</b> by the new HAR tests developed by Kiefer et al. (2000), Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005), and Sun et al. (2008).
