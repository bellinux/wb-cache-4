50|$|Over-expression {{of certain}} miRNAs may {{directly}} reduce expression of specific DNA repair proteins. Wan et al. referred to 6 DNA repair genes that are directly {{targeted by the}} miRNAs indicated in parentheses: ATM (miR-421), RAD52 (miR-210, miR-373), RAD23B (miR-373), MSH2 (miR-21), BRCA1 (miR-182) and P53 (miR-504, miR-125b). More recently, Tessitore et al. listed further DNA repair genes that are directly targeted by additional miRNAs, including ATM (miR-18a, miR-101), DNA-PK (miR-101), ATR (miR-185), Wip1 (miR-16), MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 (miR-155), ERCC3 and ERCC4 (miR-192) and UNG2 (mir-16, miR-34c and miR-199a). Of these miRNAs, miR-16, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-34c, miR-125b, miR-101, miR-155, miR-182, miR-185 and miR-192 are among those identified by <b>Schnekenburger</b> and Diederich as over-expressed in colon cancer through epigenetic hypomethylation. Over expression of {{any one of these}} miRNAs can cause reduced expression of its target DNA repair gene.|$|E

The {{configuration}} of the C N double bond of the title compound, C 7 H 6 BrNO, is E; the non-H atoms are approximately coplanar (r. m. s. deviation = 0. 038 A ˚). In the crystal, pairs of molecules are linked {{by a pair of}} O—H N hydrogen bonds about a center of inversion, generating hydrogenbonded dimers.

3000|$|... qRT-PCR was {{performed}} using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 Real-Time PCR Detection System (MJ Research) and SYBR Green qPCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems) and primers for {{the genes of}} interest as listed in Table S 1. All experiments were performed at least in triplicates. The relative differences in qRT-PCR among samples were determined by the ΔCT value as described previously (<b>Schnekenburger</b> et al., 2007). Hence, the ΔCT value for each sample was calculated by subtracting cycle threshold (CT) value (obtained from the means of replicates) of the input DNA (or Gapdh signal) from that of each sample in order to normalize ChIP assay (or to normalize gene expression) results. The ΔΔCT value was calculated by subtracting control ΔCT values from the corresponding experimental ΔCT values. The resulting values were converted to fold changes over control by raising 2 {{to the power of}} −ΔCT values.|$|E

30|$|ChIP was {{performed}} following the protocol described previously (<b>Schnekenburger</b> et al., 2007). Briefly, cells were fixed for 10 min with 1 % formaldehyde, followed by addition of 0.125 mol/L glycine for 5 min to stop cross-linking. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in cell lysis buffer (5 mmol/L PIPES [pH 8.0], 85 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 % NP- 40, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) for 10 min on ice. The nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in nucleus lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 10 mmol/L EDTA, 1 % SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin was sheared to a size range of 0.3 to 0.8 kb by sonication. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, chromatin was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with a 50 % gel slurry of protein A-agarose beads saturated with salmon sperm DNA (Upstate), and then diluted {{three times in}} IP dilution buffer (16.7 mmol/L Tris-Cl [pH 8.1], 167 mmol/L NaCl, 1.2 mmol/L EDTA, 1.1 % Triton X- 100, 0.01 % sodium dodecyl sulfate) with 10 % of the supernatants used as input. The diluted chromatin was incubated with antibodies specific for the proteins of interest for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of a 50 % gel slurry of protein A-agarose and incubation overnight (Upstate). The agarose beads were pelleted and washed twice with 1 × dialysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.2 % Sarkosyl) and four times with IP wash buffer (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl [pH 9.0], 500 mmol/L LiCl, 1 % NP- 40, 1 % deoxycholic acid). Precipitated chromatin complexes {{were removed from the}} beads by incubation with elution buffer (50 mmol/L NaHCO 3, 1 % SDS) with mild vortexing. This step was repeated, and the eluates were combined. Cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 mol/L and incubating overnight at 65 °C in the presence of RNase A. Samples were then digested with proteinase K at 45 °C for 1.5 h. DNA was purified by chromatography on QIAquick columns (QIAGEN) and eluted in double-distilled water for further qPCR analysis.|$|E
