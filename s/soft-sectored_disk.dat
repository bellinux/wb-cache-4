5000|$|When a <b>soft-sectored</b> <b>disk</b> is {{low-level}} [...] "formatted", each {{track is}} written {{with a number}} of bytes calculated to fit within 360 degrees at the highest expected motor speed; identification data showing where each sector should start is written at this time. The system of punched holes used by hard-sectored disks is not needed; a single hole is retained to indicate the start of the track (-inch disks use an alignment pin rather than a hole). If the motor is spinning any slower than the highest acceptable speed, which is usually the case, the data will fit in fewer than 360 degrees, resulting in a gap {{at the end of the}} track. Additionally, if a sector were to be rewritten on a drive running faster than the drive was running when the track was formatted, the new data would be larger (occupy more degrees of rotation) than the original sector. Therefore, during formatting a gap must be left between sectors to allow a rewritten sector to be larger without over-writing the following sector.|$|E
2500|$|Another LED/photo-transistor pair {{located near}} the center of the disk detects the index hole once per {{rotation}} in the magnetic disk; it is used to detect the angular start of each track [...] and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed. Early 8‑inch and 5¼‑inch disks had physical holes for each sector and were termed hard sectored <b>disks.</b> Later <b>soft-sectored</b> <b>disks</b> have only one index hole, and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low-level software from patterns marking the start of a sector. Generally, the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks, with only the disks and controllers differing. Some operating systems utilizing soft sectors, such as Apple DOS, do not use the index hole; the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor; this was mainly a hardware cost-saving measure.|$|R

50|$|It was a disk-based {{operating}} system, using 256-byte sectors on <b>soft-sectored</b> floppies; the <b>disk</b> structure used linkage bytes in each {{sector to}} indicate the next sector in a file or free list. The directory structure was much simplified as a result. TSC (and others) provided several programming languages including BASIC in two flavors (standard and extended) and a tokenizing version of extended BASIC called Pre-compiled BASIC, FORTH, C, FORTRAN, and PASCAL.|$|R

Other computers received nicknames, such as Lucy Van Pelt, Pournelle's [...] "fussbudget" [...] IBM PC, and he referred to generic PC compatibles as [...] "PClones". Pournelle often denounced companies that announced products without delivering them, sarcastically writing that they would arrive [...] "", later abbreviated to just [...] "RSN". As part of a redesign in June 1984, the magazine renamed the popular column to [...] "Computing at Chaos Manor", and the accompanying letter column became [...] "Chaos Manor Mail". After the print version of Byte ended publication in the United States, Pournelle continued publishing the column for the online version and international print editions of Byte. [...] In July 2006, Pournelle and Byte declined to renew their contract and Pournelle moved the column to his own web site, Chaos Manor Reviews.|$|R
