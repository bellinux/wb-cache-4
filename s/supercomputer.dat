5|$|On September 16, 2007, due {{in large}} part to the {{participation}} of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so. Top500's fastest <b>supercomputer</b> at the time was BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS. The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS, followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 20 and September 28, 2008 respectively. On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008's fastest <b>supercomputer</b> was IBM's Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS. On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.|$|E

Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton can communicate while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus UNIVAC with 256 gigabytes of random-access memory.|$|E
5|$|The Cray-3 was {{originally}} slated for delivery in 1991. This was {{during a time}} when the <b>supercomputer</b> market was rapidly shrinking from 50% annual growth in 1980, to 10% in 1988. At the same time, Cray Research was also working on the Y-MP, a faster multi-processor version of the system architecture tracing its ancestry to the original Cray-1. In order to focus the Y-MP and Cray-3 groups, and with Cray's personal support, the Cray-3 project moved to a new research center in Colorado Springs.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the same}} time frame, while {{computer}} clusters used parallelism outside the computer on a commodity network, <b>supercomputers</b> began to use them within the same computer. Following {{the success of the}} CDC 6600 in 1964, the Cray 1 was delivered in 1976, and introduced internal parallelism via vector processing. While early <b>supercomputers</b> excluded clusters and relied on shared memory, in time some of the fastest <b>supercomputers</b> (e.g. the K computer) relied on cluster architectures.|$|R
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a <b>supercomputer.</b> By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University {{aspires to}} become a top twenty-five public {{research}} university with at least one-third of its PhD programs {{ranked in the top}} 15 nationally.

The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research. Other milestones at the university include the first ETA10-G/8 <b>supercomputer,</b> capable of 10.8 GFLOPS in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the Cray-2/8, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.|$|E
5|$|Jennings slowly {{began to}} chip away at Rutter's record, first by winning $714.29 in 2006 {{as part of the}} Mob on NBC's 1 vs. 100. A year later, Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the $100,000 top prize by {{defeating}} Ogi Ogas in the final round. Finally, on October 10, 2008, Jennings passed Rutter by winning $500,000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. He extended the record by winning $300,000 in The IBM Challenge, where he and Rutter took on IBM <b>supercomputer</b> Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy! event. Rutter won $200,000 in the challenge, in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity. He then added $100,000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game, raising his total to $3,555,102, second only to Jennings' $3,923,414.29.|$|E

50|$|Development of the R8000 {{started in}} the early 1990s at Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). The R8000 was {{specifically}} designed to provide the performance of circa 1990s <b>supercomputers</b> with a microprocessor instead of a central processing unit (CPU) built from many discrete components such as gate arrays. At the time, the performance of traditional <b>supercomputers</b> was not advancing as rapidly as {{reduced instruction set computer}} (RISC) microprocessors. It was predicted that RISC microprocessors would eventually match the performance of more expensive and larger <b>supercomputers</b> {{at a fraction of the}} cost and size, making computers with this level of performance more accessible and enabling deskside workstations and servers to replace <b>supercomputers</b> in many situations.|$|R
