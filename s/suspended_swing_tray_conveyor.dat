50|$|The longest {{conveyor}} system {{in an airport}} is the Dubai International Airport baggage handling system at 63 km. It was installed by Siemens and commissioned in 2008, and has a combination of traditional belt <b>conveyors</b> and <b>tray</b> <b>conveyors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ninja is {{the only}} Arrow Dynamics <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> coaster west of the Mississippi River. The other three <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> {{coasters}} in North America (Vortex at Canada's Wonderland, Iron Dragon at Cedar Point, and The Bat at Kings Island) are all east of the Mississippi.|$|R
50|$|Standard type of {{vibratory}} fluidized dryer {{consist of}} vibrating <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor</b> where hot gases from the chamber will {{flow through the}} holes within the tray and {{come in contact with}} the materials to be dried. The tray area is big enough to tolerate constant flow of material through the bed and passed along the deck with a low depth on the tray. The vibrations to the deck are directed in vertical component to assist in fluidization of the material whereas the horizontal component of the vibration, support in transporting materials along the tray.|$|R
25|$|The BHS {{was built}} by Toyo Kanetsu and in 2006 a {{contract}} to extend the system from the satellite building to the ERL (Express Rail Link) platform in the Main Terminal Building was awarded to Siemens. The new system from Siemens will transport baggage between the two terminals at speeds of up to 36km per hour, compared to the previous rate of 7.2km per hour. The new system uses a high-speed <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor</b> system in which bags are placed on individual trays for better control and tracking at high speed compared to conventional belt conveyors enables the baggage to be checked-out in KL Sentral once the operator of KLIA Express, ERL Berhad introduce the new facility.|$|R
50|$|Iron Dragon's {{previous}} {{color scheme}} was red track with gray supports, similar paint schemes {{to that of}} Ninja's at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Vortex at Canada's Wonderland (both are also Arrow <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> coasters). In 2004, the supports were repainted yellow, giving Iron Dragon the same paint scheme as Top Thrill Dragster.|$|R
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} derive their trucks from road applications, Tatra T815 was purposely designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions {{are derived from}} the off-road original concept. The principle consists in a central load-carrying tube with independently <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> half-axles bolted as one whole. This gives Tatra vehicles outstanding driving qualities in the most difficult terrains. The concept allows higher off-road speed compared to classical rigid axle design.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{conscious}} of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little impatience, as I replied: [...] "The exhibition of a splendid intellect." [...] My young lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn't prepared for another question I hastily pursued: [...] "The sight of a great <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> crystal--huge lucid lustrous, a block of light--flashing back every impression of life and every possibility of thought!" ...|$|R
40|$|Describes a fowl {{harvesting}} {{apparatus that}} receives fowl which are conveyed upwardly and deposited in a metering tray which actuates a switch {{to cut off}} the conveyor when a desired number of fowl have been deposited in the tray. The tray is then moved downwardly on a supporting framework to be positioned adjacent an open coop compartment of a multi-compartment coop unit following which the tray is pivoted to deposit the fowl in the associated coop compartment. The multi-compartment coop unit is shiftable into one of two positions in which one of two vertically aligned banks of coop compartments is positioned in alignment with the fowl receiving and depositing <b>tray.</b> <b>Conveyor</b> is provided for removing the multi-compartment coop unit following the filling of same so as to permit the positioning of an empty multi-compartment coop unit on the apparatus for subsequent filling purposes...|$|R
5000|$|A Suspended Family Coaster is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} built by Vekoma designed {{for families with}} no inversions. Just like all inverted roller coasters the train runs under the track with the seats directly attached to the wheel carriage. This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> coaster, which runs under the track, but [...] "swings" [...] via a pivoting bar attached to the wheel carriage.|$|R
2500|$|Next to the pier, {{of which}} the {{concrete}} portion is largely intact, sits an empty, circular cement pool which was once a ride. Beach-goers could sit in <b>suspended</b> <b>swing</b> seats, and be taken for rides around the [...] pool via a motor in the pool's center. Later, the swing seat apparatus was removed, and a center fountain was put in its place. The pool is now filled in with dirt and grass. Plans are to rebuild the Pier.|$|R
50|$|Vampire (originally named The Vampire) is an Arrow <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> {{roller coaster}} at Chessington World of Adventures Resort theme park in London, England. It opened in 1990 {{in the new}} Transylvania area, and in 2017 {{continued}} into the areas new theme of the Wild Woods. The ride was designed by John Wardley. During the 2001 season, Vampire was closed {{so that it could}} be modified to use new trains, and reopened in 2002. The ride has a gothic theme, and its station features strong theming, including an animatronic organist.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} and reliability of the mechanized transplanting, a vegetable seedling automatic conveying system was designed. The functional execution component of the system consists of a tank-wheel storage seedling mechanism, a seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor,</b> and a hanging cup circulating conveying mechanism. Combined with the communication technology between host computer and programmable logic controller (PLC), the user interface software of automatic conveying system for potted vegetable was developed by using Visual Studio to control and monitor the transmission progress. The PVDF pressure sensor was used to detect the pressure change of the seedling storage disk to obtain the information of the loading seedling tray. The limit switch and stroke switch were combined to obtain the information of the push rod and feed plate. The timing of each component {{is controlled by the}} PLC controller combined with the feedback information of each sensor. The test results show the effect of taking an individual seedling is excellent, the error rate of the pushing mechanism is about 2.08 %, and the success rate was 97.91 %.|$|R
50|$|As {{the ride}} started to age, it {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} breakdowns and maintenance problems. The manufacturer, Arrow Dynamics, had gone bankrupt since the ride had been built, meaning little could be done to rectify these issues. The Vampire was closed for the 2001 season, and at the time this was thought to be permanent. However, instead of removal, the decision was taken to modify the ride so that it could use a new type of suspended coaster train. The track was to remain unchanged because modifying this would require planning permission, which was unlikely to be granted. Since the ride consisted of the <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> model, with tight corners, any new trains would also {{have to be able to}} swing (reducing lateral Gs). This led to the development of <b>swinging</b> <b>suspended</b> floorless coaster trains, manufactured by Vekoma, which are still in use today. The modified ride opened in 2002, under the same name as the previous incarnation.|$|R
30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling <b>tray</b> enters the <b>conveyor</b> belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988 Ninja, [...] "The Black Belt of Roller Coasters", opened. Built by Arrow Dynamics, it was {{the first}} <b>suspended</b> <b>swing</b> roller coaster on the West coast. Ninja has gone through very few changes since it was opened in 1988; evidently only the wheels and paint have been changed.Tidal Wave opened in 1989. It is a short, wet ride {{featuring}} a large boat that travels up a low-angled incline to a level water trough. The trough, {{in the shape of a}} semicircle, ends in a steep drop into a large splashpool. The impact displaces large amounts of water on its riders. The ride's exit ramp crosses over the splashpool, allowing willing patrons leaving the ride to get soaked from the splash.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparatus}} {{in which}} the Salmon ova were deposited was placed between decks and was of two kinds—one hung on gimbals {{in the same manner}} as a mariner's compass, the other suspended on the principle of an ordinary <b>swinging</b> <b>tray.</b> Both were of wood,—the gimbal apparatus consisted of three shallow square boxes, one resting on the other, that on the top being the smallest and was fitted with trays, the bottoms of which were formed of parallel glass rods upon which the Ova were placed. The suspended apparatus consisted of a pyramid formed by three shallow square boxes placed one above the other in such a manner as to leave spaces between them, the lowest being four feet square, the bottoms of the trays in this being formed of perforated pure tin, on which rested one inch of gravel and in and upon the gravel the Ova were deposited. The suspended apparatus was varnished under the superintendence of Professor Pepper, Chemical Lecturer at the Polytechnic, the other by the Carpenter with common shell-lac varnish...|$|R

"Well, you see, Miss Renshaw, you ladies have an {{objection}} to my smoking my pipe below; and besides, {{what with the}} groans and moans from the cabins, and the clatter of the <b>swinging</b> <b>trays,</b> and {{the noise of the}} waves, and one thing and another, there is little to tempt me to stay below But really I shall be very glad when it is over. The ship has been doing splendidly; and as the wind has blown from the same quarter the whole time, the sea though very high is regular, and everything is going on well. Still a gale is a gale, and you can never answer for the vagaries of the wind. If it were to veer round to another quarter, for instance, you would in a few hours get a broken sea here that would astonish you, and would try all the qualities of the Flying Scud. Then again we have been running south with tremendous speed for the last three days, and if it were to go on for a few days longer we might find ourselves down among the ice. Therefore, I say, the sooner the gale is over the better I shall be pleased." ...|$|R

500|$|The relief, however, was dashed {{in early}} March by {{news of the}} Damascus affair. Reports that the Jews of Damascus had confessed to having murdered Father Thomas {{reinforced}} the belief of the Christian community in the ritual murder charge. The British consul reported that [...] "the Greeks cried loud that justice had not been rendered to them and that the rabbi and chiefs {{ought to have been}} imprisoned… In order to keep the populace quiet… it was decided that these should be arrested." [...] Eight Jews were arrested, including the chief rabbi and David Mizrahi, who were tortured by being <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> from hooks in the ceiling {{in the presence of the}} European consuls. Mizrahi lost consciousness after six hours, while the rabbi was kept there for two days until he suffered a hemorrhage. Nevertheless, neither confessed and they were released after a few days. The other six Jews remained in prison in early April.|$|R

50|$|Ninja is an Arrow Dynamics/Vekoma steel {{roller coaster}} {{located in the}} Studio Backlot section of Six Flags St. Louis in Eureka, Missouri. The ride {{features}} a loop, a sidewinder, and a double corkscrew. It was originally built for and located at Expo '86 in Vancouver, B.C., operating as Scream Machine from May to October 1986. It began operating as Ninja at Six Flags St. Louis in 1989. The coaster was started by Arrow Dynamics, but when Arrow fell into bankruptcy, it was sold to Vekoma, who finished it. The ride is formerly shared a name with Blue Hawk at Six Flags Over Georgia until that coaster's retheming in 2016. Another roller coaster with the same name exists at Six Flags Magic Mountain, but that ride is an Arrow Dynamics <b>suspended</b> <b>swinging</b> coaster. The Ninja, like most modern roller coasters, requires {{a minimum of two}} employees to dispatch the train. One operates the main panel, which controls the restraints, gates, and has a section for the mechanics. The other operator stands at the remote enable. Both operators have to do an all clear sweep and thumbs up, then press their buttons at the same time.|$|R

50|$|Dering {{gained an}} {{interest}} in telegraphy from his teacher Henry Highton. He invented a signal detector using a needle <b>suspended</b> to <b>swing</b> like a pendulum in 1850. This detector {{was used by the}} Bank of England in its company communication system on Threadneedle Street. The Electric Telegraph Company of Ireland used the system in 1852, and Dering was made a company director. Further use was made in experiments by European Telegraph company between London and Dover, and on Great Northern Railway.|$|R
50|$|Suspended {{spindles}} are {{so named}} because they are <b>suspended</b> to <b>swing</b> from the yarn after rotation has been started. Drop Spindles are a popular type of suspended spindle and get their name because the spindle is allowed to drop down while the thread is formed, allowing for a greater length of yarn to be spun before winding on. Suspended spindles also permit the spinner to move around while spinning, going about their day. However, there are practical limits to their size/weight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} a design {{and development of}} a machine which integrated mechanical and enzymatic solutions in the decortications of pepper pericarp to improve the efficiency of white pepper production as compared to conventional water retting method. A power operated enzymatic retting machine for producing white pepper was tested and its performance evaluated. The major parts were grinding surfaces, pectinase solution <b>tray,</b> screw <b>conveyor</b> enclosed in cylindrical drum, and 0. 5 hp motor. Freshly harvested green pepper berries soaked in enzyme solution and the retting machine was operated {{for a period of}} 14 days. For comparison, green pepper soaked in tap water (control) under the same retting condition were conducted. The study showed that the combination of enzymatic process with automated machine have significant influence on process time and finished product quality. The white pepper obtained using the enzymatic retting machine was achieved in only five days and the quality was superior compared to the control...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of DMA analyzers used currently: forced {{resonance}} analyzers and free resonance analyzers. Free resonance analyzers measure the free oscillations of damping of the sample being tested by <b>suspending</b> and <b>swinging</b> the sample. A restriction to free resonance analyzers {{is that it is}} limited to rod or rectangular shaped samples, but samples that can be woven/braided are also applicable. Forced resonance analyzers are the more common type of analyzers available in instrumentation today. These types of analyzers force the sample to oscillate at a certain frequency and are reliable for performing a temperature sweep.|$|R

Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines, and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, <b>suspend,</b> fall, <b>swing,</b> and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying. Some performers use dried or spray rosin on their hands and feet to increase the friction and grip on the fabric.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design of}} novel two-phase fingers to passively reorient objects while picking them up. Two-phase refers {{to a change in}} the finger-object contact geometry, from a free spinning point contact to a firm multipoint contact, as the gripping force increases. We exploit the two phases to passively reorient prismatic objects from a horizontal resting pose to an upright secure grasp. This problem is particularly relevant to industrial assembly applications where parts often are presented lying on <b>trays</b> or <b>conveyor</b> belts and need to be assembled vertically. Each two-phase finger is composed of a small hard contact point attached to an elastic strip mounted over a V-groove cavity. When grasped between two parallel fingers with low gripping force, the object pivots about the axis between the contact points on the strips, and aligns upright with gravity. A subsequent increase in the gripping force makes the elastic strips recede into the cavities letting the part seat in the V-grooves to secure the grasp. The design is compatible with any type of parallel-jaw gripper, and can be reconfigured to specific objects by changing the geometry of the cavity. The two-phase gripper provides robots with the capability to accurately position and manipulate parts, reducing the need for dedicated part feeders or time-demanding regrasp procedures.
