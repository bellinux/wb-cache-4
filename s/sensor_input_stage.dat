40|$|Abstract—Deployment of robots in {{practical}} domains poses key knowledge representation and reasoning challenges. Robots need to represent and reason with incomplete domain knowl-edge, acquiring and using <b>sensor</b> <b>inputs</b> based on need and availability. This paper presents an architecture that exploits the complementary strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models {{as a step}} towards addressing these challenges. Answer Set Prolog (ASP), a declarative language, is used to represent, and perform inference with, incomplete domain knowledge, including default information that holds in {{all but a few}} exceptional situations. A hierarchy of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) probabilistically models the uncertainty in <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> processing and navigation. Non-monotonic logical inference in ASP is used to generate a multi-nomial prior for probabilistic state estimation with the hierarchy of POMDPs. It is also used with historical data to construct a Beta (meta) density model of priors for metareasoning and early termination of trials when appropriate. Robots equipped with this architecture automatically tailor <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> processing and navigation to tasks at hand, revising existing knowledge using information extracted from <b>sensor</b> <b>inputs.</b> The architecture is empirically evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot visually localizing objects in indoor domains.

40|$|Abstract. For {{widespread}} deployment in domains {{characterized by}} partial ob-servability, non-deterministic actions and unforeseen changes, robots need to adapt sensing, processing and interaction with humans to the tasks at hand. While robots typically cannot process all <b>sensor</b> <b>inputs</b> or operate without substantial domain knowledge, it {{is a challenge}} to provide accurate domain knowledge and humans may not have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and accurate feedback. The architecture described in this paper combines declarative program-ming and probabilistic reasoning to address these challenges, enabling robots to: (a) represent and reason with incomplete domain knowledge, resolving ambigu-ities and revising existing knowledge using <b>sensor</b> <b>inputs</b> and minimal human feedback; and (b) probabilistically model the uncertainty in <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> pro-cessing and navigation. Specifically, Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declar-ative programming paradigm, is combined with hierarchical partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), using domain knowledge to revise proba-bilistic beliefs, and using positive and negative observations for early termination of tasks that can no longer be pursued. All algorithms are evaluated in simulation and on mobile robots locating target objects in indoor domains. ...|$|R
