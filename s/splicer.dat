5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a <b>Splicer</b> then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
5|$|The Warner {{brothers}} pooled {{their resources}} {{and moved into}} film production in 1910. Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired {{a job as a}} film <b>splicer</b> in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante's Inferno. Despite the film's success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market. In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success, and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California. In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam. In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion <b>splicer.</b> The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The <b>splicer</b> uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the <b>splicer</b> generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the <b>splicer,</b> by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E

25|$|As a Big Daddy, {{the player}} can attempt to defeat other Big Daddies who are {{themselves}} escorting Little Sisters. Should the player succeed, {{they can then}} choose to either harvest or adopt the Little Sister. While adopted, the Little Sister can lead the player to corpses from whom she can extract more ADAM. While she does this, the player must defend her from <b>splicer</b> attacks and other foes. Once the Little Sister has collected enough ADAM, the player can then return her to an escape vent, where the player must choose to either rescue or harvest the Little Sister. Rescuing her gives the player a modest amount of ADAM but also the possibility of beneficial gifts later; harvesting her yields a large ADAM boost. ADAM can then be spent at Gatherer's Garden machines throughout Rapture to buy new plasmids, gene tonics, slots, or health/eve upgrades. Once the player has either rescued or harvested each of the Little Sisters on the level, the player will be attacked by a Big Sister. The Big Sister's agility and resourcefulness will task the player with a difficult fight before the player can proceed further in the game.|$|E

The Green Goblin kidnaps MJ and tells Spider Man to meet him atop the Chrysler Building, via a piano solo ("I'll Take Manhattan"). Spider-Man accepts, and the two have an epic battle over the audience. The Geek Chorus interrupts, wondering how they can get Spider-Man to defeat his foe; they decide that MJ has been attached to the piano and the Green Goblin pushes it over the side. He gets caught in it and falls to his death, while Spider-Man saves MJ. As he brings her down, they kiss and she asks who he is.

40|$|Transcriptional isoforms are {{not just}} random {{combinations}} of exons. What has caused exons to be differentially <b>spliced</b> and whether exons with different <b>splicing</b> frequencies are subjected to divergent regulation by potential elements or <b>splicing</b> signals? Beyond the conventional classification for alternatively <b>spliced</b> exons (ASEs) and constitutively <b>spliced</b> exons (CSEs), we have classified exons from alternatively <b>spliced</b> human genes and their mouse orthologs (12, 314 and 5, 464, respectively) into four types based on their <b>splicing</b> frequencies. Analysis has indicated that different groups of exons presented divergent compositional and regulatory properties. Interestingly, with the decrease of <b>splicing</b> frequency, exons tend to have greater lengths, higher GC content, and contain more <b>splicing</b> elements and repetitive elements, which seem {{to imply that the}} <b>splicing</b> frequency is influenced by such factors. Comparison of non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> (NAS) mouse genes with alternatively <b>spliced</b> human orthologs also suggested that exons with lower <b>splicing</b> frequencies may be newly evolved ones which gained functions with <b>splicing</b> frequencies altered through the evolution. Our findings have revealed {{for the first time that}} certain factors may have critical influence on the <b>splicing</b> frequency, suggesting that exons with lower <b>splicing</b> frequencies may originate from old repetitive sequences, with <b>splicing</b> sites altered by mutation, gaining novel functions and become more frequently <b>spliced...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of <b>splicing</b> systems (H systems) was initiated by Head in 1987. By restricting the <b>splicing</b> rules of <b>splicing</b> systems, some variants of <b>splicing</b> {{systems such as}} simple and semi-simple <b>splicing</b> systems have been developed.

40|$|Regulation of {{alternative}} <b>splicing</b> {{is controlled by}} pre-mRNA sequences (cis-elements) and trans-acting protein factors that bind them. The combinatorial interactions of multiple protein factors with the cis-elements surrounding a given alternative <b>splicing</b> event lead to an integrated <b>splicing</b> decision.

Using a splicing-sensitive DNA microarray, we assayed 352 Caenorhabditis elegans alternative cassette exons for changes in embryonic <b>splicing</b> patterns between wild-type and 12 different strains carrying mutations in a <b>splicing</b> factor. We identified many alternative <b>splicing</b> events that are regulated by multiple <b>splicing</b> factors. Many <b>splicing</b> factors {{have the ability to}} behave as <b>splicing</b> repressors for some alternative cassette exons and as <b>splicing</b> activators for others. Unexpectedly, we found that the ability of a given alternative <b>splicing</b> factor to behave as an enhancer or repressor of a specific <b>splicing</b> event can change during development. Our observations that <b>splicing</b> factors can change their effects on a substrate during development support a model in which combinatorial effects of multiple factors, both constitutive and developmentally regulated ones, contribute to the overall <b>splicing</b> decision...|$|R
40|$|While 9 % {{of human}} {{pathogenic}} variants have an established effect on pre-mRNA <b>splicing,</b> it is suspected that an additional 20 % of otherwise classified variants also affect <b>splicing.</b> Aberrant <b>splicing</b> includes disruption of <b>splice</b> sites or regulatory elements, or creation or strengthening of cryptic <b>splice</b> sites. For {{the majority of}} variants, it is poorly understood to what extent and how these may affect <b>splicing.</b> We have identified cryptic <b>splicing</b> in an unbiased manner. Three types of cryptic <b>splicing</b> were analyzed {{in the context of}} pathogenic variants in the acid α-glucosidase gene causing Pompe disease. These involved newly formed deep intronic or exonic cryptic <b>splice</b> sites, and a natural cryptic <b>splice</b> that was utilized due to weakening of a canonical <b>splice</b> site. Antisense oligonucleotides that targeted the identified cryptic <b>splice</b> sites repressed cryptic <b>splicing</b> at the expense of canonical <b>splicing</b> in all three cases, as shown by reverse-transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and by enhancement of acid α-glucosidase enzymatic activity. This argues for a competition model for available <b>splice</b> sites, including intact or weakened canonical sites and natural or newly formed cryptic sites.
