The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a <b>small-scale</b> <b>computer</b> was later applied in the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer used in the Instrument Unit that guided all Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered {{to the surface of the}} PCB. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities. Often only the solder joints hold the parts to the board, in rare cases parts on the bottom or [...] "second" [...] side of the board may be secured with a dot of adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside reflow ovens if the part has a large size or weight. [...] Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a wave soldering process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously. Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered together without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a selective solder mask is used to prevent the solder holding the parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates. SMDs can be one-quarter to one-tenth the size and weight, and one-half to one-quarter the cost of equivalent through-hole parts.|$|E

40|$|Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (hereafter VAWT) {{are one of}} {{the useful}} {{renewable}} energy systems. They have several advantages in comparison with the conventional, propeller-typed, horizontal axis wind turbines. VAWTs operate independently of the wind direction. Moreover, maximum power coefficient can be obtained at lower tip-speed ratio compared to the conventional wind turbines. Flow induced noise is therefore smaller than that of the conventional ones. In this paper, we attempt to simulate an unsteady flow filed and aerodynamic noise radiated from VAWT by using the discrete vortex method and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. The result shows that the power coefficient is almost the same as the conventional typed wind turbines. Moreover, the predicted noise level of the developed VAWT is about 70 dB, which is 10 dB lower than that of the horizontal axis wind turbine. We also attempted to estimate noise spectrum by using three dimensional vortex methods. However, the applied vortex methods can not simulate turbulent eddy motions such as the combination process and vortex break down process. Aerodynamic noise simulation by using discrete vortex methods is therefore limited to overall noise level estimation. However, vortex methods are useful to estimate aerodynamic noise from VAWT with <b>small-scale</b> <b>computers.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Software {{frequently}} {{needs to}} adapt its behavior at run time {{to respond to}} changes in its running environment. Many techniques have been proposed to make software adaptable. However, an adaptive system often consists {{of more than one}} piece of software and making single pieces of software adaptive is not enough. An important research problem is the collaboration among elements in an adaptive system. This problem is even more important for distributed adaptive systems because of the distribution and heterogeneity of elements. Existing collaborative adaptation techniques either do not provide an open collaboration interface for existing adaptation techniques, fail to use existing distributed middleware techniques, or are unable to provide platform-independent solutions. This paper introduces a framework called M 2 to support collaborative adaptation in distributed systems.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of computer hardware and open source software, the Beowulf Clusters have become an economic and practical choice of small-and-medium-sized institutions to shorten their research cycle. In many growing Universities, departmental clusters are being set up on the departmental demand for running simulations, rendering and other calculations. Hence, in the University, individual departments may have their own HPC resources. However, the staff and students of these Higher or Further Education Institutes are familiar with various software, which run on different operating systems, e. g. Windows and Linux. Furthermore, the platform-crossing software generally gives Windows users easier and friendlier interface. To support these software, their <b>small-scale</b> <b>computer</b> clusters have to be divided in two or more computer clusters.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} PhD is to {{investigate}} how a methodology rooted in systems engineering concepts can be established and applied {{to the design of}} distributed wide-area visual surveillance systems. Nowadays, the research community in surveillance systems tends to be mostly focused on the computer vision part of these systems, researching and developing more intelligent algorithms. The integration and finally the creation of the system per se, are usually regarded as a secondary priority. We postulate here that until a robust systems-centred, rather than algorithmic-centred approach is used, the realisation of realistic distributed surveillance systems is unlikely to happen. The future generation of surveillance systems can be categorised, from a system engineering point of view, as concurrent, distributed, embedded, real time systems. An important aspect of these systems is the inherent temporal diversity (heterogeneous timing) that arises from a variety of timing requirements and from the parallelisation and distribution of the processes that compose the system. Embedded, real-time systems are often naturally asynchronous. However, the computer vision part of these surveillance systems is commonly conceived and designed in a sequential and synchronous manner, in many cases using an object-oriented approach. Moreover, to cope with the distributed nature of these systems, technologies such as CORBA are applied. Designing processes in a synchronous manner plus the run-time overheads associated with object oriented implementations may cause communication bottlenecks. Perhaps more importantly, it may produce unpredictable behaviour of some components of the system and hence undetermined performance from a system as a whole. Clearly, this is a major problem on surveillance systems that can often be expected to be safety-critical. This research has explored the use of an alternative approach to object-orientation for the design and implementation of intelligent distributed surveillance systems. The approach is known as Real-Time Networks (exemplified by system engineering methodologies such as MASCOT and extensions such as DORIS). This approach is based conceptually on conceiving solutions as being naturally concurrent, from the highest level of abstraction, with concurrent activities communicating through well-defined data-centred mechanisms. The methodology favours a disciplined approach to design, which yields a modular structure that has close correspondence between functional elements in design and constructional elements for system integration. It is such characteristics that we believe will become essential in overcoming the complexities of going from <b>small-scale</b> <b>computer</b> vision prototypes to large-scale working systems. To justify the selection of this methodology, an overview of different software approach methods that may be used for designing wide-area intelligent surveillance systems is given. This is then, narrowed down to a comparison between Real-Time Networks and Object Orientation. The comparison is followed by an illustration of two different design solutions of an existing real-time distributed surveillance system called ADVISOR. One of the design solutions, based on Object Oriented concepts, uses CORBA as a means for the integration and distribution characteristics of the system. The other design solution, based on Real-Time Networks, uses DORIS methodology as a solution for the design of the system. Once the justification over the selection is done, a' novel design of a generic visual surveillance system using the proposed Real-Time Networks method is presented. Finally, the conclusions and future work are explained in the last chapter...|$|E
