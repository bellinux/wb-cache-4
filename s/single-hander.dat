5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The <b>single-hander</b> episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E

His first episode of EastEnders was on 23 November 2000 and he has since directed several notable episodes including Dot Branning's (June Brown) <b>single-hander</b> episode, the Christmas Day 2008 episodes, a live episode on 19 February 2010 celebrating the show's 25th anniversary, which won the award for Best Single Episode at the 2010 British Soap Awards, and the 4466th episode, in which Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) carries the Olympic Flame in a live segment of the episode, which was nominated for Spectacular Scene of the Year at the 2013 British Soap Awards. He has also directed for ITV's Emmerdale and Where the Heart Is, BBC's Holby City, and a special EastEnders spin-off, Perfectly Frank, focusing on the character Frank Butcher (Mike Reid).|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Baby...." [...] is {{an episode}} of the British {{television}} soap opera EastEnders, broadcast on BBC One on 31 January 2008. It is the only EastEnders episode to feature just one character and {{the first of its}} kind in soap. It was written by Tony Jordan, directed by Clive Arnold and produced by Diederick Santer. The episode features Dot Branning, played by June Brown, recording a message for her husband Jim Branning (John Bardon), who is in hospital recovering from a stroke, reflecting Bardon's real-life stroke, which saw him written out of the show and allowed the opportunity for the <b>single-hander</b> to arise. Jordan's scripting was inspired by Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape.|$|E

50|$|Falling {{overboard}} while single-handed {{ocean sailing}} {{is almost certainly}} fatal, {{as there is no}} one to attempt to recover the crewmember who has fallen overboard. However, the nightmare scenario of floating in mid-ocean while watching one's boat sail away under auto-pilot makes many <b>single-handers</b> very cautious. Staying on the boat (by careful and thorough use of handholds, lifelines, and tethers) is undoubtedly the best approach for any sailor, but some <b>single-handers</b> tow a rope astern, as a last desperate chance if they should fall overboard. Modern technology has given us EPIRB, PLB, SART Radar SART and AIS SART devices which can help recover victims of a man overboard (MOB) incident. Additionally the most modern autopilot systems eg NKE Gyropilot have - or can have added as a retro-fit option - remote control handsets which not only allows the autopilot to be remotely controlled from anywhere on the boat but also detects when an individual carrying/wearing one goes over board, sounding the alarm and, depending on type of installation and mode selected, either turning the boat into the wind or locking the rudder hard over on the opposite tack causing the yacht to stall/forereach, in both cases preventing the boat from continuing on its route and allowing a conscious MOB the possibility of getting back aboard. Falling overboard while single-handed sailing also creates a hazard to navigation for all other vessels as the now-uncontrolled vessel can remain afloat for an extended period.|$|R
50|$|Thiem is {{primarily}} an aggressive baseline player who is adept at defending as well. His groundstrokes are solid on both wings, {{with a heavy}} forehand and a tenacious, powerful single-handed backhand. He is notably {{one of the few}} younger ATP players to use a single-handed backhand. According to Thiem, he changed to his now famous single-handed backhand at the advice of his coach. His backhand can effectively handle high bouncing balls which has been a big problem for a lot of <b>single-handers,</b> including Roger Federer. Thiem often uses heavy, penetrating groundstrokes to construct points and hit winners or outlast his opponents. He has a long take-back on both wings, and the top-spin he produces on his groundstrokes allows him to both attack and defend well. Thiem also possesses a strong serve, capable of reaching 145 mph (233 km/h).|$|R
500|$|Brown's <b>single-hander</b> {{episode of}} EastEnders {{received}} much critical acclaim.

500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} for the 'Best Actress' BAFTA award for Dot's <b>single-hander</b> EastEnders episode in 2009; {{she became the first}} soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described Brown's BAFTA nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA– of which I'm a member– to connect with a big audience." [...] Brown has also won 'Best Actress' for her role as Dot at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001 and 2004, as well as the 'Outstanding Achievement' award in 2003, and 'Best Couple' in 2005 with John Bardon, as Dot and Jim Branning. She and Bardon also won 'Best On-Screen Partnership' at the British Soap Awards in both 2002 and 2005, while in 2005, Brown won a 'Lifetime Achievement' award for her role, again at the British Soap Awards. The role also resulted in several award nominations including a 'Most Popular Actress' nomination at the National Television Awards in 2005, and a 'Best Actress' nomination at the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards among others. Dot was also voted the 46th best television character in a television poll entitled The 100 Greatest Television Characters.|$|E

5000|$|Optimists {{are used}} for beginners. Light weight sailors {{continue}} to race them up 14 to 15 years of age. The age limit is 15. Very small children are sometimes [...] "doubled up" [...] but usually the boats are <b>single-handers.</b> Many sailing schools and yacht clubs own {{a number of them}} and they are the first boat most beginners will sail. The Optimist is the biggest youth racing class in the world. As well as the annual world championship the class also has six continental championships, attended by a total of over 850 sailors a year. Many of the top world Optimist sailors have become world-class Laser Radial or 4.7 sailors after they [...] "age-out" [...] but many also excel in double-handers such as the 420 and 29er.At the 2016 Olympics at least 85% of the boat skippers were former Optimist sailors.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing a lone sailor is managing the need to sleep, since a good watch must be kept at all times while at sea. Many <b>single-handers</b> use the technique of napping for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, using a timer to wake them up for periodic look-arounds; with the relatively slow speed of a sailboat, this allows most hazards to be seen in time. Again the challenge is greater for racers, given their higher speeds and more intense activity, and some racers have carried out considerable research into getting the maximum benefit from short cat-naps. Especially for racing, often routes are chosen that stay away from land, shallow areas and busy shipping routes. In the Southern Ocean sailors often do not see another boat for weeks. Recreational sailors usually choose a more tropical route (through the Panama Canal) closer to land and have to keep a better lookout for shipping. They often stop in ports en route for rest and sightseeing. In recent years the Automatic Identification System has become available to non-commercial shipping, providing advance warning of collision risks.|$|R
40|$|Background: Single-handed practice, a {{traditional}} model of general practice, {{has been an}} important facet of primary care provision since before the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948, but has increasingly been challenged by the growth of large practices. Now less than 10 % of GPs remain single-handed in the UK, concentrated in rural areas and areas of urban deprivation. This gradual decline of single-handed practice has resulted partly from the continued advocacy of partnership by the government, but is also indicative of NHS modernisation itself focusing on the delivery of high quality of care. However, little is known about single-handed GP today, particularly in urban areas, and what impact the most recent policy changes resulting from the implementation of the 2004 General Medical Service contract has had on them. Aim The aim of this thesis is to explore the current position of single-handed practices in urban areas exploring the quality of care delivered and to develop an understanding of how being a single-handed GP affects their practices in today’s NHS. Methods A mixed method methodology was employed. Quantitative analyses of routine datasets described characteristics of single-handed general practitioners and their practice population, and also examined their quality of care in comparison to that of group practices. A set of qualitative interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of a single-handed GP and their views of the future of this type of practice. Results The data presented in this thesis shows that single-handed practice accounted for 12. 6 % (n= 85) of urban Scottish general practices and had over 150, 000 registered patients with a high proportion living in areas of socio-economic deprivation. GPs working single-handedly {{were more likely to be}} male, older, qualified in South Asia, and had larger personal list size than their counterparts in group practices. Taking account of practice and population characteristics, single-handed practices offered comparable quality of care to large practices but tended to refer more patients with coronary heart disease to secondary care and also attained fewer organisational points in the Quality and Outcomes Framework of the new GP contract than larger practices. The data generated from the GPs interviews shed light on such patterns, suggesting that single-handed practices had little benefit from the economies scale possible in larger practices with regards to employing additional practice staff and sharing tasks within practice teams. Single-handed GPs continued practising on their own as they enjoyed the true levels of autonomy regarding clinical and managerial work within their own practices. However, the increasing accountability associated with the new contract in terms of Quality and Outcomes Framework monitoring may be a greater challenge to their freedom than current Government rhetoric about larger practice configurations. Some, however, had begun to find other ways of supporting themselves, such as sharing facilities with other small practices or using colleagues also from small practices to provide cross-cover when required. Conclusion The findings from the quantitative and qualitative work drawn together in this thesis highlighted that there was a significant group of GPs in urban areas who continue to practice single-handedly, whose quality of care was as good as that provided by larger practices when difference in the socio-economic status of practice populations between practices was taken into account. Although no significant association between practice size and CHD outcome measures (mortality, EMAs, prescribing and operation rates) was observed, there was variation in out-patient referral rates that remained unexplained, suggesting that patient-related factors such as their level of morbidity, may be important. Under the new contract, with little advantage in practice organisation, single-handed practices attained comparable clinical performance to group practices in the Quality and Outcomes Framework, though the underlying distribution of quality scores and percentage achievement for individual indicators in relation to practice size needs to be examined further, incorporating data on exception report to understand the full effect of practice size on QOF attainment. Enjoying their personal autonomy within their own practices, many thought they also provided a good quality of care for their patients, particularly in relation to access and continuity, and would remain as <b>single-handers.</b> However, concerns over the increasing accountability largely associated with the new contract in terms of QOF requirements may be a greater challenge to single-handed practices than current government rhetoric about larger practice configurations. The findings of this study indicates that the quality of care provided single-handed practice is at least as good as and, possibly better than that of larger practices. This has implications for service delivery in general practices, because it suggests that a policy drive to the development of large units in general practice may not necessarily lead to an improvement in quality of care as it intended. Despite some limitations, the importance of socio-economic deprivation rather than practice size in explaining the observed differences in quality outcomes emphasises the need to address health inequalities in populations, as well as the need to support practices such as single-handed practices working in the areas of deprivation and with ethnic minority populations, and to value their ongoing contribution to the provision of primary care in such areas.

40|$|AbstractPURPOSEThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the seat for the skipper of a 2. 4 mR, a Paralympic sailing boat (<b>single-hander).</b> Primarily, the seat was designed for a man with diastrophic dysplasia, a disorder of cartilage and bone development. This 39 year old man has a short stature with very short arms and legs and joint deformities which restrict movement. The skipper's main tasks are handling the rudder and the mainsheet using small ropes with his hands and pedals with his feet. He is sitting on a seat attached to the floor of the boat, while his body is positioned facing the bow of the boat. The combination of movements of the boat and tasks during sailing resulted in a constantly changing instability of the body. This might declare some of the injuries (pain in hips, knees and shoulders) that were called. The design goal for the seat was to find an optimum in body stability and range of motion during sailing. METHODSAn analysis of the possible movements in the frontal and sagittal plane of the skipper in the boat was made using a mock-up. A movement analysis of sailing was made in three boat conditions: 1. Boat heeling 32 ° (sailing close hauled), bodyweight as much windward as possible in the hull; 2. No boat heeling (reaching), bodyweight in front of the seat; 3. No boat heeling (reaching), bodyweight at the back of the seat. A biomechanical analysis was made in order to estimate the forces on the body in the three boat conditions where the boat heeling and the position of the bodyweight of the sailor are varied. An iterative design process was followed which resulted in different prototypes and finally in a new seat. RESULTSThe main requirement on the seat is that it should prevent sliding on the seat in the frontal plane, especially in condition 1. Then, a friction coefficient of 0, 63 is needed. Three prototypes have been build and tested. The final design consists of an aluminium seat with three sloping surfaces and a backrest that stabilizes the body. The seat can slide 19 cm forwards and backwards. CONCLUSIONThe third prototype has been tested in the lab and on the water. Freedom of movement and stability were enhanced. The prototype is further developed and applied for different Paralympic sailors and sailboats...|$|E
