40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for evaluating the}} progress of patients with back pain. Various symptoms were scored on analogue scales and spinal motion was measured by various techniques. These data were integrated to make subjective and objective indices respectively. Reasonable reproducibility of the measurements was obtained. This technique was used to elucidate {{the role of the}} lumbar support in <b>surgical</b> <b>corsets</b> in relief of back pain. Sufferers from back pain were randomly allocated to corsets with and without lumbar supports. There was significant improvement in those with a support compared with those without. On the other hand objective changes measured with the corset removed did not differ between the 2 groups. This study indicates that the spinal support in a lumbosacral corset makes a significant contribution towards the relief of symptoms...|$|R

50|$|The {{growth of}} Banbury's {{population}} had nearly {{stopped by the}} 1920s, and people left the town as its market and its economic importance in the district declined: it is recorded that only 9,700 animals were sold there {{in the whole of}} 1924, compared with 6,300 at the town's Michaelmas Fair alone in 1832. The town's existing industries were mostly unsuccessful and in steady decline. The Banbury Tweed Co. closed its factory in 1932 and the Britannia Works, which made agricultural machinery, closed in 1933. But in the 1930s the town's economy became more diversified and less closely linked with the surrounding countryside and towns such as Daventry, Bloxham, Bicester and Southam. In 1927 a large factory for <b>corsets</b> and <b>surgical</b> supports (Spencer <b>Corsets</b> Ltd) opened in a disused clothing factory in Britannia Road, and the manufacture of electrical equipment by Switchgear and Equipment Ltd. started in 1932, first in part of the disused machinery Britannia Works; it moved to a newly built factory on the Southam road around 1939. New industries continued to be attracted to Banbury after the Second World War, and in the 1950s the council established the Southam Road Industrial Estate, which attracted a wide range of industrial installations and works to the town. The 60-year-old cabinet works near The Mill centre and the Cherwell Engineering works on the Canalside estate also closed in the late 1950s.|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{designed}} {{this study to}} quantify the effects of radiotherapy (RT) on bone density as a local response in spinal bone metastases of women with breast cancer and, secondly, to establish bone density as an accurate and reproducible marker for assessment of local response to RT in spinal bone metastases. Methods: We retrospectively assessed 135 osteolytic spinal metastases in 115 women with metastatic breast cancer treated at our department between January 2000 and January 2012. Primary endpoint was to compare bone density in the bone metastases before, 3  months after and 6  months after RT. Bone density was measured in Hounsfield units (HU) in computed tomography scans. We calculated mean values in HU and the standard deviation (SD) as a measurement of bone density before, 3  months and 6  months after RT. T-test was used for statistical analysis of difference in bone density {{as well as for}} univariate analysis of prognostic factors for difference in bone density 3 and 6  months after RT. Results: Mean bone density was 194. 8 HU[*]±[*]SD 123. 0 at baseline. Bone density increased significantly by a mean of 145. 8 HU[*]±[*]SD 139. 4 after 3  months (p[*]=[*]. 0001) and by 250. 3 HU[*]±[*]SD 147. 1 after 6  months (p[*]<. 0001). Women receiving bisphosphonates showed a tendency towards higher increase in bone density in the metastases after 3  months (152. 6 HU[*]±[*]SD 141. 9 vs. 76. 0 HU[*]±[*]SD 86. 1; p[*]=[*]. 069) and pathological fractures before RT were associated with a significantly higher increase in bone density after 3  months (202. 3 HU[*]±[*]SD 161. 9 vs. 130. 3 HU[*]±[*]SD 129. 2; p[*]=[*]. 013). Concomitant chemotherapy (ChT) or endocrine therapy (ET), hormone receptor status, performance score, applied overall RT dose and prescription of a <b>surgical</b> <b>corset</b> did not correlate with a difference in bone density after RT. Conclusions: Bone density measurement in HU is a practicable and reproducible method for assessment of local RT response in osteolytic metastases in breast cancer. Our analysis demonstrated an excellent local response within metastases after palliative RT...|$|E
