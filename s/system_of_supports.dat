40|$|The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, {{established}} by Congress as a re-authorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (EASA) requires that all states establish a statewide <b>system</b> <b>of</b> intensive and sustained support and improvement for local educational agencies and schools.

This study will describe and analyze the design and establishment of a comprehensive statewide <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in Idaho, the Idaho Building Capacity (IBC) project. Central to the study is the question: How does Idaho develop and implement an effective, comprehensive statewide <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> that will provide technical assistance to schools and districts at all levels of needs improvement status? This study will also look at a second question: How has a targeted district and its schools integrated these efforts into its improvement process?

50|$|RTI is {{originally}} {{a special education}} term that has broadened into general education framework that involves research-based instruction and interventions, regular monitoring of student progress, and the subsequent use of these data over {{time to make a}} variety of educational decisions, including, but not limited to SLD eligibility. To facilitate this broadened conception of RTI, a shift to labeling this approach as a Multi-Tier <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Supports</b> (MTSS) is occurring in schools and the professional literature.

The size of employment and earnings impacts are relatively small in comparison to what might be needed to eliminate the need for SSDI or SSI benefits (and the associated benefits through Medicare and Medicaid). In part, the limited impacts likely reflect that most participants targeted in these demonstrations receive substantial cash and other supports that are terminated due to substantive work and must navigate a fragmented <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> to access additional services.|$|E

These challenges include personal barriers to employment, work disincentives inherent in the SSI and SSDI programs, a fragmented and poorly coordinated <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports,</b> and limited means by which early intervention might occur.|$|E

30|$|Over {{the past}} three decades in the United States, there have been sharp {{increases}} in benefit receipt and large declines in employment and income of people with disabilities relative to their counterparts without disabilities. An increasing share of people with disabilities receives cash supports from the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) disability programs, which include Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This trend has heightened policy interest in finding alternatives to disability benefit receipt-including employment-to promote economic well-being of people with disabilities and to alleviate fiscal pressures on the SSA trust fund and federal budget. Finding alternatives to benefit receipt is challenging, however. Personal barriers to employment, work disincentives inherent in the SSI and SSDI programs, a fragmented and poorly coordinated <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports,</b> and limited means by which early intervention might occur contribute to the difficulty facing policy makers in developing the means to reduce disability expenditures.|$|E

40|$|In the paper, the {{influence}} of support compliances on the stability and the limiting slen-derness ratio of compression helical springs was investigated. To analyze the stability of helical springs, {{the concept of an}} equivalent column was applied and a general <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> described by three independent compliances was utilized. In the general case, the solution obtained, which describes the critical force, depends on two rotational compliances and a lateral compliance of a transverse shift of the support. The influence of the individual compliances on the critical load and on the limiting slenderness ratio was studied. Simple approximation formulas were proposed to describe these relationships. Key words: helical spring, stability, support compliance, slenderness ratio 1. Introductory remarks Helical springs, specially compression ones, fulfil different functions in the technique: do the work, store energy, alleviate the impact, raise or take vibration and many others. Moreover, they may be subjected to loss of stability. A helical spring should be treated as a spatially curved bar. Such an approach, based on Kirchhoff-Clebsh equations and geometrically non-linear theory, was developed by Nikolai (1955). It was applied to the problems of stability of helical springs, among others, by Cherny...|$|E
