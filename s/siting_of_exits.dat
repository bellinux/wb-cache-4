This point is crucial, because tissue perfusion is directly related to the driving pressure (the difference between pressures at the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>exit</b> <b>of</b> the capillary), the radius of the vessel, and the density of capillaries; additionally, tissue perfusion is inversely related to blood viscosity.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} destroying the posterior approaches to the atrioventricular (AV) node. Background. Surgical and catheter ablation procedures have been developed for the cure of AV junctional reentrant tachycardia. Some of these destroy the posterior approaches to the AV node. Methods. Atrioventricular node function and electrical excitation of Koch's triangle and the proximal coronary sinus were examined in 18 dogs. Dissection of the posterior atrionodal connections was performed in 10 dogs and a sham procedure in 8. After 28 to 35 days, repeat electrophysiologic and mapping studies were performed to assess changes in AV node function and the routes of AV and ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction. The AV junction was then examined with light microscopy. Results. The compact AV node was undamaged in eight cases (80 %). In two cases minor fibrosis occurred at the posterior limit of the compact node. The right-sided posterior atrionodal connections lying between the coronary sinus orifice and the tricuspid annulus were replaced by scar tissue in all cases, but the left-sided posterior connections and the anterior connections remained intact. Atrioventricular and VA conduction intervals and refractory periods were not altered. Atrioventricular junctional echoes were present in 10 dogs before and in 7 dogs after dissection (p = 0. 06). Posterior (slow pathway) retrograde exits from the AV node were present in seven dogs before and in seven dogs after dissection. However, retrograde atrial excitation was altered in four of these seven dogs, so that the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> from the AV node was more leftward than it had been preoperatively. The node remained responsive to autonomic blocking drugs postoperatively. Double atrial electrograms similar to slow pathway potentials were found in all dogs. Conclusions. This procedure ablates the posterior atrionodal connections but rarely damages the compact AV node. Atrioventricular node function is not impaired and the node is not denervated. The mechanism of cure of AV junctional reentrant tachycardia is probably damage to the perinodal atrium. This suggests that part of the slow AV node pathway may lie outside the compact AV node. Dual AV node exits and double atrial electrograms are present in the normal canine heart...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} electrophysiologic and anatomic efects of a surgical procedure that cures the anterior (common) type of atrioventricular (AV) junciional reentrant tachycardia. Background. The procedure was designed to interrupt the reentrant circuit {{at the point of}} earliest atrial activation during AV junctional reentrant tachycardia, the anterior atrionodal connections. Methods. Atrioventricular node function and the sequence of electrical excitation of Koch's triangle were examined in 18 dogs. Excitation of Koch's triangle was mapped using a 60 -channel mapping system. Surgical dissection was performed in 10 dogs and a sham procedure in 8. After 28 to 35 days, AV node function and the atrial excitation pattern were reassessed. The AV junction was examined using light microscopy. Results. Some degree of AV node damage was visible in all dogs in the dissection group, but it was minor in 40 % of cases. The anterior part of the AV node was disconnected from the anterior atrionodal connections in all cases. Anterograde AV node function was mildly impaired. The median AH interval was increased (62 vs. 76 ms [interquartile ranges 48 to 72 and 64 to 104, respectively], P = 0. 05), and the AV Wenckebach cycle length was increased (210 vs. 245 ms [interquartile ranges 200 to 230 and 210 to 260, respectively], p = 0. 02). The degree of impairment of conduction was directly proportional to the length of dissection (p < 0. 05) but not to the degree of damage to the AV node. Ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction was destroyed in 50 % of dogs undergoing dissection but in none of those with a sham operation (p < 0. 04). The AV node remained responsive to autonomic blocking drugs, and atrial mapping during ventricular pacing revealed that the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> from the AV node had been altered. Conclusions. The atrionodal connections closest to the His bundle are the preferred route of conduction through the AV node during normal AV or VA conduction. Destruction of these connections modifies AV node conduction. The surgical procedure selectively interrupts these connections, and this interruption {{is likely to be the}} mechanism of cure...|$|R

The first stage predicts the next page of a viewer based on a variant of a Markov transition matrix computed from page sequences of other visitors who read the same pages as that viewer did thus far. The second stage re-analyzes the incorrect exit/continuation predictions of the first stage through data mining, incorporating the visitor's viewing behavior observed from the log file. The two-stage process takes advantage of a robust, theory-driven nature of statistical modeling for extracting the overall feature of the data, and a flexible, data-driven nature of data mining to capture any idiosyncrasies and complications unresolved in the first stage. The empirical result with a test site implies that the first stage alone is sufficiently accurate (50. 3 %) in predicting page transitions.

In the study reported here, we assessed the influence of afferent lymphatic vessel interruption on lymph node composition, organization of cellular elements; and on expression of vascular addressins. At 1 wk after occlusion of afferent lymphatic vessels, HEV became flat walled and expression of the peripheral lymph node addressin disappeared from the luminal aspect of most vessels, while being retained on the abluminal side. In addition, an HEV-specific differentiation marker, defined by mAb MECA- 325, was undetectable at 7 -d postocclusion. In vivo homing studies revealed that these modified vessels support minimal lymphocyte traffic from the blood. After occlusion, we observed dramatic changes in lymphocyte populations and at 7 -d postsurgery, lymph nodes were populated predominantly by cells lacking the peripheral lymph node homing receptor LECAM- 1. In addition, effects on nonlymphoid cells were observed: subcapsular sinus macrophages, defined by mAb MOMA- 1, disappeared; and interdigitating dendritic cells, defined by mAb NLDC- 145, were dramatically reduced.

Functional analyses of lymphocyte interactions with HEV have shown the lymphocytes can discriminate between HEV in different tissues, indicating that HEV express tissue- specific determinants or address signals for lymphocyte recognition.

R., E. L. Berg, B. N. Rouse, R. F. Bargatze, and E. C. Butcher. 1988. Nature (Lond.). 331 : 41 - 46). Here we document the existence and tissue-specific distribution of a distinct HEV differentiation antigen. Defined by monoclonal antibody MECA- 79, this antigen is expressed at high levels on the lumenal surface and in the cytoplasm of HEV in peripheral lymph nodes. By contrast, although MECA- 79 stains many HEV in the mucosal Peyer's patches, expression in most cases is restricted to the perivascular or ablumenal aspect of these venules. In the small intestine lamina propria, a mucosa-associated site that supports the extravasation of lymphocytes, venules do not stain with MECA- 79. Finally, we demonstrate that MECA- 79 blocks binding of both normal lymphocytes and a peripheral lymph node-specific lymphoma to peripheral lymph node HEV in vitro and that it also inhibits normal lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes in vivo without significantly influencing lymphocyte interactions with Peyer's patch HEV in vitro or in vivo.

40|$|Efficient {{intracellular}} {{transport of}} the capsid of alphaherpesviruses, such as {{herpes simplex virus}} 1 (HSV- 1), {{is known to be}} dependent upon the microtubule (MT) network. Typically, the MT network radiates from an MT-organizing center (MTOC), which is, in most cases, the centrosome. During herpesvirus egress, it has been assumed that capsids travel first from the nucleus to the centrosome and then from the centrosome to the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> envelopment. Here we report that the centrosome is no longer a primary MTOC in HSV- 1 -infected cells, but it retains this function in cells infected by another alphaherpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (PrV). As a result, MTs formed at late times after infection with PrV grow from a major, centralized MTOC, while those formed after HSV- 1 infection arise from dispersed locations in the cytoplasm, indicating the presence of alternative and minor MTOCs. Thus, loss of the principal MT nucleating center in cells following HSV- 1 infection raises questions about the mechanism of HSV- 1 capsid egress. It is possible that, rather than passing via the centrosome, capsids may travel directly to the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> envelopment after <b>exiting</b> the nucleus.

By a combination of mean-field theory and computer simulation of these models we demonstrate how the flux of one species of rods is completely switched off by the other. Exploring the parameter space of the model we also establish the conditions under which switch-like regulation of two fluxes is possible; from the extensive analysis we discover more than one possible mechanism of this phenomenon.
