5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the choke. Jackson began to attack with ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the office.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E
5|$|United {{opened the}} 1969–70 {{campaign}} {{by winning the}} Charity Shield with a 2–1 win over Manchester City, {{and went on to}} face realistic possibility of winning the treble – the league, FA Cup and European Cup. However they missed out on all three trophies as the games built up {{towards the end of the}} season, and the league title was the first to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their hands as Everton went on to build an insurmountable lead. They then bowed out of the European Cup after a 3–1 aggregate defeat to Celtic, including a 2–1 loss at Hampden Park in front of a UEFA record crowd of 136,505. They took two replays to overcome Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals (Bremner scored the only goal in 300 minutes of football), but lost 2–1 in the replayed final to Chelsea after the original 2–2 draw, in which Charlton opened the scoring. Charlton took responsibility for Peter Osgood's goal in the replay as he was distracted from marking duties as he was trying to get revenge on a Chelsea player who had kicked him.|$|E
25|$|A {{shoulder}} separation occurs {{where the}} collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments {{that hold the}} AC (acromioclavicular) joint together are partially or completely torn, the outer end of the clavicle may <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury {{is caused by a}} blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it is hard to do a 180 degrees rotation.|$|E

25|$|Screenwriters and {{directors}} use {{the image of}} a man or woman slipping on a pair of leather gloves to indicate knowledge that a crime is happening. It is a common cliche in film for the hero to hold on to a person's gloved hand, and for the person to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the glove and fall to their death. This can be seen in Batman and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.|$|E
25|$|Chihuahuas {{are also}} known for luxating patella, a genetic {{condition}} that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.|$|E
25|$|The Canadians {{began their}} 2011 Rugby World Cup on September 14 against Tonga, winning 25–20. They {{followed}} this {{up with a}} 46–19 loss to France on September 18. The team had only a four-day turn-around after their first match, and let the game <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their reach within the final 20 minutes. They produced a repeat result of 2007, by playing to a 23–23 draw against Japan. Their Rugby World Cup concluded with a 79–15 loss against the All Blacks. Canada finished fourth in their pool, narrowly missing out on automatic qualification for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Leeds seemed {{unable to}} {{maintain}} any consistency; {{they started the}} 2008/09 season well, but lost momentum {{and a series of}} poor performances saw them <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the play-off positions. In the cups, Leeds were beaten in Johnston's Paint Trophy by Rotherham, and struggled to the quarter finals of the League Cup, where they were beaten 2–1 by Derby. McAllister was sacked on 21 December following a run of 6 defeats in a row, including an embarrassing defeat to non-league Histon in the FA Cup, and replaced by Blackpool manager Simon Grayson. Blackpool subsequently reported Leeds United to the Football League, claiming that they rejected five approaches from Leeds to talk to Grayson, and that they had not accepted Grayson's resignation.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{conclusions}} of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better {{stem the tide of}} U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where terrorists are able to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries were it is increasingly not difficult for terrorists to travel {{back and forth to the}} Western world.|$|E
25|$|The deep {{penetration}} {{and large}} hip thrusts of the missionary position {{can cause the}} man to reach orgasm quickly compared to other positions, which can be problematic if the couple seeks to reach simultaneous orgasm. The male reaching orgasm first can be disruptive to sex, as 50% of penile erection is lost immediately after ejaculation, making him more likely to inadvertently <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vagina, especially during the strong pelvic contractions of female orgasm. In addition to the standard methods for treating premature ejaculation, Zachary Veilleux notes that this problem can be overcome by workarounds such as changing positions frequently (which studies have shown delays male orgasm {{by a factor of}} 2-3), using lubrication to reduce friction (friction stimulates the male but is not as important in female orgasm), or switching to cunnilingus for a while when close to ejaculation, and then switching back when ejaculation is no longer imminent.|$|E

25|$|Rosebud pornography, rosebudding or rectal {{prolapse}} pornography {{refers to an}} anal sex practice which occurs in some extreme anal pornography wherein a pornograhic actor or actress performs a {{rectal prolapse}} wherein {{the walls of the}} rectum <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the anus. A rectal prolapse is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional. However, in rosebud pornography it is performed deliberately. Michelle Lhooq, writing for VICE, argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making 'extreme' content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet. She also argues that rosebudding is a way for pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves. Repeated rectal prolapses can cause bowel problems and anal leakage and therefore risk the health of pornographic actors or actresses who participate in them. Lhooq also argues that some who participate in this form of pornography are unaware of the consequences.|$|E
25|$|Willot finally {{emerged from}} prison in January 1795. He regained his rank as general of brigade on 13 April. He became the acting {{commander}} of the 1st Division of the Army of the Western Pyrenees in place of Jean-Antoine Marbot. On 6 July 1795 he was promoted general of division. On 13 July, the army commander Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey sent Willot and 3,500 troops from Salvatierra toward Vitoria while another 4,500-man column under Bernard Dessein reached Vitoria from the north. The Spanish troops managed to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trap but {{they were forced to}} abandon their supplies. Dessein and Willot then joined forces and occupied Bilbao. When the news of the Treaty of Basel arrived on 5 August 1795, the French occupied Miranda de Ebro. The French troops started back to Bayonne on 17 August. Two divisions numbering 10,995 soldiers were assembled under Willot and Dessein and ordered to march to join Lazare Hoche's Army of the West. By the time the reinforcement reached its destination at Fontenay-le-Comte, heavy desertion reduced its numbers to 4,000 men.|$|E
25|$|As in 2012, Valverde won {{the overall}} {{classification}} of the Vuelta a Andalucía in 2013, {{where he also}} won the points classification in the race. Valverde continued showing some good form after finishing with podium places in the Vuelta a Murcia, the Amstel Gold Race and in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. After having a decent spring campaign, Valverde aimed for a podium finish in the Tour de France. Valverde started the Tour in good form after finishing third in Ax3 Domaines behind Chris Froome and Richie Porte. However the next day, Porte lost over 15 minutes which moved Valverde into second overall right before the tour left the Pyrenees. On Stage 13, Valverde lost almost 10 minutes after getting a flat tire. Despite a very hard pursuit, the high crosswinds and {{the pace of the}} peloton prevented him and his teammates from catching back. They ended up with the second group at the finish causing him to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top ten. Despite losing his second position, Valverde managed to do well in the Alps which moved him back into the top ten of the overall standings, finishing 8th overall.|$|E

25|$|The III Cavalry Corps {{was first}} {{constituted}} for the French invasion of Russia and {{placed under the}} command of General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy. On 24 June 1812, corps numbered 9,676 men in 50 squadrons and was supported by 30 horse artillery pieces. There were three divisions under Generals of Division Louis Pierre Aimé Chastel, Jean-Pierre Doumerc, and Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye. Chastel led the 3rd Light Cavalry Division, Doumerc directed the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division, and Houssaye commanded the 6th Heavy Cavalry Division. The Imperial French army captured Vilnius and Emperor Napoleon entered the city on 28 June. Four days later a freak storm with freezing rain blew all night long, causing the deaths of thousands of horses. Colonel Lubin Griois of Grouchy's corps artillery claimed that the storm killed one-fourth of his horses. Soon after, Grouchy was directed to place his cavalry under Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout in attempt to cut off General Pyotr Bagration's Russian Second Army. Though Davout reached Minsk ahead of Bagration, the Russian was able to <b>slip</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trap because King Jérôme Bonaparte failed to pursue with energy.|$|E

He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue.
