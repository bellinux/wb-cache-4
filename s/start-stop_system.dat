25|$|Holden {{announced}} on December 22, 2008 that its Elizabeth, South Australia production line would be split to commence local {{production of the}} Cruze sedan and the Australian-developed hatchback. Production was originally scheduled to start by September 2010. However, it was confirmed in January 2010 that production would in fact begin in March 2011. The announcement to assemble the car came {{as a response to}} the slowing sales of the larger, locally produced Holden Commodore range. The Australian Government committed 149million to the program from its $6.2billion Green Car Innovation Fund, with a further $30million given by the State Government of South Australia. GM Holden matched both amounts, but the then chairman and managing director Mark Reuss would not reveal Holden's total investment. Reuss announced his firm would be considering the utilization of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85) flexible-fuel and petrol/electric hybrid <b>start-stop</b> <b>system</b> powertrain technologies. These technologies, if materialized, would supplement the four-cylinder petrol and diesel powertrain offerings already confirmed by Holden at the time of the announcement.|$|E

Every model came with a 5-speed manual gearbox until 2011, when 6-speed manual and automatic (EGS6) manual versions were introduced, along with an eco-friendly <b>start-stop</b> <b>system</b> and regenerative braking technology in certain models, notably the Exclusive and Tendance models for the German market. According to Citroën, these two new features reduce [...] emissions significantly and their introduction coincided with the release of a higher specification Airdream engine, the European emission standards (Euro 5) carbon dioxide emissions limits were lowered and the addition of low-rolling resistance tyres were added to the entire range. The tyres are specially designed to minimize wasted energy when the tyre rolls and have been estimated by the California Energy Commission to save 1.5–4.5% of fuel in a typical car.|$|E

2500|$|Modern HEVs {{make use}} of efficiency-improving {{technologies}} such as regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to electric energy to charge the battery. Some varieties of HEV use their internal combustion engine to generate electricity by spinning an electrical generator to either recharge their batteries or to directly power the electric drive motors; this combination {{is known as a}} motor–generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting down the ICE at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as a <b>start-stop</b> <b>system.</b> A hybrid-electric produces less emissions from its ICE than a comparably sized gasoline car, since an HEV's gasoline engine is usually smaller than a comparably sized, pure gasoline-burning, vehicle and if not used to directly drive the car, can be geared to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.

The system is now commonplace in the Volkswagen range, fitted to all vehicles with the Bluemotion Technology package, though certain other models have the technology too. For the Lupo 3L, with an automated manual gearbox and clutch, the engine stops four seconds after the car becomes stationary with the driver's foot on the brake pedal. No other action is necessary. Removing the foot from the brake pedal initiates engine start and the car can be driven away. The gear lever remains in the drive D position throughout. The same applies to the Audi A2 1.2TDi, which is almost identical mechanically.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people are}} working on {{improving}} the efficiency of car's engines.

40|$|AbstractOur {{cars have}} known energy efficiency. We {{take for granted}} they are {{efficient}} at different speeds, some are able to reuse energy and many have start-stop engine functionality. Critically they do not consume energy {{when they are not}} moving. This paper explores the challenges of working towards a <b>start-stop</b> production <b>system</b> concept. The base load energy and other resource consumption (whether during breaks or at night) are known to be a significant proportion of total consumption and attempts to reduce consumption span behavioural aspects through to technology limitations. The impact on switching off machines and supporting utilities has a major impact on the response time to starting full production as well as confidence in the quality that can be achieved. The situation is further {{compounded by the fact that}} most production systems are configured with technology that means running at less than full production rate has a serious impact on energy efficiency; there are rarely alternative energy efficient operating speeds...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that the use phase, including people’s use behaviour, is a large contributor to the environmental impact of many products. Some eco-design tools mention the use phase as a possible target area, but {{there is a lack of}} methods that specifically address how to lower its environmental impact. Thus, this contribution presents a toolbox that enables companies to influence user behaviour to reduce the negative environmental impact during the use phase; we call this the Design for Sustainable Behaviour (DfSB) toolbox. The main tool in the toolbox comprises five types of strategies for the design of products and services. Enlighten strategies influence users’ knowledge, values, attitudes and norms, e. g. an eco-driving support system. Spur strategies encourage users to perform sustainable behaviours, e. g. through external rewards, punishments or competitions. Steer strategies guide users by making sustainable behaviour the evident choice, physically or cognitively, e. g. a refrigerator steering the placement of food to optimize preservation. Force strategies compel a sustainable behaviour upon the users, e. g. a washing machine that automatically adds the right amount of detergent. Match strategies adapt products and services to users’ current behaviours, e. g. <b>start–stop</b> <b>systems</b> in cars. A comparative study of different types of strategies shows that they have the potential to be effective in influencing users’ behaviour and to be accepted by consumers. The toolbox is utilized by employing its main tool and supporting tools (e. g. user studies and personas) in a design process focusing on users and their behaviour. This may mean a shift of eco-design efforts from later to earlier stages of the development process, which enables greater opportunities for radical environmental gain through design, as it is in the early stages that the environmental impact of products is largely determined. Different tools from the toolbox have been applied in a number of R&D cases in industry. For instance, Eliq Online, a home energy management system verified to support energy reductions have been developed by Exibea, and novel product concepts to reduce household’s energy use and to avoid food waste have been developed for IKEA and Electrolux. Apart from the evident advantage of encouraging sustainable behaviours, and thus reducing resource use, the DfSB toolbox can also spur innovation and provide a way to differentiate on saturated markets...|$|R
40|$|Good HVAC {{control is}} often the most {{cost-effective}} option to improve the energy efficiency of a building. However the effect of changing the control strategy (i. e. effect on indoor comfort and energy consumption) is usually {{the most difficult to}} predict. To achieve this more easily, a new simulation tool, QUICKcontrol, was developed. In this paper, the new tool is used to investigate the energy savings potential in the Engineering Tower Building (ETB) of the University of Pretoria. The influence of reset control, economizer cycle combined with CO 2 control on the outside air ventilation rate and better <b>system</b> <b>start-stop</b> times were investigated. The simulation models were firstly verified with actual measurements obtained from the existing system to confirm their accuracy for realistic control retrofit simulations. With the aid of the integrated simulation tool it was possible to predict savings of 491 MWh per year (34 % building energy saving) by implementing these control strategies. These control strategies can be implemented in the building with a direct payback period of less than 9 months. ...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 2002 Fuel Cell Seminar, Palm Springs, CA, November 2002 The Schatz Energy Research Center (SERC) has designed, built, and {{operated}} a PEM fuel cell power system that supplies back-up {{power to a}} remote radio-telephone repeater. The repeater, located within Redwood National Park in northwestern California, {{is part of the}} Yurok Indian Reservation???s telecommunications system. A photovoltaic (PV) system with batteries provides primary power for the repeater. When solar insolation is insufficient to maintain battery state-ofcharge, the 100 -Watt fuel cell system starts automatically and provides clean, quiet, reliable power. The system began unattended operation in November 1999. The original fuel cell stack logged 3239 hours of run time. In January 2001, SERC engineers refurbished the original fuel cell stack, incorporating improved membrane-electrode assemblies and gas diffusion media. The original resin-impregnated graphite was replaced with pyrosealed components and a temperaturecontrolled fan switch was added to protect the stack from sudden temperature increases while minimizing parasitic loads. The system ran continuously though October 2001, accumulating 3836 hours of run time and completing 283 <b>start-stop</b> cycles.
