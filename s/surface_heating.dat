5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} weather was issued for northern Kansas into southern Nebraska and from eastern West Virginia through Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. An ongoing line of thunderstorms moved east across West Virginia as the atmosphere began to destabilize. The thunderstorms {{resulted in a}} threat for isolated tornadoes in eastern sections of West Virginia, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland. In the central Great Plains region, a warm front extended northeast in northeastern Kansas from a surface low in central sections of Kansas. Strong instability occurred {{in the vicinity of}} the area as a result of <b>surface</b> <b>heating.</b> An intensifying low-level jet stream broke the cap in the region and resulted in the development of thunderstorms. During the afternoon, numerous thunderstorms formed across the Mid-Atlantic States. An EF0tornado was produced from one of the thunderstorms that impacted portions of Chesapeake Beach, tearing off sections of roof and siding from 10to 20single family homes. EF1tornadoes were produced in Culpeper, Clarke and Stafford counties in Virginia. Several other EF0 and EF1 tornadoes formed throughout the Great Plains region.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak {{area of low pressure}} initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced risk area. Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow {{is a key}} {{parameter}} for the geothermal structure, rheology, {{and hence}} the dynamics of continents. However, the coverage of heat flow measurements is still poor in many continental areas. By transforming the stable nonlinear heat conduction equation into a Poisson's one, we develop a method to infer <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow for a stable or quasi-stable continent from a Parker's-like formula. This formula provides {{the relationship between the}} Fourier transform of <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow and the sum of the Fourier transform of the powers of geometry for the heat production (HP) interface in the continental lithosphere. Once the interface geometry is known, one to three dimensional distribution of the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow can be calculated accurately by this formula. As a case study, we estimate the three-dimensional <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flows for the Ordos geological block and its adjacent areas in China on a 1 ^∘× 1 ^∘ grid based on a simple layered constant HP model. Comparing to the measurements, most relative errors of the heat flows inferred are less than 20 %, showing this method is a favorable way to estimate <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow for stable or quasi-stable continental regions where measurements are rare or absent.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the complex coupling between <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and local fluid velocity in convective heat transfer, advanced techniques {{are required to}} measure the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux at high spatial and temporal resolution. Several established flow velocity techniques such as laser Doppler anemometry, particle image velocimetry and hot wire anemometry can measure fluid velocities at high spatial resolution (?m) and have a high-frequency response (up to 100 kHz) characteristic. Equivalent advanced <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> transfer measurement techniques, however, are not available; even the latest advances in high speed thermal imaging do not offer equivalent data capture rates. The current research presents a method of measuring point <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux with a hot film that is flush mounted on a <b>heated</b> flat <b>surface.</b> The film {{works in conjunction with}} a constant temperature anemometer which has a bandwidth of 100 kHz. The bandwidth of this technique therefore is likely to be in excess of more established <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurement techniques. Although the frequency response of the sensor is not reported here, it is expected to be significantly less than 100 kHz due to its physical size and capacitance. To demonstrate the efficacy of the technique, a cooling impinging air jet is directed at the <b>heated</b> <b>surface,</b> and the power required to maintain the hot-film temperature is related to the local heat flux to the fluid air flow. The technique is validated experimentally using a more established <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurement technique. The thermal performance of the sensor is also investigated numerically. It has been shown that, with some limitations, the measurement technique accurately measures the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> transfer to an impinging air jet with improved spatial resolution {{for a wide range of}} experimental parameters...|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with this reasoning, the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> {{flow of the}} study area correlates in a general manner to the structure of the K horizon in that there is a clear demarcation between the areas where the K horizon is relatively shallow (the east) and areas where it is significantly deeper (the west). However, local maxima in the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow correlate with the shape of the Burano unit (see Figs.  9,  13) within which topography-driven advective heat transport takes place at relatively shallow depths. These maxima in <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow are good indicators of structural highs of the shallow reservoir.|$|R

500|$|There {{are several}} {{difficulties}} with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates {{from the top}} [...] "skin" [...] of the ocean, approximately the top 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the bulk temperature of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth efforts. [...] Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas. [...] However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover. [...] Within atmospheric sounder channels on weather satellites, which peak just above the ocean's surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.|$|E
500|$|Monsoons {{are caused}} by the larger {{amplitude}} of the seasonal cycle of land temperature {{compared to that of}} nearby oceans. This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a [...] "mixed layer" [...] that may be fifty meters deep, through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so. [...] Additionally, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land. [...] Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean. The hot air over the land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains, <b>surface</b> <b>heating,</b> convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation.|$|E
500|$|In deserts, lack {{of ground}} and plant {{moisture}} {{that would normally}} provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low-pressure area called a thermal low. [...] Monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats more quickly than the surrounding nearby ocean. [...] This generates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall {{is caused by the}} moist ocean-air being lifted upwards by mountains, <b>surface</b> <b>heating,</b> convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation. [...] In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. [...] Monsoons resemble sea and land breezes, terms usually referring to the localized, diurnal (daily) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale - also stronger and seasonal.|$|E

2500|$|Typical of the Deep South, Tuscaloosa {{experiences}} a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) with four distinct seasons. The Gulf of Mexico heavily influences the climate by supplying {{the region with}} warm, moist air. [...] During the fall, winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along fronts creates precipitation. These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the jet stream. Notable exceptions occur during hurricane season where storms may move from due south to due north or even {{from east to west}} during land-falling hurricanes. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the severe weather seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet stream flows well {{to the north of the}} southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently convectional, i.e., caused by the warm <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> the air above.
