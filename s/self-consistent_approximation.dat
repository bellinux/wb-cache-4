40|$|We generalize {{the concept}} of conserving, Φ-derivable, approximations to {{relativistic}} field theories. Treating the interaction field as a dynamical degree of freedom, we derive the thermodynamic potential in terms of fully dressed propagators, an approach which allows us to resolve the entropy of a relativistic plasma into contributions from its interacting elementary excitations. We illustrate the derivation for a hot relativistic system governed by electromagnetic interactions. It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to Leo Kadanoff on his sixtieth birthday. Immediately after Leo and I received our Ph. D. ’s from Harvard in 1960, we began working together at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen (now the Niels Bohr Institute) {{on the problem of}} how to construct <b>self-consistent</b> <b>approximations</b> to two-particle propagators that preserved the basic conservation laws.
