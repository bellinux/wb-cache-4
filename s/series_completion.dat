5000|$|Robert Yerkes and a {{committee}} of six representatives developed two intelligence tests; the Army Alpha test and the Army Beta test to help the United States Military screen incoming soldiers for [...] "intellectual deficiencies, psychopathic tendencies, nervous intangibility, and inadequate self-control". [...] The Alpha test was a verbal test for literate recruits and was divided into eight test categories, which included: following oral directions, arithmetical problems, practical judgments, synonyms and antonyms, disarranged sentences, number <b>series</b> <b>completion,</b> analogies and information, whereas the Beta test was a nonverbal test used for testing illiterate or non-English speaking recruits. The Beta test did not require those being tested to use written language, but rather the examinees completed tasks by using visual aids. The Beta Intelligence test was divided into seven subtests, which included: [...] "Test 1- assessed the ability of army recruits to trace {{the path of a}} maze; Test 2- assessed the ability of cube analysis; Test 3-assessed the ability of pattern analysis using an X-O series; Test 4- assessed the ability of coding digits with symbols; Test 5- assessed the ability of number checking; Test 6-assessed the ability of pictorial completion; and Test 7- assessed the ability of geometrical construction".|$|E
50|$|Another {{test that}} is still in use is the Verbal and Spatial Reasoning Test also known as VESPAR. VESPAR is a test that was {{designed}} by Elizabeth Warrington and Dawn W. Langdon in 1996. VESPAR is a reasoning test that presents a fairly new approach in how reasoning tests are performed. This test is designed to measure the fluid intelligence in neurological patients. This test is unique in that it offers more accuracy than any other test available {{for this type of}} measurement. VESPAR is divided into six sections. There are three matched sets of verbal and spatial reasoning problems, where each is dedicated to one of three forms of inductive reasoning. This includes odd one out, by analogy, and <b>series</b> <b>completion.</b> VESPAR is able to overcome many restraints that arise when performing more conventional reasoning tests by using stimuli that is more readily accessed by patients who suffer from physical or cognitive impairments due to neurological illness. VESPAR does not use timing to help evaluate performance, instead it uses high frequency stimulus words or visually distinct spatial stimuli to help determine its results. VESPAR has a multiple choice format. This format has been adopted to reduce both short term memory load and output demands on the patient. The assessment of patients for neurodiagnostic and neurorehabilitation needs will be facilitated. VESPAR only requires the patient to do simple pointing gestures. The spatial section of the test measures the fluid intelligence of patients with aphasia. The verbal section does the same for patients with visual and spatial problems. VESPAR focuses more the instinctive ability of a patient, rather than educational experience. Thus, although originally developed for adult neurological populations, the test is suitable {{for a wide range of}} clinical, educational, occupational, and research applications. This test is also available for purchase at most online bookstores.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between the theory of knowledge spaces and formal models of cognitive problem solving processes is examined. This connection is described for {{a model of the}} cognitive processes of subjects in solving letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> problems, which is based on ideas from Simon and Kotovsky (1963). The model is formulated as an algorithm, depending on its ability to solve letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> problems on two parameters. Different abilities of subjects in solving such problems can be represented within the model by different choices for these parameters. It is shown that the model determines surmise relations on sets of letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> problems. These surmise relations, respectively the corresponding quasi–ordinal knowledge spaces, are used in two experimental investigations to test the underlying process model empirically. The results of these experiments show that the surmise relations derived from the process model are able to predict the difficulty of letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> problems in a satisfactory manner. 133 134 SCHREP...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{correlate}} {{of human}} inductive reasoning process is still unclear. Number series and letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> are two typical inductive reasoning tasks, {{and with a}} common core component of rule induction. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} different strategies are adopted in number series and letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> tasks; even the underlying rules are identical. In the present study, we examined cortical activation as a function of two different reasoning strategies for solving <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> tasks. The retrieval strategy, used in number <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> tasks, involves direct retrieving of arithmetic knowledge to get the relations between items. The procedural strategy, used in letter <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> tasks, requires counting a certain number of times to detect the relations linking two items. The two strategies require essentially the equivalent cognitive processes, but have different working memory demands (the procedural strategy incurs greater demands). The procedural strategy produced significant greater activity in areas involved in memory retrieval (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and mental representation/maintenance (posterior parietal cortex, PPC). An ACT-R model of the tasks successfully predicted behavioral performance and BOLD responses. The present findings support a general-purpose dual-process theory of inductive reasoning regarding the cognitive architecture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In Experiment 1, reliable priming effects emerged, whether primes and targets were separated by four or ten fillers.

40|$|Abstract Background Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{vaccine coverage}} rates remain low. This {{is believed to}} reflect parental hesitancy, but {{few studies have examined}} how changes in parents’ attitudes impact HPV vaccine uptake. This study examined the association between changes in parents’ vaccine attitudes and HPV vaccine receipt in their adolescent children. Methods A baseline and 1 -year follow-up survey of HPV vaccine attitudes was administered to parents of 11 – 17  year olds who had not completed the HPV vaccine series. Changes in attitudinal scores (barriers, harms, ineffectiveness, and uncertainties) from the Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scale were assessed. Two outcomes were measured (in parents’ adolescent children) over an 18 -month period and analyzed using multivariable regression; receipt of next scheduled HPV vaccine dose and 3 -dose <b>series</b> <b>completion.</b> Results There were 221 parents who completed the baseline survey (11 % response rate) and 164 with available follow-up data; 60 % of their adolescent children received a next HPV vaccine dose and 38 % completed the vaccine series at follow-up. Decrease in parents’ uncertainties {{was a significant predictor of}} vaccine receipt, with each 1 -point reduction in uncertainties score associated with 4. 9 higher odds of receipt of the next vaccine dose. Higher baseline harms score was the only significant predictor of lower <b>series</b> <b>completion.</b> Conclusions Reductions in parents’ uncertainties appeared to result in greater likelihood of their children receiving the HPV vaccine.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study is}} the first to examine {{associations}} between several area-based socioeconomic factors and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake among boys in the United States (U. S.). Methods Data from the 2012 - 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen restricted-use data were analyzed to examine associations of HPV vaccination initiation (receipt of ≥ 1 dose) and <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> (receipt of three doses) among boys aged 13 - 17  years (N =  19, 518) with several individual-level and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) census measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of HPV vaccination initiation and <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> separately. Results In 2012 - 2013 approximately 27. 9 % (95 % CI 26. 6 %- 29. 2 %) of boys initiated and 10. 38 % (95 % CI 9. 48 %- 11. 29 %) completed the HPV vaccine series. Area-based poverty was not statistically significantly associated with HPV vaccination initiation. It was, however, associated with <b>series</b> <b>completion,</b> with boys living in high-poverty areas (≥ 20 % of residents living below poverty) having higher odds of completing the series (AOR 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 48) than boys in low-poverty areas (0 - 4. 99 %). Interactions between race/ethnicity and ZIP code-level poverty indicated that Hispanic boys living in high-poverty areas had a statistically significantly higher odds of  HPV vaccine initiation (AOR 1. 43, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 97) and <b>series</b> <b>completion</b> (AOR 1. 56, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 2. 32)   than Hispanic boys in  low-poverty areas. Non-Hispanic Black boys in high poverty areas had higher odds of initiation (AOR 2. 23, 95 % CI 1. 33 - 3. 75) and completion (AOR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 6. 44) than non-Hispanic Black boys in low-poverty areas. Rural/urban residence and population density were also significant factors, with boys from urban or densely populated areas having higher odds of initiation and completion compared to boys living in non-urban, less densely populated areas. Conclusion Higher HPV vaccination coverage in urban areas and among racial/ethnic minorities in areas with high poverty may be attributable to factors such as vaccine acceptance, health-care practices, and their access to HPV vaccines through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free vaccines to uninsured and under-insured children. Given the low HPV vaccination rates among boys in the U. S., these results provide important evidence to inform public health interventions to increase HPV vaccination...|$|E
