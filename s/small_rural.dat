5|$|First {{settled by}} Europeans in the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown from}} a {{collection}} of <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> villages and farms to become fully urbanised with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Unlike mosques {{situated}} in urban settings in West Africa, the Larabanga Mosque is comparatively <b>small.</b> <b>Rural</b> mosques, like Larabanga's, were usually conceived {{by a single}} marabout and loosely based on styles seen elsewhere {{such as in the}} Great Mosque of Djenné. In order to achieve a physical resemblance to the architecture used elsewhere, the Larabanga Mosque had to incorporate large buttresses in order to compensate for the poorer quality of building materials. Larabanga is one of eight ancient and highly revered mosques in Ghana, and is also the oldest. It is a place of pilgrimage and is considered the Mecca of West Africa.|$|E
50|$|In Saskatchewan, local {{improvement}} districts (1898) were the precursors of rural municipalities. Discontinuance of {{local improvement}} districts {{in favour of}} <b>smaller</b> <b>rural</b> municipalities began on December 13, 1909. Typically, an rural municipality consists of about nine townships, each six miles by six miles in area. Settled areas of denser populations could form urban municipalities such as villages, towns and cities. In northern Saskatchewan, the large Northern Local Improvement District {{was replaced by the}} Department of Northern Saskatchewan in 1972, and was not subdivided into <b>smaller</b> <b>rural</b> municipalities.|$|R
40|$|Summary. -A {{study using}} 1800 "lost letters " was {{designed}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that returned responses would be greater in <b>smaller</b> <b>rural</b> communities (population M= 964) than in a city (population = 60, 591) or the suburbs (population = 195, 847) unless the addressee was aff'iated with a pro-abortion group. Returns to control, Committee For Free Abortion, and committee Against Free Abortion aff'iates were 37. 2 %, 24. 0 %, 29. 3 %, respectively. From the city, the number of returned letters was much larger than the number from the suburbs except for those letters with an affilia-tion to the pro-abortion condition. Returned letters from the citv were fewer than those from <b>smaller</b> <b>rural</b> communities exceot those letters aKiated with che oro-abor-tion group. More letters affhated with the pro-abortion condition were returned from the suburbs than from the <b>smaller</b> <b>rural</b> communities. The geographic condition influ-enced over-all rates of return. Rates were higher when letters were addressed to a city P. O. Box than to a rural one. Second, rates were also greater in <b>smaller</b> <b>rural</b> commu-nities for letters bearing "in-town " (Molino) and "out-of-town " (Pensacola) addresses than those from the city bearing an "out-of-town " (Molino) address.

5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas was a <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> town. The family's {{house was}} {{moderately}} large for the time; {{it was built}} with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with {{a strong interest in}} Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular Don Quixote. Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.|$|E
5|$|Mao Zedong {{had been}} born and raised at his father's farm in Shaoshanchong, a <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> village named for the nearby Shaoshan mountain. His disciplinarian father, Mao Yichang, had decided to deal with Zedong's rebellious {{attitude}} in a manner typical of the time, by forcing him into an arranged marriage that would compel him to take family matters seriously. Yichang also desired a helper for his own wife, Wen Qimei, whose health had deteriorated through years of heavy agricultural labour. He selected Luo Yixiu in either late 1907 or 1908. Her kinship to the Maos may have helped in this selection, as Luo Yixiu's mother's four brothers, surnamed Mao, lived only two li (1 km) from Mao Yichang's home in Shaoshanchong. Following traditional procedures, a matchmaker would {{have been sent to}} the Luo family house, and the Luo family would have been socially expected to accept the marriage proposal immediately. Luo Helou was happy to see his eldest daughter married. The two families exchanged gifts and signed the marriage contract, after which the marriage was considered inviolable.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E

5|$|Sheet Harbour is a <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> {{community}} {{located on}} the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. The catchment area around the community includes approximately 5,500 people. Sheet Harbour is located slightly more northward compared to other coastal communities in the area, due {{to the shape of}} the harbour. The population of Census Tract 2050154.00, which includes Sheet Harbour and a large amount of land around Sheet Harbour's land borders, is 3,478 as of the 2011 Canadian Census. Census tracts are small subdivisions of land that are used for statistics gathering by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000. Each census tract has a numerical designation. The population of the community of Sheet Harbour is about 800. Immediately west of Sheet Harbour is Sheet Harbour 36, a small Mi'kmaq reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial was}} held at the Assizes in the <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> market town of Buckingham. More used to the trials of local poachers and sheep thieves, Buckingham had never before seen such a spectacle. The town was {{inundated}} with journalists and the merely curious. Byrne was charged with manslaughter. Tom Cribb, Reuben Martin, Thomas Reynolds, and George Cooper were charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter. With such illustrious names as Cribb's, Jackson's and Spring's involved, the trial had the potential to turn into a huge establishment scandal. People of all classes had bet hundreds of pounds on the outcome of the boxing match. Despite being banned, prize fighting enjoyed huge public support and patronage from levels up to the younger male members of the Royal family, some of whom Jackson had taught to box. The support received by Byrne at his trial is testimony to the wealth of his backers. The establishment rallied to his support; Byrne was represented by three barristers and five solicitors, and twelve witnesses journeyed from London to give evidence on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many <b>small</b> <b>rural</b> towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
