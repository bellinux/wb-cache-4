40|$|In this work, a {{detailed}} combined numerical-experimental {{program has been}} developed to study the <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> testing of rubber materials principally used for gasket applications. The correlation between <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> and linear elastic and hyperelastic properties has been systematically investigated. A detailed FE model of the <b>shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness</b> test has been developed with re-meshing functions in order {{to cope with the}} large deformation during simulation of <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> tests over <b>a</b> range of E values. The model is used in modelling <b>shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness</b> on samples with standard thickness (over 6 mm) and the result is validated against published experimental data. FE indentation models of thin samples are then developed and successfully used to predict the <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of thinner samples over a property range relevant to gasket applications. <b>A</b> chart linking <b>shore</b> <b>hardness,</b> Young’s modulus and samples thickness is established and used to analyse <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of three cases including silicone rubber made in the lab with different thicknesses, thin silicone rubber gasket and an EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) gasket for plate heat exchangers. In all of the cases, the estimated E values based on <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> tests are able to predict the deformation of the material under different loading conditions including tensile and compression tests on samples of different shapes. In <b>shore</b> OO <b>hardness</b> modelling, the numerical results show a good agreement with analytical solution for spherical indenters. The <b>shore</b> <b>hardness,</b> thickness and E value chart predicted is used to evaluate the properties (Young’s modulus) of a soft silicone rubber and a latex rubber, in both cases, the E values predicted from hardness tests are able to predict the deformation of the material under tension and compression. In the case of latex rubber, the results also agree with hyperelastic properties from combined tensile and planar tests. Based on the FE model developed, extensive data over a larger spectrum of material properties are developed and used in developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) program for inverse estimation of material properties from <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> and direct prediction of <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> for the cases when the material properties are known.

Different fillers were added to an experimental VPS. The study was developed in two stages: (i) incorporation of fillers in different concentrations: (a) 20 wt% fillers, and (b) 40 wt%. The fillers were added to experimental VPS and mixed with a speed mixer; (ii) characterization of experimental VPS; after the base paste and catalyst paste were mixed, the experimental VPS was used to make specimens specifically for each test, which were stored at 23 °C for 24 hours. The tests were designed according to the specific standardization for the analysis of tensile strength, detail reproduction, <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness,</b> and elastic recovery.

The bases of orthopaedic surgical instruments are usually made of metal, especially stainless steel. Silicone elastomer was chosen as an alternate biocompatible material, which would be compliant on the bone surface when used as the base of an instrument. The {{coefficient of static friction}} was calculated at the bone/material interface {{in the presence of a}} synthetic solution that had a comparable viscosity to that of blood, to assess the friction provided by each base material. Three types of silicone elastomers with different <b>hardnesses</b> (<b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness</b> 23, 50 and 77) and three distinct stainless steel surfaces (obtained by spark erosion, sand blasting and surface grinding) were used to assess the friction provided by the materials on slippery bone. The bone specimens were taken from the flattest region of the femoral shaft of a bovine femur; the outer surfaces of the specimens were kept intact. In general, the stainless steel surfaces exhibited higher values of coefficient of static friction, compared to the silicone elastomer samples. The stainless steel surface finished by spark erosion (surface roughness Ra [*]=[*] 8. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 6 [*]µm) had the highest coefficient value of 0. 74 [*]±[*] 0. 04.

40|$|A major {{consideration}} {{in the performance of}} mouthguards is their ability to absorb energy and reduce transmitted forces when impacted. This is especially important to participants in contact sports such as hockey or football. The thickness of mouthguard materials is directly related to energy absorption and inversely related to transmitted forces when impacted. However, wearer comfort is also an important factor in their use. Thicker mouthguards are not user-friendly. While thickness of material over incisal edges and cusps of teeth is critical, just how thick should a mouthguard be and especially in these two areas? Transmitted forces through different thicknesses of the most commonly used mouthguard material, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) (<b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>Hardness</b> of 80) were compared when impacted with identical forces which were capable of damaging the oro-facial complex. The constant impact force used in the tests was produced by a pendulum and had an energy of 4. 4 joules and a velocity of 3 meters per second. Improvements in energy absorption and reductions in transmitted forces were observed with increasing thickness. However, these improvements lessened when the mouthguard material thickness was greater than 4 mm.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel method for accelerated wear of squeegees used in screen printing and describes {{the development of}} mechanical tests which allow more in-depth measurement of squeegee properties. In this study, squeegees were abraded on the screen press {{so that they could}} be used for subsequent print tests to evaluate the effect of wear on the printed product. Squeegee wear was found to vary between different squeegee types and caused increases in ink transfer and wider printed features. In production this will lead to greater ink consumption, cost per unit and a likelihood of product failure. This also has consequences for the production of functional layers, etc., used in the construction of printed electronics. While more wear generally gave greater increases in ink deposition, the effect of wear differed, depending on the squeegee. There was a correlation between the angle of the squeegee wear and ink film thickness from a worn squeegee. An ability to resist flexing gave a high wear angle and presented a sharper edge at the squeegee/screen interface thus mitigating the effect of wear. There was also a good correlation between resistance to flexing and ink film thickness for unworn squeegees, which was more effective than a comparison based on <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness.</b> Squeegee indentation at different force levels gave more information than <b>a</b> standard <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness</b> test and the apparatus used was able to reliably measure reductions in surface hardness due to solvent absorption.

Moreover, we will also explore a new approach to fabrication that challenges the concept of Computer- Aided Manufacturing (CAM) by introducing a software application that, rather than providing a means of digitizing the geometry of a completed design, allows engineers and designers to create and design structures that are defined at various points by their material behavior as opposed to their geometry.

50|$|The {{governing}} {{standard for}} the Barcol hardness test is ASTM D 2583. Barcol hardness is measured {{on a scale from}} 0 to 100 with the typical range being between 50B and 90B. A measurement of 60B is roughly equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>Shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of 80D or <b>a</b> Rockwell <b>hardness</b> R100. <b>As</b> defined in ASTM D 2583 the scale divisions from 0-100 should each indicate a depth of 0.0076 mm or the equivalent 0.0003 inches.|$|R
40|$|Biodegradable polyurethanes (PUR) were {{prepared}} from polyols derived from castor oil by transesterification of pentaerythritol-modified castor oil and lysine polyisocyanates (LDI and LTI). The polyurethanes obtained {{were characterized by}} Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The mechanical behavior of the polyurethanes was measured by <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness</b> and tensile testing (stress-strain curves). The biodegradable nature of the material was determined by contact angle, water absorption tests, and in vitro degradation in PBS solution. This study aims to {{examine the effect of}} the structure and functionality of diisocyanate on the mechanical properties and in vitro degradation of the material. The results were compared with homologous materials obtained from isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) used in previous works. The objective was to evaluate candidate materials that can be potentially used in tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} UVA-UVB {{irradiation}} on the mechanical properties {{of three different}} industrial types of polydimethylsiloxane and chlorinated polyethylene samples, used in maxillofacial prostheses, was investigated in this study. Mechanical properties and thermal analysis are commonly {{used to determine the}} structural changes and mechanical strength. An aging chamber was used in order to simulate the solar radiation and assess natural aging. Compression and tensile tests were conducted on a Zwick testing machine. Durometer <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements were carried out in a CV digital Shore A durometer according to ASTM D 2240. Glass transition temperature was evaluated with a differential scanning calorimeter. Simple mathematical models were developed to correlate the measured properties with irradiation time. The effect of UVA-UVB irradiation on compressive behavior affected model parameters. Significant deterioration seems to occur due to irradiation in samples. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
