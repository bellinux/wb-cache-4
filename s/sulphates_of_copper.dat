We had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark. This mill was a six-stamp affair, driven by steam. Six tall, upright rods of iron, as large as a man's ankle, and heavily shod with a mass of iron and steel at their lower ends, were framed together like a gate, and these rose and fell, one after the other, in a ponderous dance, in an iron box called a [...] "battery." [...] Each of these rods or stamps weighed six hundred pounds. One of us stood by the battery all day long, breaking up masses of silver-bearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the battery. The ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to powder, and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it to a creamy paste. The minutest particles were driven through a fine wire screen which fitted close around the battery, and were washed into great tubs warmed by super-heated steam--amalgamating pans, they are called. The mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by revolving [...] "mullers."

40|$|The Cathedral of León {{is one of}} the {{principal}} Gothic cathedrals in Spain, renowned for its impressive stained-glass windows. Since the beginning of its construction in the 13 th century, it has suffered structural problems which have kept it under constant construction and restoration works. An extensive restoration carried out in the late 19 th century rebuilt many parts of the building, including the transept and the south façade. To add stability to each course, cut stones were joined using metal brackets; these reinforcements are usually carried out using iron brackets fixed by molten lead, but in this case the materials used were bronze brackets and molten sulphur. The corrosion of these brackets is causing tension, resulting in cracks and fractures in the stones. This article summarises the results of a research project carried out by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) and the Instituto del Patrimonio Cultural de España (IPCE) aimed at understanding the causes and mechanisms of this corrosion process in order to establish the scientific basis for the conservation works. Samples of brackets and corrosion products from the south gable have been studied and the metal characterised by means of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). Corrosion products have been identified using SEM-EDX. Laboratory tests have been carried out to simulate the initial steps of the corrosion processes. Results have shown that the brackets are made of cast bronze, presenting a large amount of pores and inclusions. Thick corrosion crusts are present in the interface between the bronze and the sulphur, with a layered structure <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> sulphides (covellite (CuS)) and <b>sulphates,</b> mainly <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> (brochantite, Cu 4 (SO) 4 (OH) 6; antlerite, Cu 3 (SO 4) (OH) 4). Laboratory tests have demonstrated that covellite forms immediately from the direct reaction <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> with molten sulphur. This is a spontaneous reaction that continues over time as long as copper and sulphur are present. In spite of the great thickness of the covellite layers, up to 2 cm at some points, the formation of covellite does not involve an increase in volume, so it cannot explain the fractures in the stones. However, when water and oxygen reach the covellite through pores and cracks in the stone, different sulphates are formed and sulphuric acid, which attacks the metallic copper, is released. The formation <b>of</b> <b>sulphates</b> causes an increase in the volume of corrosion products, and this is responsible for the mechanical damage to the stones. Our work has demonstrated that the formation <b>of</b> <b>sulphates</b> by the reaction of covellite with oxygen and water is the controlling step of the degradation process. This has significant implications for conservation: while the degradation process cannot be completely arrested, it can be limited by reducing the water uptake of the stones and the entry of water through cracks and joints in the masonry.

When {{solutions}} of caustic potassa or soda, or <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> magnesia, or <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> soda, were {{acted upon}} by the electric current, just as much oxygen and hydrogen was evolved from them as from the diluted sulphuric acid, {{with which they were}} compared. When a solution of ammonia, rendered a better conductor by <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> ammonia (554.), or a solution of subcarbonate of potassa was experimented with, the hydrogen evolved was in the same quantity as that set free from the diluted sulphuric acid with which they were compared.

On placing {{solution}} of iodide of potassium in paper {{at one of}} the decomposing localities, and solution <b>of</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> soda at the other, so that the electric current should pass through both at once, the {{solution of}} iodide was slowly decomposed, yielding iodine at the anode and alkali at the cathode; but the solution <b>of</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> soda exhibited no signs of decomposition, neither acid nor alkali being evolved from it. On placing the wires so that the iodide alone was subject to the action of the current (900.), it was quickly and powerfully decomposed; but on arranging them so that the <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> soda alone was subject to action, it still refused to yield up its elements. Finally, the apparatus was so arranged under a wet bell-glass, that it could be left for twelve hours, the current passing during the whole time through a solution <b>of</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> soda, retained in its place by only two thicknesses of bibulous litmus and turmeric paper. At the end of that time it was ascertained by the decomposition of iodide of potassium at the second place of action, that the current was passing and had passed for the twelve hours, and yet no trace of acid or alkali from the <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> soda appeared.|$|R
