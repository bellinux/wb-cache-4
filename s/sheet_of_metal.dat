After welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds, providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow, and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal.|$|E

Each trough is a , which can be made simply by bending a flat <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.|$|E

Other artefacts that form the village include a clay tuyère from a pair of bellows, whetstones, iron knives and iron currency bars, which could be used as tokens and exchanged for goods. The glazed jar on display is a 1936 copy of one from the village site; however some of the original storage bowls are included in the displays which were re assembled by Arthur Bulleid, who discovered the site in 1892. In the old kitchen {{at the rear of the}} building is a log boat excavated near the village.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1935 Leipzig Spring Fair, an {{electric}} tabletop railway, Trix Express, was displayed to a gauge described as [...] "half nought gauge", {{which was then}} abbreviated as gauge 00 ("nought-nought"). Märklin, another German firm, followed suit with its 00 gauge railway for the 1935 Leipzig Autumn Fair. The Märklin 00 gauge track that appeared {{more than ten years}} after Bing's tabletop railway had a very similar appearance to the previous Bing track. On the Märklin version, however, the rails were fixed to the tin 'ballast' as in the prototype, whilst the Bing tracks were simply stamped into the ballast, so that track and ballast were made of single <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} forming is in {{relation}} to two things, the flow and stretch of material. [...] As a die forms a shape from a flat <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> {{there is a need}} for the material to move into the shape of the die. [...] The flow of material is controlled through pressure applied to the blank and lubrication applied to the die or the blank. [...] If the form moves too easily, wrinkles will occur in the part. [...] To correct this, more pressure or less lubrication is applied to the blank to limit the flow of material and cause the material to stretch or set thin. [...] If too much pressure is applied, the part will become too thin and break. [...] Drawing metal requires finding the correct balance between wrinkles and breaking to achieve a successful part.|$|E
2500|$|Merengues {{are fast}} {{arrangements}} with a [...] beat. The traditional instrumentation for a conjunto típico (traditional band), the usual performing group of folk merengue, is a diatonic accordion, a two–sided drum, called a tambora, {{held on the}} lap, and a güira. A güira is a percussion instrument {{that sounds like a}} maraca. It is a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> with small bumps on it (created with hammer and nail), shaped into a cylinder, and played with a stiff brush. The güira is brushed steadily on the downbeat with a [...] "and-a" [...] thrown in at certain points, or played in more complex patterns that generally mark the time. Caballito rhythm, or a quarter and two eighths, is also common. The double headed drum is played on one side with a stick syncopation {{and on the other side}} with the palm of the hand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of a horizontal pendulum is that it achieves very low frequencies of oscillation in a compact instrument. [...] The [...] "gate" [...] is slightly tilted, so the weight tends to slowly return to a central position. [...] The pendulum is adjusted (before the damping is installed) to oscillate once per three seconds, or once per thirty seconds. [...] The general-purpose instruments of small stations or amateurs usually oscillate once per ten seconds. [...] A pan of oil is placed under the arm, and a small <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> mounted {{on the underside of}} the arm drags in the oil to damp oscillations. The level of oil, position on the arm, and angle and size of sheet is adjusted until the damping is [...] "critical," [...] that is, almost having oscillation. [...] The hinge is very low friction, often torsion wires, so the only friction is the internal friction of the wire. [...] Small seismographs with low proof masses are placed in a vacuum to reduce disturbances from air currents.|$|E

2500|$|Direction {{refers to}} the shape, quality and {{evenness}} of a lamp's output. [...] The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. [...] The first are {{the specifics of the}} lamp, reflector and lens assembly. [...] Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector {{and the nature of the}} lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the pattern of light. [...] Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. [...] In ellipsoidal reflector spotlights (ERS) or profile spotlights, there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. [...] When the cones of both intersect at the throw distance (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. [...] When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. [...] Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. [...] This is typically a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> with a shape cut into it. [...] It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. [...] Gobos, or templates, [...] come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.|$|E
2500|$|The nucleus was {{discovered}} in 1911, {{as a result of}} Ernest Rutherford's efforts to test Thomson's [...] "plum pudding model" [...] of the atom. The electron had already been discovered earlier by J.J. Thomson himself. Knowing that atoms are electrically neutral, Thomson postulated that there must be a positive charge as well. In his plum pudding model, Thomson suggested that an atom consisted of negative electrons randomly scattered within a sphere of positive charge. Ernest Rutherford later devised an experiment with his research partner Hans Geiger and with help of Ernest Marsden, that involved the deflection of alpha particles (helium nuclei) directed at a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> foil. He reasoned that if Thomson's model were correct, the positively charged alpha particles would easily pass through the foil with very little deviation in their paths, as the foil should act as electrically neutral if the negative and positive charges are so intimately mixed as to make it appear neutral. To his surprise, many of the particles were deflected at very large angles. Because the mass of an alpha particle is about 8000 times that of an electron, it became apparent that a very strong force must be present if it could deflect the massive and fast moving alpha particles. He realized that the plum pudding model could not be accurate and that the deflections of the alpha particles could only be explained if the positive and negative charges were separated from each other and that the mass of the atom was a concentrated point of positive charge. This justified the idea of a nuclear atom with a dense center of positive charge and mass.|$|E

It is matter of history that looking-glasses were made in the first century of the Christian era, but whether quicksilver was poured upon the back, as it is now, or whether some other metal was used, we do not know.|$|E
