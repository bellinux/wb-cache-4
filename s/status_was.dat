50|$|Religion is {{generally}} {{perceived as an}} ascribed status but for those individuals who choose a religion as an adult, or convert to another religion, their religion becomes an achieved status, based on Linton's definition. It is commonly perceived that ascribed <b>statuses</b> <b>are</b> irreversible while achieved <b>statuses</b> <b>are</b> reversible. Linton uses Leo Schnore's research to illustrate how ascribed <b>statuses</b> can <b>be</b> both irreversible and reversible.

5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial <b>status</b> <b>was</b> a different story.

This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E
5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this <b>status</b> <b>was</b> not permanent.

A chief's power in Ojibwa society was based on persuasion and consensus; it was contingent, holding only as long as the community of elders, including the women, chose to respect and follow the chief's lead.|$|E

50|$|The Study of Man {{established}} Linton {{as one of}} anthropology's premier theorists, particularly amongst sociologists {{who worked}} outside of the Boasian mainstream.

5|$|Charing Cross, at the {{junction}} of Strand and Whitehall, {{was the site of}} the first public monument in what is now the City of Westminster, the cross commissioned by Edward I late in the 13th century in memory of his queen, Eleanor of Castile. Destroyed by order of the Long Parliament in 1647, the Eleanor cross was replaced after the Restoration by the equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur, the oldest public sculpture now standing in the borough. In 1865 a facsimile of the cross was erected in the forecourt of Charing Cross railway station. Charing Cross was declared the official centre of London in 1831 and a plaque marking this <b>status</b> <b>was</b> installed near Le Sueur's statue in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person.

An assessment of the present <b>status</b> <b>was</b> performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
