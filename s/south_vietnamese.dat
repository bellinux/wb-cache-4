5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese military authorities. The <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military in Huế also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} which {{contributed to the}} {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of secrecy, which <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. It is hard to fathom how <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost secrecy. So when North Vietnamese forces attacked the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> column along Route 7, there was little <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E
5|$|In the Phước Bình sub-sector, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment {{were able}} to overrun <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{government}} positions within 25 minutes, and they claimed to have killed 115 <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers in the process At 9am on May 11, the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion was airlifted into a small town located about 14 kilometres away from Phước Bình in the south-east. As the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion marched upward towards Phước Bình, the Viet Cong 272nd and 273rd Regiment was ordered to destroy the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Rangers. However, {{by the time the}} 272nd Regiment arrived at the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> staging area, the Rangers had already pulled out and successfully recaptured Phước Bình. Meanwhile, on May 15, the Viet Cong 274th Regiment defeated two <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Regional Force companies along Route 20, and destroyed 20 vehicles in the process.|$|E

5|$|In the end, {{it was the}} {{ordinary}} <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers and their families who paid the ultimate price, as North Vietnamese artillery heavily destroyed much of the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military convoy on Route 7.|$|E
5|$|Since December 1974, the North Vietnamese {{prepared}} for the offensive by conducting raids on various <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> outposts and broadcasting fake radio messages to keep <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders guessing about the location of their next assault. While the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units were kept occupied by Communist diversions, North Vietnamese General Hoang Minh Thao began moving his troops into attacking positions. The VPA 7th Combat Engineer Regiment was tasked with connecting Route 14 at North Vo Dinh with Highway 19 near Mang Yang Pass, which surpassed the district of Kontum. The VPA 10th Infantry Division began withdrawing from Duc Lap, and only left a small force behind to continue the bombardment of Pleiku, as artillery and tanks units took positions north of Kontum. The 320A Infantry Division deployed a small unit west of Pleiku to apply additional pressure on <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> positions at La Son, Thanh An, and Don Tam. Elements of the 95th Regiment conducted blocking operations along Highway 19 to stop <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> reinforcements from reaching their destination. The 198th Special Forces Regiment raided <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> depots at Pleiku, while the main formation of the 10th and 320A Infantry Divisions marched on Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|The {{third factor}} {{which led to}} the quick {{disintegration}} of II Corps was the poor state of morale amongst the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. By 1975, the morale of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers and their commanding officers had reached its lowest point as the war continued to drag on with no end in sight. The determination of the ARVN officer corps had taken a serious blow when <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam returned from the United States in February 1975, and reported that no additional military or economic aid had been offered. When the order was given to abandon the Central Highlands, the primary concern of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military personnel was not battlefield victories, but the welfare of their families. Consequently, when the North Vietnamese attacked <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> forces on Route 7, large numbers of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers left the battlefield to search for their families amidst the chaos. During the final days of South Vietnam’s existence, the average <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldier showed more loyalty to his family than to his commanding officer, which {{had a significant impact on}} his willingness to fight on.|$|E

5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} {{contemplated}} by the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> was doomed {{by the thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too common as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00am on March 10, North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} of the 368th Artillery Regiment dragged 12 pieces of artillery which included 85mm, 105mm and 122mm guns onto the top of Nui Vu and Han Thon, and aimed their guns directly on Hill-211 and the administrative centre of Tien Phuoc, to support the 31st Regiment attacking those areas. At 1:30pm, following two failed counter-attacks, <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units in Phuoc Lam deserted from the battlefield. In the mean time, however, <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> troops in Tien Phuoc could bare held their ground with support from two A-37 bombers, after <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders on the ground had called for reinforcement from Chu Lai. By 4:00pm, Tien Phuoc was captured by the VPA 2nd Division.|$|E
5|$|At around 6:50 am on 5 April, the Viet Cong 5th Division {{moved across}} the Cambodian border to stage the main attack on Lộc Ninh. The Viet Cong assault opened with a heavy barrage of artillery, rocket and mortar fire {{targeting}} {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment and the Lộc Ninh district compound. The Viet Cong simultaneously mounted other attacks throughout the ARVN 5th Infantry Division's areas of operations in Lai Khê and Quần Lợi. There was also indirect fire on <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> positions in Phước Long Province, mainly targeting Phước Vinh, Sông Bé, and Bo Duc. Following the artillery barrage, Viet Cong infantry, supported by about 25 tanks, attacked Lộc Ninh from the west. In the initial assault, they tried to overrun the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> regimental compound located {{at the south end of}} the airstrip. Despite the ferocity of the onslaught, <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers held their ground and fought desperately to hold the enemy at bay; <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> artillerymen lowered the muzzles of their 105mm howitzers and fired directly at enemy infantry formations moving through the rubber trees.|$|E

5|$|Believing it {{was useless}} to {{continue}} arguing with Cao, Vann climbed back into his L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and left Tan Hiep. Throughout the afternoon, he continued to press Cao to quickly deploy the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> paratroopers. He was fearful that the battle {{would turn out to}} be the largest defeat of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> forces up to that point of the war. Cao promised to deploy the second Civil Guard battalion which had just arrived at the southwest flank of Ap Bac, and to drop the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion at around 16:00 behind Ba's armored personnel carriers. Late in the afternoon, a flight of C-123 Providers, with about 300 <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> paratroopers aboard, closed in on their objective and quickly drew machine gun fire from the hamlet. The C-123 pilots changed course to avoid the ground fire, but either the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> jump master or the American flight leader did not compensate for the change. As a result, the paratroopers landed right in front of the entrenched Viet Cong positions, instead of behind the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron and the Civil Guards.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} season of 1975, the Vietnam People's Army High Command in Hanoi made the {{decision}} to seize the major <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> cities of Huế and Da Nang, and also destroy the various <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units in I Corps Tactical Zone, led by ARVN General Ngô Quang Trưởng. Originally, the campaign was planned to take place over two phases; during the seasons of spring-summer and autumn. However, as the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces rolled over <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> defences on the outskirts of Huế and Da Nang, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu ordered General Trưởng to abandon all territories under his control, and pull his forces back to the coastal areas of I Corps. However, the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps picked off one <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> unit after another, until Huế and Da Nang was completely surrounded. By March 29, 1975, North Vietnamese troops had full control of Huế and Da Nang, while South Vietnam lost all territories in I Corps and most of the units belonging to the ARVN 1st Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in the day, {{at about}} 2:30pm, <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} that the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had moved into positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu’s order was carried out, elements of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had engaged in clashes with the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> for more than 10 hours. By 5pm the North Vietnamese 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> ranger battalion.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt the North Vietnamese assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from the North Vietnamese 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Ranger Battalion held off the North Vietnamese 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support. Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, the North Vietnamese 149th Regiment defeated the <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E

5|$|On March 5, 1975, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps officially {{commenced}} {{its campaign}} against <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> forces of I Corps.
