25|$|The Court of Appeal {{decided the}} matter in Coughlan's favour. It took into account the {{importance}} of the promise to her, {{and the fact that the}} consequence to the Health Authority of honouring the promise was merely financial in nature, and while the Authority had agreed to fund the cost of her treatment it had offered no alternative permanent accommodation. In the circumstances, the Court was of the view that for the Authority to frustrate Coughlan's legitimate expectation was <b>so</b> <b>unfair</b> that it amounted to an abuse of power. Furthermore, there were no overriding public interest considerations to justify the Authority's decision.|$|E
25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be <b>so</b> <b>unfair</b> as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E
500|$|As {{regards the}} second question, in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{identified}} {{three categories of}} legitimate expectations. Category (b) involves procedural legitimate expectations, and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality. Categories (a) and (c) relate to substantive legitimate expectations. Category (a) cases are those which lie [...] "in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field". The public authority [...] "is only required {{to bear in mind}} its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, category (c) cases are usually those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". When assessing such a case, the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is <b>so</b> <b>unfair</b> that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy. A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws. In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999), he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not [...] "hermetically sealed", and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach: ...|$|E

500|$|However, the courts' role in {{protecting}} substantive legitimate expectations was clearly {{established by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999). The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her [...] "home for life". The Court granted the application for review {{on the ground that}} the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority. It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned, courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it (such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case). As regards substantive legitimate expectations, courts would decide whether cases lie [...] "... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field", or are those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". In the first situation, the public authority [...] "is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, when assessing a case in the second situation, the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is <b>so</b> <b>unfair</b> that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy.|$|E

2500|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} legitimate expectation– promise {{having the}} character of a contract. If a lawful promise or practice has [...] "induced a legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural", the court will decide [...] "whether to frustrate that expectation is <b>so</b> <b>unfair</b> that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power". When the expectation is established to be legitimate, [...] "the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy". Most cases of this type are likely to be [...] "cases where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation {{the character of}} a contract".|$|E

50|$|The {{problems}} for the employer are that constructive dismissal is a contractual claim, which {{can be made in}} a tribunal for up to £25,000 or in court without limit, and, by dismissing constructively, it by definition misses out on the correct procedure meaning that even if the reason was fair, the decision was probably not, and <b>so</b> an <b>unfair</b> dismissal usually arises, creating a statutory claim alongside the contractual claim.|$|R
2500|$|McManaman's {{image of}} being a {{contract}} rebel and mercenary was exacerbated by his involvement in a year-long dispute between 1997 and 1998 with Umbro, his football boot sponsor. Umbro sued him for breach of contract for knowingly wearing Reebok branded boots in contravention of the deal, and deliberately [...] "blacking out" [...] their logo on his boots in protest. McManaman argued that his contract was unenforceable and an unlawful restraint of trade. McManaman claimed {{that he was being}} exploited. He hired the services of agent Simon Fuller to help free him from the sponsorship contract. The court initially ordered McManaman to fulfil his contract, plus an undertaking to pay Umbro's legal costs for launching contempt of court proceedings against him in 1997, which McManaman accepted and apologised for. A year on, however, McManaman continued to dishonour the deal. He finally won an out-of-court settlement in October 1998, freeing him to negotiate with other companies for what he regarded as remuneration appropriate to his status. The case, in addition to his Liverpool contract wrangles saw the media describe McManaman as the [...] "star performer in his own soap", though McManaman's Liverpool manager Roy Evans defended the player, stating, [...] "Macca is so laid-back you would never know he was hurting inside.

40|$|It is {{important}} for a cooperative to assign an appropriate cost to the equity capital its members provide. Because cooperatives usually do not issue publicly traded capital stock, there is no market value on which they can base the cost of equity.

Consequently, {{it is easy for}} them to undervalue the cost of equity, which can cause them to rely too much on equity capital and underestimate overall capital costs. That can result in capital costs that are higher than necessary and overinvestment in assets. A cooperative that undervalues the cost of equity is also less likely to retire member equity in a timely manner <b>so</b> an <b>unfair</b> share of the costs of financing the organization is borne by individuals who no longer benefit from its services...|$|R
