5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recorded history}} of the Glacier Bay area starts with the 1741 Russian expedition of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov. La Perouse (after whom one of the glaciers in the bay was named subsequently) established contact with the local inhabitants, the Tlingits at Lutya Bay, in 1786. This {{was followed by the}} Russians <b>staking</b> their claim to the region.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with <b>staking</b> {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Brodeur visits Speranza in his cell, {{and offers}} {{to have his}} death {{sentence}} commuted in exchange for stopping the murders. Speranza takes the offer. That night, Parmelly visits Danielle, who has become agitated since Mulder and Scully have begun <b>staking</b> out her house. The agents now suspect Parmelly to be behind the murders and leave to notify Brodeur, who asks that Parmelly be arrested. Soon afterward, Danielle wakes up to see Neech standing by her room door. She grabs her gun and confronts Parmelly, thinking he is Neech's resurrected form. The agents and a police task force arrive to see her shoot and kill Parmelly. Meanwhile, Brodeurassuming that Charez and Parmelly were on the listthinks Speranza has reneged on their deal and has him taken to the showers. Before Brodeur kills him, Speranza claims that one person remains on the list.|$|E

In 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana.

5|$|Ritter leaves Scully <b>staking</b> out Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she}} sees Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him <b>staking</b> command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and <b>staking</b> of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.|$|E
5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was <b>staking</b> too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E

50|$|In each <b>stake,</b> {{one of the}} meetinghouses is {{designated}} the <b>stake</b> center. This building is usually the largest meetinghouse in the <b>stake,</b> but where <b>stakes</b> are large in area the <b>stake</b> center may be chosen {{because it is more}} centrally-located in the boundaries of the <b>stake.</b> The <b>stake</b> center is where functions of the <b>stake</b> such as <b>stake</b> conferences, <b>stake</b> meetings, and <b>stake</b> activities are usually held. There are usually offices for conducting <b>stake</b> business in the <b>stake</b> center. During the mid-to-late 19th and early-20th century, in areas with larger LDS populations, <b>stake</b> tabernacles were used for most of the larger activities now performed at <b>stake</b> centers, while the <b>stake</b> offices were located in what was known as a <b>stake</b> house. In areas with fewer members and no <b>stake</b> tabernacle, a <b>stake</b> house was used like a modern <b>stake</b> center for both meetings and offices.|$|R
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include <b>staking</b> terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} in the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Transylvania, with frequent stakings and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and <b>staking</b> of vampires.

Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood. In the second case, Arnold Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Seward was an expansionist, {{and sought}} {{opportunities}} to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) {{as a financial}} liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, {{only to be told}} {{there was no time to}} deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was <b>staking</b> an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.|$|E
