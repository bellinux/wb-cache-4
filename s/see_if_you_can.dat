2500|$|Povenmire persisted {{and later}} pitched the series to Nickelodeon, {{where it was}} {{considered}} by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated. Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually [...] "means they {{throw it in the}} trash later." [...] Disney then surprised him by accepting. Said Povenmire, [...] "Disney was the first to say, 'Let's <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it for 26 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Hoggard was {{considered}} a scapegoat for his sudden falling out of favour the England and Wales Cricket Board. [...] "We've had the same problems with the ECB since I started international cricket," [...] {{he wrote in his}} book. [...] "There were people slagging them off when I first came in and there are people still slagging them off. [...] And it's not the ECB who pick the side anyway. [...] <b>See</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find a player with a good word to say about the ECB. [...] What are they going to do, sue me for telling the truth?" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the book's publication, Timothy L. O'Brien was a {{reporter}} for The New York Times, and had reported on Donald Trump's businesses since 1990. O'Brien interviewed Trump for the book, and said that Trump enjoyed his presence, despite O'Brien's claim that Trump once referred to him as a [...] "total whack job." [...] Trump said that he cooperated with O'Brien because, [...] "It's almost like a competitive thing with me. I almost want to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get Trump." [...] O'Brien also interviewed contestants from Trump's reality television series, The Apprentice, as well as Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, casino owner Steve Wynn, and former New York City mayor Ed Koch.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} The Male Animal opened, Darryl F. Zanuck, {{the head of}} 20th Century Fox, was [...] rumored {{to have been in}} the audience. During the performance, he told an {{assistant}} to note Tierney's name. Later that night, Zanuck dropped by the Stork Club, where he saw a young lady on the dance floor. He told his assistant, [...] "Forget the girl from the play. <b>See</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sign that one." [...] It was Tierney. At first, Zanuck did not think she was the actress he had seen. Tierney was quoted (after the fact), saying: [...] "I always had several different 'looks', a quality that proved useful in my career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oppewall {{obtained}} her master's {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1969 {{and moved to}} Los Angeles, California. At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, [...] "I can {{teach you how to}} draw, I cannot teach you how to think or <b>see.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> think and you can see, you can stay." [...] Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, [...] "saw something in me I didn't know was there." [...] By the end of her time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits. Eames made more than 100 small personal and educational films in that time and, {{as a result of her}} exposure to them, Oppewall said she got into the film business [...] "by accident." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E

500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances." [...] The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, [...] "Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be <b>seen...</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame." ...|$|R
6000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the month}} it became {{suddenly}} known in London that Lord Grex had died at Brighton. There was a Garter to be given away, and everybody was filled with regret that such an ornament to the Peerage should have departed from them. The Conservative papers remembered how excellent a politician he had been in his younger days, and the world was informed that the family of Grex of Grex was about the oldest in Great Britain of which authentic records were in existence. Then there came another note from Lady Mabel to Tregear. [...] "I shall be in town on the 31st in the old house, with Miss Cassewary, and will <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> come on the 1st.
