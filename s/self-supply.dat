5|$|In 2002, Eduardo Duhalde {{fixed the}} prices for public {{services}} such as electricity, gas, and water supply. These remained fixed during the terms of Duhalde and Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, despite the crisis that motivated them having ended. As the inflation rate grew during the period, the state financed part of these prices with subsidies. Investment in these areas decreased, and the generation and distribution networks suffered. Argentina lost its <b>self-supply</b> of energy, and had to import it, rather than being able to export surpluses.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{did not run}} for reelection. Instead, Cristina Kirchner was the {{candidate}} for the Front for Victory party, becoming president in the 2007 presidential election. Her first term of office started with a conflict with the agricultural sector, and her proposed taxation system was rejected. After this she nationalized private pension funds, and fired {{the president of the}} Central Bank. The price of public services remained subsidised, the country lost its <b>self-supply</b> of energy, and she renationalized energy firm YPF as a result. The country fell into sovereign default in 2014. The country had good relations with other South American nations, and a rocky one with the United States and the United Kingdom. She also continued her husband's human rights policies, and had a rocky relationship with the press. Néstor Kirchner died in 2010, and Cristina Kirchner was reelected in 2011. She established currency controls during her second term. Several corruption scandals took place, and she faced several demonstrations against her rule. In the 2013 midterm elections the Front for Victory failed to achieve the two-thirds majority necessary to amend the constitution to allow the president to run for a third term. Governor Daniel Scioli was appointed as {{the candidate}} for the 2015 presidential elections. Scioli was defeated by Mayor Mauricio Macri in a ballotage.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{calculate}} the <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield-necessary to promote dairy management based on <b>self-supplied</b> forage - from actual survey data, and to study the <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield per unit of land area, which is equivalent to land productivity. The <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yields of eight dairy farmers in Hokkaido were calculated and used to categorize the farmers into three groups according to type of management: (i) dairy management which achieved high <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield through efficient use of <b>self-supplied</b> forage; (ii) dairy management which produced average <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield but high milk yield per delivered cow(i. e. a cow that has calved at least once) through use of purchased feed concentrates in addition to <b>self-supplied</b> forage; and (iii) dairy management which only produced low milk yield from <b>self-supplied</b> forage. Land is the most fundamental farming resource. In light of this, it is necessary to maximize the use of farmland by shifting to farm management based on <b>self-supplied</b> forage, which is resilient to changes in the external environment and therefore stable. To make this shift possible, efficient land use will be a priority management goal, of which <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield is a useful indicator. The case study also revealed that the <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield per unit of land area considered adequate for the management of individual dairy farmers differs from the maximum <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield that can be produced from land. Individual farmers do not experience management problems if they can earn large incomes even where their <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield per unit of land area is low. However, the fact that some farmers within a district experience <b>self-supplied</b> forage shortages and need to purchase feed shows the importance of improving the efficiency of the use of land, a common local resource, beyond individual farm managemen...|$|R

25|$|The first {{commercially viable}} mining company was John Munroe Longyear's Arctic Coal Company, which {{established}} Longyear City (from 1925 Longyearbyen). By 1910, 200 men {{were working for}} the company. The town and mines were bought by the Norwegian-owned Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani in 1916. Another early entrepreneur was Ernest Mansfield and his Northern Exploration Company. He started marble mining on Blomstrandhalvøya, but the marble was unusable and his company never had any profitable ventures, despite surveying {{large parts of the}} island. By the 1910s, it was established that coal was the only economically viable mining activity on Svalbard. Swedish interests established mines at Pyramiden and Sveagruva, while Dutch investors established Barentsburg in 1920.

2500|$|The general {{concept of}} {{artificial}} machines {{capable of producing}} copies of themselves dates back at least several hundred years. An early reference is an anecdote regarding the philosopher René Descartes, who suggested to Queen Christina of Sweden that the human body could {{be regarded as a}} machine; she responded by pointing to a clock and ordering [...] "see to it that it reproduces offspring." [...] Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist. Samuel Butler proposed in his 1872 novel Erewhon that machines were already capable of reproducing themselves but it was man who made them do so, [...] and added that [...] "machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind". In George Eliot's 1879 book Impressions of Theophrastus Such, a series of essays that she wrote in the character of a fictional scholar named Theophrastus, the essay [...] "Shadows of the Coming Race" [...] speculated about self-replicating machines, with Theophrastus asking [...] "how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of <b>self-supply,</b> self-repair, and reproduction".|$|E

I for my part cannot see any reason why a sufficiently penetrating thinker, who can see his way through a thousand years or so, should not conceive a parliament of machines, in which the manners were excellent and the motions infallible in logic: one honourable instrument, a remote descendant of the Voltaic family, might discharge a powerful current (entirely without animosity) on an honourable instrument opposite, of more upstart origin, but belonging to the ancient edge-tool race which we already at Sheffield see paring thick iron as if it were mellow cheese--by this unerringly directed discharge operating on movements corresponding to what we call Estimates, and by necessary mechanical consequence on movements corresponding to what we call the Funds, which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as [...] "sensitive." [...] For every machine would be perfectly educated, that is to say, would have the suitable molecular adjustments, which would act not the less infallibly for being free from the fussy accompaniment of that consciousness to which our prejudice gives a supreme governing rank, when in truth it is an idle parasite on the grand sequence of things." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Self-supply</b> is not {{formally}} {{part of the}} water strategy to increase access to improved water sources in most developing countries and is not commonly counted in inventories of access to improved water sources,.
