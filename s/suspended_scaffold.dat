50|$|The {{second group}} of teams began the race on the grounds near Tel Yavne archaeological site. Their first clue {{instructed}} them {{to make their way}} to Yavne's water tower, where they would have to fill a bucket of water and bring {{it to the top of}} the tower while sitting on a <b>suspended</b> <b>scaffold</b> and using chains to go up and balance the scaffold. Once at the top, teams would have to fill an empty bucket, which would go down and then would release their car's keys. If teams didn't bring enough water to make the bucket go down, they would have to descend and bring another bucket of water.|$|E
50|$|The {{temporary}} access scaffold {{required to}} complete the works had to consider the ancient monument status of the bridge so was unable to be tied into the structure. <b>Suspending</b> a <b>scaffold</b> from the carriageway was also unsuitable because the bridge could not withstand the kentledge weight required. The chosen solution was for the scaffold to be founded on the river bed with tubes secured around piers providing anchorage.|$|R

The large bell sits on a short <b>scaffold</b> <b>suspended</b> from a {{mechanism}} allowing the bell to rock and ring. The driver of the wagon is turned toward the camera. A man stands in the darkened open doorway of the church. A cross is perched on a bell tower on the apex of the roof. The surrounding landscape is flat and fairly devoid of large vegetation. Snow [?] lays on the ground...|$|R
5000|$|From the 30 January 1867 until 5 November {{that year}} hourly checks were made {{until it was}} deemed safe to reopen the pit. Tomlinson {{describes}} a visit he made to the pithead during this time: [...] One shaft was filled up - chokeful of earth and rubbish the other had a wooden <b>scaffold</b> <b>suspended</b> by wire ropes, and let down about twenty yards. Upon this cage was first piled straw, &c., and then puddled clay so that, except a small aperture from a temporary iron pipe (which contains a valve to close or open the orifice at will), this shaft, also, was sealed up.|$|R
40|$|This {{numerical}} study {{considers the}} steady, axisymmetric flow inside a novel open-top rotating-base bioreactor. The flow is simulated over a Reynolds number range {{that corresponds to}} steady axisymmetric flow. The swirling flow consists of two distinct recirculation zones, namely a primary dominant region, and a secondary recirculation bubble that is formed close to the axis of rotation. Of particular interest to tissue engineering is the stress distribution inside the bioreactor. The stress is quantified by the coordinate-independent principal stress terms, namely, the positive tensile, intermediate, and negative compressive components. The analysis indicates {{that there are three}} main regions of high strain within the bioreactor: at the rotating bottom lid; on the side walls; and at the surface close to the breakdown bubble. Finally, the local flow environment of a <b>suspended</b> <b>scaffold</b> is determined...|$|E
5000|$|The 2009 {{video for}} the song Beautiful https://www.youtube.com/loverockrevolution {{featured}} an innovative script {{written and directed by}} the group members themselves. Billed as 'One Camera, One Shot, No Special Effects' this video was an antidote to the expensive and over-produced music videos that have become an expectation of the industry. Singer Enright performed in his characteristic wings, while feathers, balloons, hearts, bubbles, and other paraphernalia floated upwards as if by magic. Occasionally, the other band members appeared, apparently playing their instruments while upside down. The companion video Making Us Beautiful http://www.myspace.com/scatterheartband reveals the secret: Jesse was hanging upside down, <b>suspended</b> from a <b>scaffold</b> while wearing a climbing harness under his feathers. With the camera also positioned upside down, friends tossing various flying objects from the scaffold, {{and the rest of the}} band sneaking into the shot with instruments in hand, the effect was complete. The 2009 video {{for the song}} [...] "More Than A Man", which featured typical Scatterheart antics with the stunning Vancouver skyline as a backdrop, was in rotation in 2009 at MuchMusic http://www.muchmusic.com. A third video, based on the song [...] "The Free" [...] featured concert footage from the 10th Annual International Rock Festival http://www.rockfestival.co.kr/ in Busan, South Korea.|$|R
60|$|During {{wet weather}} the {{situation}} of the artificers {{on the top of the}} building was extremely disagreeable; for although their work did not require great exertion, yet, as each man had his particular part to perform, either in working the crane or in laying the stones, it required the closest application and attention, not only on the part of Mr. Peter Logan, the foreman, who was constantly on the walls, but also of the chief workmen. Robert Selkirk, the principal builder, for example, had every stone to lay in its place. David Cumming, a mason, had the charge of working the tackle of the balance-weight, and James Scott, also a mason, took charge of the purchase with which the stones were laid; while the pointing the joints of the walls with cement was intrusted to William Reid and William Kennedy, who stood upon a <b>scaffold</b> <b>suspended</b> over the walls in rather a frightful manner. The least act of carelessness or inattention on the part of any of these men might have been fatal, not only to themselves, but also to the surrounding workmen, especially if any accident had happened to the crane itself, while the material damage or loss of a single stone would have put an entire stop to the operations until another could have been brought from Arbroath. The artificers, having wrought seven and a half hours of extra time to-day, had 3s. 9d. of extra pay, while the foremen had 7s. 6d. over and above their stated pay and board. Although, therefore, the work was both hazardous and fatiguing, yet, the encouragement being considerable, they were always very cheerful, and perfectly reconciled to the confinement and other disadvantages of the place.|$|R
