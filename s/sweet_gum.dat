25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum</b> populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including <b>sweet</b> <b>gum.</b> They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E

50|$|It was 1863, and Chris Brabson {{lived in}} a dogtrot cabin on Walden’s Ridge in the rural {{mountains}} of Tennessee, where streams ran clear and sweet down the mountain. The blue sky stretched out forever overhead, and trees of all varieties grew on the mountains, including sourwoods, <b>sweet</b> <b>gums,</b> black gums, hickories and oaks.

25|$|The {{leaves are}} short-petioled {{and so have}} little {{individual}} motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the beech (Fagus). Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes maple, dogwood, sassafras, and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum,</b> as well as various species of tupelo.|$|E
25|$|American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), {{also known}} as American storax, hazel pine, bilsted, redgum, satin-walnut, star-leaved gum, alligatorwood, or simply sweetgum, is a {{deciduous}} tree in the genus Liquidambar native to warm temperate areas of eastern North America and tropical montane regions of Mexico and Central America. <b>Sweet</b> <b>gum</b> {{is one of the}} main valuable forest trees in the southeastern United States, and is a popular ornamental tree in temperate climates. It is recognizable by the combination of its five-pointed star-shaped leaves and its hard, spiked fruits. It is currently classified in the plant family Altingiaceae, but was formerly considered a member of the Hamamelidaceae.|$|E

The heart, when broken, is like <b>sweet</b> <b>gums</b> {{and spices}} when beaten; for as such cast their {{fragrant}} scent into the nostrils of men, so the heart when broken casts its sweet smells in the nostrils of God. The incense, {{which was a}} type of prayer of old, was to be beaten or bruised, and so to be burned in the censer. The heart must be beaten or bruised, and then the sweet scent will come out: even groans, and cries, and sighs, for the mercy of God; which cries, &c. to him, are a very excellent thing, and pleasing in his nostrils.|$|R

25|$|As climate warmed further around 3,000 B.C., beech, walnut, hickories, chestnut, and {{butternut}} grew. These trees produced nuts {{for feeding}} Archaic hunters; Archaic Indian populations grew more rapidly. As populations grew, large families became small tribes in various areas. During {{this time the}} 12 prominent hardwood tree species of Eastern North America existed in Warren County, which were Ash, Beech, Birch, Cherry, Chestnut, Elm, Hickory, Maple, Oak, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Gum,</b> Sycamore, and Walnut. The Chestnut tree is now extinct in Warren County, following the Chestnut blight that decimated the eastern U.S. in the earlier twentieth century. The Archaic period lasted from 8000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common name}} [...] "sweet gum" [...] {{refers to the}} species' [...] "sweetish gum", {{contrasting}} with the black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), only distantly related, with which the <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> overlaps broadly in range. [...] The species {{is also known as}} the [...] "red gum", for its reddish bark.|$|E

30|$|Titanium is a metal {{commonly}} used {{in the field of}} biomaterials and bio-applications (Niinomi 2002). Titanium characteristics such as high strength, low modulus of elasticity, low density, biocompatibility, complete inertness to body environment and high capacity to integrate with bone and other tissues make it widely used in implant applications (Niinomi 2002). Ti ions are absorbed by body through food like candies, <b>sweets</b> and chewing <b>gums</b> (Weir et al. 2012).|$|R
2500|$|In January 2004, Reflecting Absence, by {{architect}} Michael Arad {{and landscape}} architect Peter Walker, was selected from 5,201 entries from 63 countries {{as the winner}} of the LMDC's design competition. Two [...] pools with the largest man-made waterfalls in the United States comprise the footprints of the Twin Towers, symbolizing the loss of life and the physical void left by the attacks. The waterfalls are intended to mute the sounds of the city, making the site a contemplative sanctuary. Landscape architect Peter Walker planted many parts of the memorial with white oaks. Almost 400 <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> and swamp white oak trees fill the remaining [...] of the Memorial Plaza, enhancing the site's reflective nature.|$|E
2500|$|The city's {{flora and}} fauna are also {{distinct}} from coastal regions of the state, and include many deciduous species, such as dogwood, maple, hickory and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum,</b> alongside palms, live oaks, and other evergreens. Thus, the city enjoys brief periods of fall color in late November and December (though hardly comparable to areas further north) and a noticeable and prolonged spring from mid February through early April. This is a generally pleasant period, as colorful blooms of azalea and redbud complement a cloudless blue sky, for {{this is also the}} period of the lowest precipitation and lowest humidity. The city averages [...] of rain per year. June through September accounts for a majority of annual rainfall, while autumn and early winter is the driest period.|$|E
2500|$|While {{these trees}} are often known as simply [...] "tupelo", the fuller name black tupelo helps {{distinguish}} it from the other species of the tupelo genus (Nyssa), {{some of which have}} overlapping ranges, such as water tupelo (N. aquatica) and swamp tupelo (N. biflora). The name [...] "tupelo" [...] is used primarily in the American South; northward and in Appalachia, the tree is more commonly called the black gum or the sour gum, although no part of the plant is particularly gummy. Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> (Liquidambar styraciflua), which does produce an aromatic resin. [...] Another common name used occasionally in the Northeast is pepperidge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gummed</b> <b>sweets</b> such as jelly {{beans and}} wine gums are not {{manufactured}} using a mold {{in the conventional}} sense. A tray is filled with native starch and leveled. A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1,000 or so jelly beans. The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put onto a stove to set. This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured.|$|R

40|$|Flavor perception, the {{integration}} of taste and odor, is {{a critical factor in}} eating behavior. It remains unclear how such sensory signals influence the human brain systems that execute the eating behavior. WE TESTED CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW (CBF) IN THE FRONTAL LOBES BILATERALLY WHILE SUBJECTS CHEWED THREE TYPES OF GUM WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF TASTE AND ODOR: no taste/no odor <b>gum</b> (C-gum), <b>sweet</b> taste/no odor <b>gum</b> (T-gum), and <b>sweet</b> taste/lemon odor <b>gum</b> (TO-gum). Simultaneous recordings of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and near infrared spectrometer (NIRS) were used to measure CBF during gum chewing in 25 healthy volunteers. Bilateral masseter muscle activity was also monitored. We found that subjects could discriminate the type of gum without prior information. Subjects rated the TO-gum as the most flavorful gum and the C-gum as the least flavorful. Analysis of masseter muscle activity indicated that masticatory motor output during gum chewing was not affected by taste and odor. The TCD/NIRS measurements revealed significantly higher hemodynamic signals when subjects chewed the TO-gum compared to when they chewed the C-gum and T-gum. These data suggest that taste and odor can influence brain activation during chewing in sensory, cognitive, and motivational processes rather than in motor control...|$|R

60|$|Autumn in Virginia, {{especially}} {{if one is}} not too near the mountains, is a season in which greenness sails very close to Christmas, although generally veering away in time to prevent its verdant hues from tingeing that happy day with the gloomy influence of the prophetic proverb about churchyards. Long after {{the time when the}} people of the regions watered by the Hudson and the Merrimac are beginning to button up their overcoats, and to think of weather strips for their window-sashes, the dwellers in the land through which flow the Appomattox and the James may sit upon their broad piazzas, and watch the growing glories of the forests, where the crimson stars of the <b>sweet</b> <b>gum</b> blaze among the rich yellows of the chestnuts, the lingering green of the oaks, and the enduring verdure of the pines.

6000|$|On {{the other}} side of the road, {{undivided}} from it by hedge or fence, stretched, like a sea gently moved by a groundswell, a vast field, sometimes planted in tobacco, and sometimes in wheat. In the midst of this field stood a tall persimmon tree which yearly dropped its half-candied fruit upon the first light snow of the winter. It is true that persimmons, quite fit to eat, were to be found on this tree at an earlier period than this, but such fruit was never noticed by the people in those parts, who would not rudely wrench from Jack Frost his one little claim to rivalry with the sun as a fruit-ripener. To the right of the field was a wide extent of pasture land, running down to a small stream, or [...] "branch," [...] which, flowing between two other streams of the same kind a mile or two on either side of it, had given its name to the place. In front, to the left, lay a great forest of chestnut, oak, sassafras, and <b>sweet</b> <b>gum,</b> with here and there a clump of tall pines, standing up straight and stiff with an air of Puritanic condemnation of the changing fashions of the foliage about them.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Concentrated beverage emulsions containing 14 % canola oil, 20 % whey protein concentrate from acid or sweet whey protein concentrate, 10 % whey protein concentrate from acid or sweet whey protein concentrate with 10 % gum arabic, and 20 % gum arabic were prepared. The emulsions were homogenized and stored at 5 ?C for analysis of creaming index, homogenization index, particle size index, particle size distribution, and viscosity. Creaming index was affected by type of emulsifier and homogenization pressure. The CI values of acid whey, <b>sweet</b> whey, or <b>gum</b> arabic emulsions increased when the homogenization pressure was increased from 20 to 60 MPa. However, the CI of the emulsion prepared using <b>sweet</b> whey and <b>gum</b> arabic decreased during storage. There was no significant effect by emulsifier, homogenization pressure, and days of storage on emulsion stability determined by HI. The particle size distribution of the sweet whey emulsion homogenized at 20 and 60 MPa, the acid whey emulsion homogenized at 60 MPa, and the acid whey and gum arabic emulsion homogenized at 20 MPa changed during storage time. These emulsions appeared to have experienced creaming during storage. The size of particles in the emulsions prepared using sweet or acid whey and gum arabic were larger than particles in emulsions prepared using other emulsifiers. There was an increase in the percentage of small particles in these emulsions during storage. Material from loosely associated surface aggregates was probably migrating to the continuous phase of the emulsion. The particle size index of emulsions made from acid whey changed during storage and the change might have been related to the concentration of minerals in emulsions. The viscosity of emulsions prepared using acid whey, acid whey and gum arabic, and gum arabic did not change. Physical characteristics of the particles in these emulsions did not change during storage. The viscosity of acid whey, acid whey and <b>gum</b> arabic, and <b>sweet</b> whey and <b>gum</b> arabic increased when the homogenization pressure was increased from 20 to 60 MPa. The higher viscosity at 60 MPa was probably caused by {{an increase in the number}} of particles and the interfacial surface viscosity of particles of emulsions...|$|R

One hundred and twenty eight students (10 - 19 years) selected from three senior secondary schools in Ekiti State Nigeria, formed the participants for this study. Questionnaire was the instrument for data collection and the data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics (bivariate Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression) using Spss version 12 at 0. 05 level of significance. Findings of this study showed that of all the adolescents, only 16. 4 %, 14. 1 %, 7. 0 %, 16. 4 % and 10. 2 % followed a healthy dietary pattern of regular intake of breakfast, three square meals, milk, fruits and vegetables respectively. 50 %, 38. 3 % and 45. 3 % followed an unhealthy dietary pattern of regular intake of <b>sweets,</b> chewing <b>gum</b> and soft drinks. With regards to body mass index and academic performance, less than 40 % of the respondents were of normal weight and only half of the respondents had good academic performance.
