25|$|Popper has {{developed}} some equipment innovations to accommodate {{his use of}} harmonicas during onstage performances. Because each individual diatonic harmonica is tuned to one particular key, he fashioned belts with enough pockets to hold harmonicas in all 12 keys (plus extras) and wore them as a bandolier, or <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> neck. He frequently has to switch keys multiple times within one song, and this arrangement allowed him to quickly trade one harmonica for another without looking. In 2002, he stopped using the belts because they no longer fit him properly due to his weight loss; now he carries his harmonicas in a small black attaché case. He uses a special microphone with switches that change the audio effect of the harmonica as it is played through an amplifier, similar to a guitar effects pedal. Popper was inspired by Jimi Hendrix's guitar playing to make his instrument sound however he wanted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E

60|$|Next {{morning he}} got up before the sun rose, put the holy water into a strong flask, and two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket, <b>slung</b> them <b>over</b> <b>his</b> back, took his alpine staff in his hand, and set off for the mountains.|$|R
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder as he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on {{the two sides of the}} same item, as if they were the beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E
2500|$|With all his {{belongings}} {{wrapped in a}} handkerchief and <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder Flatman hiked from his home to Newmarket - a scruffy 15-year-old, 4 stone (25kg) stripling looking for work. [...] When {{he arrived at the}} yard of trainer, William Cooper, [...] "one of the most upright trainers and best men that ever lived", he was initially dismissed on account of his dishevelled appearance. [...] Cooper's wife took kindly to him, though, and pleaded Flatman's cause to her husband. [...] As a result, Flatman was taken on as apprentice to the Cooper stable in 1825.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{element is}} the [...] "Voices of Veterans" [...] area, which forms the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} site. This exhibit consists of three staggered glass walls consisting {{of a total of}} 49 panels. Each panel is [...] high, [...] wide, and [...] thick; weighs and consists of five [...] sheets of Starphire glass laminated together. On the interior sheets of glass are inscribed photo-realistic images of veterans and quotations from veterans describing their devotion to duty, {{what it was like to}} be wounded, and how they came to terms with their disability. Four bronze panels, with silhouettes of soldiers cut from their center, stand behind some of the glass panels. The four bronze panels feature a saluting soldier in full dress uniform, a soldier rescuing a wounded comrade (who is <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders), a running soldier bowed beneath a full pack, and a soldier with an amputated leg using crutches to hold himself upright.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} won my bet, René, if you had taken it," [...] Cuthbert exclaimed, as he <b>slung</b> <b>his</b> cartridge-box <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. [...] "They are on us all along the line." ...|$|R
60|$|Hugh {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} scornfully, and in his reckless swaggering way, crossed {{to the other side}} of the little green, and there, with the bridle <b>slung</b> loosely <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, led the horse to and fro, glancing at his master every now and then from under his bushy eyebrows, with as sinister an aspect as one would desire to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never fear," [...] Bill said huskily, [...] "oi will wroite, Polly; goodby, and God {{bless you}} all; but it mayn't be goodby, for oi mayn't foind him;" [...] and, {{wringing}} {{the hands of}} Luke and Polly, Bill returned to his cottage, hastily packed up a few things in a kit, <b>slung</b> it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder on a stick, and started out in search of Ned.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{the brother}} {{was filled with}} envy at {{the words of the}} man, and he set out at once, and before dawn he had reached the hut, and saw the pot and the mortar were {{standing}} outside.

At length she said to herself, ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Tessa's {{heart beat}} {{fast as she}} trudged away with Tommo, who <b>slung</b> <b>his</b> harp <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, and gave her his hand. It was rather a dirty hand, but so kind that Tessa clung to it, and kept {{looking up at the}} {{friendly}} brown face for encouragement.|$|R
60|$|Having thus {{arranged}} {{his domestic}} affairs to please himself, though little to Shorty's satisfaction, I thought, he <b>slung</b> <b>his</b> powder-horn <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, and we started. Tonoi was, at once, sent on in advance; {{and leaving the}} plantation, he struck into a path which led toward the mountains.|$|R
60|$|But {{once more}} Jerry outwitted them. Calling to Blumpo to steady the {{temporary}} mast, he {{climbed to the}} top, his gun <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Quick as a flash De Catinat {{had caught}} up the axe, and faced De Montespan {{with the heavy}} weapon <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} and a challenge in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|A loop of a lasso, <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{head and}} jerked tight, choked off his intelligible utterance. But as the silent, {{ruthless}} men dragged him away he gave vent to terrible, half-strangled cries.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour the steak had been done to a turn, and they sat down to eat it. It was {{certainly}} a most informal meal, without plates or platter, and only Dick's pocket knife to cut the steak with. Yet neither had ever enjoyed a repast more. Having finished, they procured a drink at a flowing stream behind them, and then Dick cut off a chunk of the bear meat, wrapped it in a bit of skin and <b>slung</b> it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are coming, aren't you?" [...] she said, {{looking over}} her {{shoulder}} into his eyes. And taking consent from his unchanging eyes, she let go his hand and slightly opened the door. He turned slowly, and taking his coat from a nail, <b>slung</b> it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and drew it on. Then he picked up his hat, and put his foot on his half-smoked cigarette, which lay smoking still. He followed her out of the room, walking with his head rather forward, in the half loutish, sensual-subjected way of the Italians.|$|R
50|$|Hercules found Hades {{and asked}} {{permission}} to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Hercules could subdue the beast without using weapons. Hercules overpowered Cerberus {{with his hands}} and <b>slung</b> the beast <b>over</b> <b>his</b> back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the Peloponnese and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his pithos. Eurystheus begged Hercules to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are French, are you not?" [...] I asked, {{as we all}} {{walked up}} the hill together, he with his black bag {{in his hand and}} his long blue cloak <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Radbury {{had gone}} for the deer with his gun <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> back, so he could easily fire a return signal if he wished. Eagerly the {{brothers}} listened, but the exasperating silence continued.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was not so}} {{difficult}} after all, you see,' he said, turning to Geirald. And placing the giant's head in a leathern wallet which was <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> back, they began their journey to the castle.|$|E
6000|$|So he ran quickly, {{and with}} his little sword cut down two violets, and of the petals he made two little soft bundles, and, tying them {{together}} with his garters, he <b>slung</b> them <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Full of his terrible purpose, he then ran to the Princess, and, going behind her, clambered up her dress until he stood on her shoulder, and, getting {{on the top of}} her head, he loosened a long hair, and lowered himself down with it, until he stood upon the under lashes of her left eye. Now, his intention was evident. Those violet bundles were to [...] "end this thing." [...] They were to be crammed into the source of those fatal tears, to the beauty of which poor Ling-a-ting had fallen a victim.|$|R
60|$|So sword Silence {{was handed}} to him, and he <b>slung</b> it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Foy {{looked at the}} {{kneeling}} Elsa, {{and he looked at}} his sword. Then an idea struck him, and he looked at the face of Adrian, his brother, whom he had last seen when the said Adrian ran to warn him and Martin at the factory, for though {{he knew that he was}} fighting with his father among the Spaniards, during the siege they had never met. Even then, in that dire extremity, with a sudden flash of thought he wondered how it happened that Adrian, being the villain that he was, had taken the trouble to come and warn them yonder in Leyden, thereby giving them time to make a very good defence in the shot tower.|$|R
60|$|An {{hour later}} the split was cleaned out {{so far as}} it could be {{accomplished}} with the tools at hand. There remained a small crack still, running downward three feet, as Earl ascertained by testing it with a berry-bush switch. What there might be {{at the bottom of the}} crack there was no telling, although it must contain some gold, if only in dust. Three additional nuggets had been unearthed, one as large as a pint measure and finer in appearance than any of the rest. Making sure they were not observed, the first nuggets were again brought forth, and each took a portion of them to carry home. The largest was tied up in Earl's coat, which he <b>slung</b> carelessly <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder as he trudged along.|$|R
60|$|They {{were soon}} on their way, Todd {{carrying}} the mail {{in a bag}} <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> horse's neck. Man and boy were {{in the best of}} spirits, and both made rapid time over the dusty roads.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To sit aloft with a brigandish driver {{dressed in}} a scarlet and black uniform, with a curly horn <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, and to go tearing up hill and down with four frisky horses, is irresistible,' and up skipped Matilda.|$|E
60|$|The {{weapon was}} <b>slung</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{back where it}} would not impede his movements; and with a single glance {{backward}} he set out with a long, swinging stride such as he knew by experience he could maintain for many hours.|$|E
60|$|Another half-hour passed. The Captain {{was still}} upon the bridge. It {{seemed as if}} he would never come down. My nerves were in a state of unnatural tension, {{so much so that the}} sound of two steps upon the deck made me start up in a quiver of excitement. I peered over the edge of the boat, and saw that our {{suspicious}} passengers had crossed from the other side, and were standing almost directly beneath me. The light of a binnacle fell full upon the ghastly face of the ruffian Flannigan. Even in that short glance I saw that Muller had the ulster, whose use I knew so well, <b>slung</b> loosely <b>over</b> <b>his</b> arm. I sank back with a groan. It seemed that my fatal procrastination had sacrificed two hundred innocent lives.|$|R
5000|$|After {{loading the}} three {{firearms}} and stuffing his pockets with ammunition, including a [...] "suicide" [...] 7.62mm round which he {{placed in the}} front right hand pocket of his jeans, he placed a black combat knife {{down the back of}} his jeans. He then <b>slung</b> the M14 <b>over</b> <b>his</b> back and picked up the Mossberg and the Ruger in his right and left hands respectively. Immediately afterwards, at around 9.29pm, he opened {{the front door of the}} house and ran out into Ramsden Street.|$|R
60|$|The {{soldiers}} were, one day, hard on Cluny's tracks, {{and they}} seized a clansman, whom they compelled {{to act as}} guide. He pretended an innocence bordering on idiotcy, and affected to be specially pleased with the drum, a thing of which he could not even conceive the use. To humour him, they <b>slung</b> the drum <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders. Presently he thumped it violently. Cluny heard the warning and escaped, while the innocence of the crafty gillie was so well feigned, {{that he was not}} even punished.|$|R
