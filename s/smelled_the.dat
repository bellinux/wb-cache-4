Shortly afterwards, {{he took a}} job working at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he worked in the cardiac care unit. Within the next three years, Cullen killed at least five patients and is known to have attempted to murder two more. On January 11, 2000, Cullen attempted suicide again. He put a charcoal grill in his bath tub, lit it, and hoped to succumb to carbon monoxide poisoning. Cullen's neighbors <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> smoke and called the fire department and police. Cullen was taken to a hospital and a psychiatric facility but returned home the following day.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is through}} the aromas of wine that wine is <b>smelled.</b> <b>The</b> human tongue {{is limited to the}} primary tastes {{perceived}} by taste receptors on the tongue-sourness, bitterness, saltiness, sweetness and savoriness. The wide array of fruit, earthy, floral, herbal, mineral and woodsy flavor present in wine are derived from aroma notes sensed by the olfactory bulb. In wine tasting, wine is sometimes smelled before being drunk in order to identify some components of the wine that may be present. Different terms are used to describe what is being <b>smelled.</b> <b>The</b> most basic term is aroma which generally refers to a [...] "pleasant" [...] smell as opposed to odor which refers to an unpleasant smell or possible wine fault. The term aroma may be further distinguished from bouquet which generally refers to the smells that arise from the chemical reactions of fermentation and aging of the wine.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Noah {{to come out}} of the Ark with his family and to free the animals. Then Noah built an altar to God and offered burnt offerings of every clean animal and of every clean bird. God <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> {{pleasing}} odor and vowed never again to doom the earth because of man, as man's imaginings are evil from his youth, but God would preserve the seasons so long as the earth endured. God blessed Noah and his sons to be fertile and increase, and put the fear of them into all the beasts, which God gave into their hands to eat. God prohibited eating flesh with its life-blood in it. God would require a reckoning of every man's and beast's life-blood, and whoever shed the blood of man would have his blood shed by man, for in God's image did God make man. God told them to be fertile and increase. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here.|$|E
2500|$|Disguised as Esau, Jacob entered Isaac's room. Surprised that Esau {{was back}} so soon, Isaac asked {{how it could}} be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, [...] "Because the LORD your God brought it to me." [...] Rashi, on [...] says Isaac's suspicions were aroused even more, because Esau never used the {{personal}} name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him directly, [...] "Art thou my very son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am." [...] Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him. [...] As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28–29 states Isaac's blessing: [...] "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: [...] Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{gas chamber}} {{was set up}} at the butcher shop of the prison. At least one cat {{was used to test}} the lethal effectiveness of the chamber. Gee was to be strapped onto a chair in the chamber, which was eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high. A small window next to the wooden chair allowed witnesses to look inside. Attendees included news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the U.S. Army. Gee wept as he was placed on the chair until the captain of the guards told him to [...] "Brace up!" [...] At 9:40a.m. on February 8, 1924, the pump sprayed four pounds of hydrocyanic acid into the chamber. The weather was cold and humid. Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was 52 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 75 degrees, causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing to nod up and down for six minutes. He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas. The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber. Gee's body was removed from the chamber at 12:20p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead, but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released. Gee was 29 years old when he died.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Buechner's time in Bermuda has, however, {{manifested}} {{in other respects}} in his writing and in his life. [...] While he often refers to {{the natural beauty of}} Bermuda's island landscape—the [...] "unutterable, blinding blue-green flash of the ocean" [...] and its [...] "unkempt greenness"—and its idyllic island charms—the [...] "narrow-gauge Toonerville Trolley of a railway with wicker armchairs for seats" [...] and the pastel houses [...] "with their blinding white roofs stepped to catch the rain"—the distinctly British flavor of pre-World War II Bermuda also instilled in him an enduring love of English custom and culture. [...] Amidst the sounds and textures Buechner recalls from his days in Bermuda, he writes of [...] "the sound and feel of English money—the heavy coppers and florins and half crowns that weighed down your pockets, the thin little sixpences and threepenny bits, the pound notes with the King's picture on them." [...] Traces of the United Kingdom were all around him: [...] "I remember the public library with a park behind it where a British regiment called the Sherwood Foresters gave band concerts underneath a huge India rubber tree, and a bookstore that <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> way a new book printed in England does when you first open it." [...] That smell, [...] "faintly like nutmeg, dry, erudite," [...] stayed with Buechner the rest of his life. Details from the island's celebration of the coronation of George the Sixth—for which Buechner and his classmates [...] "helped drag brushwood {{to the top of a}} hill for a bonfire" [...] and went around [...] "lighting bonfires on all the hills in Bermuda"—appear throughout his memoirs. [...] Thus, in The Eyes of the Heart, Buechner recalls the [...] "royal governor who on state occasions such as the coronation of George VI wore a cocked hat with white plumes on it like the captain of the Pinafore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon son of Rabbi Ishmael {{interpreted}} the term [...] "the Tabernacle of the testimony" [...] in [...] {{to mean that}} the Tabernacle was God's testimony {{to the whole world}} that God had forgiven Israel for having made the Golden Calf. Rabbi Isaac explained with a parable. A king took a wife whom he dearly loved. He became angry with her and left her, and her neighbors taunted her, saying that he would not return. Then the king sent her a message asking her to prepare the king's palace and make the beds therein, for he was coming back to her on such-and-such a day. On that day, the king returned to her and became reconciled to her, entering her chamber and eating and drinking with her. Her neighbors at first did not believe it, but when they <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> fragrant spices, they knew that the king had returned. Similarly, God loved Israel, bringing the Israelites to Mount Sinai, and giving them the Torah, but after only 40 days, they sinned with the Golden Calf. The heathen nations then said that God would not be reconciled with the Israelites. But when Moses pleaded for mercy on their behalf, God forgave them, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord said: ‘I have pardoned according to your word.'" [...] Moses then told God that even though he personally was quite satisfied that God had forgiven Israel, he asked that God might announce that fact to the nations. God replied that God would cause God's Shechinah to dwell in their midst, and thus [...] says, [...] "And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." [...] And by that sign, God intended that all nations might know that God had forgiven the Israelites. And thus [...] calls it [...] "the Tabernacle of the testimony," [...] because the Tabernacle was a testimony that God had pardoned the Israelites' sins.|$|E
