5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender <b>skewing</b> comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E

Tom Skerritt, the captain, was 46, Hurt was 39 but looked older, Holm was 48, Harry Dean Stanton was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 30 and Weaver at 29 were in the age range of the usual thriller cast. Many recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key roles or sidekicks, but by <b>skewing</b> older, Alien achieves a certain texture without even making a point of it: These are not adventurers but workers, hired by a company to return 20million tons of ore to Earth.|$|E
5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum {{than the rest of}} its formation, <b>skewing</b> the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E

25|$|The {{differentiation}} of phenotype in heterozygous females is furthered {{by the presence}} of X-inactivation <b>skewing.</b> Typically, each X-chromosome is silenced in half of the cells, but this process is skewed when preferential inactivation of a chromosome occurs. It is thought that <b>skewing</b> happens either by chance or by a physical characteristic of a chromosome that may cause it to be silenced more or less often, such as an unfavorable mutation.|$|E
25|$|Spectral <b>skewing</b> is {{the change}} in {{relative}} intensity of mass spectral peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the mass spectrum is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source. Spectral <b>skewing</b> is not observed in ion trap (quadrupole (this has been seen also in QMS) or magnetic) or time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers because potentially all ions formed in operational cycle (a snapshot in time) of the instrument are available for detection.|$|E

5000|$|Jeu-de-taquin slides change {{not only}} the {{relative}} order of the entries of a tableau, but also its shape. In the definition given above, {{the result of a}} jeu-de-taquin slide is given as a <b>skew</b> diagram along with a <b>skew</b> standard tableau having it as shape. Often, it is better to work with <b>skew</b> shapes rather than <b>skew</b> diagrams. (Recall that every <b>skew</b> shape [...] gives rise to a <b>skew</b> diagram , but this is not an injective correspondence because, e. g., the distinct <b>skew</b> shapes [...] and [...] yield the same <b>skew</b> diagram.) For this reason, it is useful to modify the above definition of a jeu-de-taquin slide in such a way that, when given a <b>skew</b> shape along with a <b>skew</b> standard tableau and an addable cell as an input, it yields a well-defined <b>skew</b> shape along with a <b>skew</b> standard tableau at its output. This is done as follows: An inward slide of a <b>skew</b> tableau T of <b>skew</b> shape [...] into a cell c is defined as above when c is a corner of [...] (that is, when [...] is a Young diagram), and the resulting <b>skew</b> shape is set to be [...] where d is the empty cell {{at the end of the}} sliding procedure. An outward slide of a <b>skew</b> tableau T of <b>skew</b> shape [...] into a cell c is defined as above when c is a cocorner of [...] (that is, when [...] is a Young diagram), and the resulting <b>skew</b> shape is set to be [...] where d is the empty cell at the end of the sliding procedure.|$|R
25|$|It’s {{thought that}} X-inactivation <b>skewing</b> could {{be caused by}} issues in the {{mechanism}} that causes inactivation, or by issues in the chromosome itself. However, the link between phenotype and <b>skewing</b> is still being questioned, and should be examined on a case-by-case basis. A study looking at both symptomatic and asymptomatic females who were heterozygous for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD) found no apparent link between transcript expression and skewed X-Inactivation. The study suggests that both mechanisms are independently regulated, {{and there are other}} unknown factors at play.|$|E

40|$|Clock <b>skew</b> {{is often}} cited as an {{impediment}} to designing high-performance synchronous circuits. Clock <b>skew</b> reduces {{the performance of a}} circuit by reducing the time available for computation, and it may even cause circuit failure by allowing race conditions. In this paper, we show how to use retiming to reduce the effect of clock <b>skew</b> in both edge-clocked and level-clocked circuits. We include both fixed clock <b>skew,</b> for example <b>skew</b> which results from clock distribution wiring and buffering, and variable clock <b>skew</b> which results from uncontrolled variation in process parameter and operating conditions. By including fixed <b>skew</b> in the maximum constraint equations retiming can find the fastest circuit given that <b>skew.</b> By including variable <b>skew,</b> retiming can also generate the circuit that tolerates the most variation in clock <b>skew</b> for a given clock frequency. Clock <b>skew</b> {{can also be used to}} speed up circuits using a technique similar to retiming described by Fishburn [2]. We describe a me [...] ...|$|R

Furthermore, the invertibility of the <b>skew</b> left circulant matrices is also discussed. We obtain the determinants and the inverse matrices of the <b>skew</b> left circulant matrices by utilizing the relationship between <b>skew</b> left circulant matrices and <b>skew</b> circulant matrix, respectively.

They may suffer partial or complete erosion in the digestive tract, <b>skewing</b> measurements of prey number and biomass. Species with fragile, easily digested otoliths may be underestimated in the diet. To address these biases, otolith correction factors have been developed through captive feeding experiments, in which seals are fed fish of known size, {{and the degree of}} otolith erosion is quantified for different prey taxa.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the causes, however, psychoticism {{marks the}} two {{approaches}} apart, as the five factor model contains no such trait. Moreover, psychoticism, unlike {{any of the other}} factors in either approach, does not fit a normal distribution curve. Indeed, scores are rarely high, thus <b>skewing</b> a normal distribution. However, when they are high, there is considerable overlap with psychiatric conditions such as antisocial and schizoid personality disorders. Similarly, high scorers on neuroticism are more susceptible to sleep and psychosomatic disorders. Five factor approaches can also predict future mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|These earlier methods had flaws {{that were}} easily exploitable. The average run-rate method took no {{account of how}} many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply {{reflected}} how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. So if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, <b>skewing</b> the comparison with the first team. The most productive overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalized the team batting second for good bowling, by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.|$|E
40|$|The {{benchmark}} test case for non-orthogonal grid mesh, the "driven <b>skewed</b> cavity flow", first introduced by Demirdzic et al.

The benchmark problem has non-orthogonal, <b>skewed</b> grid mesh with <b>skew</b> angle (alpha). The governing 2 -D steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in general curvilinear coordinates are solved for the solution of driven <b>skewed</b> cavity flow with non-orthogonal grid mesh using a numerical method which is efficient and stable even at extreme <b>skew</b> angles. Highly accurate numerical solutions of the driven <b>skewed</b> cavity flow, solved using a fine grid (512 x 512) mesh, are presented for Reynolds number of 100 and 1000 for <b>skew</b> angles ranging between 15 <alpha< 165...|$|R

The study concludes that public-funded schools in Shanghai have the highest educational quality in the world. Critics of PISA results counter that, in Shanghai and other Chinese cities, most children of migrant workers can only attend city schools up to the ninth grade, and must return to their parents' hometowns for high school due to hukou restrictions, thus <b>skewing</b> {{the composition of the}} city's high school students in favor of wealthier local families.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines {{the production of}} the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby <b>skewing</b> prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).|$|E
25|$|In 1969, the FIM — citing high {{development}} costs for non-works teams — brought in new rules restricting all classes to six gears and most to two cylinders (four cylinders {{in the case}} of the 350cc and 500cc classes). This led to a mass walk-out of the sport by the previously highly successful Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha manufacturer teams, <b>skewing</b> the results tables for the next several years, with MV Agusta effectively the only works team left in the sport until Yamaha (1973) and Suzuki (1974) returned with new two-stroke designs. By this time, two-strokes completely eclipsed the four-strokes in all classes. In 1979, Honda, on its return to GP racing, made an attempt to return the four-stroke to the top class with the NR500, but this project failed, and, in 1983, even Honda was winning with a two-stroke 500.|$|E
