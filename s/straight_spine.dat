2500|$|The Catholic Encyclopedia said: [...] "Authorities are {{agreed that}} {{a sort of}} helmet of thorns must have been plaited by the Roman soldiers, this band of rushes being {{employed}} to hold the thorns together. It seems likely according to M. De Mély, that already {{at the time when}} the circlet was brought to Paris the sixty or seventy thorns, which seem to have been afterwards distributed by St. Louis and his successors, had been separated from the band of rushes and were kept in a different reliquary. None of these now remain at Paris. Some small fragments of rush are also preserved ... at Arras and at Lyons. With regard to the origin and character of the thorns, both tradition and existing remains suggest that they must have come from the bush botanically known as Ziziphus spina-christi, more popularly, the jujube tree. This reaches the height of fifteen or twenty feet and is found growing in abundance by the wayside around Jerusalem.

Information is given at three spinal levels (T 8, T 12 and L 3) for 636 schoolchildren aged 8 to 15 years. Rib-hump and lumbar-hump scores were standardised to create trunk asymmetry scores (TASs) making comparison possible between children of different age, size and sex. Two groups of children were defined: those with clinically <b>straight</b> <b>spines</b> (585 children); and those with clinical evidence of lateral spinal curves (51 children). In the children with clinically <b>straight</b> <b>spines</b> the main findings were: about 1 : 4 had objectively detectable rib and lumbar humps; female-to-male ratios were 1. 2 : 1 for the thoracic region and 1. 4 : 1 for the lumbar region; right humps were about 10 times more common than left; TASs in {{the boys and girls}} at each spinal level had normal distributions about means to the right of zero (where zero represents perfect symmetry); at T 8 and T 12, a wider scatter of TASs in girls than in boys; at L 3, larger TASs in girls than in boys; a relation between shortening of one lower limb and a contralateral hump on the back; and no relation to age (except at L 3), stature (corrected for age) or handedness. The findings are discussed in relation to possible causes of back contour asymmetry, early diagnosis of scoliosis by screening, sexual dimorphism and significance for the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis.

40|$|Spines {{in plants}} {{have evolved to}} reduce {{mammalian}} herbivory, and their main function may be to protect twigs more than photosynthetic tissue. Type and frequency of spines vary in different scales. We hypothesised that different types of spines affect animal foraging through different mechanisms. We studied feeding behaviour by twig browsing goats in relation to two types of spines of Acacia tortilis using experimental manipulation of the occurrence of spines. Feeding time, number of biting actions, number and diameter of bites on trees (post-trial) and total intake were recorded. The removal of either long <b>straight</b> <b>spines</b> or short hooked spines resulted in no feeding responses by goats. The removal of both types of spines tended to increase feeding time resulting in more and larger bites with larger bite diameters and in increased total intake and utilisation compared to control branches. The removal of spines gave no effects on feeding rate, expressed as biting actions/minute, number of twigs bitten/minute or intake rate (g/minute). Both types of spines reduced total intake and utilisation of browse, but the functional mechanisms were different with the long <b>straight</b> <b>spines</b> mainly influencing bite size and short hooked spines mainly affecting number of bites...|$|R

50|$|This brace is {{designed}} for use with the Schroth physical therapy method. It utilizes large, sweeping pads to push the body against its curve and into blown out spaces. The Schroth theory holds that the deformity can be corrected through retraining muscles and nerves to learn what a <b>straight</b> <b>spine</b> feels like, and breathing deeply into areas crushed by the curvature to help gain flexibility and to expand. The brace helps patients to keep doing their exercises throughout the day. This brace is asymmetrical, and is used for patients of all degrees of severity and maturity. It is often worn 20-23 hours a day. The brace principally contracts to allow for lateral and longditutal rotation and movement.|$|E

50|$|While the {{anterior}} deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward {{phase of a}} push-up, the triceps brachii muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle {{is divided into three}} heads — the lateral head, long head and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach {{to the back of the}} humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.There is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand is placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond.

50|$|The oldest {{structure}} in the conservation area is the remains of Peterston Castle situated beside Castle Bungalow. The castle was built by the Norman lords of the manor, Le Sor family probably in the mid 13th century. It replaced an earlier structure destroyed by the Welsh and in turn was sacked and destroyed by Owain Glyndwr in 1403. Despite being a scheduled monument, the castle remains have been progressively destroyed by housing development.The earliest feature of St. Peter’s Church is the 14th century chancel arch but the church is more notable for its Perpendicular style tower. The west tower with its corbelled battlements and gargoyles is 15th century. The chancel was mostly rebuilt in 1890-91 by Kempson & Fowler. From the medieval period until the 19th century, the settlement was a small rural community {{with the majority of}} its inhabitants deriving an income from agriculture. Major change arrived with the construction of the railway (opened 1850) and the opening of a railway station west of the village {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. A comparison of the pre-railway Tithe Map of c. 1840 with the First Edition Ordnance Survey of c.1880 shows that the railway required a slight re-alignment of the through road giving rise to the unusual alignment of properties south of the railway bridge.During the immediate post-railway period a school was built south of the church, The Old Rectory was built in 1857 and the chancel of St. Peter’s Church was largely reconstructed. It has been suggested that the higher roots of the older yews in the churchyard indicate that the churchyard was cleared in the 19th century. In the early 20th century John and Reginald Cory, coal magnates, began a Garden Village to the south of, and quite separate from, the historic village, now known as Wyndham Park. Main Avenue was, and remains, a wide and <b>straight</b> <b>spine</b> road uphill from a bridge over the river. The road originally crossed the river on the site of today’s footbridge but is now re-directed westwards along Wyndham Park Way. The church’s lych gate is dedicated to those who fell in the Great War. The cost of the playing fields was deferred by grateful parishioners following the 1939-1945 War.Further housing development took place in the late 20th century adding to the settlement’s population and thereby helping the village to continue to support a village shop and school.|$|E

40|$|NASA {{spacecraft}} {{design requirements}} for occupant protection are {{a combination of}} the Brinkley criteria and injury metrics extracted from anthropomorphic test devices (ATD's). For the ATD injury metrics, the requirements specify the use of the 5 th percentile female Hybrid III and the 95 th percentile male Hybrid III. Furthermore, each of these ATD's is required to be fitted with an articulating pelvis and a <b>straight</b> <b>spine.</b> The articulating pelvis is necessary for the ATD to fit into spacecraft seats, while the <b>straight</b> <b>spine</b> is required as injury metrics for vertical accelerations are better defined for this configuration. The requirements require that physical testing be performed with both ATD's to demonstrate compliance. Before compliance testing can be conducted, extensive modeling and simulation are required to determine appropriate test conditions, simulate conditions not feasible for testing, and assess design features to better ensure compliance testing is successful. While finite element (FE) models are currently available for many of the physical ATD's, currently there are no complete models for either the 5 th percentile female or the 95 th percentile male Hybrid III with a <b>straight</b> <b>spine</b> and articulating pelvis. The purpose of this work is to assess the accuracy of the existing Livermore Software Technology Corporation's FE models of the 5 th and 95 th percentile ATD's. To perform this assessment, a series of tests will be performed at Wright Patterson Air Force Research Lab using their horizontal impact accelerator sled test facility. The ATD's will be placed in the Orion seat with a modified-advanced-crew-escape-system (MACES) pressure suit and helmet, and driven with loadings similar to what is expected for the actual Orion vehicle during landing, launch abort, and chute deployment. Test data will be compared to analytical predictions and modelling uncertainty factors will be determined for each injury metric. Additionally, the test data will be used to further improve the FE model, particularly in the areas of the ATD neck components, harness, and suit and helmet effects...|$|E
