50|$|Irrigation is {{the process}} of artificially {{applying}} water to soil to allow plant growth. This term is preferably used when large amounts of water is applied to dry, arid regions in order to facilitate plant growth. The process of irrigation not only increases the growth rate of the plant bust also increments the yield amount. In temperate and tropical areas rainfall and snowfall are the main suppliers of irrigation water, but in dry places with unfavourable weather conditions, groundwater serves as an essential source. Groundwater collects in basins made up of gravel and aquifers which are water-holding rocks.Dams also act as an essential distributive source of irrigation water. Underground wells also {{play an important role in}} storing water for irrigation, specifically in America and Arizona. Water and debris from streams filled by water accumulated during storms, also collects into underground basins. There are two types of irrigation techniques: <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> and drip irrigation. Drip irrigation is regarded more efficient as less water evaporated as in <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation.</b>|$|E

The City facilities used for effluent <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> include the Southwest Sprayfield, located at the TPS facility, and the Southeast Farm Reuse Facility, located eight {{miles east of the}} TPS facility on Tram Road. The City of Tallahasseeâ€™s reclaimed water system comprises both a Public Access Reuse system and a Restricted Access Reuse system. The Public Access Reuse system is served from the Tram Road Reuse Facility and has the capacity to provide 1.2 million gallons per day, serving commercial customers in the Southwood area since 2008. There are two areas in which Restricted Access Reuse water is utilized: the Southwest Sprayfield and the Southeast Farm facility. The Southwest Sprayfield came online in 1966 and currently covers approximately 60 acres. The Southeast Farm has been in operation since 1980 and now has just over 2,500 acres permitted for irrigation use. The main crops grown at the Southeast Farm are corn, soybeans, coastal Bermuda grass as well as other feed and fodder crops. Between these reuse systems the City of Tallahassee has been reusing 100% of the treated water since 1984. Currently these systems are reusing about 18 million gallons a day of reclaimed water.|$|E

Examples involving evaporation of sprays include fuel droplets combustion devices, fire control using water <b>sprays,</b> <b>irrigation</b> of crops, etc. In materials processing beds of particles (i. e., sand, recycled aluminum, etc.) are melted in furnaces to produce engineered materials. When the heat sources are at high temperature, radiation transfer has to be accounted for in analysis. In this research, phase change of a single particle is considered first to develop understanding of the fundamental heat transfer/phase change processes before tackling melting of a particle bed heating by convection and radiation from above. ^ Evaporation of a droplet (fuel and water) heated by convection and external radiation field is analyzed as examples of application in fuel spray combustion and fire control. The droplets are assumed to be spherical and semitransparent to radiation. Published spectral absorption coefficient data are used in the calculations, and model predictions are compared with available experimental and theoretical results on water, n-heptane and n-decane evaporation. ^ Melting of spherical opaque and semitransparent particles is analyzed, and a thermal model is developed. As an example, fused silica is considered as the material and spectral absorption coefficient data from the literature are used to predict the local spectral irradiance and the local volumetric rate of absorption and emission of radiation as a function of particle diameter and the external radiation source temperature. A model has been developed, extensive numerical results have been generated, but experimental data needed for model validation could not been identified in the literature for validation purposes. ...|$|R
