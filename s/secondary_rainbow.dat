5000|$|Unlike {{a double}} rainbow that {{consists}} of two separate and concentric rainbow arcs, the very rare twinned rainbow appears as two rainbow arcs that split from a single base. The colours in the second bow, rather than reversing as in a <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow,</b> appear {{in the same order}} as the primary rainbow. A [...] "normal" [...] <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow</b> may be present as well. Twinned rainbows can look similar to, but {{should not be confused with}} supernumerary bands. The two phenomena may be told apart by their difference in colour profile: supernumerary bands consist of subdued pastel hues (mainly pink, purple and green), while the twinned rainbow shows the same spectrum as a regular rainbow.The cause of a twinned rainbow is the combination of different sizes of water drops falling from the sky. Due to air resistance, raindrops flatten as they fall, and flattening is more prominent in larger water drops. When two rain showers with different-sized raindrops combine, they each produce slightly different rainbows which may combine and form a twinned rainbow.A numerical ray tracing study showed that a twinned rainbow on a photo could be explained by a mixture of 0.40 and 0.45 mm droplets. That small difference in droplet size resulted in a small difference in flattening of the droplet shape, and a large difference in flattening of the rainbow top.|$|E

50|$|Alexander's band or Alexander's {{dark band}} is an optical {{phenomenon}} associated with rainbows which {{was named after}} Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it in 200 AD. It occurs due to the deviation angles of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbows.</b> Both bows exist due to an optical effect called the angle of minimum deviation. The refractive index of water prevents light from being deviated at smaller angles.|$|R
50|$|Rainbows can be {{observed}} whenever there are water drops {{in the air and}} sunlight shining from behind the observer at a low altitude angle. Because of this, rainbows are usually seen in the western sky during the morning and in the eastern sky during the early evening. The most spectacular rainbow displays happen when half the sky is still dark with raining clouds and the observer is at a spot with clear sky {{in the direction of the}} sun. The result is a luminous rainbow that contrasts with the darkened background. During such good visibility conditions, the larger but fainter <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow</b> is often visible. It appears about 10° outside of the primary rainbow, with inverse order of colours.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the common primary and secondary rainbows, {{it is also possible}} for rainbows of higher orders to form. The order of a rainbow is determined by the number of light reflections inside the water droplets that create it: One reflection results in the first-order or primary rainbow; two reflections create the second-order or <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow.</b> More internal reflections cause bows of higher orders—theoretically unto infinity. As more and more light is lost with each internal reflection, however, each subsequent bow becomes progressively dimmer and therefore increasingly harder to spot. An additional challenge in observing the third-order (or tertiary) and fourth-order (quaternary) rainbows is their location {{in the direction of the}} sun (about 40° and 45° from the sun, respectively), causing them to become drowned in its glare.|$|E

5000|$|In Europe, Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics was {{translated}} into Latin and studied by Robert Grosseteste. His work on light was continued by Roger Bacon, who wrote in his Opus Majus of 1268 about experiments with light shining through crystals and water droplets showing the colours of the rainbow. In addition, Bacon {{was the first to}} calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that the rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42° above the horizon. Theodoric of Freiberg is known to have given an accurate theoretical explanation of both the primary and secondary rainbows in 1307. He explained the primary rainbow, noting that [...] "when sunlight falls on individual drops of moisture, the rays undergo two refractions (upon ingress and egress) and one reflection (at the back of the drop) before transmission into the eye of the observer." [...] He explained the <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow</b> through a similar analysis involving two refractions and two reflections.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary rainbows {{are caused}} by a double {{reflection}} of sunlight inside the raindrops, and are centred on the sun itself. They are about 127° (violet) to 130° (red) wide. Since {{this is more than}} 90°, they are seen {{on the same side of}} the sky as the primary rainbow, about 10° above it at apparent angles of 50-53°. As a result of the [...] "inside" [...] of the secondary bow being [...] "up" [...] to the observer, the colours appear reversed compared to the primary bow. The <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow</b> is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a greater area of the sky. Each rainbow reflects white light inside its coloured bands, but that is [...] "down" [...] for the primary and [...] "up" [...] for the secondary. [...] The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it.|$|E
5000|$|A single {{reflection}} off {{the backs}} of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside. Within the [...] "primary rainbow" [...] (the lowest, and also normally the brightest rainbow) the arc of a rainbow shows red on the outer (or upper) part of the arc, and violet on the inner section. This rainbow is caused by light being reflected once in droplets of water. In a double rainbow, a second arc may be seen above and outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colors reversed (red faces inward toward the other rainbow, in both rainbows). This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets. The region between a double rainbow is dark. The reason for this dark band is that, while light below the primary rainbow comes from droplet reflection, and light above the upper (<b>secondary)</b> <b>rainbow</b> also comes from droplet reflection, there is no mechanism for the region between a double rainbow to show any light reflected from water drops, at all.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{will be based on}} the diet {{composition}} monitoring of the introduced rainbow trout and wild brown trout and grayling in defined time intervals, and assessing the degree of the food competition among the monitored species. The experiment was held {{in the second half of}} September 2010 in the river Blanice in the protected fish areas close to the village Těšovice, where several dozens of rainbow trout were stocked. In a predefined several - day interval of were caught 30 pieces of the rainbow trout (SL = 266 ? 14 mm, m = 347 ? 54 g), 33 brown trout (SL = 244 ? 19 mm, m = 219 ? 51 g), 14 graylings (SL = 256 ? 27 mm, m = 240 ? 91 g) and 12 resident rainbow trout (SL = 255 ? 13 mm, m = 280 ? 47 g) originated from the last plant. Within these groups a fish stomach content and consequently food selectivity was examined by using of the Ivlev's selectivity index (1961), a food competition was examined by using of the Schoener's index food overlap (1970) and the importance of various food components was examined by using of the index of preponderance according to Natarajan (1961). Rainbow trout began to ingest food immediately after the stocking into the stream and its occurrence was seen in all fish crop caught during the period. The insect (Insecta) was given as a preferential food of the rainbow trout and according to the index of preponderance (IP), it formed 54 %, Trichoptera (IP) 24 % and Ephemeroptera (IP) 19 % orders belonged to the most preferable kinds of the food.

The <b>rainbow</b> trout was accepting the same dietary components as well as the original sorts of salmonoid fish within the river. According to the index of a food overlap (S), the food competition between rainbow trout and brown trout was equal to the value of (S = 0. 566) during the whole monitored period and the grayling was equal to (S = 0. 520). Even though both of these values are slightly below the significant food overlap (S = 0. 6), we can still say that the food competition is relatively high among these kinds...|$|R
40|$|Impacts on {{aquatic biota}} {{residing}} near municipal {{wastewater treatment plant}} (MWWTP) outfalls have been documented globally. These impacts may be directly or indirectly associated with elevated contaminants such as nutrients, metals, suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demanding matter (BOD), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. A variety of effects have been well documented in the Grand River watershed of southern Ontario below the outfalls of the MWWTPs of the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo. Responses in wild fish have been reported at multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from altered gene expression to changes in fish communities, as well as changes in nutrient cycling within the aquatic food web. The most consistently observed effect has been high occurrences and severe cases of intersex (ova-testes) in the male rainbow darter (Etheostoma Caeruleum); this finding represents one of the worst examples of pollution-caused intersex reported anywhere in the world. Primarily in response to the introduction of new effluent quality standards, the Region of Waterloo has invested millions of dollars to upgrade several of its MWWTPs including the facility servicing Kitchener, creating a unique opportunity to conduct a before-and-after study. The main objective of this thesis was to assess if treatment upgrades, which were targeted at conventional contaminants (i. e., ammonia, BOD, SS, and chloride), effectively remediated the responses previously reported in wild fish downstream of the MWWTP. To test this, historical, archived, and new data collections were used to assess changes at multiple levels of biological organization, including changes in nutrient cycling in the aquatic food web, reproductive effects in the male rainbow darter (e. g., intersex), and changes in fish community composition. For comparative purposes, responses in rainbow darter were also examined at numerous reference sites and below the smaller Waterloo MWWTP, which did not undergo any major upgrades during the study period. The treatment upgrades at the Kitchener MWWTP (which included nitrifying activated sludge) improved the overall quality of the effluent; these improvements included reductions in nutrients (total ammonia), pharmaceuticals, and total estrogenicity (E 2 eq). In contrast, the Waterloo MWWTP had deteriorating effluent quality, with ammonia levels increasing {{over the course of the}} study. Changes in effluent quality at both the Kitchener and Waterloo MWWTPs were detected in the downstream aquatic food webs using stable isotope ratios (δ 15 N and δ 13 C). Patterns of δ 15 N in a primary consumer (benthic invertebrate) and a <b>secondary</b> consumer (<b>rainbow</b> darter) reflected the exposure to MWWTP effluents and changes in nutrient cycling in response to the changing effluent quality. A major reduction in intersex in the male rainbow darter below the Kitchener MWWTP outfall was also associated with the improvements in effluent quality. Rates of intersex were reduced by as much as 70 % in the first year post-upgrade and dropped to near background levels within three years. Detecting change in fish communities below MWWTP outfalls (including before and after the upgrades) was more challenging. While subtle changes were detected (e. g., increases in pollution-tolerant species below the MWWTP outfalls), these could not be directly associated with MWWTP effluents because they were confounded by a watershed gradient (e. g., stream size). Fish communities were highly variable both spatially and temporally, limiting our ability to associate changes with local environmental conditions (i. e., effects of MWWTP outfalls). Although rainbow darter has been used as a sentinel species for detecting impacts of MWWTP effluents in many studies, little is known about its movement patterns. Elevated intersex was observed historically at the near-field upstream site of the Kitchener MWWTP outfall, leading to a hypothesis that wastewater-exposed fish may be moving upstream. To inform the interpretation of responses in rainbow darter as a sentinel species, a mark-and-recapture study was conducted at an upstream reference site to better understand their movement. Although the majority of fish (85 %) had high site fidelity, a small proportion of fish moved considerable distances (up to 975 m). This study confirmed that there is potential for some fish to move and thereby confound the interpretation of near-field upstream sites that are not physically separated from the sites below the MWWTP outfall. The decline in intersex in rainbow darter after the upgrades at the site immediately upstream of the Kitchener outfall supports the view that at least some of the responses seen at this site were probably associated with fish movements. 	Overall, this thesis advances our understanding of the impacts of MWWTP effluents on wild fish and their response to improved effluent quality (i. e., treatment). The relatively simple (conventional) upgrades at the Kitchener MWWTP resulted in improvements in the aquatic receiving environment, indicating that more advanced treatment may not be required to address these effects of concern. However, other impacts may be occurring that were not measured in this study. The results drawn from this thesis may have implications for future wastewater management strategies for other MWWTPs across Canada and around the globe. In addition, these studies may provide insight into key biological endpoints that could be useful for future biomonitoring programs for MWWTP effluents...|$|R

Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by channel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is sensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit evidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or otherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials. Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing the elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the elastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation of the DPP. The dependence of the DPP {{on the nature of}} the coupled states and other parameters can be studied. Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C- 12 and the combined excitation of O- 16 and C- 12. The radial forms found were very different from uniform renormalization of the potential.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a supernumerary nuclear rainbow in inelastic scattering is reported. This is done by studying inelastic ^ 16 O scattering from ^ 12 C, exciting the 2 ^+ (4. 44 MeV) state of ^ 12 C and elastic scattering at the incident energies in the range 124 to 200 MeV, using the coupled channels method. An extended double folding potential is used. This is derived from realistic wave functions for ^ 12 C and ^ 16 O calculated with a microscopic α cluster model and a finite-range density-dependent nucleon-nucleon force. Excitations to the 2 ^+ (4. 44 MeV), 3 ^- (9. 64 MeV) and 4 ^+ (14. 08 MeV) states of ^ 12 C, and the 3 ^- (6. 13 MeV) and 2 ^+ (6. 92 MeV) states of ^ 16 O {{are included in the}} coupled channels calculations.

40|$|Sprays and {{droplets}} {{are involved}} in numerous industrial processes and in nature, e. g. fuel injection in combustion chambers, painting, spray cooling, spray coating, chemical engineering, cloud physics, etc. The understanding of the light scattering features from the droplets, or particles in general, lays the foundation for extending existing techniques or devising novel techniques for particle characterization. The optical techniques are clearly advantageous over sampling, because of their non-intrusiveness and immediacy of results. Typical particle characteristics of interest include refractive index, size, velocity, and especially for non-spherical particles, some information regarding shape or form and orientation. However, most of existing optical techniques are only available for the measurement of spherical particles. In this thesis, the light scattering from a spheroid is studied and the generalized rainbow technique is proposed for droplet non-sphericity measurement. First, the vector ray tracing (VRT) model is employed to simulate the optical caustic structures in the primary rainbow region of oblate spheroidal droplets, which includes the rainbow and hyperbolic umbilic (HU) fringes. The location of cusp caustic is calculated by use of the VRT simulation and compared with that calculated by using analytic solution, exhibiting excellent agreement. Furthermore, the evolution process of the optical caustic structures {{is consistent with the}} experimental observation. It reveals that the optical caustic structures in the primary rainbow region can be used to measure the non-sphericity of oblate droplets. The VRT model {{can also be used to}} simulate and predict the optical caustic structures observed in higher-order rainbows. As a further validation, the cusp location and optical caustic structures in the <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow</b> region also have been studied using the VRT method. The <b>secondary</b> <b>rainbow</b> fringe, as well as the location and opening rate of the cusp caustic provide a further avenue for non-sphericity measurement of oblate droplets. Then the character of the generalized rainbow pattern from a spheroidal water droplet is investigated experimentally. In the experiment, light scattering from spheroidal water droplets in the vicinity of the primary rainbow region has been observed to contain a variety of characteristic interference patterns which are the generalization of the rainbow from a sphere. These patterns start from being a fold rainbow, change to transverse cusp caustics and then to hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe as the aspect ratio of the droplet increases. A comparison of the intensity distribution of the observed rainbow patterns in the horizontal equatorial plane with those of Airy simulation reveals that these patterns can be used for characterizing droplets, in particular for determining the refractive index and the diameter of the spheroidal droplet in the equatorial plane. According to the generalized rainbow patterns and Airy approximation, the refractive index and equatorial diameter of water droplets can be inverted from the corresponding generalized rainbow patterns. A comparison of the refractive indices inverted from the corresponding generalized rainbow patterns with that of pure water shows good agreement with absolute errors less than 0. 5 x 10 - 4. The water droplet diameters in the horizontal equatorial plane are calculated from the generalized rainbow patterns and compared to that measured by direct imaging. It is shown that the relative errors of droplet diameters associated with the generalized rainbow patterns lie between - 5...|$|E
