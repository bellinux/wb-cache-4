40|$|Th is paper, {{based on}} presentations before audiences in Lisbon, {{provides}} an overview of the causes of the credit crisis and discusses one of the reports issued in the wake thereof, the De Larosière Report. Its main findings in respect of financial sector regulation are reviewed: a <b>single</b> European <b>rulebook,</b> colleges of supervisors, deposit guarantee schemes, bank resolution regimes and ‘living wills’ as well as transparent corporate structures of banks. The proposals {{for the establishment of a}} European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) are described and subjected to critical reviews, both from a legal angle and from a broader perspective. Emphasis is given to the European Banking Authority (EBA), as one of the agencies within the ESFS. Suggestions are made to broaden the legal underpinning of the proposals in order to place the new bodies on a firm footing. This paper argues that, even though major steps toward a stronger Union-wide response to difficulties in the financial sector, the De Larosière proposals and the Commission’s legislative follow-up do not provide an adequate response to the lessons from the crisis. Federal authority for overseeing the financial sector is required: this implies Treaty change...|$|R

40|$|The Application of Anti-Manipulation Law to EU Wholesale Energy Markets and Its Interplay with EU Competition Law Of the findings, the European Commission {{established}} {{in its report}} on Energy Sector Inquiry, market manipulation constituted a major concern for the functioning and integrity of EU energy sectors. The Commission argued that the responsibility for high prices in wholesale energy markets {{could be attributed to}} manipulative practices of energy incumbents and the trust in the operation of operation of sector was largely compromised, due to these practices. Remedies, EU competition law provided, were considered as insufficient to resolve these shortcomings and thus should be supplemented with regulatory-based tools. The findings of the Energy Sector Inquiry and subsequent consultation documents by multiple EU institutions {{paved the way for the}} adoption of the Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, REMIT, which incorporated into an anti-manipulation rule, specifically designed to prohibit and prosecute manipulative practices in EU wholesale energy markets. Nevertheless, as EU case law on market manipulation has yet to develop and there are uncertainties with respect to the concept of market manipulation. Furthermore REMIT does not preclude the jurisdiction of EU competition law, questions arise as to the scope and the extent of the application of this prohibition. Throughout its chapters, this book explores the scope of and the case law on market manipulation to determine what types of market practices are regarded as manipulative and thus prohibited under anti-manipulation rules. It also focuses on the interplay between REMIT and EU competition law and evaluates factors and circumstances that determine when and what market misconduct can be subject to enforcement proceedings under both anti-manipulation and antitrust rules. As the development of a <b>single,</b> coherent, <b>rulebook</b> that can be relied upon by market participant is fundamental for the functioning of EU wholesale energy markets, the book, finally, provides proposals and measures that can mitigate and resolve the legal uncertainties regarding the regulatory framework REMIT established...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of short selling {{is one of}} the most debated topics of the immediate post-crisis financial regulatory landscape. Notwithstanding, nothing – or at least very little – has been written about it moving the analysis of such controversial issue from a legal perspective. Against this background, the main purpose of this work is to complement the ongoing international policy discussion enriching the existent debate with new considerations which are deemed to be essential for a deeper understanding of such investment technique. In particular, it presents a comprehensive analysis of short selling regimes as currently in place in the United States and at the European Union level, in the wider context of transatlantic dialogues. In doing so, the study of short selling regulations is proposed along to two main descriptive lines of research, which are clearly reflected in two distinct, although interconnected, parts. Common thread of Part I (Short Selling Regulation from a Comparative Perspective) can be identified in the need to provide solid methodological justification to the research. Chapter 1 investigates first of all the reasons behind the adoption of a comparative law perspective in the analysis of short selling regulation, moving from the scrutiny of short selling as described until now by economic studies. In particular, it moves from commenting on the status quo of research – with reference both to the identification of the different ‘mechanisms’ of short sales and to their impact on financial markets – evidencing economists’ difficulties in providing an uncontroversial response on whether regulatory intervention in this field is need. A legal perspective becomes thus critical in order to fill the gaps left by economic analysis, bringing to the debate considerations on the role of regulation in the direction of financial markets and on the necessity to provide market operators with a safe environment relying on legal certainty of financial operations. In this sense, the research further investigate the added value of a comparative approach in addressing risks posed by potential divergences in the {{regulation of}} short selling, in particular with reference to risks of ‘regulatory arbitrage’, upholding the key role of comparative law in the as transitional step towards international regulatory harmonization. Chapter 2 faces instead the absence of comparative law research in the field of financial regulation, questioning the appropriateness of the comparative law traditional methodology once applied to the topic in hand. In this respect, criticisms move from evidencing that financial regulation has been traditionally disregarded as object of comparison, tracing back this lack of interest in the difficulties in ascribing it within classical comparative law categories. In this sense, this work support the abandonment of a rigid compartmentalization – addressing in particular, the private/public law distinction, legal families, and the impact of globalization on comparative studies – in order to show that comparative studies on financial regulation are possible, but require a flexible methodology. Lastly, Chapter 3 will deal with the rationale behind a comparison of short selling regulations enacted by two different ‘forms of government’: the United States, as main point of reference and pioneer in the regulation of financial markets since the Great Crush of 1929, and the European Union, as its emerging new counter-party in international regulatory dialogues. In this context, it held that despite institutionally different – the former being a federal State and the latter a supranational organization – regulatory choices recently undertaken by the European Union show strong signs of convergence towards the traditional approach which characterizes financial regulation in the United States, at least from the perspective of the interaction between the Union and its Member States. This position is supported by the analysis of the U. S. ´dual system’ of financial regulation against strong harmonization trends in the EU Framework, observed from the adoption of the EU Financial Services Action Plan to the project for a EU <b>Single</b> European <b>Rulebook.</b> As a consequence, comparison of these two sets of rules represents, at the current stage, the most appropriate choice for a comparative analysis of short selling regulations, also in light of the increasing importance of transatlantic regulatory dialogues. Part II of the research (Short Selling Regulatory Choices – European Union and United States Compared) is then dedicated to the in depth comparative analysis of the current regulatory framework of short selling in the in the United States and in the European Union, in order to support the methodological assumption on the convergence of the two normative frameworks. Chapter 4, after addressing the main evolutionary steps in the regulation of short selling from an historical perspective, provides an overview of the regulations which are in force, at the current juncture, in the two systems. In particular, space is given to the regulatory debates which led to the enactment of Regulation SHO for United States and of Regulation 236 / 2012 for the European Union, offering a preliminary outline of the main legislative measures governing short selling. Chapter 5 thus enters into the detail of the analysis of the content of the two regulatory regimes. In particular, it describes the scope of application of Regulation 236 / 2012 and Regulation SHO, moving the analysis from emphasising the importance of legal definitions in the context of short selling. Against a widespread common understanding on the mechanics of short sales, the absence of clear legal definitions represented a misleading element in the study of short selling regulations, since generic reference to this practice has often led researchers to take for granted that measures adopted in different legislations were referring to the exact same phenomenon. Consistently, short selling is described focusing on the definitions provided under the two regulatory frameworks, with specific reference to the impact of the concept of ‘ownership’, of the calculation of ‘positions’ and of the privileged treatment of professional investors embodied in the U. S. regime. Scope of the two frameworks is then completed by the identification of the instruments covered and of their geographical applicability, with specific reference to the controversial issue of extraterritoriality. Chapter 6 presents the core provisions of the two regulatory frameworks, namely the way in which EU and U. S. legislators addressed short selling with reference to transparency of transactions and to the particular risks posed by ‘naked’ short selling. With respect to the first, it provides on overview on pro and cons of two divergent approaches: a notification and disclosure regime, as adopted in the EU, and a ‘marking’ system, as in force in the U. S. As for the second, it addressed the instruments adopted by the EU and U. S. regulators in order to curb the risks connected to ‘naked’ short selling. Main focus is posed on the functioning of ‘locate rules’ and on the application of ‘buy-in’ or ‘close-out’ requirements, with references to the measures implemented in order to address short selling when used as instrument for market abuses. In addition, attention is paid to the exceptions provided for the applicability of those rules, with emphasis on the different approaches adopted in the treatment of ‘market marking’ activities. Ultimately, Chapter 7 completes the analysis of short selling regulatory frameworks addressing powers of intervention granted to national competent authorities in order to face risks posed by short under specific circumstances. In particular, it describes the treatment of short selling in declining markets, under discretional and automatic ‘circuit breakers’, as well as extra-ordinary powers triggered by ‘exceptional’ or ‘emergency’ circumstances. In this context, particular attention is paid to the European regime, setting forth rules for the interaction among Member States competent authorities and the European Securities and Markets Authority. Cooperation arrangements are also taken into consideration under an international dimension, identifying the main instruments which foster the establishment of effective information sharing systems and collaboration in the enforcement of short selling regulatory regimes. ...|$|R
50|$|Ysgarth is {{generally}} noted, both positively and negatively for the extreme detail of its game mechanics. It {{was one of}} the first roleplaying systems to rely heavily on skills and discard the idea of character classes and also one of the first games to rely solely on the use of 10 sided dice for percentile rolls in resolving actions. Ysgarth also emphasizes realistic combat resolvable in minute detail. Some have praised the mechanics as innovative and others have damned them as cumbersome. This issue of excessive mechanics is made more complex by the fact that each edition of Ysgarth featured fairly radical changes in the implementation of the basic rule concepts varying in their level of complexity. The 5th edition actually included three completely different versions of the mechanics in a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The main {{addition}} in the Regulation is the [...] "Single Rulebook", {{which aims}} to provide a single set of harmonised prudential rules which institutions throughout the EU must respect. The term <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook</b> was coined in 2009 by the European Council in order {{to refer to the}} aim of a unified regulatory framework for the EU financial sector that would complete the single market in financial services. This will ensure uniform application of Basel III in all Member States, it will close regulatory loopholes and will thus contribute to a more effective functioning of the Internal Market. The new rules remove a large number of national options and discretions from the CRD, and allow Member States to apply stricter requirements only where these are justified by national circumstances, needed on financial stability grounds or because of a bank's specific risk profile.|$|E

Although the <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook</b> uniforms banks' risks management and micro-prudential supervision, the macro-prudential components contained are reduced and academically challenged. The question of Member States outside the Eurozone on the participation within the Single Supervisory Mechanism is when is the right moment and not if, since there is an implicit horizon for joining the Eurozone and thus to the mechanism. For these Member States, where the banking system is dominated by banking groups supervised by the European Central Bank, entering into a close cooperation with the Single Supervisory Mechanism does not appear to be a necessity, given that national supervision authorities are applying the <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook,</b> and cooperation between national authorities and the European Central Bank is clearly established...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposal}} for a European banking union represents the more recent effort to drive the Eurozone countries towards the effective adoption of a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook</b> and a single supervisory handbook, {{at the same time}} endowing them with a centralised mechanism for the resolution of bank crises. The new institutional framework should help to disconnect banking operations from the vicissitudes of sovereign debts, to reverse the recent re-nationalisation of finance and to restore the effectiveness of ECB monetary policy. Although the new framework would mark a significant advancement with respect to the present situation, its predictable incomplete adoption, restricted to the single supervisory mechanism, coupled with the unwillingness to burden it with legacy problems, will most likely produce opposite results from its inception. Although the full implementation of the proposal would not constitute a departure from the political de-centralised design that has so far dominated the European construction, the potential fiscal implications of a centralised resolution mechanism have raised the same barriers that have so far impeded to complete the design initiated with the Maastricht Treaty.     JEL Codes: E 02, F 33, G 18  </p...|$|E
40|$|Three {{years have}} passed since the euro crisis broke out in 2010, {{revealing}} the shortcomings of the EMU architecture as it was foreseen in Maastricht. A number of reforms have been undertaken since 2010 in order to strengthen the Monetary Union, make it more adept to face the challenges of the financial integration that the euro itself created and ensure a stronger resilience to financial crises in the future. To this end, the EMU framework has been strengthened on the side of financial supervision, fiscal discipline and macroeconomic surveillance. Among the various reforms, the agreement to create a Banking Union is certainly a major one and represents probably the most important step towards integration to date. But is it enough? The economic session of the BTTD 2014 will review the progress on banking union so far and ask what else is missing in the EMU architecture to complement and enhance the reforms on the financial side. 2 2014 will be a year of important changes for the European financial system, and the shape of the European Banking Union is due to become clearer.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, the {{financial}} crisis has shown important lacks in the EU regulation relating to the banking sector, making {{the introduction of a}} unified regulatory framework necessary. Since June 2009 the European Council has recommended a “Single Rulebook”, that is a unique and harmonizing discipline applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market, become effective on January 2014. This prudential discipline requires much more minimum capital, liquidity and information transparency and it defines format and minimum standards of contents. The aim of this research is to investigate the relation between the new mandatory disclosure and earnings management policies in banking sector realized through Loan Loss Provisions (LLP), the component of income statement mainly subject to manipulations, especially in form of earnings smoothing. Because the new integrated regulatory framework requires a more transparent disclosure, we expected that accruals manipulation (basically LLP) could be discouraged. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 116 listed European banks over the period prior (2011 - 2012 - 2013) and after (2014 - 2015 - 2016) the effective date of the <b>Single</b> <b>Rulebook.</b> The evidence confirm our hypothesis suggesting that this banking reform discourages earnings manipulation and improves earnings quality, making financial reporting more useful for investors.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2008 highlighted {{the need for}} a deeper integration of the banking system, as a warranty to support long-term financial stability. It was argued that the grounds of the crisis lie also in an uncoordinated national response to the failure of banks, in a fragmentation of the Single Market in lending and funding and, therefore, a better regulation and supervision of the financial sector can ensure financial stability and growth in the European Union. In order to restore the proper functioning of the internal market and to avoid future crisis, the European Commission launched a set of initiatives, in order to assure a safer and sounder financial sector for the single market; are included here: stronger prudential requirements for banks, improved depositor protection and rules for managing failing banks and a <b>single</b> <b>rulebook</b> for all the 28 Member States of the European Union. The single rule book is the step towards the Banking Union sits. The banking union consists of three pillars: a Single Supervisory Mechanism, a Single Resolution Mechanism and a joint deposit-insurance scheme.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the {{conditions and limitations}} of mutual recognition and seeks to identify the lacunae in the governance mechanism and the regulatory framework applicable to undertakings in collective investment in transferable securities (‘UCITS’). It assesses the regulatory and supervisory mechanisms that may be applied to address the identified weaknesses. For this purpose, the thesis formulates a theoretical framework for effective mutual recognition based on quasi-maximum harmonisation, reflexive governance of financial supervision and a mechanism for the strengthening of mutual trust between national financial supervisors. The technique for financial regulation {{in the field of}} UCITS should create the right balance between implementing a policy designed to attain a high degree of harmonisation of investor protection regulation and making exceptions to address national differences. The picture that emerges is one where a model based on minimum harmonisation causes serious limitations to mutual recognition in the form of inconsistencies in the implementation of EU Law and the application of national discretions. Quasi-maximum harmonisation becomes the optimal technique for UCITS. However, the limitations of a model based on minimum harmonisation of regulation resurface, although to a lesser extent, even in a framework based on quasi-maximum harmonisation. The solution is not one where an even higher degree of harmonisation (the <b>single</b> <b>rulebook</b> mechanism) is required, but lies in reflexive governance of financial supervision combined with a framework for the strengthening of mutual trust between national financial supervisors. This framework can form the basis for overcoming the remaining obstacles to the cross-border activity of UCITS, including the barrier to the depositary passport which is the last major bastion that stands {{in the way of a}} complete internal market for UCITS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{response}} to the economic and financial crisis, the EU has adopted a new regulatory framework of the banking sector. Its central elements consist of new capital requirements, the <b>single</b> <b>rulebook,</b> and rules for bank recovery and resolution. These legislations have been adopted to reduce the call for government bail-out of distressed banks in future crises. The present study performs a detailed quantitative assessment of the reduction in public finance costs {{brought about by the}} introduction of these rules. We use a microsimulation portfolio model, which implements the Basel risk assessment framework, to estimate the joint distribution of bank losses at EU level. The approach incorporates the complete safety-net set up in EU legislation to absorb these losses, explicitly modelling enhanced Basel III capital rules, the bail-in tool and the resolution funds. Using a near-full sample of commercial, cooperative and savings banks in the EU, we quantify the cumulative effects of this safety-net and the contribution of each individual tool to the total effect. Considering a crisis of a similar magnitude as the recent one, our results show that potential costs for public finances decrease from roughly 3. 7 % of EU GDP (before the introduction of any new tool) to 1. 4 % with bail-in, and finally to 0. 5 % when all the elements we model are in place. This latter amount is very close to our estimate of leftover resolution funds {{and the size of the}} Deposit Guarantee Scheme. This exercise extends the quantitative analyses performed by the European Commission in its Economic Review of the Financial Regulation Agenda by developing additional scenarios, crucial robustness checks, simulations for different annual data vintages, and by implementing some methodological improvements...|$|E
