40|$|From the introduction]. The {{structure}} of the paper is as follows. In the next section, I briefly outline {{the efforts of the}} European Community to develop a regulatory regime for vehicle emissions, with a particular focus on the period 1970 to 1990. The following section then moves from simple description of the regulatory regime to analysis of the "how and "why. ' At that point, I formally introduce the concept of the intergovernmental state and the associated method for analyzing such states. The next section of the paper then reviews the evolution of the regulatory regime for vehcile emissions {{from the perspective of the}} EC as an intergovernmental state. To anticipate, the general claim is that the vehicle emissions policy network began as a clientele pluralist network, evolved into a state-directed network in the late 1980 s, and was transformed again into a much less <b>structured</b> <b>issue</b> network in the early 1990 s. In the concluding section, I discuss the extent to which the vehicle emissions case is representative of the policy-making process in the Eu, and consider the implications of this case for the study of environmental policy and interest organizations in the Union...|$|E

Since some of the available contradictory evidence on capital <b>structure</b> <b>issues</b> might be explained by econometric challenges due to the typical data structure, we also discuss methodological issues like panel data, endogeneity, and partial adjustment models in the capital structure context.
