25|$|Created by Congress on 4 August 1790 at {{the request}} of Alexander Hamilton as the Revenue Marine, it is the oldest {{continuous}} <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> of the United States. As Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton headed the Revenue Marine, whose original purpose was collecting customs duties in the nation's seaports. By the 1860s, the service was known as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the term Revenue Marine gradually fell into disuse.|$|E
25|$|Halsted {{appears to}} have had no active <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> {{after the end of}} the wars with France. He married Miss A. Fowler and had two sons and one daughter. Of his sons, his eldest, Lawrence William, {{obtained}} a commission in the 87th Regiment of Foot, while George Anthony followed his father into the navy, having reached the rank of lieutenant by 1830. Due to his low position on the seniority lists, John Halsted did not live long enough to achieve flag rank. He died, still a post-captain, at Exeter on 2 November 1830, at the age of 62.|$|E
25|$|Heathcote {{paid off}} Scipion in October 1814 {{and had no}} further active <b>seagoing</b> <b>service.</b> He {{received}} a knighthood on 20 July 1819 and was promoted to rear-admiral in 1825. Further promotions followed, he was advanced to vice-admiral in 1837, and to a full admiral in 1846. He had married Sarah-Elizabeth Guscott on 10 November 1799. She predeceased him, dying on 19 October 1845. By this time the couple had produced a large family. Their eldest child, Sarah-Frances Heathcote married Major-General Henry Somerset. Their third son, Thomas Hamilton Heathcote, entered service with the East India Company, and died a lieutenant at Bombay in 1824 {{at the age of}} 20. The couple had eleven children in total, at least one of whom followed his father into the navy.|$|E

50|$|He {{became a}} sea cadet in 1898 and was {{commissioned}} into the Swedish Navy as an acting sub lieutenant in 1904 after passing the naval officer examination. Ehrensvärd {{was promoted to}} sub-lieutenant in 1906. Ehrensvärd passed the higher course at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1910 to 1911 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1913. He was {{a teacher at the}} Royal Swedish Naval Academy from 1916 to 1919 and at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1918 to 1922 when he was promoted to commander. <b>Seagoing</b> <b>services</b> in the 1910s was partly as captain and division commander of torpedo boats.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{countries}} do {{not distinguish between}} these uses, and employ only one national flag and ensign in all cases; in the United States, for example, all ships of the <b>seagoing</b> <b>services</b> of the United States Government {{with the exception of}} the United States Coast Guard fly the national flag as their ensign, although the ships of some agencies also fly an agency flag as a [...] "distinguishing mark." [...] Other countries (like the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Italy, Russia, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan) use different ensigns. Such ensigns are strictly regulated and indicate if the vessel is a warship, a merchant ship, a ship under contract to carry mail, or a yacht, for example.|$|R
25|$|Apparently {{aware of}} the Navy's view that screw {{propellers}} would prove unsuitable for <b>seagoing</b> <b>service,</b> Smith determined to prove this assumption wrong. In September 1837, he took his small vessel (now fitted with an iron propeller of a single turn) to sea, steaming from Blackwall, London to Hythe, Kent, with stops at Ramsgate, Dover and Folkestone. On {{the way back to}} London on the 25th, Smith's craft was observed making headway in stormy seas by officers of the Royal Navy. The Admiralty's interest in the technology was revived, and Smith was encouraged to build a full size ship to more conclusively demonstrate the technology's effectiveness. He was able to attract a number of investors to provide the necessary capital, including the banker Wright and the engineering firm of J. and G. Rennie, who together formed a new company called the Ship Propeller Company. The company's proposed vessel was initially tentatively named Propeller, but the name eventually adopted for the ship was Archimedes, after the 3rd century Greek inventor.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the ship}} from the Admiralty sketch design was based around the Fairey IIID {{seaplane}} being operated for the RAN by the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 101 Flight. Albatross could carry up to nine aircraft—six active and three in reserve—in three internal hangars; their incorporation inside the ship's hull resulted in an unusually high freeboard in the forward half of the vessel, and forced the propulsion machinery, accommodation, and bridge to all {{be located in the}} aft half. Three recovery cranes were used to manipulate the aircraft. The Faireys were removed from service shortly before Albatross entered service, and were replaced by the Supermarine Seagull Mark III. The Mark IIIs were unsuited for operations aboard Albatross, particularly as the aircraft were not durable enough to withstand catapult launches. Specifications for a new aircraft design were drawn up to the RAN and RAAF, and Supermarine designed the Seagull Mark V (later to be called the Walrus) specifically for Albatross, although the design was later adopted by the Royal Navy. Albatross was removed from <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> in 1933, two months before the Mark Vs entered service, although the aircraft were operated from the vessel while she was at anchor. In addition, the new Seagulls were too tall to manoeuvre around inside the hangars, although this problem was worked around by placing the aircraft, with undercarriage retracted, on specially designed trolleys.|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to European waters with {{the resumption of}} the wars with France, joining a fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood blockading Cadiz. The reinforced fleet, by then commanded by Horatio Nelson, engaged the combined Franco-Spanish fleet when it emerged from port. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October Bellerophon fought a bitter engagement against Spanish and French ships, sustaining heavy casualties including {{the death of her}} captain, John Cooke. After repairs Bellerophon was employed blockading the enemy fleets in the Channel and the North Sea. She plied the waters of the Baltic Sea in 1809, making attacks on Russian shipping, and by 1810 was off the French coast again, blockading their ports. She went out to North America as a convoy escort between 1813 and 1814, and in 1815 was assigned to blockade the French Atlantic port of Rochefort. In July 1815, defeated at Waterloo and finding escape to America barred by the blockading Bellerophon, Napoleon came aboard [...] "the ship that had dogged his steps for twenty years" [...] (according to maritime historian David Cordingly) to finally surrender to the British. It was Bellerophons last <b>seagoing</b> <b>service.</b> She was paid off and converted to a prison ship in 1815, and was renamed Captivity in 1824 to free the name for another ship. Moved to Plymouth in 1826, she continued in service until 1834, when the last convicts left. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1836, and she was broken up.|$|E
5000|$|The Naval Order of the United States traces {{its origin}} to the {{initiative}} of Charles Calhoun Philbrook, Charles Frederick Bacon Philbrook, and Franklin Senter Frisbie, who met in Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 July 1890 {{to take the first}} step toward establishing an organization that was originally named the Naval Commandery of the United States of America. Its purpose was to commemorate the <b>seagoing</b> <b>services</b> of their ancestors' naval service. The original eligibility for membership was based upon service [...] "in any of the wars or in any battle in which the United States Navy or Marine Corps has participated, or who served as above in connection with the Revenue or Privateer Services." [...] Four months later, on the 115th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, 13 November 1890, the organization was established on a permanent basis and branches were established in several states. Three years later on 19 July 1893, the Naval Commandery began discussions with a smaller organization that had similar aims: the Naval Legion of the United States. The result of these talks resulted in the formal merger of the two organizations as the Naval Order of the United States. The formal meeting of the new and expanded organization took place on 15 August 1893 at Faneuil Hall, Boston, where the Naval Order adopted its constitution that created local commanderies in the various states with members becoming Companions of the Naval Order.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. Navy League Cadet Corps (also {{known as}} the United States Naval League Cadet Corps or [...] "NLCC") is a junior version of the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps (NSCC) program {{developed}} for younger cadets, aged 11 through 14, {{under the auspices of}} the Navy League of the United States. The mission of the NLCC is to train cadets about the <b>seagoing</b> military <b>services,</b> community service, citizenship, and an understanding of discipline and teamwork so that they are prepared for membership in the NSCC. While NLCC cadets can go into the NSCC when they turn 13, they may also elect to remain in the NLCC until age 14, when they must either transfer into the NSCC, or leave the program.|$|R
25|$|Ferries used to link {{opposite}} sides of the Clyde in Glasgow but they have been rendered near-obsolete, by bridges and tunnels including the Erskine Bridge, Kingston Bridge, and the Clyde Tunnel. The only remaining crossings are the Renfrew Ferry between Renfrew and Yoker, and the Kilcreggan Ferry in Inverclyde, both run by SPT but outwith the city boundary. The PS Waverley, the world's last operational <b>seagoing</b> paddle-steamer, provides <b>services</b> from Glasgow city Centre, mainly catering to the pleasure cruise market. A regular waterbus service links the city Centre with Braehead in Renfrewshire, some 30 minutes downstream. A service by Loch Lomond Seaplanes, connecting the city with destinations in Argyll and Bute started in 2007. The only operational dock left in Glasgow operated by Clydeport is the King George V Dock, near Braehead. Since the advent of Containerisation, most other facilities, such as Hunterston Terminal are located in the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde, which together handle some 7.5million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the Sea of the Hebrides.|$|R
2500|$|Further {{promotions}} followed {{during his}} time in command in the West Indies, and on 29 January 1778 {{he was promoted to}} admiral of the white. Contemporary chroniclers recorded that he had raised his flag aboard [...] in February that year, but his time as the station commander was drawing to a close. He returned to England in July 1778, and had no further active <b>seagoing</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
2500|$|He {{volunteered for}} <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> {{and became a}} sea cadet on the cruiser [...] on 1 April 1913. In 1914, {{promotion}} to Fähnrich zur See and transfer to the battleship [...] followed. He received the Iron Cross First Class in [...] August, 1915 as an officer candidate, for his excellence as an artillery spotter. On 18 September 1915, he received his leutnant's (lieutenant's) commission.|$|E
2500|$|In 1819, the Allaire Works {{supplied}} the engine for Robert Fulton, the first steamship to enter service along the United States coastline (as opposed to working the inland waterways). This engine had a [...] cylinder and {{a stroke of}} 5 feet. Robert Fulton helped to demonstrate that steamships were capable of reliable <b>seagoing</b> <b>service.</b> Other engines built in this period by the Allaire Works include those for United States—a 140-foot steamer {{said to be the}} first American steamboat to issue tickets (rather than [...] "way-bills") to passengers—and for James Kent, North Carolina, South Carolina and other Hudson River steamers.|$|E
2500|$|Vengeance was a 48-gun frigate of the French Navy, lead ship of her class. She engaged [...] {{during the}} Quasi-War, in an {{inconclusive}} engagement that left both ships heavily damaged. During the French Revolutionary Wars, [...] hunted Vengeance down and captured her after a sharp action. She was recommissioned in the Royal Navy as the 38-gun fifth rate HMS Vengeance, but the British apparently never returned her to <b>seagoing</b> <b>service.</b> Accounts are divided as to her eventual fate. She {{may have been}} broken up in 1803 after grounding in 1801, or continued as a prison ship until 1814.|$|E
2500|$|Andrey Pervozvanny and Imperator Pavel I saw {{very limited}} <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> in 1910 through 1912; their few voyages within the Russian Baltic waters were trials, rather than active duty. Their combat {{readiness}} was crippled by shortage of personnel. Absence of proper portholes and limited capacity of electrical fans made living conditions unbearable, thus commissioned officers evaded {{transfer to the}} [...] "ugly sisters" [...] at all costs. The NTC seriously considered cutting portholes through the armor, but found it too expensive to be done. The enlisted men sabotaged the system by jamming the fan switches in [...] "on" [...] position, which caused frequent electrical failures. The Navy [...] "fixed the problem" [...] by building steel lockers around the switches but could not contain the discontent of the sailors.|$|E
2500|$|Born {{the son of}} a {{naval officer}} in 1782, Edward Hawker was first entered in the books of a warship when just four years old. [...] His actual <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> did not begin until 1792, after which he saw action in some of the early engagements of the French Revolutionary Wars. [...] Commissioned a {{lieutenant}} at thirteen, he served with several relatives both in the West Indies and in the waters off the British coast. A commander at twenty-one, he captained his own ships at the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. [...] Posted again to the West Indies, he endured several mishaps, including running his ship aground, and then having it struck by lightning and damaged. His travails with the weather there continued after his promotion to post-captain, including a severe hurricane that dis-masted his ship and nearly sank her.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1890s, {{the monitor}} concept was well and truly obsolete, if indeed {{it had ever}} been optimal. Monitor {{warships}} suffered a variety of well known defects, the most obvious {{of which was the}} type's poor suitability to oceangoing service, due mainly to the very low freeboard—a feature originally included as a means of reducing the vessel's exposure to enemy fire. Other problems which diminished the type's practicality for <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> were the low speed, and short range {{due to a lack of}} space for fuel. An additional problem was the lack of ventilation which often made for almost unbearable heat below deck (the engine room of one particular monitor once recorded a temperature of [...] ). On the positive side, monitors were considered stable gun platforms and could generally be fitted with larger guns than more conventional vessels of an equivalent tonnage.|$|E
2500|$|Troubridge {{was born}} into a family with {{substantial}} military connections, with several of his forebears being distinguished naval officers. He too embarked on a career in the navy, rising through the ranks during the late Victorian period, and commanding ships in the Mediterranean. He served as a naval attaché to several powers, including the Empire of Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. He spent some time immediately before the outbreak of the First World War as a staff officer and assisted in the drawing up of strategic plans to be adopted in the event of war, though these were later rejected. He returned to <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> just prior to the outbreak of war, and commanded a cruiser squadron in the Mediterranean with the rank of rear-admiral. Here his promising career was blighted by the events surrounding the pursuit of two German warships, [...] and [...] Despite being outclassed by the German warships, Troubridge intended to engage them, but was convinced otherwise by his flag captain and allowed them to escape to Constantinople. He and his commanding officer were heavily criticised for their failure to intercept the German ships, particularly when it subsequently appeared that they became influential in the Turkish decision to enter the war. [...] Troubridge was court-martialled and although he was acquitted, his reputation had been damaged.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrier {{does not}} appear to have had any <b>seagoing</b> <b>service</b> after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, and having been made a vice-admiral on 4 June 1814, settled ashore at Deal, Kent. His {{obituary}} recorded that his public character [...] "evinced great punctuality, naval skill, fortitude, resolution, and a steady perseverance, and to a degree which drew forth the admiration of all those with whom he served." [...] He was a good friend of Admiral Lord Exmouth, and the Duke of Wellington, whom he had met while serving in India. Ferrier was a frequent visitor to the Duke's residence at Walmer Castle, close to his home at Deal. His private life was remarked to be [...] "most unassuming and unostentatious, influenced in all his actions by the very highest sense of honour, and he secretly exercised many acts of bounty and munificence." [...] He was promoted to the rank of admiral of the blue, but having been suffering for some time from an internal complaint, was advised to undergo an operation. He travelled to London in late January 1836, and the operation was performed there on 25 January. There were complications, and the admiral died two days later, on 27 January at the age of 77. He had married late in life, his wife surviving him.|$|E
