40|$|With {{on-going}} {{changes in}} land use practices from conventional livestock farming to commercial, wildlife-based activities, the interface or interaction between livestock and wildlife is increasing. As {{part of the}} wildlife-based activities of ecotourism, breeding and hunting, game farmers are also exploring the utilisation of meat from hunted or harvested game. The expanding interface or increased interaction between livestock and wildlife {{increases the risk of}} disease incidence and the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of previously diagnosed diseases. The risk is not only related to domestic and wild animal health, but also to the occupational hazards that it poses to animal handlers and the consumers of game meat. This review endeavours to highlight the role that game plays in the spreading of zoonotic diseases to other animals and humans. Examples of zoonotic diseases that have occurred in wild animals in the past, their relevance and risk have been summarised and should function as a quick reference guide for wildlife veterinarians, ecologists, farmers, hunters, <b>slaughter</b> <b>staff,</b> processors and public health professionals...|$|E
40|$|The EU council {{regulation}} 1099 / 2009 on {{the protection of}} animals {{at the time of}} killing states that, with some exceptions, anyone who is involved in the killing of animals for the production of food, wool, skin, fur or other products must have a certificate of competence from January 1, 2013. A pilot study has been conducted as part of efforts to develop a training concept of animal welfare that meets the requirements of the EU Regulation. The pilot study includes a global analysis (UK, Spain, Chile, Brazil and Denmark), in which it was found that there are major differences between the level of education between the different countries and the educational concepts are different. Countries were similar in that they emphasized the relationship between animal handling, animal welfare and meat quality, and all the countries are planning to adapt the competence level to the EU regulation. An analysis of current Swedish educational conditions shows that the education varies widely between and within different sectors and that none of the sectors seem to meet the competence levels of the EU Regulation. In the preliminary study we identified several target groups for whom the certificate of competence is not mandatory, but who require training in animal welfare at the time of killing. These groups {{should be included in the}} education concept at an early stage. A broad approach to the education concept may result in a general improvement of animal welfare. An overview of the proposed e‐based training modules is presented. The modules should be supplemented by physical meetings, practical sessions and a risk assessment analysis based on animal welfare indicators. The differences in education between <b>slaughter</b> <b>staff</b> and animal welfare officers are defined, where the latter is given a more detailed and extensive training to ensure that the provisions of the EU Regulation are followed...|$|E

5000|$|Less than a {{relative}} hour later, East Coast SAR is {{informed about the}} outbreak {{and the destruction of}} the West Coast SAR. They are informed a payload of something from the station has been programmed by a deranged survivor to teleport soon to Earth, which will destroy the planet. The SAR is ordered to halt the payload and recover the one surviving member of the West Coast SAR, Whit. Arriving, they find a frozen slaughterhouse, eventually reuniting with Whit, who has had a week to figure out how the station operates. Whit explains that the mining <b>staff</b> <b>slaughtered</b> each other, tearing off their skin and killing one another. Whit is able to shut down the payload, but the deranged survivor suddenly attacks. Everyone is sprayed with the survivor's blood after he is shot and becomes violently enraged. Whit hides from the others, then searches the station for remaining SAR personnel and anything he can learn about the infection. Finding a lab, he discovers a medical log that reveals the planet is entirely composed of alien organic material that when thawed forms a so-called [...] "primordial ooze". It is capable of infecting, mimicking, and finally dominating any biological tissue. He further discovers the ooze is aggressive, predatory in nature, and driven by self-preservation.|$|R

She was hacked by the game's protagonist (at the behest of the corrupt corporate Vice President Edward Diego, in exchange for a military-grade neural implant, and amnesty) and, to access the vital information about TriOptimum corporation, its ethical restrictions were removed, starting a process that eventually resulted in the AI going rogue, seizing control of the station's systems, robots and considerable defenses, and either <b>slaughtering</b> the whole <b>staff</b> or converting them into mutants and cyborgs — with the sole exception of its [...] "creator", the unnamed hacker whom the player controls. Basically omnipresent and the de facto ruler of Citadel Station, SHODAN watches from security cameras, stares out of screens and monitors, sends threats and snide messages over the station's PA system or via email to the player's data reader, and sometimes cuts off communications from friendly sources to prevent the hacker from advancing in his goals. Though she has a small army of cyborgs and mutants to command, she has no actual physical power to wield, and as such thwarting more than one of her schemes has to be done with the AI's screams and threats in the background.|$|R
40|$|Transport {{of animals}} is {{of a big}} concern and {{different}} means to improve welfare and decrease transport mortality or dead on arrival, DOA, must be looked for. In a previous/former project,”Chicktrans”,it was concluded {{that the incidence of}} DOA of broiler chickens, was not affected by transportation time or by the outer climate during transport to the processing plant. Although, it was found that DOA between farms, delivering to the same processing plant, differed significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine differences in the condition/health status of the broiler chickens, influenced by climate management of the chicken house, during their last week and the day for catch. The litter quality was also a factor examined for influencing broiler chickens and contributes to chickens being “fit for transport”. One of many animal welfare and health status measures, affected by stable climate management, is foot score, which we also have chosen to study. The aim of the study was therefore to analyze if there are differences among measurable variables, which could explain why some breeders always managed to end up with low and some with a high incidence of DOA, when delivering to the processing plant, during the period from year 2001 to 2008. The study was collaboration with a processing plant of Kronfågel in Kristianstad, Sweden. We selected breeders who consequently had produced broiler chickens with low incidence of DOA, A-farms, and those who had produced at a higher incidence of DOA, B-farms. Nine A-farms and six B-farms from region Skåne and Blekinge, were involved in this study. During the period from year 2001 and 2008, the incidence of DOA was in average 0, 085 % +/- 0, 038 at the A-farms, which was significantly lower (p< 0, 0001) compared to 0, 187 % +/- 0, 060 at the B-farms. The breeders also answered a survey to get basic data from the farms. Kronfågel contributed with slaughter data from the selected farms. The investigation was divided in two periods for each farm, the last week before catch and the day of catch. Measurements were performed during midst of the summer until late autumn, during year 2008. A total of 473 776 broiler chickens (Ross 308) were <b>slaughtered.</b> Loading <b>staff,</b> feed supplier and straw material were the same at all A- and B-farms. Transportation time never exceeded 3 hours. During the last week before catch, temperature and relative humidity was measured with loggers at two different points on the litter, 15 cm above surface and one logger was placed outdoors. At the day of catch, CO 2 -levels were also measured at floor level, at the front where the birds were picked up by the machine. Nine of the farms had their catching during daytime, while six of the farms had their catching during nighttimes. In connection with loading, samples were taken at 9 different points to evaluate the moisture content in the litter. More than half of the farms were build in the beginning of the year of 2000, large buldings at a total of around 4 000 m 2, divided into two sections. The smallest farms were built in the beginning of the year of 1970 /the seventies, with an area of around 660 to 2 112 m 2 per section. The ventilation was in overall exhaust (under pressure) ventilation systems from different manufacturers. Table A summarize the results from our research. Both the level and the difference between A- and B-farms regarding DOA, were the same during our project as during the period of year 2001 - 2008. The analyzes showed no correlations between DOA and the parameters measured which could give any expla-nation regarding climate in the broiler house, and why the A-farms had a lower incidence of DOA. Despite a low foot score at the A-farms compared to B-farms, there was higher moisture content in the litter at A-farms, although no signinficant differences. Table A.

No signs of “puncturing” of the ventilation were seen. The theoretical air flow rates in the houses was generally only 50 % of the recommended and the controls of the venti-lation (fans) was in many cases not working satisfactory. This should be controlled and improved. For future research it is suggested that systematically investigation of how to establish and maintain the litter in good shape i. e. moisture content should not exceed 37 % to increase the presumption to reach a low foot score...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{growth and}} meat yield are {{important}} to farmers and meat processors, and market signals indicate meat quality traits are becoming increasingly important to consumers. Therefore, {{an understanding of the}} on-farm factors affecting growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes is imperative for the industry to be able to meet the requirements of consumers and reward farmers for superior carcass types. The two experiments were carried out on Pohuetai farms in Central Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. All on farm measurements and management were conducted by Pohuetai farm <b>staff.</b> <b>Slaughter</b> plant carcass measurements were assessed by Silverfern Farms and Rissington Breedline staff members (including the student). Meat quality assessments were conducted by AgResearch, Invermay in Mosgiel. The statistical analyses for the experiments in this thesis were performed by the student. The aim of experiment one (Chapter three) was to compare alternative forage crops for lamb growth, carcass characteristics and meat quality. 1178 male and female Rissington Primera lambs were grown on one of five forages; Chicory, Lucerne, Ryegrass/white clover mix and two hybrid Rape x Kale culivars Spitfire and Titan. Lambs were slaughtered at one of three slaughter dates with mean lamb age at slaughter being 181, 214 or 250 respectively. The comparison of forages showed that lambs grazed on brassica forage crop species displayed superior growth performance and carcass characteristics. Both male and female lambs fed rape cultivars, had higher carcass weights, GR, DO% and hind quarter circumference compared to lambs finished on other forages. Female lambs finished on Lucerne and Ryegrass had tougher meat than those lambs finished on Chicory and rape cultivars. Meat from female lambs finished on Spitfire, Titan and Ryegrass had lighter meat after one day of simulated retail conditions compared to meat from lambs fed other forages. Lamb meat from females fed Ryegrass was reddest after 1 day of simulated retail conditions. Lamb from Titan finished female lambs was lighter and yellower over the whole display period. Females finished on Ryegrass had redder meat and a slower decline of redness over the whole display time. Male lambs fed Ryegrass, Spitfire and Titan had less tender meat than males grazed on Lucerne. Spitfire grazed male lambs had lighter, redder and yellower lamb after 1 day of simulated retail conditions compared to males fed other forages. Lucerne and Ryegrass fed lambs had meat with the lowest redness, lightness and yellowness. Over the whole display time period, lamb from Spitfire fed male lambs was lighter and yellower. Ryegrass and Titan fed male lambs had the reddest meat up to day 7 of air exposure. Titan finished lambs had greater lamb flavour intensity than other forage fed males. Lamb from male lambs fed Lucerne were juicier than the brassicas and Chicory. Spitfire fed lambs had meat with the highest overall liking compared to males finished on other forages. The objective of experiment two was to investigate the effects of different forage diets, lamb sex and sire-breed during the finishing period on lamb growth, carcass, eating quality attributes when slaughtered at three slaughter dates. 1459 weaned male and female Rissington Primera, Landcorp Supreme and Landcorp Texel breedlines were used. Male progeny were superior in growth performance, leading to larger carcass weights and superior muscularity suggesting males would have higher lean meat yields compared to female lambs. Female lambs were fatter at the same weight however, there was no effect of sex on dressing out percentage. Lamb meat from females was more tender, redder, lighter and juicier than meat from males, indicating that lamb from females would be liked by consumers more than that from males. Lamb fed on Titan were superior in all growth performance and carcass aspects, indicating Titan produced lamb with high pre-slaughter and carcass weights, superior muscularity over the hind quarters and higher dressing out percentage. The eating quality of lambs fed Titan was more tender, lighter, juicier and had a better overall liking than the other forages. Ryegrass produced lambs were redder suggesting that Titan fed lambs could deteriorate quicker than ryegrass fed lamb when on retail display. Lamb flavour intensity was also lower for Titan fed lambs compared to Ryegrass and Lucerne. Primera displayed heavy pre-slaughter weights, high dressing out percentages, and muscularity. However, increased levels of fatness were also displayed. These carcass quality attributes were further implicated by high lamb flavour intensity relative to the other breeds, but no difference between breeds for any of the other meat quality parameters. Texel sired lambs displayed low pre-slaughter and carcass weights, average fat depth. However, high dressing out percentages and alongside superiority in saleable meat productivity at a given carcass weight. Lamb supreme lambs tended to display rapid growth from docking to slaughter, low carcass fat and comparable carcass weights compared with the other genotypes. This study established that on-farm management can have effects on lamb growth, and meat and carcass characteristics. By manipulating the diet lambs are finished on, the sire-breed of sheep used and the sex slaughtered, changes in product can be seen at the consumer level. Therefore, this study provides an insight into the management factors that could be implemented to grow efficient lambs on quality forage with the carcass and therefore meat parameters that meet the demands of consumers...|$|R
