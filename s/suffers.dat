6000|$|... 2. As we {{are said}} to do by Christ, so we {{are said to}} <b>suffer</b> by him, to <b>suffer</b> with him. 'I am crucified with Christ,' said Paul. And again, 'Forasmuch then as Christ hath <b>suffered</b> for us in the flesh, arm yourselves {{likewise}} with the same mind; for he that hath <b>suffered</b> in the flesh hath ceased from sin' (1 Peter 4:1). Mark how the apostle seems to change the person. First he says, it is Christ that suffered; and that is true; but then he insinuates that it is us that <b>suffered,</b> for the exhortation is to believers, to 'walk in newness of life' (Rom 6:4). And the argument is, because they have <b>suffered</b> in the flesh, 'For he that hath <b>suffered</b> in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God' (1 Peter 4:1,2). We then <b>suffered,</b> when Christ suffered; we then <b>suffered</b> in his flesh, and also our 'old man was crucified with him' (Rom 6:6); that is, in his crucifixion; for when he hanged on the cross, all the elect hanged there in their common flesh which he assumed, and because he <b>suffered</b> there as a public man.|$|R

40|$|Number of {{patients}} with hypertension have increased from year to year. This is due to an unhealthy lifestyle, excessive stress and so forth. Patiens with hypertension are often unaware of the dangers that {{can be caused by}} disease. The medical diagnosis of hypertension is made when obtained blood pressure is obtained more than 140 / 90 mmHg. In this study, created a system of enforcement of hypertension using sugeno fuzzy logic. This application uses the parameters of age, body mass index, blod pressure(systole and diastole), family history (genetics), diabetes mellitus.
