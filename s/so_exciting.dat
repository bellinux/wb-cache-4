5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

500|$|Avnet and Conran {{spent two}} years working on the screenplay, which {{included}} numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently {{with a lot of}} his own money. The producer realized that [...] "the very thing that made this film potentially <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> for me, and I think for an audience, which was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's <b>so</b> <b>exciting.</b> As you get older, you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|Steve Polak of the Australian The Daily Telegraph, {{who enjoyed}} the first Max Payne game, also praised Max Payne 2, calling it an [...] "outstanding" [...] game that [...] "keeps alive {{the sense of}} {{atmosphere}} and engaging gunplay-oriented action that was <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> in the first release." [...] He lauded the game for better production values compared to the first game, including its more polished story, more professional scripts, and better acting and graphics. The complexity of Max's character was a welcomed element by Polak, who found that games often created heroes that were simplistic. The Sydney Morning Heralds Dan Toose described the game's experience as [...] "brutal, yet beautiful gun-blazing gaming".|$|E

500|$|Cited {{by many as}} one of {{the best}} {{amusement}} rides in the world, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man has been well received. Howard Shapiro of The Philadelphia Inquirer stated the ride was [...] "bound to become one of the all-time attractions of theme parks anywhere". He described the climax of the ride the [...] "most amazing effect". Bill Dean of The Ledger described the ride as the [...] "most impressive" [...] attraction at Islands of Adventure. Guests interviewed by Dean praised the ride with comments including [...] "I loved it", [...] "I think this is better [...] because of the 3-D effects", and [...] "it was <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> and everything was happening all at once, so it was really, really good". Fred Mawer of the Daily Mail described the rides at Islands of Adventure [...] "as technologically sophisticated as any in the world" [...] with The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man being [...] "the most extraordinary few minutes".|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{a member}} of Slipknot since 1999, it was the first album where guitarist Jim Root had been {{significantly}} involved. He had joined them during the later recording stages of Slipknot and subsequently became more involved with this album. During an interview with Guitar magazine in November 2001 he explained, [...] "it was <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> as well as scary {{to be part of this}} whole huge process", adding that there was a lot of pressure from fellow guitarist Mick Thomson to perform well on the record. In an interview with FHM in December 2001, vocalist Corey Taylor revealed that he put himself in specific situations to achieve his performance on the album. While recording vocals for the final song [...] "Iowa" [...] he was completely naked, vomiting all over himself and cutting himself with broken glass. Explaining this, he said, [...] "that's where the best stuff comes from. You've got to break yourself down before you can build something great." [...] While producing the album, Ross Robinson was injured from a dirt bike accident, fracturing his back. He returned to the studio after a day of hospital treatment, reportedly [...] "putting all of his pain into the album", much to the admiration of the band.|$|E
500|$|From the {{available}} fragments of music, both Virtanen and Andrew Mellor of Gramophone detect hints of Tapiola, {{particularly in the}} first of the three extracts. Kilpeläinen points to some of Sibelius's late minor works, in particular the [...] "Five Esquisses" [...] for piano Op. 114 (1929), as providing evidence that in his final compositional years Sibelius was [...] "progressing towards a more abstract idiom: clear, ethereal images little touched by the human passions". Further originality, Kilpeläinen says, is found in the [...] "Surusoitto" [...] music for organ, composed in 1931 for the funeral of Sibelius's friend Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a work that Aino Sibelius admitted might have been based on Eighth Symphony material: [...] "Did the new symphony", asks Kilpeläinen, [...] "thus also represent a modern sound unlike that of his previous style, with bleak, open tones and unresolved dissonances?" [...] After the recording of the fragments, Storgårds could recognise the composer's late style, adding that [...] "the harmonies are so wild and the music <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> that I'd really love to know how he went on with this." [...] Sibelius's only preserved comment on the music itself, as distinct from his occasional progress reports, is a remark to Schnéevoigt in December 1932: [...] "You have no idea how clever it is".|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Chávez's endorsement, Chomsky told The New York Times {{that he would}} be [...] "happy to meet" [...] the Venezuelan President, asserting that he was [...] "quite interested" [...] in what his administration had achieved and thought many of Chávez's views to be [...] "quite constructive". This meeting came about in August 2009, when Chomsky visited the Latin American country. In a press conference to commence the meeting, Chávez made reference to the intellectual's work, remarking [...] "Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival", before comparing Chomsky's thesis with the concept of [...] "Socialism or Barbarism" [...] advocated by German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 20th century. Speaking through an interpreter, Chomsky replied that [...] "I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that's easy. What's harder is to create a better world... and what's <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> about at last visiting Venezuela is that I can see how a better world is being created." [...] He went on to Venezolana de Televisión, where he commented on the U.S. government's role in orchestrating the 2009 Honduran coup d'état to overthrow leftist President Manuel Zelaya. He also expressed cautious support for the leftist reforms being implemented by Chávez's administration, remarking his opinion that their moves [...] "toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out".|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E

[...] "It came {{as something of a}} shock then that here were five politically astute black men calling themselves niggers and their women bitches at a time when Afrocentric rap was the current vogue... Straight Outta Compton sounded <b>so</b> <b>exciting,</b> insignificant details such as realism and integrity could be overlooked." ...|$|E

En route to the Philippines in 1941 when the Japanese launched their invasion, the unit was ordered back to Orlando, Florida, to train personnel for defense wings.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the Tang artists {{outlined}} {{figures with}} fine black lines and used brilliant color and elaborate detail. [...] However, one Tang artist, the master Wu Daozi, used only black ink and freely painted brushstrokes to create ink paintings that were <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> that crowds gathered {{to watch him}} work. [...] From his time on, ink paintings were no longer thought to be preliminary sketches or outlines to be filled in with color. [...] Instead, they were valued as finished works of art.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, as jazz music {{developed}} and grew in complexity, scat singing did as well. During the bop era, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity. Annie Ross, a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: [...] "The [...] music was <b>so</b> <b>exciting,</b> {{everyone wanted to}} do it." [...] And many did: Ella Fitzgerald, Eddie Jefferson, Betty Carter, Anita O'Day, Joe Carroll, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, Jon Hendricks, Babs Gonzales, and Dizzy Gillespie were all singers in the idiom. Fitzgerald once hailed herself as the [...] "best vocal improviser jazz has ever had", and critics since then have been in almost universal agreement with her.|$|E

Ward, and others. Jones said, [...] "It's <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> and flattering and fun when I get asked to sing with somebody that I admire.... It takes {{you a little bit}} out of your comfort zone when you're doing something with another artist. You don't know what to expect—it's kind of like being a little kid and having a playdate."

[...] When Hellzapoppin' was shown at the KTH student theatre, they were in awe by the dancing in the film. [...] The speed, acrobatics, and skill of the dancers was like nothing they had ever seen before. [...] They started discussing a trip to New York City {{to find someone who}} could teach them how to dance the same way.|$|E
2500|$|Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock, a {{wonderful}} shock. You just got shivers {{up and down}} the spine.

I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of [...] "fatness" [...] of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh <b>so</b> <b>exciting.</b> It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.|$|E
