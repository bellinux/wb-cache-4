25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% <b>solid</b> <b>content.</b> Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E

A low-clay {{translucent}} whiteware {{has been}} formulated and the {{studies have been}} carried out to establish the necessary conditions required for different whiteware manufacturing processes, such as slip casting.

The slips containing 88 wt % nonplastic prefired materials and 12 wt % clay mixtures were prepared and the effects of type and amount of various commercial deflocculants and <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> on the casting behaviour were investigated.

40|$|The fibrous {{network of}} {{cardboard}} samples was studied {{with the aid}} of tomographic imaging. For analysing the samples a method of determing the number of contacts between fibres in a planar fibrous network was introduced. The model is {{based on the fact that}} deposited paper-like structures tend to have predominantly planar fibre orientation. With this assumption an expression of the mean segment length was derived in terms of the average shortest path along fibres through the sample in the out-of-plane direction. The density profiles of cardboard samples were analysed by determing four quantitative features, the <b>solids</b> <b>content,</b> standard deviation of the <b>solids</b> <b>content,</b> slope and curvature. All the samples had a slope in the same direction, i. e., they were denser at the bottom surfaces. Densification seems to occur at both surfaces, as the curvature was larger for samples with higher <b>solids</b> <b>content.</b> Our measurements indicate that contact densities of the cardboards, i. e., the number of fibre-fibre contacts per unit volume are proportional to the square of the <b>solids</b> <b>content.</b> This is in agreement with earlier models for three-dimensional fibre networks...|$|R

40|$|Surface sizing at high at <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> from 8 % to 30 % yields up to 75 % {{savings in}} afterdrying capacity. Decreasing the wetting {{of the sheet}} will also {{increase}} paper machine efficiency by {{reducing the number of}} web breaks. Also, the same afterdrying capacity can be used for both MSP coating and surface sizing at size <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> of 20 %- 30 %. Surface sizing <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> of up to 30 % have not been used due to the insufficient stability of starch at elevated <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> and maintaining the binding power of the starch. Also the ability to maintain the amount of starch at the MSP application at very high <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> has been lacking. Here, both the chemistry of the starch solutions and the application technology used needed to be developed in order to produce the desired applied starch amount at starch <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> of up to 30 % with desired binding properties. The features of the base paper also needed to be adjusted to fit the features of high solids surface sizing. The findings of this study prove {{that it is possible to}} use a wide variety of starch viscosities and molecular weights even at increased <b>solids</b> <b>contents.</b> Increasing starch <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> with more stable starches is therefore not restricted to highly degraded starches only with their lower binding power. When the <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> of the starch solution is increased from 8 % to 30 %, less starch penetrates into the sheet and more starch remains on the paper surface. The concentration of starch on the surface of paper decreases sheet porosity, oil absorption and internal strength, as well as increases its surface strength and bending stiffness. At very high <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> internal strength behavior also suggests that starch may locally penetrate into the larger sheet pores. This observation is supported by pore size distribution analysis. The base paper for high solids surface sizing can also be optimized by adjusting the press to dryer web draw. Here, the aim could be to minimize the press draw below 2 % when internal strength or air permeability are critical. A method for obtaining more informative starch distribution curves was developed to provide a helpful tool in characterizing the effect of various process parameters on the z-distribution of starch in the sheet. An additional feature of this method is the definition of a dimensionless penetration number Qtot that can be used to quantitatively compare the penetration of surface sizing starch in different paper samples. A novel interpretation is presented of the role of surface sizing starch with respect to the elastic modulus and bending stiffness properties of the sheet. When increasing the elastic modulus or bending stiffness of the sheet, starch may merely promote shrinkage potential instead, which leads – when shrinkage is not allowed – to increased drying stress that, in turn, leads to an increase in the elastic modulus of the sheet and a further increase in bending stiffness. reviewe...|$|R
