5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (<b>stack</b> <b>effect)</b> creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the <b>stack</b> <b>effect</b> has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{accurate}} and efficient <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> macro-model for leakage power in sub- 100 nm circuits {{is presented in}} this paper. Leakage power, including subthreshold leakage power and gate leakage power, is becoming more significant compared to dynamic power when technology scaling down below 100 nm. Consequently, fast and accurate leakage power estimation models, which are strongly dependent on precise modeling of the <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> on subthreshold leakage and gate leakage, are vital for evaluating optimizations. In this work, making use of the interactions between subthreshold leakage and gate leakage, we focus our attention on analyzing the <b>effects</b> of transistor <b>stacking</b> on gate leakage between the channel and the gate and that between the drain/source and the gate. The contribution of the latter has been largely ignored in prior work, while our work shows {{that it is an}} important factor. Based on the <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> analysis, we have proposed a new best input vector to reduce the total leakage power; and an efficient and accurate leakage power estimation macro-model which achieves a mean error of 3. 1 % when compared to HSPICE.

40|$|Parallel {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis of}} the coaxial <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> of two bases localized in one strand of DNA duplexes has been performed. Oligonucleotides were immobilized {{in an array of}} three-dimensional polyacrylamide gel pads of microchips (MAGIChips‘). The <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> was studied for all combinations of two bases and assessed by measuring the increase in melting temperature and in the free energy of duplexes formed by 5 mers stacked to microchip-immobilized 10 mers. For any given interface, the effect was studied for perfectly paired bases, as well as terminal mismatches, single base overlaps, single and double gaps, and modified terminal bases. Thermodynamic parameters of contiguous stacking determined by using microchips closely correlated with data obtained in solution. The extension of immobilized oligonucleotides with 5, 6 -dihydroxyuridine, a urea derivative of deoxyribose, or by phosphate, decreased the <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> moderately, while extension with FITC or Texas Red virtually eliminated stacking. The extension of the immobilized oligonucleotides with either acridine or 5 -nitroindole increased stacking to mispaired bases and in some GC-rich interfaces. The measurements of stacking parameters were performed in different melting buffers. Although melting temperatures of AT- and GC-rich oligonucleotides in 5 M tetramethylammonium chloride were equalized, the energy of stacking interaction was significantly diminished...|$|R
25|$|The {{height of}} a chimney {{influences}} its ability to transfer flue gases to the external environment via <b>stack</b> <b>effect.</b> Additionally, the dispersion of pollutants at higher altitudes can reduce {{their impact on the}} immediate surroundings. In the case of chemically aggressive output, a sufficiently tall chimney can allow for partial or complete self-neutralization of airborne chemicals before they reach ground level. The dispersion of pollutants over a greater area can reduce their concentrations and facilitate compliance with regulatory limits.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Stack</b> <b>effect</b> or {{chimney effect}} is the {{movement}} of air {{into and out of}} buildings, chimneys, flue gas stacks, or other containers due to buoyancy. Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences. The greater the thermal difference and the height of the structure, the greater the buoyancy force, and thus the <b>stack</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>stack</b> <b>effect</b> helps drive natural ventilation and infiltration. Some cooling towers operate on this principle; similarly the solar updraft tower is a proposed device to generate electricity based on the <b>stack</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} better {{illustrate}} the <b>stacking</b> <b>effect,</b> for example, according to Fig.  6 e, f, the absorption of the last band (about 6.5  Thz later) is mainly dominated by the fourth layer of graphene (from bottom to top). So, we tune the voltage of this layer of graphene. As shown in Fig.  7, {{with the increase of}} the Fermi energy of the fourth layer of graphene, the absorption amplitude of the band after about 6.5  Thz gradually increases, but there is almost no change in the band before 6.5  Thz. Similarly, we can also independently adjust a certain band mainly affected by other layers of graphene. All bands which can be adjusted independently for high absorption are superimposed to form a broadband absorption eventually. As with the analysis of Fig.  7, the phenomenon of independent adjustment further illustrates that the <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> of all layers of graphene achieves a near-perfect broadband absorption.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new domino circuit is proposed, {{which has}} a lower leakage and higher noise {{immunity}} without dramatic speed degradation for wide fan-in gates. In this domino circuit a chain of evaluation network uses well known <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> technique to reduce the leakage. The <b>stacking</b> <b>effect</b> and current mirror makes the circuit more noise immune and considerably improves the Power Delay Product (PDP) {{as compared to the}} other existing domino logic. The leakage current is also decreased by exploiting the footer transistor in diode configuration, which results in increased noise immunity. DCLCR domino circuit reduces the leakage power consumption by maintaining the same level of delay. By connecting the gate of the transistor M K 1 to its drain power is reduced up to 14 % as compare to standard footless domino and 24 %.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{implementation}} of a library of multi-zone airflow models in Modelica and a comparative model validation with CONTAM. Our models have a similar level of detail as the models in CONTAM and COMIS. The multizone airflow models allow model-ing the flow between rooms through doors, staircases or construction cracks. The flow can be caused by buoyancy <b>effects,</b> such as <b>stack</b> <b>effects</b> in high rise buildings or air temperature imbalance between ad-joining rooms, by flow imbalance of a ventilation sys-tem, or by wind pressure on the building envelope. The here presented library can be used with a Mod-elica library for thermal building and HVAC system simulation to compute interzonal air flow rates. The combined use facilitates the integrated design of build-ing systems, which is typically required for analyzing the interaction of room control loops in variable air volume flow systems through open doors, the flow in naturally ventilated buildings and the pressure in ele-vator shafts caused by <b>stack</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a lattice polymer model (random walk), {{in which the}} walk is allowed to visit lattice bonds at most twice. Such a model might have some relevance to describe statistical properties of RNA molecules.

The latter term is expected to mimic the <b>stacking</b> <b>effect,</b> whereas no effect of sequence, that is, of chemical specificity, is taken into account. The phase diagram is worked out exactly on a Bethe lattice, in a grand-canonical formulation.
