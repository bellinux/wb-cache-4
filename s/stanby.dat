Continuing to perform in the radio and theatre, {{she went on to}} create numerous other comedy characters, among them: Cosme, Doña Caterina, Doña Pola, Mingo, the aristocratic Mónica de Picos Pardo Unzué Crostón, Niña Jovita, Pedantina, Sabelotodo and Ursilina (all satires of stereotypically Argentine types, and some male). Her work in the theatre helped make household names of young colleagues of hers such as Zully Moreno, Enrique Pinti, Antonio Gasalla and Juan Carlos Altavista, as well making successes of theatre pieces such as Coqueluche (with Thelma Biral) and a 1972 monologue, Y se nos fue redepente (Left Suddenly).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{pemetrexed}} disodium (Alimta), LY 231514) is {{the first}} antifolate able to inhibit {{at the same time}} the synthesis of purins and pyrimidins. Many therapeutic tests were carried out in clinical situations where the methotrexate and the fluorouracil had been the proof of their effectiveness. It then showed an interesting activity in a great number of tumours but with very different profiles of tolerance according to the studies and pathologies. The explanation will come in 2001 by the description from the relation between the vitamin deficiencies among treated patients and occurred from toxicities. The two randomized studies carried out in the malignant pleural mesothelioma and the non small cell lung cancer made it possible to establish its utility and to record the pemetrexed in these clinical situations. Others axes of development remain possible, but the results are <b>stanby</b> or to confirm as in squamous-cell cancer in the head and neck and breast, digestive or urinary tracts cancer. In all the cases, the optimization of the pemetrexed in terms of amount/methods of administration and associations possible because of its profile of tolerance makes of it a molecule of chemotherapy with a future...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this diploma thesis is a project of a {{building}} for handicapped people. This building is set into the historic center of the urban conservation area in Lipník nad Bečvou. The site for the building has a rectangular plan in view and is situated {{on the edge of}} the southern row of houses on the T. G. M. square and the western row of houses of Křížkovského street. The conditions for the building of the house in a view of the conservation care: - the house has maximally two floors - the plan in view must respect the street line - the roof must be inclined - wooden windows and doors - lime plaster The mass solution is based on the concept of the ending of both present street faces, whose heights are very different. The part of the building which faces towards the square, fulfils the condition of two floors building and thus in the long distance view from the square it does not eclipse the skyline of the bell tower and St. Jacob´s church. The higher part of the house follows the currently standing house in Křížkovský street, it makes a second plan impression and it does not disturb the long distance view. The southern orientation of the taller part contributes to a good sunlit of the inner space and the taller height enables a better use of the building plot. Both masses are connected by a part with the eastern orientation which is sunk in the view of the base line and so it enables to make he space for placing the ramp and two <b>stanby</b> parking places. The building is partly two-floored and partly four-floored with one floor in the underground. In the grand floor there is placed six parking places, technical background and storage rooms. The vertical transport is provided by both personal and freight lifts, the inner staircase a set forth ramp and one direction ramp for cars, which is controlled by trafic lights. In the first floor there are: 2 commercially useful spaces with backgrounds, a freight ramp for materials and workshop products transport and a waste storage. In the second floor there are a workshop with backgrounds (office, storage room, daily room, cloakroom and bathroom) and a flat (103 m 2). In the third floor there are two flats (79 m 2) and (49 m 2). In the fourth floor there is a flat (79 m 2). The construction of the house is monolytic, made of steel and concrete. It is made of basal belts, footing, peripheral supporting walls, bearers and ceiling boards. The dividing walls are concrete. The concrete construction is like a view from the inner space and from the other space. It is warmed with mineral fiberglass, which is covered with a retaining hydroisolation and cement facing with a lime plaster. This everything is hung on an aluminium profiles grid. In the ground floor, the fillings of the slots are aluminium eloxed in an anthracite grey colour. In the other floors They are made of wood with a wooden facing. The roof construction is made of a wooden bond which is put on a steel and concrete construction. The roof case is ventilated and there are aluminium eloxed folded templates...|$|E
