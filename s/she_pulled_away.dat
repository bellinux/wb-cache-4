5|$|With Ceylon {{no longer}} engaged, Duperré pulled ahead to engage Astell {{but found that}} Stewart had brought his {{battered}} Windham between the French frigate and the third East Indiaman. In the growing darkness, Stewart attempted to hail Astell to propose boarding Bellone together, but the remaining officers either ignored or did not hear the suggestion as Astell extinguished all her lights and made all sail to escape the action, receiving a final broadside from Bellone as <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>away.</b> Alone, Stewart continued to engage the French ships to enable Astell to make her escape. At 19:20 the repaired Minerve returned and took possession of Ceylon, and at 19:45 Stewart surrendered {{for the second time}} in less than a year: his ship badly damaged and casualties mounting among his crew and passengers.|$|E
25|$|On 28 (or 20) May Lieutenant James Robertson (Acting), {{took two}} of Fawns boats on a cutting out {{expedition}} to capture Spanish privateer schooner and three merchant vessels anchored {{under the protection}} of two batteries at the NE end of Porto Rico. The crew of the schooner ran her ashore and abandoned her. To get her off Robertson had to nail sheet lead over holes in her bows. As <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> he had the prize crew fire her guns at the privateersmen who were firing small arms from the shore. Suddenly the magazine on the prize exploded, throwing all but Robertson and two seamen into the water. The explosion killed one man, and injured four others. Still, that evening Robertson was able to rejoin Fawn with the schooner and the three merchant vessels. Unfortunately a squall the next day sank the captured schooner, killing five men.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>away</b> because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5000|$|Coster-Waldau said, [...] "If {{you look}} closer {{there are those}} moments where she—well, I haven't seen the {{finished}} edit, of course—but we tried to have it where she goes into it then <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>away,</b> <b>she</b> goes in then <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>away,</b> {{but of course he}} is forcing himself."

60|$|Whenever a {{steamboat}} would land, this abominable mob {{had to be}} kept off {{her with}} bayonets; when <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>away,</b> they sprang on her and were pushed by scores into the water, where they were suffered to drown one another in their own way.
