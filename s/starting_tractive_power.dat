50|$|<b>Starting</b> <b>{{tractive}}</b> effort: <b>Starting</b> <b>tractive</b> {{effort is}} the tractive force {{that can be}} generated at a standstill. This figure is important on railways because it determines the maximum train weight that a locomotive can set into motion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{existing}} {{diesel-electric locomotives}} offer a <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of [...] for EMD F40PH-2 and [...] for MPI M36PH-3C; in comparison, the six-car KISS EMU has a <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of , meaning {{the acceleration of}} the EMU should be substantially better than current trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} {{diesel-electric locomotives}} offer a <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 65000 lbf kN for EMD F40PH-2 and 85000 lbf kN for MPI M36PH-3C; in comparison, the six-car KISS EMU has a <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 121400 lbf kN, meaning {{the acceleration of}} the EMU should be substantially better than current trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{three main}} {{categories}} of locomotives are often subdivided in their usage in rail transport operations. There are passenger locomotives, freight locomotives and switcher (or shunting) locomotives. These categories determine the locomotive's combination of physical size, <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort and maximum permitted speed. Freight locomotives are normally designed to deliver high <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort—needed to <b>start</b> trains that may weigh {{as much as}} 15,000 LT—and deliver sustained high power, at the sacrifice of maximum speed. Passenger locomotives develop less <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort but are able to operate at the high speeds demanded by passenger schedules. Mixed traffic locomotives (US English: general purpose or road switcher locomotives) are built to provide elements of both requirements. They do not develop as much <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort as a freight unit but are able to haul heavier trains than a passenger engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were also}} used on large passenger trains, when their high <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> was advantageous.|$|R
5000|$|The letter {{represents}} {{the power of}} the locomotive, and is approximately proportional to the <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort, thus: ...|$|R
5000|$|Factor of adhesion, {{which is}} simply the weight on the locomotive's driving wheels divided by the <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort ...|$|R
50|$|K5 #5698 used {{conventional}} Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and piston valves, {{and developed a}} <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 54675 lbf kN.|$|R
50|$|The {{mass was}} 60 t and <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort 192 kN. The {{locomotive}} used a 12V180ZL engine and SF2010 transmission.|$|R
50|$|For an {{electric}} locomotive or a diesel-electric locomotive, <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort {{can be calculated}} from the amount of weight on the driving wheels (which may be less than the total locomotive weight in some cases), combined stall torque of the traction motors, the gear ratio between the traction motors and axles, and driving wheel diameter. For a diesel-hydraulic locomotive, the <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort {{is affected by the}} stall torque of the torque converter, as well as gearing, wheel diameter and locomotive weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} is ballasted to a 25 t {{axle load}} - a reduction to 23 t axle load with reduced <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort is optional.|$|R
50|$|A subtype PH37Aci {{has been}} {{designed}} to be built to fit within the UIC 505-1 vehicle gauge. Unlike the original version built for the UK loading gauge the design has a full width body. There are two versions of the design, one with a 20 t axle load and 450 kN <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort intended for European railways, and a 21 t axleload version with more powerful traction motors and <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 544 kN. The versions have axleload class L620 and L621 as defined by European Standard EN 15528 (2008).|$|R
50|$|The E6ACT/E6ACU {{locomotive}} has {{a continuous}} power of 5,004 MW and a <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 375 kN, maing it {{able to pull}} 4,000 tonnes of cargo - or 4,500 with Max Load option.|$|R
50|$|The <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> {{effort is}} 132 kN - {{remarkable}} {{for such a}} small locomotive. The Sifa safety system was fitted but not Indusi because of the slow speeds the trains used on the branch lines.|$|R
50|$|They {{were not}} very powerful—they had a power output of , a <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 191 kN, a maximum speed of 80 km/h, and a weight of 52 t. They were given the fleet numbers 21904-21923.|$|R
30|$|No {{need for}} the use of the {{traditional}} <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> supply system could avoid the deleterious consequences from the faults of pantograph-contact line and the traction system, thus improving the reliability in operational safety of the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|The winning driver Rhys Millen {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the vehicle had lost half its <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> (due to heat) from around the halfway point. Based on testing the team had expected a run 30 seconds faster.|$|R
5000|$|Noise : A {{single source}} of <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> (i.e., motors in one place), is quieter than {{multiple}} operational power units, where {{one or more}} motors are located under every carriage. The noise problem is particularly noticeable in diesel multiple units.|$|R
50|$|<b>Starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort {{calculated}} in {{the usual}} way (85% mean effective pressure) comes out 76,400 lbf kN, but the engine used 70% limited cutoff (presumably to increase port openings at short cutoff) so the railroad claimed a correspondingly lower tractive effort.|$|R
50|$|After delivery, these {{vehicles}} were nearly exclusively used in local traffic within the Großraums Hannover transport association. They were mostly {{used on the}} railway lines of the then-future StadtExpress and today's S-Bahn network; Class 141 locomotives were commonly used as <b>tractive</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{locomotive}} prototype {{consists of}} four built-in subsystems: the PEMFC power plant, cooling subsystem, hydrogen storage subsystem, and <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> supply subsystem. Each of the four subsystems was independently tested, and then tested as an integrated system, before being finally installed in the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Depending on subseries, 1xx, 2xx or 3xx, {{some members}} of this class can drive with maximum speed 100 km/h, 120 km/h, 140 km/h, or 160 km/h (latest series), {{depending}} on the gearing. The most common gearings are for 120 km/h (classes 0xx, 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 8xx) intended for freight and passenger trains, and 140 km/h (classes 6xx and 7xx) intended for passenger services, with locos for 160 km/h being rare and locos for 100 km/h all converted for 120 km/h. The models with higher maximum speed got less <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> and are used for passenger or light freight trains only, whereas the models with lower maximum speed got high <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> and are thus able to pull heavy freight trains as well.|$|R
50|$|Maximum {{tractive}} effort: Maximum {{tractive effort}} {{is defined as}} the highest tractive force that can be generated under any condition that is not injurious to the vehicle or machine. In most cases, maximum tractive effort is developed at low speed and may be the same as the <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{switcher}} is optimised for its job, being relatively low-powered {{but with}} a high <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. Switchers are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats.|$|R
50|$|To date, the Class 150's <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> {{effort of}} 450 kN remains unparalleled on German rails—in {{fact it was}} very close to the {{breaking}} force of the chain couplings used {{at the time of its}} production. Some engines were therefore fitted with automatic coupling (type unicupler AK69e) to haul heavy ore-trains.|$|R
2500|$|The NSB Di 8 is a {{class of}} {{diesel-electric}} locomotives built by Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK), while {{it was part of}} Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik, for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB).

50|$|The Sequel's fuel-cell stack has a {{rated power}} output of 73 kW (98 hp), {{supplemented}} by a lithium-ion battery pack rated at 65 kW. One 65 kW electric motor drives the front wheels and individual 25 kW wheel-motors (outboard of the rear brakes) drive each rear wheel, providing total <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> of 115 kW.|$|R
50|$|The Midland Railway {{introduced}} {{a system of}} locomotive classification based on the power output represented by a locomotive's tractive effort at 50 mph (passenger locomotives) or 25 mph (goods locomotives). This is the continuous tractive effort and is {{much lower than the}} <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort which is the figure usually quoted in technical publications.|$|R
5000|$|It has a [...] MTU-Detroit Diesel 12V4000 Engine. It weighs {{approximately}} 277,000 lb and is 59 ft 2 in long. It has {{a maximum}} speed of 70 mph.

50|$|The Abeille Bourbon is a {{high seas}} {{emergency}} tow vessel (salvage tug), 80 metres long with a <b>tractive</b> <b>power</b> of 200 t-f MN, a crew of 12, designed by Norwegian naval architect Sigmund Borgundvåg. She was christened by Bernadette Chirac on 13 April 2005 {{in the presence of}} sponsor Jacques de Chateauvieux. She is based in Brest, France.|$|R
50|$|Its 105 lt 13 lcwt kg {{adhesive}} weight and the SAR's ultra-conservative practice of reporting a Mallet's tractive effort at only 50% of boiler pressure {{resulted in a}} much lower than actual <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort of 48370 lbf kN. The Class MH was almost certainly capable of exerting more than 60000 lbf kN <b>tractive</b> effort at <b>starting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{was to be}} mechanical, via a two-speed gearbox, {{giving a}} high speed for passenger working and a lower speed for freight. The tractive effort figures, quoted above, look suspiciously high for the specified speeds. It seems {{more likely that the}} figures quoted are for <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort and maximum speed in high gear and low gear respectively.|$|R
5000|$|A narrow gauge, [...] to , six axle Co'Co' {{design has}} also been proposed. The {{locomotive}} weight would be 96 tons with an engine power of [...] at 1800 rpm, depending on engine installed (either 12 or 16 cylinder engines, either CAT, Cummins or MTU designs). Top speed would be 120 km/h and <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort 320 kN.|$|R
50|$|Swiss company BLS {{operates}} 18 similar locomotives, designated Re 465. These locomotives have efficiency modifications {{and individual}} axle control rather than individual bogie control {{which allows for}} slightly higher <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> effort, but are otherwise identical to the Re 460. Numbered 001-018, all are named. These locomotives are used for both passenger and freight duties by BLS.|$|R
