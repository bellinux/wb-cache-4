The new show, titled <b>Ditch</b> <b>Diggers,</b> focusses on the professional and business side of writing and {{is intended to be}} honest to the point of brutality, in contrast to the more optimistic and uplifting tone of I Should Be Writing. It was a Hugo Award finalist for Best Fancast in 2017.|$|R

25|$|Because of {{the great}} {{economic}} potential for Los Angeles, the demand for Indian labor grew rapidly. Yaanga began attracting Indians from the islands and {{as far away as}} San Diego and San Luis Obispo. The village began to look like a refugee camp. Unlike the missions, the pobladores paid Indians for their labor. In exchange for their work as farm workers, vaqueros, <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers,</b> water haulers, and domestic help; they were paid in clothing and other goods as well as cash and alcohol. The pobladores bartered with them for prized sea-otter and seal pelts, sieves, trays, baskets, mats, and other woven goods. This commerce greatly contributed to the economic success of the town and the attraction of other Indians to the city.|$|R
50|$|The Aum group {{traveled}} with chemicals and mining equipment {{on which they}} paid over $20,000 in excess baggage fees. According to the Australian Federal Police report, among the baggage was a mechanical <b>ditch</b> <b>digger,</b> picks, petrol generators, gas masks, respirators, and shovels. A Customs duty of over $15,000 was paid to import these items. Because of {{the large amount of}} excess baggage being brought in by the group, Australian Customs searched the entire group. This search revealed four liters of concentrated hydrochloric acid, including some in containers marked as hand soap. Among the other chemicals that Australian customs officials found were ammonium chloride, sodium sulphate, perchloric acid, and ammonium water. All of the chemicals and some of the laboratory equipment were seized by Australian authorities.|$|R

A new storm - Rose - is on the horizon, and Virgil is {{planning}} to evacuate New Orleans forever. He begs Trey to go with him, but Trey - now a scientist - {{is in the middle}} of an exciting - and secretive - longevity project at Wolfinger Biomed, one of many companies owned by local carpetbagger Simon Wolfinger.

5|$|Louche: The louche (耬車) was {{a mobile}} animal-drawn {{agricultural}} seed drill invented by the Chinese agronomist Zhao Guo, a Han official {{in charge of}} agricultural production {{during the reign of}} Han Wudi in the Han dynasty. According to the records of Political Commentator by the Eastern Han dynasty writer Cui Shi, the Louche consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers</b> under it used for sowing. The Louche was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the Louche directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. The machine was known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.|$|R
500|$|The investors {{showed little}} {{interest}} in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing {{side of the business}} was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a <b>ditch</b> <b>digger</b> for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing [...] "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery".|$|R
5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, most prominently the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers</b> and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|R
2500|$|Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr. [...] {{was born}} on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a <b>ditch</b> <b>digger,</b> and the former Byrl Veda Page.

2500|$|Tanner {{was born}} in Amarillo, Texas and {{graduated}} from Caprock High School in 1989 where he won the Texas State Championships in wrestling as a junior and senior despite only entering the sport in his sophomore year of high school. Tanner attended Simpson College in Iowa but dropped out when he was 19 because {{he felt that he}} was not receiving a [...] "real world" [...] education that he was searching for. After dropping out, he travelled the country working various jobs as a bouncer, a cable television contractor, a framer building beach houses, a dishwasher, a baker, a <b>ditch</b> <b>digger,</b> and slaughterhouse worker. After a brief one semester stint at the University of Oklahoma he eventually returned to Amarillo and entered a local mixed martial arts tournament. What he thought would be an isolated event served as a springboard to his professional career. In 2008, he relocated to Oceanside, California.|$|R

50|$|Morton's {{first wife}} was Jane Ann Bailey of Blackpool, England, but {{she died in}} {{childbirth}} in 1881. At this time, Morton was subsisting on doing odd jobs such as <b>ditch</b> <b>digger</b> and milk roundsman. He placed his daughter in a Roman Catholic convent in New Westminster and his son with a private family. However, Jane had owned a tea merchant's business in Blackpool, England, with her brother James. Morton was able to claim her entire share of the business, worth about 700 pounds, and {{use the money to}} retain his part in the Brickmaker's Claim and, in 1884, to purchase a large farm at a place called Mission. He married Ruth Mount, set up a brickmaking business in Clayburn, part of the town of Abbotsford, and ran the farm at Mission. It was from here, on 13 June 1886, that his family saw the Great Vancouver Fire burning in the distance.|$|R
5000|$|Fergus meets Burt the <b>ditch</b> <b>digger</b> {{and asks}} him a favor: {{he would ask}} Scrooge to shine his shoes and give him the dime as payment. As Fergus (correctly) believes, Scrooge will be fooled (since American dimes cannot be spent in Scotland) and will keep the dime as a {{reminder}} not to be fooled again. After Fergus and his daughters leave, Magica, who [...] "can't seem to alter history", decides to [...] "twist" [...] it. She makes a deal with Burt: she'll give him two shillings {{in exchange for the}} dime; he keeps one and gives the other one to Scrooge. Burt agrees, but the plan goes awry when Magica accidentally drops the dime, which is found by an honest shoe-shine boy, who delivers a speech about the importance of keeping every single dime and his hopes of earning his own dimes very soon.|$|R
