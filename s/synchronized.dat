Using this characterization we prove that any such automaton possesses a <b>synchronizing</b> word of length at most 3 n- 5. We also prove that checking whether a given DFA A is in FG is co-NP-hard and provide an algorithm for this problem which is exponential {{in the number of}} states A...|$|R

40|$|A <b>synchronizing</b> {{word for}} an {{automaton}} {{is a word}} that brings that automaton into one and the same state, regardless of the starting position. Cerny conjectured in 1964 that if a $n$-state deterministic automaton has a <b>synchronizing</b> word, then it has a <b>synchronizing</b> word of length at most (n- 1) ^ 2. Berlinkov recently made a breakthrough in the probabilistic analysis of synchronization: he proved that, for the uniform distribution on deterministic automata with n states, an automaton admits a <b>synchronizing</b> word with high probability. In this article, we are interested in the typical length of the smallest <b>synchronizing</b> word, when such a word exists: we prove that a random automaton admits a <b>synchronizing</b> word of length O(n log^{ 3 }n) with high probability. As a consequence, this proves that most automata satisfy the Cerny conjecture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A <b>synchronizing</b> of a {{deterministic}} automaton {{is a word}} in {{the alphabet}} of colors (considered as letters) of its edges that maps the automaton to a single state. A coloring of edges of a directed graph is <b>synchronizing</b> if the coloring turns the graph into a deterministic finite automaton possessing a <b>synchronizing</b> word. The road coloring problem is <b>synchronizing</b> coloring of a directed finite strongly connected graph with constant out-degree of all its vertices if the greatest common divisor of lengths of all its cycles is one. The problem was posed by Adler, Goodwin and Weiss over 30 years ago and evoked noticeable interest among the specialists {{in the theory of}} graphs, deterministic automata and symbolic dynamics. After so many people challenge to solve this problem finally, A. N Trahtman could present a positive solution. Therefore we know that we can make a <b>synchronizing</b> coloring for every graph witch has the necessary conditions. In this note we are going to explain a method for appointing a <b>synchronizing</b> coloring and a <b>synchronizing</b> word, in some special cases. ...|$|R
