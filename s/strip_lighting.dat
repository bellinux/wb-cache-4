500|$|The new eastern tunnel, [...] in diameter, was {{accepted}} into the roads programme in March 1959, and construction started in March 1960. It was opened on 2 August 1967 by Desmond Plummer, Leader of the Greater London Council (GLC). It was wider and usable by vehicles up to [...] During construction, transport minister Ernest Marples clarified that unlike the Dartford Tunnel, also then under construction, tolls would not be imposed as the tunnel was already an established route. At the time of opening, the <b>strip</b> <b>lighting</b> in the tunnel was commended as [...] "a big improvement" [...] on the standard provided in the original tunnel. In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no sharp bends, and emergency telephones were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect Terry Farrell. Immediately after opening, the old tunnel was closed for refurbishment. It re-opened on 4 April 1969 with a new electronic system to detect overheight vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|An LED <b>Strip</b> <b>Light</b> (also {{known as}} an LED tape or ribbon light) is a {{flexible}} circuit board populated by surface mounted light-emitting diodes (SMD LEDs) and other components that usually comes with an adhesive backing. Traditionally, <b>strip</b> <b>lights</b> had been used solely in accent lighting, backlighting, task lighting, and decorative lighting applications. Increased luminous efficacy and higher-power SMDs have allowed LED <b>strip</b> <b>lights</b> {{to be used in}} applications such as high brightness task lighting, fluorescent and halogen lighting fixture replacements, indirect lighting applications, Ultra Violet inspection during manufacturing processes, set and costume design, and even growing plants ...|$|R

40|$|The {{appliance}} (1) has a {{light source}} (2, 3) projecting a light beam (5, 6) {{on to the}} surface (8) of the object and a light sensor (4) to detect light scattered from foreign bodies (impurities) on the surface. The light beam is directed as <b>strip</b> <b>light</b> on to the surface. Foreign bodies on the surface cause scattering of the light beam but otherwise the light is subjected to no or only insignificant change. The light sensor is located so that {{at least part of}} the scattered light is detected. The light beam can be directed approximately in parallel to the surface. USE/ADVANTAGE - For detecting irregularities on the surface of silicon wafers. Suitable for wafers with smooth or uneven surfaces as only impurities (foreign bodies) scatter <b>strip</b> <b>light</b> and not uneven surfaces, can be used in series production of wafers...|$|R

50|$|In 1968 the Hawke's Bay Skydiving Club {{was born}} {{based at the}} Hastings Aerodrome, and {{in that same year}} the Hawke's Bay Gliding Club built its hangar base at Hastings Aerodrome. In 1976 full runway <b>strip</b> <b>lighting</b> was {{installed}} for the main runway. Two years later in 1978 the main runway was sealed when New Zealand Aerial Mapping sealed a 1000-metre landing strip to accommodate its new and larger aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Strip {{lights are}} {{designed}} for both indoor and outdoor use depending on whether they’re water resistant. Since the strip is flexible and can be divided at any point between LEDs, it is extremely versatile {{and can be used}} in a number of installations. Outside of traditional lighting, <b>strip</b> <b>lighting</b> is extensively used in DIY projects or lighted clothing. The ability to power strip lights off of a USB device or battery pack makes them extremely portable. Examples include: Computer lighting, costume lights, toys, workspace lighting, monitor and display ambient lighting, and alcove lighting.|$|E

50|$|Uncoated LED tape is not {{considered}} to have any resistance to water ingress, but may be rated as IP20 for some physical ingress resistance. Such tapes are generally low voltage and safe for skin to touch but can be shorted by fine metal objects. Water resistant <b>strip</b> <b>lighting</b> is covered in a heat conducting epoxy or silicone to protect the circuitry from direct contact with water, and can be rated IP65, IP67, or with suitable sealed connections IP68. Both coated and uncoated LED tapes have a two sided adhesive backing to stick to walls, desks, doors, etc.|$|E
50|$|Some of the 56 ft {{cars had}} been {{moderately}} refurbished with fluorescent <b>strip</b> <b>lighting</b> and a newer type of window, but still with bench seats akin to local buses of the time. Refurbishing of carriages for the Picton-Christchurch express meant that by late 1982 {{it was able}} to be operated by more comfortable AC cars. The northbound service left Wellington at 7:45am and reached Gisborne at 6:30pm, the southbound left Gisborne at 9:55am and reached Wellington at 8:40pm. As it lacked a buffet car, stops were made for refreshments in Napier and Palmerston North. Around this time, the train stopped carrying its distinctive headboard.|$|E
