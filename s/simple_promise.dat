25|$|In {{a limited}} number of cases, an {{agreement}} will be unenforceable unless it meets a certain form prescribed by statute. While contracts can be generally made without formality, some transactions are thought to require form either because it makes a person think carefully before they bind themselves to an agreement, or merely that it serves as clear evidence. This goes typically for large engagements, including the sale of land, a lease of property over three years, a consumer credit agreement, and a bill of exchange. A contract for guarantee must also, at some stage, be evidenced in writing. Finally, English law takes the approach that a gratuitous promise, as a matter of contract law, is not legally binding. While a gift that is delivered will transfer property irrevocably, and while someone may always bind themselves to a promise without anything in return to deliver a thing in future if they sign a deed that is witnessed, a <b>simple</b> <b>promise</b> to do something in future can be revoked. This result is reached, with some complexity, through a peculiarity of English law called the doctrine of consideration.|$|E

Promises deliver important ethical value, and commercial promises, because they are our most common experience of promise with strangers, are of special value. But not all commercial promises generate that value equally. This paper makes the following claims: (1) while some retail promises are promises either to deliver a good or service, or to pay some compensation, other retail <b>promises</b> are <b>simple</b> <b>promises</b> to deliver a good or service; (2) retail promises in high-end markets {{are more likely to}} have the simple form, while retail promises in low-end markets are more likely to be conditional; (3) conditional promises that create less certainty and less entitlement are inferior to <b>simple</b> <b>promises</b> to deliver a good or service; and (4) inequality in the quality of retail promise has implications for how members from different social backgrounds relate to others in their political and economic community...|$|R

50|$|The {{articles}} {{that make up}} this law are:1. The State and the Church are independent of each other. The Congress can not enact laws, establishing or prohibiting any religion.2. Marriage is a civil contract. This and other acts of the civil status of persons are the exclusive competence of officials and authorities of civil order, under the terms provided by law, and will have the force and validity that they attribute to them.3. No religious institution can acquire real property or capital taxes on them, with the sole exception established in Article 27 of the Constitution.4. The <b>simple</b> <b>promise</b> to speak truth and to fulfill the obligations that are contracted, will replace the religious oath with its effects and penalties5. No one can be forced to give personal works without the right retribution and without their full consent. The State can not allow any contract, covenant or agreement that has as its object the impairment, loss or irrevocable sacrifice {{of the freedom of}} man, whether due to work, education or religious vote, to be carried out. The law consequently does not recognize monastic Orders, nor can it allow its establishment, whatever the denomination or object with which they wish to be erected.

Promise theory {{defines a}} {{method by which}} static service {{bindings}} are made in a network, but little {{work has been done}} on handling the dynamic case in which bindings must change over time due to both contingencies and changes in policy. We define two new kinds of promises that provide temporal scope for a conditional promise. We show that <b>simple</b> temporally-scoped <b>promises</b> can describe common network behaviors such as leasing and failover, and allow an agent to completely control the sequence of sets of promises to which it commits with another agent, over time. This allows agents to adapt to changing conditions by making short-term bilateral agreements rather than the long-term unilateral agreements provided by previous promise constructions. ...|$|R

By closely inspecting the growth process and the crystallographic analysis of as-synthesized products, conclusive evidence has been provided to show that the growth mechanism of such nanorod-bundles is imperfect oriented attachment. The anisotropic adsorption of polyvinylpyrrolidone at the different surfaces of Sb 2 S 3 nanocrystals assists the one-dimensional preferential growth; it is just the misorientations that result in the nanorod-based superstructures. Moreover, the hydrothermal treatment time plays a crucial role, and can be used as the parameter to control the size and morphology of the bundles.
