40|$|With the {{advancement}} of cloud technologies, {{it is necessary to}} simulate large scale applications on cloud before their real time implementation. Using simulation, we can study the behavior of cloud environment. CLOUDS Laboratory introduced Cloud-Analyst, the Cloud-Sim based tool. It is useful to model and analyze large scale cloud computing development. The simulator uses different algorithms (Service Broker Algorithms, Load balancing algorithms etc) with taking some parameters under consideration as per requirement. Based on all given inputs, it gives the report for that cloud environment. With the help of <b>simulation</b> <b>report,</b> we can modify the cloud environment as per requirement. The service proximity based routing policy selects closest data center to route the user request. When there is the situation to select one data center from those with same region, the policy selects data-center randomly without considering cost-effectiveness. We have proposed the extended service proximity based routing policy. Using proposed policy, we can have the routing of user requests such that we can have cost effective data-center selection.

In this paper, we address issues related to the management of these data and their on-line processing, such as: (i) the instrumentation code is mixed (piggy-backed) in the modeling code; (ii) the amount of data to be stored may be enormous, and often, a significant part of these data are useless while their collect may consume a significant amount of the computing resources; and (iii) it is difficult to have confidence in the treatment applied to the data and then make comparisons between studies since each user (model developer) builds its own ad-hoc instrumentation. In particular, we propose OSIF, a new component-based instrumentation framework designed to solve the above mentioned issues. OSIF is based on several mature software engineering techniques and frameworks, such as COSMOS, Fractal and its ADL, and AOP...|$|E

Two aspects considered {{in that kind of}} measurement: passengers prospective and operators prospective. This thesis tries to combine both in its produced optimisation system. This study was carried out in the Hajj terminal of the King Abdul-Aziz international airport and classified the processing time among the most important measures affecting the users ’ observation of the {{level of service}}. Produced survey has helped to generate performance measure upon passengers prospective. On the other hand a simulation model of the process flow is utilised to formulate driven data model of the terminal process flow operations. The model built on Arena software and correlation study is made from the multiple “what if ” scenarios of the model. Then a linear regression is used to generate a model for each variable. Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used after to carry out better regression model then Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) model found to be more efficient as it is picked and used to generate a best observed prediction. The system is optimised through the generated Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) logic model using both Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). A validation in addition to the testing made in the optimisation system.

40|$|Evaporation {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{important}} unit operations in the industrial sector. As it is also the most energy consuming area in any industry, research and development and improvements is a continuous process over the years. As also one type of evaporator, will be appropriate only for limited applications, there are numerous variations based on the scope of application which is very wide. Variations can be in design, material of construction, size, modularity, process placement, operating mode, arrangements etc. Many literatures and information are available detailing these various types, design and applications. But very few information is available comprehensively explaining the precise use of evaporations in each process with inlet and outlet concentration values. The main objective of this thesis work is, compilation of brief technical information on evaporator application in major processes and calculation of evaporation load to produce specific quantity of the final product in these industries. As sea water desalination {{is one of the}} niche application area for evaporators which is still surviving in spite of fierce competition from other technologies, a brief report is also presented on its market scope.

40|$|Analysts use a {{dynamics}} simulator to {{test the}} attitude control system algorithms used by a satellite. The simulator must simulate the hardware, dynamics, and environment of the particular spacecraft and provide user services which enable the analyst to conduct experiments. Researchers at Goddard's Flight Dynamics Division developed GRODY alongside GROSS (GSC- 13147), a FORTRAN simulator which performs the same functions, in a case study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the Ada programming language for flight dynamics software development. They used popular object-oriented design techniques to link the simulator's design with its function. GRODY is designed for analysts familiar with spacecraft attitude analysis. The program supports maneuver planning as well as analytical testing and evaluation of the attitude determination and control system used on board the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) satellite. GRODY simulates the GRO on-board computer and Control Processor Electronics. The analyst/user sets up and controls the simulation. GRODY allows the analyst to check and update parameter values and ground commands, obtain simulation status displays, interrupt the simulation, analyze previous runs, and obtain printed output of simulation runs. The video terminal screen display allows visibility of command sequences, full-screen display and modification of parameters using input fields, and verification of all input data. Data input available for modification includes alignment and performance parameters for all attitude hardware, simulation control parameters which determine simulation scheduling and simulator output, initial conditions, and on-board computer commands. GRODY generates eight types of output: simulation results data set, analysis report, parameter report, <b>simulation</b> <b>report,</b> status display, plots, diagnostic output (which helps the user trace any problems that have occurred during a simulation), and a permanent log of all runs and errors. The analyst can send results output in graphical or tabular form to a terminal, disk, or hardcopy device, and can choose to have any or all items plotted against time or against each other. Goddard researchers developed GRODY on a VAX 8600 running VMS version 4. 0. For near real time performance, GRODY requires a VAX at least as powerful as a model 8600 running VMS 4. 0 or a later version. To use GRODY, the VAX needs an Ada Compilation System (ACS), Code Management System (CMS), and 1200 K memory. GRODY is written in Ada and FORTRAN...|$|E
