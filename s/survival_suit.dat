2500|$|Crew {{members who}} must {{work on the}} decks of {{commercial}} ships wear a type of dry suit also known as an immersion survival work suit. Single engine aircraft ferry pilots flying between North America and Europe, and helicopter pilots that must fly over the open ocean, must wear a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> in the cockpit, so {{they can continue to}} fly the aircraft, then exit immediately if the aircraft is ditched in cold water after an engine failure. These suits are also used on shore when working on docks, bridges, or other areas where cold water immersion is a safety risk. They are usually a three-part system consisting of: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{inflatable}} <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> is {{a special}} type of <b>survival</b> <b>suit,</b> recently developed, which is similar in construction to an inflatable boat, but shaped to wrap around the arms and legs of the wearer. This type of suit is much more compact than a neoprene <b>survival</b> <b>suit,</b> and very easy to put on when deflated since it is just welded from plastic sheeting to form an air bladder.|$|E
500|$|... 2. Since 1980, <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> {{have been}} {{required}} aboard ship in each crew member's quarters and at their customary work station with strobe lights affixed to life jackets and <b>survival</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R
25|$|Immersion <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> are {{dry suits}} carried {{for use by}} ship and {{aircraft}} crew who will be immersed in cold water if the craft must be abandoned. Unlike immersion <b>survival</b> work <b>suits,</b> these are {{not intended to be}} worn all the time, and are only to be used in an emergency. <b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> will typically be a one-piece design made of fire-retardant neoprene, optimized with quick donning features, and produced in high visibility colours with reflective tape patches.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> {{can also}} be {{equipped}} with extra safety options such as: ...|$|R
50|$|A ship's captain (or master) may be {{required}} to hold drills periodically to ensure that everyone can get to the <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> storage quickly, and don the suit in the allotted amount of time. In the event of an emergency, {{it should be possible to}} put on a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> and abandon ship in about one minute.|$|E
50|$|An {{immersion}} suit, or <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> (or {{more specifically}} an immersion <b>survival</b> <b>suit)</b> {{is a special}} type of waterproof dry suit that protects the wearer from hypothermia from immersion in cold water, after abandoning a sinking or capsized vessel, especially in the open ocean. They usually have built-on feet (boots), and a hood, and either built-on gloves or watertight wrist seals.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike work suits, [...] "quick don" [...] {{survival}} suits are not normally worn, but are stowed in an accessible location {{on board the}} craft. The operator {{may be required to}} have one <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> of the appropriate size on board for each crew member, and other passengers. If a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> is not accessible both from a crew member's work station and berth, then two accessible suits must be provided.|$|E
5000|$|Safety {{equipment}} such as lifeboats, liferafts, and <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> {{are carried}} aboard many vessels for emergency use.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> in Europe {{were invented}} by Daniel Rigolet, captain of a French oil tanker. Others had experimented on similar suits abroad.|$|R
50|$|These zippers {{are very}} common where {{airtight}} or watertight seals are needed, such as on scuba diving dry <b>suits,</b> ocean <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> and hazmat suits.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{garments}} overlap into scubadiver-type drysuits. Others may {{have many of}} the features of a <b>survival</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Class S - A 121.5 MHz unit {{similar to}} Class B but is often {{included}} {{as an integral}} part of a lifeboat or <b>survival</b> <b>suit.</b> Their use is no longer recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E
50|$|However, like an {{inflatable}} boat, the inflatable <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> loses all protection properties {{if it is}} punctured and the gas leaks out. For this reason, the suit may consist {{of two or more}} bladders, so that if one fails, a backup air bladder is available.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{subjects}} on the courses is Basic sea survival where the students {{learn how to}} use life rafts, lifejackets, <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> flares, MOB and personal safety equipment.|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>survival</b> <b>suit's</b> {{flotation}} {{and thermal}} protection is usually better than an immersion protection work suit, and typically extends a person's survival by several hours {{while waiting for}} rescue.|$|R
50|$|The {{helicopter}} rescued Cache Seel, who was {{the only}} crewmember {{to make it to}} the life raft. Vermeersch and Rivera, who were wearing <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> like Seel, were found dead in the water. Vermeersch was recovered by the helicopter, and Rivera was recovered by Stimson. Edwards, Luna and Marrs fell into the water without <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> and their bodies were never found. According to Seel's account, Edwards and Luna were thrown overboard while trying to release the life raft. Vermeersch ultimately freed it, but only Seel made it to the raft after 50 minutes in the water.|$|R

50|$|Once the {{inflatable}} <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> {{has been}} put on and zipped shut, the wearer activates firing handles on compressed carbon dioxide cartridges, which punctures the cartridges and rapidly inflates the suit. This results in a highly buoyant, rigid shape that also offers very high thermal retention properties.|$|E
50|$|The Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment {{is a type}} of <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> {{that can}} be used by sailors when {{escaping}} from a sunken submarine. The suit is donned before escaping from the submarine and then inflated to act as a liferaft when the sailor reaches the surface.|$|E
50|$|Founded by Olav Zipser In 2009, The FreeFly Astronaut Project is a {{scientific}} research mission toward {{the development of}} appropriate techniques and <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> for high-altitude and low-earth-orbit emergency re-entry survival and rescue situations.|$|R
50|$|Dry suit {{inflation}} only {{applies to}} diving. <b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> and other dry suits designed for wear {{on the surface}} have no inflation or dump valves as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not issues.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the Coast Guard {{required}} that <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> be required on all winter North Atlantic runs. Later, {{as a direct}} result of the casualties on the Marine Electric, Congress pushed for and the Coast Guard eventually established the now famous Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer program.|$|R
50|$|The {{first record}} of a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> was in 1930 when a New York firm American Life Suit Corporation offered {{merchant}} and fishing firms what it called a safety suit for crews of ocean vessels. The suit came packed in a small box and was put on like a boilersuit.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, {{the company}} took over Piel owned by Pirelli, {{specialised}} in survival equipment. It took the company 4 years {{to design and}} create the TPS (Thermal Protective Survival), a soft, light and isolating <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> which saved the life of Raphaël Dinelli and Thierry Dubois, during the Vendée Globe Race in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959 {{the company}} created a very compact <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> for the US Air Force. The seven piece suit {{was made of}} nylon and goose down and came vacuum packed in a small box. It was used in jets and space capsules. The coat {{converted}} into a sleeping bag. Gerry expanded into outerwear and produced {{some of the first}} lightweight down jackets.|$|E
5000|$|The vessels also {{received}} degaussing against magnetic mines, and seamen were issued watertight <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> if {{the ship had}} to be abandoned. An important part of security was strict secrecy regarding routes and destinations, as made famous in the slogan [...] "Loose lips sinks ships".|$|R
5000|$|Some {{aircraft}} pilot <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> are constructed of a breathable material that allows water vapor to escape but prevents liquid from entering. Some examples include Gore-Tex {{as well as}} a special cotton material containing very long fibers, which swell up when wet and close air pores in the suit.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{aircraft}} pilot <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> use a solid impregnable material such as rubber-backed cotton, which {{is connected to}} a forced-air cooling system. Ventilation air is supplied via air hoses inside the vehicle cabin. In an emergency the hoses can be rapidly disconnected and the ventilation access ports close on the suit.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue {{the role}} of the false self in the human personality, {{regarding}} it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization - a kind of caretaker, a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.Five levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.|$|E
5000|$|After Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian's role as Robin, while a {{standard}} Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit {{was replaced with}} a black <b>survival</b> <b>suit,</b> the grayish cape with a yellow [...] "para-cape" [...] which grants him a gliding capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more arsenal and gadgetry, a black hood, and flexible green gloves and boots.|$|E
5000|$|The film is {{included}} in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 Collection Volume 12 from Rhino. It provided several running gags that were repeated throughout the series: humming the jazzy music whenever an aircraft is seen flying, mentions of the [...] "poopie suit" [...] (an Air Force <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> designed to help contain body heat {{in the event of}} a bailout over water), and the use of the word [...] "refueling" [...] as a synonym for any long, dull scene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> are {{normally}} {{made out of}} red or bright fluorescent orange or yellow fire-retardant neoprene, for high visibility on the open sea. The neoprene material used is a synthetic rubber closed-cell foam, containing a multitude of tiny air bubbles making the suit sufficiently buoyant to also be a personal flotation device.|$|R
5000|$|The {{balance between}} oil service flights and [...] "civilian" [...] flights can be judged {{from the fact}} that the airport service area has no bar (the nearest is some 3 mi away), no taxi or bus service (to anywhere), and three large rooms for {{helicopter}} passengers to don their <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> before embarking.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s {{the company}} {{developed}} <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> for offshore oil {{workers in the}} North Sea. In 1980 the company's breathable, waterproof fabric system, called Helly Tech, was launched. Helly Tech garments use both hydrophilic and microporous technology. Hydrophilic garments have water-loving molecular chains which pass water vapor to the outside. Microporous garments have tiny pores that allow water vapor to pass out of the fabric without letting rain droplets in.|$|R
