40|$|A new polymer alloy {{has been}} {{developed}} by blending powder of UHMWPE and graphite into nitrile rubber for marine <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> <b>bearings.</b> It has good self-lubrication performance, which decreases the friction coefficient under low speed conditions and the critical speed at which bearing vibration and noise occur. Experimental investigations have been completed to examine its physical properties, integrated bearing friction as well as dynamic characteristics of the system in vibration and noise environments. The results show that mechanical and physical properties of new alloy {{meet the requirements of}} ship standard CB/ T 769 - 2008. Stick-slip occurs at the critical speed of 0. 27 m/s. The friction coefficient is only about 50 % of the restricted value in USA military specification MIL-DTL- 17901 C (SH) (2005) at or less than the speed of 0. 18 m/s, and reached a minimum value at the speed of 0. 54 m/s.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} tests {{carried out on}} the effect of Magnetorheological Elastomeric (MRE) {{material}} as an adaptive tuned vibration absorber for a propeller shaft. In general, a propeller transmits rotational motion into thrust for propulsion of ship through water. This thrust is generated by an engine generally installed further forward in the vessel. A long propeller shaft links the main engine to the propeller supported by brackets with bearing. As the propeller rotates in a non-uniformly distributed hydraulic wave near the stern of the ship the propeller vibrates causing damage to the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> <b>bearings,</b> hull and the shaft itself. The effects of resonance can be amplified by torsional, longitudinal and lateral resonant vibration. These problem results in broken shafts, lost propeller blades or simply become very uncomfortable for the people on board the vessel. MRE consists of micron sized magnetically permeable particles suspended in elastomer. Its properties can be controlled dramatically by application of magnetic field. Since shear properties of MRE changes dominantly in small strain ranges, MRE {{has the potential to be}} used in a tunable vibration and shock absorber for engineering applications. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using MRE as tuned vibration absorber for propeller shaft in order to shift resonant frequency and reduce vibrational amplitude. To this end, the experimental investigation is carried out to illustrate the real time control capabilities of MRE adaptive vibration absorber for a propeller shaf...|$|R

In the paper, this study was performed on the level of both practical and experimental bifurcation analysis. Hereto, an experimental set-up of SSB- 100 marine <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> <b>bearing</b> test machine was applied to carry on this project. The synthesis of these practical and experimental results confirmed that nonlinear friction-induced vibration was due to a subtle balance of negative damping at lower speeds or viscous friction at higher speeds.

The magnitude of the maximum oil film pressure generated is greatly affected by the attitude angle of the shaft. As the attitude angle of the shaft is varied from 90 to 180 degrees, the maximum oil film pressure gradually increases. If the eccentricity at the centre of the bearing, the angle of the shaft centre relative to the bearing centre and the attitude angle of the shaft can be determined, then it is possible to quantitatively determine the maximum oil film pressure taking the elastic deformation of the bearing into account by the method described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The most {{sensitive}} {{component in the}} propulsion shafting system is the aft <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> <b>bearing,</b> which is exposed to heavy static and dynamic propeller loads exerted to the bearing surface by the propeller shaft. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb, and the American Bureau of Shipping intend {{to work on the}} development of the theoretical model of the stern tube journal bearing behaviour, which is proposed to be done in several stages. The initial stage is to consider nonlinear fl uid structural interaction, and this is the theory shown in this article. Owing to the fact that the shaft journal in operation lies on a lubricating fl uid fi lm, which separates the journal in the bearing from the bearing liner, the theoretical nonlinear model of the journal bearing may provide more insight in the behaviour of the shaft inside the bearing and help us to determine a more realistic elastic line of the shafting. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) initiated a research project to measure actual interaction between the shaft and the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> <b>bearing</b> with the goal of applying obtained knowledge in development of an accurate analytical/numerical model for shaftbearing analysis. The initial focus of the investigation was to capture the transient operation of the shaft inside the bearing and to observe the shaftâ€™s hydrodynamic lift during starting, stopping and reversing of the engine. Proximity probes were used to monitor the shaft bearing interaction with micron precision. The installed probes measure the distance between the shaft and the bearing at eight locations inside the aft stern bush and at four locations inside the forward stern bush, and utilize obtained data to defi ne the shaft orbit and dynamics as it revolves in the bearing. The results of presented measurements show that the shaft behaviour inside the stern bush is very different depending on the locati inside the bush. Therefore, an analytical approach, which uses a simplifi ed theory of shaft bearing interaction, provides no practical value since it neglects shaft dynamics and interaction between fl uid and the structure...|$|E

50|$|Early submarines, {{when they}} carried torpedoes, were {{fitted with a}} variety of torpedo {{launching}} mechanisms in a range of locations; on the deck, in the bow or stern, amidships, with some launch mechanisms permitting the torpedo to be aimed over a wide arc. By World War 2, designs favoured multiple bow tubes and fewer or no <b>stern</b> <b>tubes.</b> Modern submarine bows are usually occupied by a large sonar array, necessitating midships tubes angled outward, while <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> have largely disappeared. The first French and Russian submarines carried their torpedoes externally in Drzewiecki drop collars. These were cheaper than tubes, but less reliable. Both the United Kingdom and United States experimented with external tubes in World War II. External tubes offered a cheap and easy way of increasing torpedo capacity without radical redesign, something neither had time or resources to do prior to, or early in, the war. British T class submarines carried up to 13 torpedo tubes, up to 5 of them external. America's use was mainly limited to earlier Porpoise-, Salmon-, and Sargo-class boats. Until the appearance of the Tambor, most American submarines only carried 4 bow and either 2 or 4 <b>stern</b> <b>tubes,</b> something many American submarine officers felt provided inadequate firepower.
