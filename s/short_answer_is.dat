2500|$|Online {{publication}} NewMusicBox—which normally covers new American music {{outside the}} commercial mainstream—argued that the Beach Boys could never earn themselves [...] "the same {{pride of place}} in American music history held by other great innovators" [...] because of their mistaken reputation as a [...] "light-hearted party band that drooled over California Girls while on a Surfing Safari," [...] hampered not only by the over-saturation of their early songs being used in film, commercials, and other media, but also [...] "...their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison contests that the group produced work that could [...] "almost" [...] be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, [...] "The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces." [...] While the group [...] "went into the great void beyond", such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: [...] "What influences could these innovations then have? The <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. … It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{advantages}} of using software for textual data analysis of focus groups (FG) interviews. In particular, we examine the technical issues faced by a researcher when analysing a corpus resulting from FG conducted in different countries. These issues are illustrated by the results of research carried out on European people’s attitudes and behaviours toward Personal Identity Data Management (PIDM) funded by the European Commission IPTS Joint Research Centre. Two focus group interviews (one with youngsters, the other with adults) were carried in different EU 27 countries including France and Germany. The results obtained were compared with Alceste Software using two different encoding techniques: de-crowded and crowded, in order to analyse the advantages and drawbacks of these two techniques. The de-crowded technique, which consists of regrouping the discourse of each individual, is more suitable when the researcher wishes to analyse the discourse of each participant in relation to his characteristics and when many <b>short</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> given during the focus group. The crowded technique takes into account the specificities of a focus group as the technique is concerned with the interactions of individuals and allows the researcher to respect the different phases of the focus group interview.
