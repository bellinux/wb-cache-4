25|$|The Goldman model {{differs from}} the Kidd-Stubbs series {{decompression}} model in that the Goldman model assumes linear kinetics, where the K-S model includes a quadratic component, and the Goldman model considers only the central well-perfused compartment to contribute explicitly to risk, while the K-S model assumes all compartments to carry potential risk. The DCIEM 1983 model associates risk with the two outermost compartments of a four compartment series. The mathematical model based on this concept is claimed by Goldman to fit not only the Navy square profile data used for calibration, but also predicts risk relatively accurately for saturation profiles. A bubble version of the ICM model was not significantly different in predictions, and was discarded as more complex with no significant advantages. The ICM also predicted decompression sickness incidence more accurately at the low-risk recreational diving exposures recorded in DAN's Project Dive Exploration data set. The alternative models {{used in this study}} were the LE1 (Linear-Exponential) and straight Haldanean models. The Goldman model predicts a significant risk reduction following a <b>safety</b> <b>stop</b> on a low-risk dive and significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the PADI tables suggest).|$|E

The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

2500|$|Inert gas {{components}} of the diver's breathing gas accumulate in the tissues during exposure to elevated pressure during a dive, and must be eliminated during the ascent to avoid formation of symptomatic bubbles in tissues where the concentration is too high to remain in solution. This process is called decompression. [...] Most recreational and professional scuba divers avoid obligatory decompression stops by following a dive profile which only requires a limited rate of ascent for decompression, but will commonly also do an optional short shallow decompression stop known as a <b>safety</b> <b>stop</b> to further reduce risk before surfacing. In some cases, particularly in technical diving, more complex decompression procedures are necessary. Decompression may follow a pre-planned series of ascents interrupted by stops, or may be monitored by a personal decompression computer.|$|E

These values may vary depending on the diver and other circumstances. A diver selecting a pony bottle can do such an analysis for his/her own breathing rates, cylinder pressure to be used, and required ascent profile, or take professional advice on the selection. Since monitoring of remaining air is a key safety issue during a dive, the submersible pressure gauge attached to the pony bottle regulator should be readable {{at any time during the}} dive.|$|E

2500|$|Configuration [...] In a pony bottle {{system the}} back-up {{regulator}} {{is a complete}} diving regulator (first and second stages, and usually a submersible pressure gauge) on a separate cylinder which is not intended for use as primary breathing gas during the dive. It provides a totally redundant emergency air supply. The size of the pony bottle cylinder is usually smaller {{than that of the}} primary scuba cylinder. It should however provide enough breathing gas to make a totally controlled return to the surface, including any required decompression stop or <b>safety</b> <b>stop</b> planned for the ascent. The required pony cylinder capacity will depend on the profile for safe ascent to the surface required for a particular dive plan. A pony bottle used for sport diving may be 6, 13 or 19 cu ft in the USA, while 2litre and 3litre are common sizes in Europe. For deep, technical diving or wreck diving, 30 and 40 cu ft (4litre and 5.5litre) cylinders are often used. The pony bottle is a minimum requirement for someone doing solo diving, who has no alternative source of air {{in the form of a}} buddy's available tank and octopus regulator if the dive is to a depth where the diver is not able to do a safe free ascent. In scientific diving operations, pony bottles can be a standard part of tethered scuba diving operations where the diver is often solo but connected to the surface by communications equipment.|$|E
