40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>surface</b> <b>refining</b> process (SRP) on hardness, wear rate and {{coefficient}} of friction of Al- 4 Cu (Cu 4 wt. %, Al balance) was measured in this study. Cast samples of the alloy composition Al- 4 wt% Cu were prepared {{for the purpose of}} this study. <b>Surface</b> <b>refining</b> was conducted using Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA) as heat source. Microstructural evaluation was done using metallurgical microscope. Vicker's Hardness tester was used to measure the hardness. Pin on disc wear tester was used to measure the wear rate and {{coefficient of friction}} under as per ASTM G 99. Hardness was found to increase from 55 HV for substrate to 104 HV for that of modified layer. Wear rate was found to decrease with increase in hardness. Further wear rate increased with increase in load whereas it remained constant with varying speeds. COF was found to be constant for all test conditions. The heat treatment is found to have an impact on the hardness of the modified layer. The hardness was increased from 104 HV for the as refined condition to 162 HV for the heat treated condition, an observation that was not previously reported in the literature. The results obtained in this study are comparable with that of previous studies. However, the aged samples showed a superior hardness when compared to the data shown in the previous e-beam/laser studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{filtration}} efficiency and precision of the filter media, two methods of <b>surface</b> <b>refining</b> treatment were presented, which were the co-stretching PTFE micro-porous membrane and foam coating on nonwoven filter media. During the process of co-stretching, the pore diameters and thickness of the membrane were different on the surface. The double-layer PTFE base sheet was simultaneously stretched, which induced the reduction of pore sizes and uniform thickness of the filter media. After foam coating, the pore sizes of nonwoven filter media were reduced to under 10 µm because of the micro-pore membrane formed on the surface. Therefore, filtration efficiency and precision were remarkably increased. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSurface {{refining}} of Al–Si alloy {{was carried}} out using the ‘Gas Tungsten Arc’ (GTA) heat source {{and the effect of}} Si content on the microstructure, hardness and wear properties of the surface modified alloys was evaluated. In order to further improve its wear resistance, the <b>Surface</b> <b>Refining</b> Process (SRP) was employed in this study. In the SRP, the surface of the parent material is melted by a suitable heat source and the molten zone is allowed to solidify progressively. It can be noted from the literature that e-beam and laser are the only heat sources employed. Both these sources are highly expensive and their productivity is also low. The depth of the modified layer by e-beam or laser process is found to be inadequate for wear applications. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, in this study, the <b>surface</b> <b>refining</b> of Al–Si alloy {{was carried out}} by using an inexpensive, high productivity and commonly available GTA source. In this work, the effect of Si content on the properties is evaluated by varying the Si content from 4 - 16 wt%. The alloys were sand–cast in the form of bar(150 x 30 x 30 mm). The Surface melting was carried out with the following GTA parameters: current- 150 A, travel Speed- 2 mm/s, arc length- 3 mm, tip angle- 1800 and electrode diameter- 2. 4 mm. The hardness was measured at different locations by using Vickers Hardness Tester by applying 100 gm load for 15 s and an average value was taken. The wear testing was conducted as per ASTM G 99 standard under a dry sliding condition in air using Pin–on–Disc wear tester. In this study, it was noted that the typical as–cast microstructure of the Al–Si alloy illustrating the elongated morphology of the eutectic–Si has been completely refined, and the eutectic–Si is finely dispersed within the α–Al matrix. It is inferred that the microstructure was refined due to fast cooling to have a globular eutectic–Si dispersed within a fine–grained matrix in the GTA process. It was found that the depth of the modified layer is significantly higher than that obtained in the e-beam/laser process. The hardness of the modified layer was found to increase when the Si content is increased from 4 - 16 wt%. The wear rate is found to decrease with an increase in the Si content whereas the coefficient of friction tends to remain the same. The wear mechanism was found to be adhesive. Finally, the peak hardness of the modified layer increased significantly upon ageing. The observations are in agreement with that of previous studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to assess {{the effect of the}} Sn content on the microstructure, hardness and wear properties of surface refined Cu-Sn bronze alloys. The <b>surface</b> <b>refining</b> was carried out using the Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA) as heat source. Alloys of various compositions, (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 wt% Sn) were melted in a melting furnace under an argon atmosphere and cast into sand moulds in the form of rods. Microstructural evaluation of the as-cast, refined and homogenized specimens were conducted using an optical microscope. The Vicker's Hardness Tester was used to measure the hardness of the modified layer and the wear testing was conducted using DUCOM Pin-On-Disc wear testing machine as per ASTM G 99 standard under dry sliding condition in air. The microstructure of the modified layer showed a refined grain structure as compared to the coarse dendritic structure observed in the as cast sample. The homogenized specimen showed that there was no formation of any non-equilibrium phase due to rapid cooling. It was found that the hardness of the modified layer increases when the Sn content was increased from 4 - 12 %. The wear rate decreases linearly with the Sn content. The Coefficient of Friction was found to remain constant irrespective of the hardness. The results of this study using GTA as heat source are comparable to those of previous works in which laser and e-beam heat sources were used...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} role of lung {{surfactant}} proteins SP-B and SP-C in storing and redelivering lipid from lipid monolayers during the compression and re-expansion occurring in lungs during breathing, we simulate the folding of lipid monolayers with and without these proteins. We utilize the MARTINI coarse-grained force field to simulate monolayers containing pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC mixed with palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), palmitic acid (PA), and/or peptides. The peptides considered include the 25 -residue N-terminal fragment of SP-B (SP-B 1 – 25), SP-C, and several SP-B 1 – 25 mutants in which charged and hydrophilic residues are replaced by hydrophobic ones, or vice-versa. We observe two folding mechanisms: folding by the amplification of undulations and folding by nucleation about a defect. The first mechanism is observed in monolayers containing either POPG or peptides, while the second mechanism is observed only with peptides present, and involves the lipid-mediated aggregation of the peptides into a defect, from which the fold can nucleate. Fold nucleation from a defect displays a dependence on the hydrophobic character of the peptides; {{if the number of}} hydrophobic residues is decreased significantly, monolayer folding does not occur. The addition of POPG or peptides to the DPPC monolayer has a fluidizing effect, which assists monolayer folding. In contrast, the addition of PA has a charge-dependent condensing affect on DPPC monolayers containing SP-C. The peptides appear to {{play a significant role in}} the folding process, and provide a larger driving force for folding than POPG. In addition to promoting fold formation, the peptides also display fusogenic behavior, which can lead to <b>surface</b> <b>refining...</b>|$|E

40|$|Lung {{surfactant}} (LS) is {{a complex}} mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces and regulates the surface tension in the lungs, thereby decreasing the work of breathing. A thorough understanding of LS function {{is critical to the}} development and optimization of synthetic surfactants for the treatment of neonatal and adult respiratory distress syndrome. We have utilized coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulation to study the dynamic, hysteretic changes occurring in the structure and phase of model surfactant mixtures with varying temperature, pressure and composition. In particular, we have studied the effects of the LS components palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitic acid (PA), cholesterol, and two surface-active proteins SP-B 1 - 25 (the 25 -residue N-terminal fragment of SP-B), and SP-C on model surfactant monolayers containing the primary lipid component dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The results indicate that POPG, POPC, SP-B 1 - 25 and SP-C act as fluidizers and PA and cholesterol act as condensing agents, which change the phase-transition temperature, LC-LE phase distribution, and the extent of hysteresis. To explore the role of LS proteins SP-B and SP-C in storing and redelivering lipid from lipid monolayers during the compression and re-expansion occurring in lungs during breathing, we have simulated 2 D-to- 3 D transitions at the interface. These simulations show that at near-zero surface tension the presence of a fluidizing agent, such as POPG, SP-C, or SP-B 1 - 25 decreases the monolayers resistance to bending allowing the monolayers to form large undulations and ultimately folds. Another folding mechanism is also observed in monolayers containing peptides, involving the lipid-mediated aggregation of the peptides into a defect, from which the fold can nucleate. The occurrence of folding depends on the hydrophobic character of the peptides; if the number of hydrophobic residues is decreased significantly, monolayer folding does not occur. In contrast, the addition of PA has a charge dependent condensing affect, which can eliminate folding. Our results suggest that the peptides {{play a significant role in}} the folding process, and provide a larger driving force for folding than does POPG.
