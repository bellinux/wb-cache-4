5|$|As {{part of the}} R211 <b>subway</b> <b>car</b> order, the MTA is {{planning}} to test a train of 10 open-gangway experimental prototype cars, which could increase capacity by up to 10% by utilizing space that in previous models was the unused space between cars. The order could be expanded to include up to 750 open-gangway cars.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, {{part of the}} {{mezzanine}} {{was closed}} off so the MTA could build a mockup of the proposed R211 <b>subway</b> <b>car.</b> When completed, the model would be publicly accessible so riders could review it. The mockup contains features such as an open-gangway design proposed for this order; digital screens showing next stops and their station layouts; and a blue-and-gold-stripe paint design on its exterior.|$|E

25|$|By March 1982, the MTA {{closed a}} deal to {{purchase}} 325 new IRT <b>subway</b> <b>cars</b> from Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan. It {{would be the first}} purchase of foreign-made <b>subway</b> <b>cars</b> that ever ran on the New York City Subway system. Other candidates for this order included Bombardier and the Budd Company. The first Capital Program allocated funding for the purchase of 1,150 <b>subway</b> <b>cars,</b> and Kawasaki was not interested in building another 825 IRT cars. Bombardier ended up winning the contract for the R62As.|$|R
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the <b>subway</b> <b>car</b> and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|The {{station and}} the {{adjacent}} segment of the Rockaway Line suffered serious damage during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and was out of service for several months. Due to its location {{in the middle of}} Jamaica Bay, the station was filled with debris, with its trackbed damaged. During its temporary closure, the station received new ADA-tactile strips, platform edge rubbing boards, and cosmetic and mechanical work. Service was restored to the station on May 30, 2013, and to celebrate the re-opening, a vintage R1 <b>subway</b> <b>car</b> formed the first train.|$|E
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a <b>subway</b> <b>car</b> and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E

5000|$|In late 2000, the MTA New York City Transit {{decided to}} phase out an {{outdated}} fleet of <b>subway</b> <b>cars</b> {{to make room for}} new R142 and R142A trains. The obsolete <b>subway</b> <b>cars,</b> (nicknamed [...] "Redbirds"), had run on the IRT lines in the New York City Subway system for 40 years. Each car was stripped, decontaminated, loaded on a barge, and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Delaware. Some cars had number plates removed because of rust, which were then auctioned off on eBay. A total of 1200 <b>subway</b> <b>cars</b> were sunk for this project.|$|R
