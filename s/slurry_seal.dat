2500|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form [...] "cutbacks" [...] with reduced melting point or mixing {{with water to}} turn the asphalt into an emulsion. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. <b>Slurry</b> <b>seal</b> involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.|$|E

Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) as the main filler {{in the application of}} <b>slurry</b> <b>seal.</b> Due to the relatively high cement prices and the pollution control for the environment; it is required to maintain the quality of the slurry by using a combination of OPC and LCFA (Low Calcium Fly Ash). This research was conducted to determine the value of consistency, setting time and indirect tensile strength (ITS) of <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> containing LCFA. A consistency testing used to obtain optimum moisture content to produce the sample {{for the rest of the}} test. The results show that with the addition of 5 % water for pre-wetting and subsequently 10 % of water content, the mixture provide appropriate consistency as required by highways standard. The time settings also meet the requirements of highways standard between 15 to 720 minutes for all types of mixtures. The mixture with composition of 50 % OPC and 50 % LCFA is considered as an ideal mixture at the optimum density value of 1. 769 g/cm 3, porosity of 9. 55 % and the indirect tensile strength of 30. 99 kPa. It could be concluded that fly ash can be used as OPC partial replacement and enhance the properties on <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> application...|$|E

Thirteen aggregates including nine Iowa sources, a quartzite, a synthetic aggregate (Haydite), a limestone stone from Nebraska, and a Chat aggregate from Kansas {{were tested in}} combination with four emulsions and two mineral fillers, {{resulting in a total}} of 40 material combinations. A number of meetings were held with the Iowa DOT engineers and 12 state highway departments that have had successful <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> experiences and records, and several <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> contractors and material and equipment suppliers were contacted. Asphalt emulsion <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> development, uses, characteristics, tests, and design methods were thoroughly reviewed in conjunction with Iowa's experiences through these meetings and discussions and through a literature search (covering some 140 articles and 12 state highway department specifications). It was found that, while asphalt emulsion slurry seals (when properly designed and constructed) can economically improve the quality and extend the life of existing pavement surface, experiences with them had been mixed due to the many material, slurry, and construction variables that affect their design, construction, and performance.

Based on survey results from 29 state departments of transportation (DOTs), {{it was found that}} the expected pavement life extension caused by these treatments follows the order of thin hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlay, microsurfacing tied with chip <b>sealing,</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>sealing,</b> and crack filling/sealing. The reported costs follow the order of thin overlay, microsurfacing, and chip <b>sealing</b> tied with <b>slurry</b> <b>sealing,</b> whereas costs of crack sealing/filling cannot be directly compared. The authors also analyzed data from 81 Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program specific pavement studies (SPS) experiments, which were specifically designed and constructed to study the effectiveness of pavement treatments. Based on paired t-tests, it was found that all the treatments reduced international roughness index (IRI) with statistical significance. The authors then pooled the data from all the control sections and created a pseudo control section and subsequently developed a linear regression model for it. By comparing the effects of treatments with this pseudo control section, the authors found that the approximate life extension of the pavement sections benefited from these treatments is as follows: thin overlay for 5. 4 years, chip sealing for 1. 9 years, crack sealing for 1. 7 years, and <b>slurry</b> <b>sealing</b> for 1. 1 years.

The first part of study reports the findings of a detailed laboratory investigation concerning the effect of asphalt emulsion, added water content, and the use of additives (Portland cement) on the design parameters and properties of micro-surfacing mixtures. For this, one aggregate type, one asphalt emulsion type/grade, and one aggregate gradation were used in the study. The evaluation was conducted at one curing stages of the mix (24 -Hours). Three levels of asphalt emulsion, four levels of added water content, and one level of Portland cement were used in order to evaluate role of asphalt emulsion, water, and cement. This part of study consisted mainly of establishing a method for preparing and testing micro-surfacing mixture using four main mixture design tests proposed by the ISSA (TB 139, TB 113, TB 100, and TB 109). The results obtained with ISSA TB 109 and ISSA TB 100 mixture design tests were found highly variable and not precise enough to suggest optimum mix design.

50|$|This type {{of surface}} damage {{can be found}} {{exclusively}} underneath the pavement markings such as lane markings and turn-lane arrows. There is no definitive explanation {{of the relationship between}} pavement markings and surface deterioration, but there are several hypotheses. One is that water vapor may have been trapped underneath the road surface markings, causing the de-bonding of asphalt binder from the aggregate materials. Another hypothesis is that the reflectivity of the markings may create differences in solar heating and thermal expansion strains between the areas with and without markings. Small flaws caused by differential strains may be combined into longitudinal cracks along the markings. There are certain surface treatments that can make the road surface less susceptible to this type of distresses, such as <b>slurry</b> <b>seals</b> and stone mastic asphalt.|$|R

30|$|Measurement of {{stability}} of PCWS was taken after the <b>slurry</b> was <b>sealed</b> {{in a container}} for 7  days. In order to ensure {{the reliability of the}} experimental results, the stability of PCWS was measured by both the rod-insertion method (Zhao 2009) and a visual method (Li et al. 2008). In the rod-insertion method, a steel rod was inserted vertically and freely from the slurry surface, and the first traveling length through the slurry was recorded. Then the steel rod was strongly pressed {{down to the bottom of}} the container, and the second traveling length through the slurry was recorded as well. The relative height of the hard sediment layer can be obtained by calculation, which is an index to evaluate slurry stability. A large relative height of hard sediment layer indicates poor stability of the PCWS. In the visual method, the changes in slurry properties, such as separated water, could be found through observation. The mass ratio of separated water to total slurry is used to evaluate the stability of slurry. A higher water-to-slurry ratio indicates a worse stability.|$|R

Glass capillaries were then filled with <b>slurries</b> and <b>sealed</b> to prevent evaporation of the solvent...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} the design, development {{and performance of}} a glass-ceramic sealant used to join the ceramic electrolyte (YSZ wafer and anode supported-electrolyte (ASE)) to the metallic interconnects (Crofer 22 APUand AISI 430) in planar SOFC stacks. The designed glass-ceramic sealant is a barium-free silica-based glass, which crystallizes {{by means of the}} heat treatment after being deposited on substrates by the <b>slurry</b> technique. The <b>sealing</b> process of the glass. ceramic was optimized and joined ceramic/seal/metal samples were morphologically characterized and tested for 400 h in air atmosphere followed by 200 h in H 2. 3 H 2 O atmosphere at the fuel-cell operating temperature of 800. C. The study showed that the use of the glass-ceramic was successful in joining the ceramic electrolyte to the metallic interconnect and in preventing adverse corrosion effects at the interface...|$|R
