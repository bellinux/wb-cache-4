5|$|Open {{season for}} California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{runs from the}} Saturday before the first Wednesday in October until the first Wednesday after March 15.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{is found}} {{in parts of the}} Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, {{extending}} as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Niño years.|$|E
5|$|To {{fish for}} <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> south of Point Arguello, a sport fishing license with ocean {{enhancement}} stamp must be displayed or kept nearby.|$|E
5000|$|Jasus is a genus of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> which live in {{the oceans}} of the Southern Hemisphere. They have two {{distinct}} [...] "horns" [...] projecting {{from the front of}} the carapace, but lack the stridulating organs present in almost all other genera of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Like all <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> they lack claws, and have long stout antennae which are quite flexible.|$|R
25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 <b>lobsters</b> long. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> by a loud screech made by the antennae of the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.|$|R
40|$|A biogeographic {{consideration}} on habitat {{isolation is}} proposed to <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in Satsunan-Kaiiki, the local sea area of southern Japan. This area has a complicated biogeographic character and distributes six species of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Based on field samplings, fishery records, and oceanological data, the diverse and segregated distributions of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{in this area}} seem to be effectively determined by a flowing branch of the Kuroshio Current. ...|$|R
5|$|Natural predators of the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant {{sea bass}} and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{is one of}} 19 {{species in}} the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered {{by the state of}} Florida to protect <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> of {{the family}} Palinuridae are known to exist in parts of Asia such as India, Japan, Indonesia and Malaya. In Ceylon <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are caught chiefly by a {{primitive}} type of gear designed to catch these species and incidentally by nets set to catch fish. The limitations {{of these types of}} gear and the results of experimental fishing in Ceylon with different designs of lobster traps have been discussed earlier. As a result of these experiments a very effective trap for capturing <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> was developed and it was shown that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> were present in large quantities (De Bruin 1960). This created great interest among skin-divers who found lobster fishing very remunerative...|$|R

5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 80 {{species of}} fish and {{shellfish}} are commercially harvested from seamounts, including <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> (Palinuridae), mackerel (Scombridae and others), red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), tuna (Scombridae), Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and perch (Percidae).|$|E
5|$|The California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other species in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; other species either lack grooves, or have grooves which span the entire body segment.|$|E

5|$|Female California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|R
5|$|The Mexican fishery for the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> was {{the first}} Latin American fishery to be awarded the Marine Stewardship Council's {{sustainable}} fishery ecolabel, and the species is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The main legal {{restrictions}} on fishing for California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> in Mexico are a minimum landing size of , {{the prohibition of}} catching berried females, and a closed season: from February 16 to November 15, fishing for spiny lobsters is prohibited in a region which moves south along Mexico's Pacific coast during the season.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, spiny {{lobsters}} {{are an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> {{also known}} as langustas, langouste, or rock lobsters, are a family (Palinuridae) of about 60 species of achelate crustaceans, in the Decapoda Reptantia. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are also, {{especially}} in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Bahamas, sometimes called crayfish, sea crayfish, or crawfish ("kreef" [...] in South Africa), terms which elsewhere are reserved for freshwater crayfish.|$|R
50|$|Female California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} 65 - 69 mm, which is typically at an age of 5-9 years; males are sexually mature after 3-6 years.

5|$|California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are nocturnal, {{hiding in}} crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long {{antennae}} showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|R
5|$|The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{reports that}} many species populations {{have not yet}} fully {{recovered}} from a large-scale shift in the oceanic ecosystem that affected the North Pacific during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This shift reduced populations of important species such as <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals. Commercial fishing ended in 2011. The monument receives strict conservation protection, with exceptions for traditional Native Hawaiian uses and limited tourism.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas is a prey {{species for}} several {{carnivorous}} gastropod mollusks, including the apple murex Phyllonotus pomum, the horse conch Pleuroploca gigantea, the lamp shell Turbinella angulata, the moon snails Natica spp. and Polinices spp., the muricid snail Murex margaritensis, the trumpet triton Charonia variegata and the tulip snail Fasciolaria tulipa. Crustaceans are also conch predators, {{such as the}} blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the box crab Calappa gallus, the giant hermit crab Petrochirus diogenes, the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> Panulirus argus and others. Sea stars, vertebrates, including fish (such as the permit Trachinotus falcatus and the porcupine fish Diodon hystrix), loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and humans also dine on the queen conch.|$|E

25|$|Invertebrate fisheries: The main {{invertebrate}} fisheries are in {{the north}} west Hawaiian Islands for slipper and <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b> This fishery started in 1977, peaked in the mid 1980s, and then declined. The decline is thought to stem from oceanographic changes. Some recovery has occurred since 1991, due to entry and harvest restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Anguillian cuisine is {{influenced}} by native Caribbean, African, Spanish, French and English cuisines. Seafood is abundant, including prawns, shrimp, crab, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> conch, mahi-mahi, red snapper, marlin and grouper. Salt cod is a staple food eaten on its own and used in stews, casseroles and soups. Livestock is limited due to {{the small size of}} the island and people there use poultry, pork, goat and mutton, along with imported beef. Goat is the most commonly eaten meat, used in a variety of dishes.|$|E
