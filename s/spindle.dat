5|$|Two {{conflicting}} {{factors are}} involved in host preferences, the species {{and the age of}} the leaf. Offered <b>spindle</b> and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids moved {{from one to the other}} depending on the active growth state of each and the senescence of each host plant. Thus in late summer and autumn, the beet leaves were old and unattractive to the aphids in comparison with the leaves of the <b>spindle,</b> whereas in spring, the young unfolding leaves of the beet were more attractive than those of the <b>spindle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated <b>spindle</b> instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line <b>spindle</b> body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E

5000|$|Modern hand <b>spindles</b> {{fall into}} three basic categories: {{suspended}} <b>spindles,</b> supported <b>spindles</b> and grasped <b>spindles.</b> Supported and suspended <b>spindles</b> are normally held vertically, grasped <b>spindles</b> may be held vertically, horizontally or {{at an angle}} depending on the tradition.|$|R
50|$|Grasped <b>spindles</b> {{are also}} known as hand <b>spindles,</b> in the hand <b>spindles,</b> in hand <b>spindles</b> and twiddled spindles; there appears no {{consensus}} on nomenclature for this category of <b>spindles</b> though there have been various attempts at creating an agreed nomenclature including diving this category of <b>spindles</b> into two, such as Crowfoot's attempts to define the difference between grasped and in hand <b>spindles</b> or merging this category into others, such as Franquemont's approach of classing them as supported <b>spindles.</b>|$|R

5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located in}} the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear <b>spindle).</b> In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E

Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the front fork torsional axis as low as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} of E.frostii is olive brown. The spores are thick walled, smooth, and <b>spindle</b> shaped, with {{dimensions}} of 11–15 by 4–5µm. Longer spores up to 18µm long {{may also be}} present. The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5µm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E.frostii. These hyaline (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14µm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like a <b>spindle</b> (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to subampullaceous—shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} post-translational modifications, NEDD9 {{is subject to}} {{significant}} phosphorylation based on growth conditions. In most actively growing adherent cells, NEDD9 migrates as a doublet of 115 and 105 kDa. Serine/threonine hyper-phosphorylated p115 NEDD9 {{is more common in}} G2/M phase cells, suggesting these modifications are associated with increased localization to centrosome and mitotic <b>spindle.</b> One study indicated the conversion of p115 into p105 is activated by cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of phosphatase PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and distribution of}} muscle <b>spindles</b> in the muscles of mastication of the rat have been studied.

No muscle <b>spindles</b> {{were found in the}} lateral pterygoid or posterior digastric muscle, and only isolated <b>spindles</b> were found in a few of the anterior digastric muscles.

5|$|The Xerxes.20 which {{superseded}} the Xerxes.X in 2005 incorporated new {{main bearing}} {{ball and the}} new Rmat-5 sub-plinth. The bearing, attached to the inner platter, has an unusually small-diameter hardened-steel <b>spindle,</b> which sits {{on top of a}} tungsten ball that measures 2mm and is machined to a tolerance in the order of micrometres. The corresponding housing is made of bronze. The two-piece platter, when fit together, are snug and will not resonate.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed <b>spindle</b> cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter, Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted {{from the main}} bearing, thus colouring the sound. To further increase isolation, the Xerxes possesses a <b>spindle</b> that allows the user to centre the record, but {{which is supposed to}} be removed during listening so that the disc rests solely on the felt mat.|$|E

5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic <b>spindle,</b> and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{produce a}} spore print with a color ranging from pinkish to salmon. Spores are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–10 by 4.5–6.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 19–43 by 6–11μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia that {{occur on the}} gill face) are usually <b>spindle</b> shaped, but have a widely {{variable}} morphology; they are abundant in the hymenium, and have dimensions of 26–122 by 8–57μm. The cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) are similar in morphology and abundance, some may feature knobs held {{at the end of}} slender projections up to 20μm long; dimensions are in the range of 26 and 144μm long by 8–46μm wide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of V.bombycina.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a <b>spindle</b> to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{structure}} composed {{largely of}} microtubules is the mitotic <b>spindle,</b> used by eukaryotic cells to segregate their chromosomes during cell division.
