5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor {{built the}} first all-hydrogen {{refinery}} in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company. It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture <b>sour</b> <b>gas,</b> which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices. In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served {{more than half of the}} world's government-owned oil companies.|$|E
25|$|The next {{important}} plant {{built in}} Canada {{resulted from the}} discovery in 1944 of a wet <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> find by Shell Oil at Jumping Pound, west of Calgary. Calgary, Exshaw (where there was a cement factory) and Banff were all potential markets for Jumping Pound gas, but the <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> first required processing and sweetening. The gas plant began operating in 1951.|$|E
25|$|One find {{from such}} a program was the <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> {{discovery}} at the village of Caroline, Alberta in south-central Alberta, in the mid-1980s. This discovery brought the industry into a new era. Because of the costs and dangers involved in developing <b>sour</b> <b>gas,</b> producers in the past had often shut in these discoveries. In the case of Caroline, this was unthinkable.|$|E

50|$|Shifting carbon {{monoxide}} and water into hydrogen also produces carbon dioxide, usually this is removed in an acid gas scrubbing process {{together with other}} <b>sour</b> <b>gases</b> as e.g. hydrogen sulfide (e.g. in a Rectisol Wash Unit).|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used amines in industrial plants are the alkanolamines DEA, MEA, and MDEA. These amines are also used in many oil refineries to remove <b>sour</b> <b>gases</b> from liquid hydrocarbons such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG).|$|R
25|$|The {{overhead}} <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> {{from the}} stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> {{is sent to}} the refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> {{processing}} technology steadily improved. By 1970, {{more stringent}} emission standards were technically feasible. The Alberta government announced new, tougher regulations in 1971. Improvements in sulphur extraction {{technology and the}} addition of tail gas clean-up units enabled processors to meet these stricter standards.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the {{attack of the}} major ions (sulfate, chloride, and magnesium) and <b>sour</b> <b>gases,</b> present in natural gas (CO 2 y SH 2), on API class H cement, the type used in gas wells under high pressure and temperature. The effects of these chemical agents on this cement was simulated to study the physicochemical changes due to the action of <b>sour</b> <b>gases</b> and formation water. Cement specimens were immersed in neutral solutions containing fixed concentrations of the major ions inside Parr reactors. These solutions were analysed and XRD analyses were conducted for over two months to identify mineralogical variations from 14 to 60 days. The objective {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} the joint attack of major ions and <b>sour</b> <b>gases</b> on cement pastes. The main effects of both gases, jointly or separately, on cement durability were, respectively, the carbonation process and the leaching of some components. Se simuló la acción agresiva de los denominados iones fundamentales (sulfato, cloruro y magnesio) y los gases agrios presentes en el gas natural (CO 2 y H 2 S) sobre un cemento API clase H utilizado en pozos gasíferos a presión y temperatura elevadas, al objeto de observar sus alteraciones fisicoquímicas por la acción combinada de tales gases y las aguas de formación. Se prepararon varias probetas del material cementante para su inmersión en disoluciones neutras, conteniendo los iones fundamentales en concentraciones fijas, dentro de reactores tipo Parr. Se analizaron durante más de dos meses una serie de disoluciones en contacto con el cemento utilizado; así como, mediante DRX, la evolución de la mineralogía de dicho material entre los 14 y los 60 días. Los principales efectos de ambos gases, en conjunto o por separado, sobre la durabilidad del cemento fueron, respectivamente, la formación de carbonato cálcico y la lixiviación de algunos componentes...|$|R
25|$|In 1982, {{the company}} was {{drilling}} a <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> well, which blew wild. Especially because the company had experienced a serious blowout in the same gas field five years earlier, regulatory and public opprobrium was intense.

2500|$|In this {{spectacular}} event, <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> flowed at {{an estimated}} rate of [...] per day.

During that time hydrogen sulphide from the blowout took the lives of two blowout specialists and sent another 16 people to hospital. Today, operators are required to ignite the well quickly {{in the event of a}} major <b>sour</b> <b>gas</b> blowout. This eliminates the dangers of highly toxic hydrogen sulphide in the air.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{reported}} to protect carbon steel pipelines for wet transport of sweet and <b>sour</b> <b>gases</b> from internal corrosion up to the top-of-the line (TOL) by using corrosion inhibitors. The method functions not only at turbulent gas flow but also at stratified flow and even under stagnant conditions. According to the TOL spreading inhibitor concept inhibitor molecules are transported with a spreading liquid film (produced by spreading-active compounds) against the gravity from the bottom-of-the-line (BOL) along the pipe wall to the TOL. The thesis describes the universal applicabillity of this concept which works under all surface conditions encountered in sweet or <b>sour</b> wet <b>gas</b> transport lines. The surface can be metallic clean, covered with mill scale, rust or corrosion product scales. These surfaces can be dry, water wet or hydrophobic. Careful tuning of the spreading system, composed of the 1 - or 2 -phase BOL liquid, the spreading agent and the corrosion inhibitor, yields optimum corrosion protection on the entire pipeline surface also at high water condensation rates...|$|R

The new developed method works for pressures ranging from 1000 to 15, 000 kPa and temperatures from 15 to 120 °C. Simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the water content of <b>sour</b> natural <b>gases</b> at various temperatures and pressures without performing any experimental measurements. In particular, gas process engineers would find the proposed approach to be user friendly involving no complex expressions with transparent calculations.

A new permeation set up has been built to determine the water vapor and nitrogen transport rates from mixed gas experiments at temperatures up to 80 °C and 80 bar. The diffusion coefficient of water decreases with activity when determined from sorption and permeation experiments. The water vapor permeability decreases and the nitrogen permeability increases with increasing temperature. This behavior causes the water nitrogen selectivity to decrease 2 orders of magnitude.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{superstructure}} optimization approach for {{the integration of the}} simultaneous production of liquid fuels and hydrogen from switchgrass and shale gas. The process is based on Fischer-Tropsch technology in which the shale gas is reformed with steam, while the switchgrass is gasified and reformed (with steam or partial oxidation). The raw gas is cleaned up and its composition may be adjusted (using either water gas shift reaction or pressure swift adsorption). Next, the <b>sour</b> <b>gases</b> are removed before the liquid fuels are produced using an FT reactor. The heavy liquids are upgraded using hydrocracking to increase the yield towards FT-diesel. A sensitivity study on the raw material prices reveals that production costs for the biomass-shale gas facility are below $ 1 /gal as long as biomass price is below $ 100 /t and the price of the shale gas is not higher than $ 11. 5 /MMBTU.
