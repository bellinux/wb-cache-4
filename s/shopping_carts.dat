For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling <b>shopping</b> <b>carts,</b> Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E

Five days later he stole a car and drove to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, {{on the morning of}} January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in <b>shopping</b> <b>carts.</b>|$|E

Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or green roofs, which absorb storm water and cut down on surface runoff, mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds.

People with {{disability}} {{have to face}} a lot {{of problems}} in their day-to-day life due to the flexibility issues. One such issue is using the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> in the grocery stores. Using <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> becomes very difficult, as they have to control the movement of the wheel chair and shopping chair at the same time while placing the grocery in the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> which is an extra burden on the user. They would have to constantly control the movement of the cart, as there would be lot of obstacles in the store which becomes a very big problem for the user. The aim of my project is to design a device to connect a wheel chair with a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> The device would be designed {{in such a way that}} the user would be able to connect the wheel chair with the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> sitting in the wheel chair without anyone???s help. This would give them that flexibility to do the things on their own instead of depending on others. This would also help them to place the grocery in the cart easily as the length of the device is smaller than the length of the average arm. The user does not have to apply a lot of effort in controlling the movement of the wheel chair and <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> as the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> would act just like an extension of the wheel chair, which makes it very easy to control. The device is portable and the cost would also be very cheap as the individual parts used in the device are easily manufactured. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

[...] The film was shot in fifty-four days on over thirty locations. Joe Scheffer's workplace was shot at Waterford Towers in Plymouth, Minnesota. Production designer Jackson De Govia transformed the fourth floor of the New Age office building into a drop ceiling corporate environment, which serves as a community to its employees. The Club 13 scenes were filmed at the Grand Hotel Minneapolis, while the karaoke scenes were shot at Grumpy's Bar & Grill, both in Minneapolis. The scenes of Tim Allen and Patrick Warburton racing their <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> were shot at the Target store in North St. Paul.

2500|$|The {{area around}} Lenox has grown immensely {{in the past}} few decades {{following}} its opening, with expanding retail developments and over 75 restaurants within a mile radius, which has made the area a highly desirable location to live and work. A two-story Target store sits across from Lenox at Lenox Marketplace, connected inside via escalators and elevators designed for <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> as well as shoppers, and having checkouts on both levels at the exits to a parking deck. Other stores at Lenox Marketplace include Dick's Sporting Goods and Neiman Marcus Last Call (Previously the site of a Filene's Basement). [...] The Sembler Company was the developer. In addition, Phipps Plaza is located to the northeast of Lenox Square across Peachtree Road. Traffic levels around Lenox are high and the streets are confusing for those unfamiliar with the area. Georgia 400 opened in 1993, restricting traffic to and from the west after it cut many existing roads. However, the BUC (Buckhead Uptown Connection), the free shuttle bus service around Buckhead, is available, supported voluntarily by a self-taxing district (Buckhead CID) which includes Lenox, and by GRTA and other agencies. The Peachtree Streetcar initiative would also extend free or low-fare streetcars to Lenox in the north, through midtown and downtown, to a proposed mixed-use redevelopment around historic Fort McPherson, [...] south. MARTA, the city's main mass transit system, provides one station across the street from the J W Marriott, as well as the Buckhead station a quarter mile Northwest on Peachtree Road.|$|E

Marketers can count how many of the <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> used in a specified period result in completed sales versus how many are abandoned. The abandonment rate is the ratio of the number of abandoned <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> to the number of initiated transactions or to the number of completed transactions.
