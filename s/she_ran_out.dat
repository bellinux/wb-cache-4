This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied. Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, {{that it could have}} been shorter, and that <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of time and energy as she tried to finish it.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Sartain met Mary Cassatt in Philadelphia and the {{following}} year they left for Paris, London, Parma, and Turin to study painting. The women spent the first winter in Italy and studied printmaking with Carlo Raimondi, who taught engraving at the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma. Sartain {{spent the rest of}} the four-year stay in Paris and studied under Évariste Vital Luminais. She shared a studio with Jeanne Rongier. Florence Esté, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, when <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education. Emily believed Hattie was likely to continue to help with education expenses in Philadelphia where expenses were lower and she would more likely sell her works.|$|E

5|$|Graduating from Richardson High in 1959, Rice {{completed}} {{her freshman year}} at Texas Woman's University in Denton and transferred to North Texas State College for her sophomore year, but dropped out when <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money {{and was unable to}} find employment. She soon decided to move to San Francisco, and received permission from her friend, Dennis Percy, to stay with his family there until she found work as an insurance claims processor. She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the Haight-Ashbury district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at University of San Francisco, an all-male Jesuit school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to enroll in a nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him. They married on October 14, 1961, in Denton, Texas, soon after she turned twenty years old, and when he was just weeks from his nineteenth birthday.|$|E

When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the girls did not take it seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E

She put him and his sister in the car she was driving at the time, a silver 1998 two-door Acura Integra, and headed for Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue. She later stated that around the 2600 block of 112th Street N.E. in that city, a long undeveloped section of the road that follows a tall concrete noise barrier around the curve of the Washington State Route 520 expressway, just west of its interchange with Interstate 405, <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of gas.|$|E

Thanksgiving passed with no contact, but Dills convinced herself that Judge Williams wouldn't leave her in jail through Christmas. She briefly saw a drug counselor on December 8 who informed her {{that there would be}} no drug court until January because Judge Williams was on vacation. Dills lost hope, and when an opportunity presented itself, she tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrists. Her attempt was discovered before she bled out, and her life was saved.|$|E
25|$|Willis is {{a suspect}} in the unsolved murder of 15-year-old Fruitport High School student Angela Marie Thornburg, whose partially-clothed body was found by a hunter on October 17, 1996 in the woods near I-96 in Fruitport. She went missing a month earlier and was {{initially}} considered a runaway, with sightings of her reported soon after. Reports from the time said <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> a back door at her boyfriend's house when her mother came to pick her up. Willis graduated from the same school in 1988 and worked as a janitor for the school district from 1998–1999 before being fired for looking at pornography on a computer meant for students in an elementary school.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{was part}} of the 2010 World Twenty20 winning team in the West Indies and played in all of Australia's matches. She was the player of the match in the final. In the first warm-up match against New Zealand, which Australia lost by 18 runs, Perry took 1/22 from three overs, {{removing}} Elizabeth Perry for 10. She then made 2 not out from 2 balls at the end of Australia's innings.

500|$|In November 2014, LaBeouf {{stated that}} a woman had [...] "stripped [...] {{clothing}} and proceeded to rape [...] " [...] the previous February during the trio's #IAMSORRY performance in Los Angeles, while Rönkkö and Turner clarified that they had prevented the assault by intervening {{as soon as they}} were aware of the incident starting to occur. In response to Piers Morgan's questions on Twitter as to why the woman was not detained, Turner stated that <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> before it was clear precisely what had happened, and that the first priority had been to ensure everybody's safety in the gallery. When later asked whether they regretted not having a code of conduct for participants during the exhibit, Turner said, [...] "I don’t think you need a notice on the wall saying 'Do not murder the artist'." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of her many trips to North America, Pankhurst became fond of Canada, stating in an {{interview}} that [...] "there seems to be more equality between men and women [...] than in any other country I know." [...] In 1922 she applied for Canadian [...] "permission to land" [...] (a prerequisite to status as a [...] "British Subject with Canadian Domicile") and rented a house in Toronto, where she moved with her four adopted children. She became active with the Canadian National Council for Combating Venereal Diseases (CNCCVD), which worked against the sexual double-standard which Pankhurst considered particularly harmful to women. During a tour of Bathurst, the mayor showed her a new building which would become the Home for Fallen Women. Pankhurst replied: [...] "Ah! Where is your Home for Fallen Men?" [...] Before long, however, she grew tired of long Canadian winters, and <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money. She returned to England in late 1925.|$|E
500|$|Budington's {{decision}} to beach the Polaris is equally controversial. Budington {{said that he}} [...] "believed the propeller was smashed and the rudder broken". The official report of the expedition states that the vessel should have been abandoned because [...] "there was only coal {{enough to keep the}} fires alive for five days". However, the same report states that the propeller and rudder were in fact discovered to be intact after the ship was run aground, and the ship's boiler and sails were available. Even if <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of coal, the ship was perfectly able to travel under sail alone. In defense of Budington's decision, when low tide exposed the ship's hull, the men found that the stem had completely broken away at the six-foot mark, taking iron sheeting and planking with it. Budington wrote in his journal that he [...] "called the officer's attention to it, who only wondered she had kept afloat so long".|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Lukasz Gottwald (Dr. Luke) {{had just}} {{finished}} producing tracks for Kelly Clarkson's album Breakaway (2004) and was looking to expand further on his writing and producing credits. Luke solicited around to different people {{in the music business}} asking for demos from unknown artists. Two of the demos he received were from Katy Perry and Kesha. He was particularly taken with Kesha's demos which consisted of a self-penned country ballad and trip-hop track. The latter of the demos caught Luke off guard when <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of lyrics and started to rap, [...] "I'm a white girl/From the 'Ville/Nashville, bitch. Uhh. Uhhhhh." [...] The improvisation made her stand out from other artists that Luke had listened to, which he recalled: [...] "That's when I was like, 'OK, I like this girl's personality. When you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of bravado and chutzpah stand out." [...] Following this, at the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs.|$|E
500|$|In her autobiography, Hill {{explains}} {{how she had}} [...] "underestimated" [...] how complicated climbing The Nose in a day would be with a film crew. Endless complications arose, such as the American coproducer backing out at the last minute, the soundman and cameraman refusing to rappel down the summit because they were afraid, and minor technical problems such as dead batteries. Hill herself had to coordinate many of the logistics because the producer had abandoned the project. Her first attempt to free climb The Nose in a day was plagued with problems. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of chalk after 22 pitches, very nearly ran out of water and was taxed by the intense heat. She tried again soon after. On September 19 at 10pm, she and her partner Steve Sutton, began the ascent again, this time without a film crew. After 23 hours, she had free climbed the entire route. In his book on the changing culture of Yosemite climbers, Joseph Taylor explains that Hill's ascent of The Nose demonstrates how climbing in the Yosemite Valley had altered from its origins in 1960s counterculture to become a [...] "consumable experience". Hill staged {{what he describes as}} a [...] "spectacle", filming the event [...] "to capture the spontaneity of her one-day ascent", but she was only successful when not surrounded by a film crew.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Kerrigan {{appears in}} [...] {{halfway through the}} first chapter of the game. She and Confederate officer Jim Raynor are tasked by Arcturus Mengsk, the leader of the militant rebel group Sons of Korhal, with {{starting}} a revolution on the fringe colony world of Antiga Prime by assassinating the presiding officers of the ruling Confederacy of Man. In response, the Confederacy blockades the planet as the insectoid Zerg Swarm begin to invade the surface, and Mengsk orders a skeptical Kerrigan to plant a psi emitter—stolen Confederate technology that attracts Zerg to it—to lure the Zerg into breaking the blockade, allowing the Sons of Korhal to escape. The Sons of Korhal then directly attack the Confederate capital world Tarsonis. During the attack, Mengsk, without consulting his officers, uses the psi emitters to ensure the complete destruction of the planet by the Zerg. The Zerg are subsequently attacked by the Protoss, a race of psionic aliens who attempt to stop further Zerg advancement and conquest. Kerrigan is sent with a detachment of troops to stop the Protoss from interfering with the Zerg rampage, but her position is overrun by the Zerg and she is abandoned by Mengsk. She was eventually captured for infestation after <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of ammo. As Raynor deserts Mengsk in disgust, Kerrigan is presumed dead.|$|E

500|$|Putana (also {{called as}} poothani), the [...] "killer of infants", {{was sent by}} Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the {{disguise}} of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) {{as a manifestation of}} goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna into her lap and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. [...] However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away(prana), as well as her milk. (Putana had got blessing [...] in her previous life from Lord Vishnu that she will meet lord Vishnu's avtaar in human form in her next life but she forgot about it). In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of the town with Krishna still clinging to her and finally fell dead. [...] She then assumed her real demonic form, turning trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust. The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke rose out of the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast-feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashodha, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.|$|E
