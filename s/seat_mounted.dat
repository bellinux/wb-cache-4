The Tree of Woe was layers of plaster and Styrofoam applied onto a {{skeleton}} {{of wood and}} steel. It was mounted on a turntable, allowing it to be rotated to ensure {{the angle of the}} shadows remained consistent throughout three days of filming. Schwarzenegger sat on a bicycle <b>seat</b> <b>mounted</b> in the tree while fake nails were affixed to his wrists and feet. The scene in which Valeria and Subotai fought off ghosts to save Conan and the final battle with Doom's forces were filmed in the salt marshes of Almerimar.

500|$|The next {{acquisition}} of locomotives took {{place after the}} British Moss Peat Company was acquired by Fisons in 1963. They ordered three [...] machines from R A Lister and Company, who were based in Dursley, Gloucestershire. They consisted of {{little more than an}} engine and driver's <b>seat</b> <b>mounted</b> on a chassis, and were used on the moors where the peat was loaded into wagons, only returning to the works for maintenance. Two were delivered to Swinefleet in 1964, and one went to Hatfield. A second machine for the Hatfield operation was ordered in 1967. Wooden peat trucks were gradually phased out following the purchase of 100 steel wagons in 1963 and 1964. They were manufactured in Leeds by Robert Hudson (Raletrux) Ltd, and were subsequently fitted with a fine inner mesh, to enable them to carry fragmented peat rather than turves. The new wagons had a side-opening door, and a tippler was installed to allow them to be emptied automatically.|$|E
2500|$|A monoski, {{also known}} as a sit-ski, {{consists}} of a molded <b>seat</b> <b>mounted</b> on a metal frame. A shock absorber beneath the seat eases riding on uneven terrain and helps in turning by maximizing ski-snow contact. Modern monoskis interface with a single, ordinary alpine ski by means of a [...] "ski foot," [...] a metal or plastic block {{in the shape of a}} boot sole that clicks into the ski's binding. A monoskier uses outriggers for stability; an outrigger resembles a forearm crutch with a short ski on the bottom. People new to mono-skiing are often surprised to see how much terrain is skiable in a monoski; advanced monoskiers can be found not only carving turns on groomed runs but also skiing moguls, terrain parks, race courses, glades and even backcountry terrain—in short, wherever stand-up skiers can go.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{high level}} {{vibration}} of helicopter flight can cause physiological {{harm to the}} aircrew and may lead to occupational health issues. This article presents {{the development of an}} adaptive helicopter <b>seat</b> <b>mount</b> to reduce the vibration levels transmitted to the aircrew body. Flight test on a Bell- 412 helicopter was conducted to measure the aircrew body vibra-tion levels and vibration transmission through the seat structures. Experimental modal anal-ysis on a Bell- 412 co-pilot seat equipped with a mannequin was carried out to investigate the seat/aircrew dynamics and identify critical vibration modes. Based on observations from the configuration, an adaptive helicopter <b>seat</b> <b>mount</b> has been developed. Two stacked piezoelec-tric actuators were installed on the seat frame as active struts to provide effective control authority to the critical mannequin vibration modes. A proof-of-concept adaptive helicopter seat has been retrofitted on a full-scale Bell- 412 co-pilot seat and the performance has been evaluated through extensive closed-loop control experiments. Test results demonstrated simul-taneous suppression of the critical mannequin vibration modes and achieved significant global reduction of the body vibration levels, which verified the effectiveness of the adaptive helicopter <b>seat</b> <b>mount</b> concept for helicopter aircrew vibration reduction applications. Key Words: stacked piezoelectric actuator, helicopter seat vibration control, adaptive real-time controller...|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} riveted aluminum tubing, with the wings and tail covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its 30 ft span wing is supported by V-struts with jury struts. The wing features half-span ailerons. The tail is a strut-braced cruciform tail. The fuselage consists of an aluminum keel tube that runs from the nose wheel to the tail. The pilot is accommodated on an open <b>seat</b> <b>mounted</b> to the main keel tube and a second seat can be fitted under the wing.|$|E

It was known by various names in different markets (Break in France, Safari and Estate in the UK, Wagon in the US, and Citroën Australia used the terms Safari and Station-Wagon). It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. 'Familiales' had a rear <b>seat</b> <b>mounted</b> further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between {{the front and rear}} squabs.

50|$|The typical early horse-drawn {{hay rake}} was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved steel or iron teeth usually operated from a <b>seat</b> <b>mounted</b> over the rake with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This rake gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the rake, turn around and drop the teeth to rake {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep rake, which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|E
