5|$|An ad for Universal {{is visible}} while Kong is tearing up Times Square. In the 1933 film, {{an ad for}} Columbia Pictures {{appeared}} in the <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> and the production designers replicated it, but Columbia asked for {{a large amount of}} money for its use, so effects artists replaced it.|$|E
5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} {{were built}} {{on the site of}} the massacre in 1955. A monument called Gudovac—Before the Firing Squad, by the Serb sculptor Vojin Bakić, was erected on the <b>same</b> <b>spot.</b> In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars, the monument and mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists. Also destroyed was one of Bakić's most famous monuments, Bjelovarac (The Man from Bjelovar). Bakić had dedicated the monument to his brothers, who were killed by the Ustaše. What remained of the ossuary was removed by the local authorities in 2002. That year, residents signed a petition to have a replica of Bjelovarac erected at the <b>same</b> <b>spot.</b> The local government promised to supply half the amount needed to restore the monument. In 2005, the Croatian Ministry of Culture advised the petitioners to apply for a tender in order to pay the other half. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{the vacant}} {{site of the}} former synagogue {{was used as a}} {{makeshift}} volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day.|$|E
25|$|This <b>same</b> <b>spotting</b> {{rifle and}} round was later adopted for the US 83mm Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW).|$|R
50|$|Ades was {{survived by}} his {{daughter}} and two sons from his first marriage. His daughter, Ruth Ades-Laurent, began selling the peelers in the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> as her father, but was later forbidden from selling in Union Square.|$|R
50|$|Under side: sides, breast, and abdomen pale yellow. Legs {{brown and}} yellow. Wings pale yellow, with the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> and marks {{as on the}} upper side, but more distinct. The wings are a little angulated. Wing-span nearly 2½ inches (62 mm).|$|R
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
5|$|The present Budolfi Church, {{which has}} {{the status of a}} cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century, {{although}} at least two earlier churches stood on the <b>same</b> <b>spot.</b> Built in the Gothic style, it consists of a nave flanked by two aisles, a tower, and a porch. After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663, the striking new Baroque tower, based on that of an earlier Copenhagen city hall, was completed in 1779. The church has 16th-century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque altarpiece from 1689 created by Lauridtz Jensen.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 8.5 mm. The forewings are buckthorn brown with tawny-olive spots along the costal margin, edged with sepia. These <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> are found along the termen. There is a large sepia patch from near the apex. The hindwings are olive brown.|$|R

5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the <b>same</b> <b>spot.</b> Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|As Rosberg was {{comfortably in}} the lead, still 18 seconds ahead of Vettel, Verstappen took ninth place from Massa going into turn one on lap 46. Red Bull {{teammate}} Ricciardo also gained a place, at Hülkenberg's expense, at the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> three laps later. With Räikkönen facing a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line, Pérez behind him {{would not have}} to pass him to achieve third place as long as he stayed within five seconds of him. Pérez nevertheless made the move on the final lap to finish in the final podium position. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg crossed the line to win the Grand Prix, more than 16 seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
50|$|Pottersville {{was founded}} on March 25, 1799 {{as a part of}} the Town of Chester, Warren County. The town was mainly agricultural; most {{families}} owned livestock, such as sheep, for access to clothing material. Carding mills and tanneries were eventually built as the first forms of manufacturing outside of the home. In 1805, roads connecting Town of Chester were opened and are in the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> today.|$|R
50|$|The lemon pansy is a {{very active}} {{butterfly}} and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very {{low to the ground}} and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly strong flier and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back in the <b>same</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Sweifieh {{has a lot}} of family-oriented spots. The malls of Sweifieh {{are usually}} filled by {{families}} during the days and afternoons, whereas the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> are occupied by a younger crowd during the night time. Sweifieh also has a high number of renowned schools, such as The English School, the British International Community School, the Modern American School, and the First Patriarch Diodoros School, a Greek Orthodox school.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the <b>same</b> <b>spot.</b> Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> it had occupied for 38years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E
5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops a {{polished}} crown while bringing his father a coat. The Siren is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the Siren has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the victims are not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the Siren to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible in the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "The Sweetest Days" [...] is shot in two {{different}} ways. The [...] "romantic version" [...] was shot in an apartment overlooking a city skyline while the [...] "urban version" [...] shows Williams walking in a park and through streets. There are a few clips that they both share in the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> but for the 3-minute and 31-second video, they give the song a different feel.|$|R
50|$|A {{diamond shape}} (4 stones {{touching}} the <b>same</b> empty <b>spot)</b> {{is considered a}} ponnuki only when constructed by capturing the middle stone.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{for a limited}} run in April, 2008 at the Paragon Cineplex in Bangkok, Thailand in its censored form. In protest of the censoring, the director inserted black, scratched film trailer in place {{of each of the}} censored scenes, the same length as the scenes that were cut. The result is that the audience experiences no sound and no picture for the same time and in the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> in the film as the censored scenes.|$|R
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently {{as a result}} of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher had crashed in the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> {{as a result of}} a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E
5|$|In second {{practice}} on Thursday afternoon, Ricciardo was fastest, setting {{a time of}} 1:14.607, {{more than half a}} second clear of Hamilton in second place. Rosberg and Verstappen, in third and fourth, were the only other drivers to get within a second of Ricciardo, while the two Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa struggled, ending the session 14th and 16th respectively. At Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen was fastest in seventh spot. His teammate, Vettel, had an incident-packed session that eventually ended with him setting the ninth fastest time. He spun at Mirabeau corner, damaging his rear wing, only to hit the wall in turn one after coming back to the track, albeit continuing with wheel rim damage. A VSC period occurred after Romain Grosjean crashed into the outside barrier at the exit of the tunnel. Two more VSC periods ensued when Rio Haryanto touched the inside barrier at the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> and later after Kevin Magnussen crashed at the final corner.|$|E
50|$|Since 2001 when Flamengo {{clinched}} the tri and Vasco the Mercosur Cup, both {{teams have been}} plagued by financial problems and have simultaneously reached an unprecedented decadence, struggling to avoid the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> of relegation to Brazilian second division. Vasco (2003) and Flamengo (2004 - over Vasco, again) still won since one state league title each. In their seemingly atavistic manner of crossing in each other's way, both teams recently managed to reach the finals of Brazilian Cup scheduled for July 2006.|$|R
2500|$|Griffith Park was {{the busiest}} {{destination}} in Los Angeles for on-location filming in 2011, with 346 production days, {{according to a}} [...] survey. Projects included the TV shows Criminal Minds and The Closer. With its wide variety of scenes and close proximity to Hollywood and Burbank, many different production crews have found new ways and angles to film the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> and make them look different. One would {{be hard pressed to}} find a spot in Griffith Park which has not been filmed or taped.|$|R
50|$|On {{permanent}} {{display is}} also the old inspection room or Staalmeesterskamer where cloth was inspected and the meeting hall where disputes were decided. Four large paintings depicting the cloth industry by Isaac van Swanenburg hang in the <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> on the walls as designed. Similarly, a very grand over-the-mantel piece by Carel de Moor shows the inspectors in a massive wooden frame decorated with their family shields, flanked {{by a series of}} three historical allegories of the city of Leiden by Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel.|$|R
5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922. It is considered the charcuterie of the connoisseurs. Despite the Greek economic crisis, Miran is expanding its {{business and}} has doubled in size to accommodate increased demand. The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, {{is thought to be}} the man who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has been in the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E
5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
50|$|Several covered bridges have spanned Thomas Creek {{since the}} late 19th century, some of them {{replacements}} for damaged or demolished bridges at the <b>same</b> <b>spots.</b> Three of these bridges—Gilkey, Shimanek, and Hannah—still cross the creek, while two—Weddle and Jordan—have been moved to cities outside the Thomas Creek watershed. The three that still cross the creek are on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Weddle Bridge was listed on the NRHP in 1979 but delisted in 1991 after its move to Sweet Home.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Lakhpur built a dharamshala {{on the spot}} where the congregations were held. Later, Gurdwara Sahib Guru Granth Sahib was built on the <b>same</b> exact <b>spot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence, a male {{crocodile}} with an English accent, {{is a minor}} {{character on}} Rubbadubbers and is practically identical to Terence. He can do amazing tie-tricks, he also dislikes getting splashed, he has 2 white teeth, the same yellow eyes, he wears the same collar, has the same yellow body, but the only difference is, his necktie that he always wears is blue. He only appears in the episode Terence's Double Trouble. Lawrence has the exact <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> down his back, but he doesn't have a red toothbrush like Terence.
