500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} <b>surface</b> <b>milling,</b> which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Milling {{is one of}} the {{progressive}} enhancements of miniaturized technologies which have wide range of application in industries and other related areas. Milling like any metal cutting operation is used with an objective of optimizing surface roughness at micro level and economic performance at macro level. In addition to surface finish, modern manufacturers do not want any compromise on the achievement of high quality, dimensional accuracy, high production rate, minimum wear on the cutting tools, cost saving and increase of the performance of the product with minimum environmental hazards. Interactive (three-dimensional) solid modeling is used in the development of relatively efficient and fast solutions to the many constraints and/or limitations encountered in the design process. In this Paper the design aspects of <b>surface</b> <b>milling</b> cutter is analyzed. The objective considered is the design and modeling of <b>surface</b> <b>milling</b> cutter and to analyse various stress components acting on it. Various designing strategies are considered to design the effective <b>surface</b> <b>milling</b> cutter like outer diameter, inner diameter, radius, teeth angle etc. The design and analysis is carried out using the softwares like CATIA V 5 and ANSY...|$|E

40|$|The {{pavement}} {{analysis in}} this study considers various combinations of pavement rehabilitation treatments (two-course HMA overlay with or without <b>surface</b> <b>milling,</b> concrete pavement restoration, three-course HMA overlay with or without <b>surface</b> <b>milling,</b> three-course HMA overlay with crack and seat of PCC pavement and 3 -R and 4 -R overlay or replacement treatments). Six road functional classes (rural and urban of interstates, non-interstates of the NHS, and non-interstates non-NHS) are considered. This allows for estimation of the performance and service life of the pavement, corresponding to each treatment and road functional class. Main findings; • More than 95 percent of the data points of the RUT pavement performance indicator were below 0. 5 inches indicating {{that this type of}} distress has become relatively rare on INDOT highways. • Data points of the PCR were scattered in a very narrow range (between a PCR value of 70 and 100) compared to the scatter of the IRI and deflection. Consequently, distinct thresholds can be obtained from the wide scatter of the IRI and the deflection. This suggests that IRI and deflection are more reliable performance measures than PCR when programming pavement rehabilitation treatments. • Two-course hot mix asphalt, HMA, overlay (with or without <b>surface</b> <b>milling)</b> treatments were found to have a forecasted average annual deterioration in IRI of roughly 6 in/mi. • Three-course HMA overlay with or without <b>surface</b> <b>milling</b> treatments were found to have a forecasted annual average deterioration in IRI of about 5 in/mi. Three-course HMA overlay with crack and seat of PCC pavement treatments were found to have a forecasted average annual deterioration in IRI of roughly 4 in/mi. Pavement projects identified as 3 -R and 4 -R overlay or replacement treatments were found to have a forecasted average deterioration in IRI in the range of 4 to 5 in/mi. Concrete pavement restoration treatments were found to have a forecasted average annual deterioration in IRI of roughly 7 in/mi. • Average service life of two-course HMA overlay (with or without <b>surface</b> <b>milling)</b> was found to be roughly 10 years; 12 years for concrete pavement restoration; 12 years for three-course HMA overlay (with or without surface milling); 15 years for threecourse HMA overlay with crack and seat of PCC pavement; and 15 years for 3 -R and 4 -R overlay or replacement treatments. These numbers match closely with the estimated service lives in the current INDOT design manual. • Unit cost of pavement rehabilitation treatment was strongly correlated (with a high degree of statistical confidence) to the service life prediction and consequently was used in the performance prediction models...|$|E
