Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he {{replaced it with a}} more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was one {{of three}} sons of Welsh noble Tudur Hen (English: Tudur the Elder) and Anghared fil Ithel Fychan, {{alongside}} Madog ap Tudur Hen and Hywel ap Tudur Hen. Tudor Hen had first been in service to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd, but retained his titles under the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England. But during the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn, Tudur acted as his steward. After the rebellion failed, Tudur pledged his loyalty to Edward. Utilising the more advantageous property laws of England, Tudur <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that his lands were passed seamlessly upon his death in 1311 into the hands of Goronwy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> {{that there were no}} evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters {{on their sides}} and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E
50|$|Other useful {{power tools}} are a belt sander, {{especially}} if using recycled timber or for finishing rough-sawn timber. A thicknesser/planer is only needed if building many boats or larger vessels, {{as it is}} usually cheaper to pay a joiner {{to do this for}} a small amount of timber. A bench saw is useful if you buy larger sectioned timber, which may be considerably cheaper and need <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the correct size, but again a timber yard will do this for a small charge.|$|R

White, who deferred socially to his older, more street-wise teammates, became friendly with a guard, coincidentally named Eddie Gard. White liked him for his personable nature and sense of style. Gard, however, was also thievish, and it was he who ultimately got White involved in the point shaving scandal that followed.|$|E
25|$|After Gagliano's {{retirement}} or death, Lucchese became {{boss and}} appointed Vincenzo Rao as his consigliere and Stefano LaSalle as his underboss. Lucchese continued with Gagliano's policies, making the now Lucchese family {{one of the}} most profitable in New York. Lucchese established control over Teamsters union locals, workers' co-operatives and trade associations, and rackets at the new Idlewild Airport. Lucchese also expanded family rackets in Manhattan's Garment District and in related trucking industry around New York City. Lucchese built close relations with many powerful New York politicians, including Mayors William O'Dwyer and Vincent Impellitteri and members of the judiciary, who aided the family on numerous occasions. Throughout his regime, Lucchese kept a low profile and <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that his men were well taken care of.|$|E
25|$|At {{forty years}} of age and a very wealthy man, Marks started {{thinking}} about marriage. He returned to Sheffield in England and married Bertha Guttmann, eighteen years his junior. This was an arranged marriage set up by Bertha's father who helped with Sammy's success during the years. Bertha was only 5 years old when Sammy set foot on the Cape's soil. From this union nine children were born, six boys and three girls. Only six children survived infancy. Having himself received a limited schooling, Marks set great store by education and <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that the children were taught at home by governesses – boys until the age of eight, girls until the age of twelve and then they were sent to private schools in England.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Flint eyed him. There was {{a mark of}} dignity, {{of silent}} power, on this tall scapegrace of a son of Hilary Vane that the {{railroad}} president had missed at first--probably because he had looked only for the scapegrace. Mr. Flint ardently desired to treat the matter in the trifling aspect in which he believed he <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>it</b> off genially. But an instinct not yet formulated told the president that he was {{face to face with}} an enemy whose potential powers were not to be despised, and he bristled in spite of himself.|$|R

25|$|Impington Village College is {{the main}} {{secondary}} school in the area. It was opened in 1939 (and had its 75 anniversary in 2014), {{two weeks after the}} outbreak of World War II, making it the fourth Village College to be opened in Cambridgeshire. As a village college, it was originally intended to encompass all aspects of learning in the village, and included prominent space for adult education and 1st Histon Scouts. Henry Morris, founder of the Village College system, <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that prominent architects were employed to design these colleges. The college was designed by Walter Gropius, founder of The Bauhaus School of Architecture, and his partner Maxwell Fry. This is the only example of Gropius’s work in Britain and the building is now Grade I listed building.|$|E
25|$|Crawford {{first went}} to sea aboard {{merchant}} vessels, trading with North America, before joining the navy during the American War of Independence. He saw action on shore on several occasions, distinguishing himself in the defence of Savannah and the siege of Charleston.

During this conflict he was heavily engaged on numerous occasions with Spanish gunboats, and {{came to the attention of}} Roger Curtis, later to become a prominent naval officer. After a period of unemployment following the end of the American War of Independence, Curtis <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that Crawford was offered a position in the fleet during the Spanish Armament.

25|$|Peter Herdic {{used his}} wealth to gain {{political}} power in Williamsport and Lycoming County, and led the drive to have Williamsport chartered as a city in 1866. He spent $20,000 to get elected mayor of Williamsport in 1869. Local saloon keepers reported that Herdic would leave $10 and $20 bills among the bottles of their taverns for anybody that would vote {{for him in the}} election. Prior to Herdic's arrival, the Newberry section of Williamsport was known as Jaysburg and had vied with Williamsport to be the county seat of Lycoming County. Herdic <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that the rival community on the west bank of Lycoming Creek would no longer compete with Williamsport by leading the cause to annex the community to Williamsport. Herdic had such influence {{that he was able to}} have the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad move their passenger station from the Pine Street area to his Herdic Hotel on West Fourth Street. Herdic was able to profit from this since the trains would now deposit their passengers at the door of his opulent hotel.|$|E
