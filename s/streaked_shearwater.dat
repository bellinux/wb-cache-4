40|$|<b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> (Calonectris leucomelas) {{breed in}} {{temperate}} regions of East and Southeast Asia {{and have been}} thought to migrate to tropical regions near the Equator after breeding. We documented the migratory and foraging behavior of this species using global location sensors (GLS). The GLS loggers were attached to 48 breeding birds in 2006 and were subsequently recovered from 38 birds in the following year. The <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> migrated from the seas around Japan to three wintering areas in the tropics, the seas off northern New Guinea, the Arafura Sea, and the South China Sea (4, 000, 5, 400, and 3, 500 km from the breeding colony, respectively). Most <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> wintered off northern New Guinea, an area of low primary productivity but high Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) abundance. <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> flew for longer periods and landed on the water more frequently around dawn and dusk during the wintering period. This pattern of activity {{is similar to that}} of subsurface predators such as tuna, and to that of tropical seabirds that are known to feed with subsurface predators. We suggest that <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> probably forage in association with subsurface predators in the tropical oceans during the wintering period. Foraging in association with subsurface predators and morphological adaptations for gliding may allow <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> to forage efficiently in both temperate and tropical environments...|$|R
40|$|Like most seabirds <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> Calonectris leucomelas have sexually {{monomorphic}} plumage. Researchers have conveniently identified {{gender in}} the field by means of two types of calls, associated with dimorphism in body size. By molecular sexing analysis using the chromo-helicase-DNA-binding (CHD) genes, we determined the gender of <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> in relation to call types and body size. We recorded the type of calls, measured body dimensions and collected non-invasive samples (buccal cells or feathers) of <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> at two breeding islands. As obvious amplification to identify gender by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{could not be obtained}} at high rates using a known universal primer pair, we developed two new primer pairs to identify gender in this species; this enabled us to identify the gender of all of the samples. Without exception all males gave high-pitched calls, whereas all females gave low-pitched calls. Molecular evidence also confirmed morphometric differences between males and females. We, therefore, conclude that <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> exhibit sexual dimorphism in body size and call type.

40|$|As {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of marine organisms is often affected by seasonal changes, pelagic seabirds may change their foraging areas in response to seasonal changes in the marine environment. Here, we examined the foraging area of <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwaters</b> Calonectris leucomelas, breeding at Sangan (SA) and Mikura Islands (MK), Japan, from spring to summer during pre-laying and incubation periods. Those colonies are located at {{the north and south}} of the Northwestern Pacific’s Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area where high seasonal temperature changes are observed, and where, consequently, birds may show comparable responses to such changes. Our results showed that <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwaters</b> from both colonies shifted their foraging areas northwards as the season progressed. The seasonal shift of foraging areas appeared to coincide with the movement pattern of pelagic fishes that migrate northward in association with the increase in water temperature. However, the pattern of seasonal movement differed between the 2 colonies; shearwaters from SA moved their foraging area along the coastal area of the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition, while those from MK moved along the Kuroshio Extension. Our results also indicated sex-related differences in this general pattern: females showed clear seasonal changes in foraging area, while males did not. During the pre-laying period males returned to the colony frequently to defend their nests or mates, and spent less time at sea. Our results suggest that <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwaters</b> changed their foraging areas in response to seasonal changes in the marine environment, although colony location and sex-related differences in reproductive roles may constrain the birds’ responses to seasonal change...|$|R

40|$|The {{energetics}} {{of adult}} <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> Calonectris leucomelas during the chick-rearing period were examined on Awa Island, Japan, in 2008 and 2009. Basal metabolic rates (BMR) were quantified using an open-flow respirometry system and field metabolic rates (FMR) were quantified using a doubly labelled water (DLW) method. In addition, we used activity loggers to estimate time allocations for different activities at sea. BMR was 0. 0124 kJ g(- 1) h(- 1) (+/- 0. 0153, N= 4) on average and corresponded to 54 % {{of the value}} predicted from allometric equations. FMR was 0. 0634 kJ g(- 1) h(- 1) (+/- 0. 0331, N= 3) and was equivalent to 5. 1 times BMR, which was higher than values reported for albatrosses (2 - 4 times BMR). Shearwaters made 50. 3 landings a day (+/- 9. 8, N= 12) and spent 44. 8 % (+/- 8. 0, N= 12) of their time sitting on the water. They landed on water approximately twice as often as albatrosses (which have been well-studied using DLW), but they both spent similar proportions of their time on water. Frequent landings at sea, and frequent takeoffs, may generate incremental energetic expenses because {{of the use of}} flapping flight; therefore, the <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwater's</b> relatively high FMR may be related to its high number of landings...|$|R

40|$|Plastics {{debris in}} the marine environment, {{including}} resin pellets, fragments and microscopic plastic fragments, contain organic contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides (2, 2 ′-bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, hexachlorinated hexanes), polybrominated diphenylethers, alkylphenols and bisphenol A, at concentrations from sub ng g– 1 to µg g– 1. Some of these compounds are added during plastics manufacture, while others adsorb from the surrounding seawater. Concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants adsorbed on plastics showed distinct spatial variations reflecting global pollution patterns. Model calculations and experimental observations consistently show that polyethylene accumulates more organic contaminants than other plastics such as polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride. Both a mathematical model using equilibrium partitioning and experimental data have demonstrated the transfer of contaminants from plastic to organisms. A feeding experiment indicated that PCBs could transfer from contaminated plastics to <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwater</b> chicks. Plasticizers, other plastics additives and constitutional monomers also present potential threats in terrestrial environments because they can leach from waste disposal sites into groundwater and/or surface waters.

40|$|The Fukushima nuclear {{accident}} in 2011 released signiﬁcant amounts of radionuclides into the marine environment. Exposure to radiation reduces levels of antioxidants such as carotenoids and vitamins A and E within exposed individuals. Such reductions can cause teratogenic or mutagenetic effects leading to reduced reproductive viability and ﬁtness. Reduced antioxidant levels therefore {{may be used}} as an indicator of radionuclide contamination and to infer individual or population level impacts; however, the taxa-speciﬁc responses of marine organisms, such as seabirds, are poorly understood. As top predators, seabirds are ideal bio-indicators of the prevalence of contaminants and pollutants in marine ecosystems. At-sea foraging distributions of Streaked Shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) from Mikura Island (MKR), Japan during the post egg-laying period coincide with the Fukushima nuclear plume while the breeding colony on Birou Island (BRU) lies outside the affected zone. We examined the physiological responses of <b>Streaked</b> <b>Shearwater</b> chicks at MKR and BRU to possible radiation exposure during the 2011 breeding season, four to seven months after the Fukushima {{nuclear accident}}. Fledging mass did not differ between islands but ﬂedglings from MKR displayed signiﬁcantly reduced vitamin A levels. Available information suggests these depletions most likely result from radiation exposure due to the Fukushima nuclear accident, implying that the risk of radionuclide contamination is considerably elevated for Streaked Shearwaters on MKR, where more than 60 % of the world’s population breeds. While additional negative impacts are expected due to delayed effects of radionuclide transport via biomagniﬁcation in the food chain, this study highlights the potential immediate and worrisome consequences of the Fukushima nuclear accident for marine wildlife...|$|E
40|$|Many animals migrate between {{breeding}} and wintering areas; however, whether each animal behaves consistently {{in space and}} time between consecutive years is less well understood. Furthermore, previous breeding state (successful or failed) is often not considered when attempting to understand consistent individual differences in behaviour that are likely to impact upon the subsequent behaviour. Between 2006 and 2010, we used geolocators to track the migratory movements of a pelagic seabird, the <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwater</b> Calonectris leucomelas, with individuals (N= 46) being followed for two years or more, including 23 birds that had chicks in two seasons and 23 birds in just one season. All individuals, except for one bird, migrated to the same broad wintering areas, and their migratory route as well as the centre of wintering distribution did not change in relation to the previous breeding outcomes. Migration schedules (dates of departure from the breeding colony, southward and northward migrations, and first return to the colony) did not differ significantly between years for individuals that had chicks during both years, while failed individuals left the breeding colony and appeared to start the southward migration at an earlier date than the previous successful year. Nonetheless, the timing of the southward migration was consistent within individuals, including both males and females, over successive years regardless of the previous breeding outcome, and also the timing of first return back to the colony for females that had chicks in the both previous years and eggs in the both following season. This may imply the existence of individual-specific broad time schedules, possibly a circannual rhythm, though ecological conditions might affect the exact timing of the actual departure event.

40|$|In {{general the}} fauna of an {{isolated}} island is interesting in {{the points of}} ecological and geographical views. Okino-shima (Lat. 34 ° 142 ̆ 7 N, Long. 1302 ̆ 2 062 ̆ 7 E) situated in the Japan Sea, 74. 9 km off Fukuoka City, is an islet about 4 km in circumference (Fig. 1). The whole islet consists of a mass of mountains surrounded by cliff. There is, however, only one gravel shore where the wharf is constructed at {{southern edge of the}} islet. A chain of four peaks runs from west to east along the major axis of the islet. A lighthouse stands above the summit of Mt. Ichino-take and two old batteries of war time remain at the summit of Mt. Shira-take and another place (Fig. 2). The whole islet belongs to the precinct of the Munakata Shrine. As the permanent residents, one Shinto priest and another lay man dwell in the shrine yard and besides them three lighthouse personnels work comming by turns. Some fishermen stay at some huts near the wharf in spring and winter fishing seasons. At the time of this survey, a number of laborers had been boarding together at some rude cabins for the purpose of repairing work of the wharf. As above mentioned, owing to the taboo of faith, difficulty of communication or strategic importance, the islet has been isolated from Kyushu for a long time. Therefore, influence of human power has not almost been imposed upon the islet and the vegetation consisted of evergreen broad- 1 aved trees shows an appearance of virgin forest. Ikeda & Yasumoto (1933) and Ohshima (1934 b) reported on chiefly shore animals, and Kuroda & Uchida (1959) described a new form of shrew, Crocidura suaveolens okinoshimae which is also interesting geologically, from the islet. We stayed at the islet to study the fauna from July 24 to 28, 1958. In this paper, has been described only the peculiarity of vertebrate fauna represented by the black rat, <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwater</b> and endemic lizard. The results obtained are as follows : Mammalian fauna is very poor {{as in the case of}} other islets. Murine fauna contains only one species, Rattus rattus (Linnaeus) all over the islet. The rats inhabit not only in the district of residence near the wharf and lighthouse (Fig. 2 -sts. B and C; Figs. 3 and 4), but in the forest (Fig. 2 -sts. A, D and E; Figs. 5 - 8). In addition to this, the population density seems to be relatively high. By the examination of the contents of stomachs, it became clear that the rats in the district of residence were semi-wild. As to the feeding habits, considerable difference was found between the semi-wild and the wild lives (Table 1). The rats were considered to be just after entrance to the breeding season judging from the inspection of their genital organs and age-constitution of captures. Such a peculiarity of murine fauna is attributed to simplicity of ecological environment and geographical condition which prevents from invasion of the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout) to the islet. Besides this, an endemic shrew was reported as above mentioned. One species of Chiroptera was found by Ikeda & Yasumoto (1933), specific name being unknown. Carnivora does not inhabit in the islet. Puffinus leucomelas (Temminck) which is the most dominant species of birds in the islet, inhabits at north-western and south-western parts of the islet (Fig. 9). The habitat is closely connected with the soil and the topography of the land. The birds were just in breeding season at the time of this survey, and either of the parents sat on an egg in the nest alternately day and night. It is very interesting that the birds inhabit sympathetically together with the black rats at the same habitat. This phenomenon can b. attributed to noncompetition for foods between both species. Only one endemic lizard is fairly numerous as reptile, and no amphibian species is found in the islet. This agrees with Ohshima 2 ̆ 7 s report. This seems to be attributed to environmental factors, such as spray of sea-water coming up to the top of mountain at the time of typhoon, together with the condition that no water puddle is made when it rains, the slope being very steep. The endemic lizard was identified as Eumeces latiscutatus latiscutatus (Hallowell) by Prof. Koba of Kumamoto University, though he noticed some differences between common and endemic ones as mentioned below. Measurements and scale character of six endemic lizards are shown in Table 2. The endemic lizards were measured more than 200 mm in total length (Fig. 10), and individuals which have 28 scale rows were found in fairly abundance (Table 3). In the common lizards, the first supraocular does not come in contact with posterior loreal, because the first superciliary which is more than twice the size of the last superciliary keeps touch with prefrontal (Fig. 11 -A). On the contrary, in the endemic lizards the first superciliary which is less than twice the size of the last one does not come in contact with prefrontal (Fig. 11 -B). It is desired to study further on this point basing on many specimens. 福岡県宗像郡大島村沖の島の動物相についてはすでに池田・安元(1933) および大島(1934 a,b) の報告があり,対象は主として汀棲動物にむけられている. これらの報告にはアワビ,サザエ,ヨメガカサ,カニダマシなどの磯の動物に非常に大形のものが少なくないこと,爬虫類としては大形のトカゲがあるのみで両棲類の棲息をみないこと,これに反してオオミズナギドリが広く棲息していることなど興味深い諸点が述べられている. 沖の島の哺乳動物相は小島の特徴の最たるものとして種類数がきわめて乏しい. 鼠とコウモリの棲息は知られているが,いずれも種不明であつた. オオミズナギドリの繁栄から食肉動物の欠如は明らかである. その後Kuroda&Uchida(1959) は同島からオキノシマコジネズミを報告した. 一般に離島の動物相はその生態地理学的特殊性と相まつて注目をひくものが多い. 同島の動物相をさらに解明すべく本学農学部動物学教室と昆虫学教室有志の協同の下に調査が行なわれた. 本報では特に鼠相の特殊性を論じ,あわせてオオミズナギドリの 2, 3 の生態観察およびトカゲの特異性について報告する. その他の鳥類については前記報告を参照されたい. 調査は昭和 33 年 7 月 24 日から 28 日にわたつた. 島への往復は福岡海上保安部巡視船 2 ̆ 2 わかちどり 2 ̆ 2 によつた. 島では福岡県の漁港修築工事監督員詰所に宿泊の便が与えられた. 本文を草するにあたり福岡海上保安部次長江原正大氏ほか保安官の方々,福岡県教育庁社会教育課筑紫豊氏,宗像神社宮司宗像辰美氏,同権禰宜神戸幸夫氏および沖の島在勤の神職氏の協力・援助に負う所が大きい. 厚く御礼申し上げる. また共に渡島して種々協力頂いた大島小学校教諭本松良則氏,昆虫学教室および当教室の諸氏に謝意を表する. なおトカゲの資料をまとめるにあたつては熊本大学教育学部木場一夫教授の御教示をうけた. 厚く御礼申し上げる...|$|E
40|$|Organisms in polar and {{temperate}} regions live in {{a seasonal}} environment where they experience regular changes in resources and/or weather conditions. Exploring how organisms respond to seasonality in environment, {{and what kind of}} environmental characteristics influence their distributions is fundamental for understanding their habitat requirements as well as adaptations in behaviour, physiology and morphology to the environment. Recent advances in tracking technologies enable us to examine the foraging movements of a variety of seabird species during the breeding season, and to identify inter-specific and sexual segregations as well as individual consistency in foraging area. In contrast, seabird distributions outside the breeding season are much less documented due to the technical and practical difficulties. Therefore, understanding of how individual seabirds respond to seasonal changes in the marine environment during the non-breeding period, and if such the response differs between sexes, among colonies, or within individuals has been elusive. The aims of this study were to examine the seasonal movement patterns of a pelagic seabird, the <b>streaked</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Calonectris leucomelas), during the non-breeding period (including post-breeding, migration, wintering, and pre-laying periods) in relation to (1) seasonal changes in the marine environment, (2) sex-related, inter- and intra-colony, and inter-annual differences, and (3) individual consistency over successive years. The study was conducted at three breeding colonies, Sangan Island (39 ° 18 ’N, 141 ° 58 ’E, Iwate, Japan) and Mikura Island (33 ˚ 52 ΄N, 139 ˚ 14 ΄E, Izu Islands, Japan) located in the Pacific Ocean, and Awa Island (38 ° 27 ’N, 139 ° 13 ’E, Niigata, Japan) located in the Sea of Japan, from August 2006 to October 2010. I recorded the seasonal movement patterns of streaked shearwaters during their non-breeding period using leg-mounted global location sensors. I obtained data of 223 tracks, including 47 birds that tracked over two successive years. Streaked shearwaters migrated to four wintering areas in November-February during the non-breeding period: most to the seas off northern New Guinea (73. 1 % of migrations), and others to the Arafura Sea (17. 0 %) and South China Sea (9. 0 %), and two birds to the seas off northwestern Australia (0. 9 %). Furthermore, streaked shearwaters from Sangan Island predominantly migrated to the seas off northern New Guinea over four non-breeding seasons. Therefore, the seas off northern New Guinea represent the key wintering area for streaked shearwaters from the study colonies. The surface concentration of chlorophyll a was low in the seas off northern New Guinea, in contrast to previous studies showing a close relationship between primary productivity and the occurrence of marine top predators. The western equatorial Pacific is generally characterized as an oligotrophic region with deep mixed and isothermal layers, but also shows a deep chlorophyll maximum at subsurface depth. Thus, biomass, including zooplankton and mesopelagic fish, is relatively high in the epipelagic layer despite low chlorophyll a concentration at the sea surface. Streaked shearwaters showed diurnal changes in their activity in the tropical oceans, as they flew for longer periods and landed on the water more frequently around dawn and dusk. This pattern of activity {{is similar to that of}} subsurface predators, such as tuna, and to that of tropical seabirds that are known to feed with subsurface predators. It possibly indicates the feeding association of streaked shearwaters with sub-surface predators in wintering areas. The seas off northern New Guinea have one of the largest fisheries for several tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. Feeding association with subsurface predators, such as tuna, is an important foraging strategy for tropical seabirds, because subsurface predators drive prey fish nearer to the surface where the seabirds can reach them. Although most shearwaters migrated to the seas off northern New Guinea, there were sex-related, inter- and intra-colony differences in the proportion of individuals that migrated to four different wintering areas. Males were more likely to migrate to the South China Sea (11. 8 % in males vs. 5. 2 % in females), while females were more likely to migrate to the Arafura Sea (9. 5 % in males vs. 29. 2 % in females). Among birds, including males and females, migrants to the Arafura Sea started the southward migration relatively earlier, and migrants to the South China Sea started the migration later than those that migrated to the seas off northern New Guinea. Between the sexes, females started the southward migration earlier than males. Among the colonies, shearwaters from Awa Island were less likely to migrate to the seas off northern New Guinea, compared to the other breeding colonies. There were two different migration routes in shearwaters from Awa Island: Pacific Ocean route and Sea of Japan route. Fewer birds that traveled along the Sea of Japan migrated to northern New Guinea (33. 3 % of 18 birds) than did those that traveled in the Pacific Ocean (61. 3 % of 31 birds). Migratory routes along the Sea of Japan were closer to the South China Sea and Arafura Sea, compared to those in the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, the South China Sea and Arafura Sea were more accessible to migrants that traveled along the Sea of Japan from Awa Island. In this study, I found remarkable individual consistency not only in wintering areas, but also for the timing of southward migration. Individuals that were tracked for two successive years migrated to the same wintering areas at a similar timing to the previous year. This may suggest that streaked shearwaters possess individual-specific migratory schedules that are possibly under the control of endogenous time programmes. After returning to the seas around the breeding colony in March (the pre-laying period), streaked shearwaters changed their foraging areas in relation to seasonal changes in sea surface temperatures of the North-western Pacific. Females moved their foraging areas northwards from April to July, but not being apparent for males. This was probably because females followed changes in the distribution of their prey, such as Japanese anchovy, that are known to conduct a seasonal northward migration in relation to the increase in sea surface temperature from spring to summer. In contrast to females, males mainly foraged in the areas around the breeding colony from April to June. During this period, males returned to the colony more frequently than females, probably to defend their nests from prospectors. Thus, sexual differences in breeding role may limit foraging ranges, leading to the different seasonal movement patterns between the sexes. The results from the present study showed that streaked shearwaters have a unique seasonal movement pattern compared to other shearwater species, as they forage in a temperate region during the breeding season and winter in tropical oceans during the non-breeding season. Pelagic seabirds often occupy similar latitudinal areas year-round either by conducting a trans-equatorial migration or remaining in areas around the colony, because general characteristics of the marine environment differ between temperate/polar and tropical oceans, and may require different foraging tactics. Streaked shearwaters forage mainly at the sea surface and are considered as an excellent glider in terms of their morphological characteristics. These behavioural and morphological characteristics appear to be adaptive to the tropical marine environment, and may enable this species to occupy both temperate and tropical marine environments...|$|E
