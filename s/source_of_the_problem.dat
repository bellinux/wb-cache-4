The responsibility for sewage treatment works still belonged primarily to local authorities, which often meant an uncoordinated approach and a proliferation of small works. In 1974, these works were transferred to the regional water authorities, with the Severn Trent Water Authority taking over the role for the Trent catchment. This led to increased investment, the closure of older and smaller works, with sewage treatment being combined at larger modern works such as Strongford and Minworth.|$|E

The <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is the force of public opinion, a force that is inevitably unstable, unserious, subjective, emotional, and simplistic.

500|$|Brownlee campaigned vigorously {{during the}} 1930 election, and was re-elected with a {{slightly}} diminished majority. [...] However, the Great Depression was making itself felt in Alberta. [...] The price of wheat, Alberta's major export, declined {{from a high of}} $1.78 per bushel in the summer of 1929, to $1.00 in the following March, to $0.45 by the end of 1930. [...] The Alberta Wheat Pool (AWP) guaranteed its members a minimum price of $1.00 per bushel (itself not enough for many farmers to earn a living), and it found itself facing ruination. [...] Banks denied credit to it and to individual farmers, which in turn made it difficult for the latter to afford seed for the 1931 crop. [...] The provincial government faced calls to provide loan guarantees. [...] Brownlee was concerned that such guarantees would encourage lenders to make loans at higher interest rates, with the knowledge that the provincial government would pay them if the farmers defaulted. [...] He sought a federally guaranteed minimum price of $0.70 per bushel, but was rebuffed by Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, who saw the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> as a global oversupply.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} a parody on the {{disaster}} film genre, {{which has been}} parodied in previous South Park episodes, like [...] "Pandemic", the twelfth season parody of the film Cloverfield. [...] "Pee" [...] included a particularly large number of references to 2012, a science fiction film {{about the end of}} the world as predicted by the Mayan calendar, which was released only days before [...] "Pee" [...] was originally broadcast. The episode parodies many common elements of such disaster films, including scientists struggling to figure out the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The destruction of rides and park amenities by the tsunami of urine is a reference to the destruction of historical monuments in 2012, and other such disaster films by Roland Emmerich, the director of, White House Down, 2012, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. [...] "Pee" [...] also includes several references to the 2012 phenomenon, the prediction that cataclysmic events would occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar. The scene in which Kyle is forced to drink three cups of urine in order to prevent his body from enduring the effects of fluid pressure before swimming down to drain it all out, is a parody of a scene in the 1989 film The Abyss, where the protagonist inhales a liquid breathing medium before venturing into the ocean depths.|$|E
500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is not locked on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. When we saw this issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E

500|$|Among these younger {{radicals}} were Bird and Snow; [...] {{among the}} old school was William Addison (a different person from Bird's superior at Guy's). [...] Addison disliked the modern reliance on laboratory and theoretical results favoured by the new generation, and challenged Richard Bright (who gave his name to Bright's disease) when Bright suggested that the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in oedema was the kidneys. [...] Addison preferred {{to believe that the}} condition was caused by intemperance or some other external factor, and that since the whole body had been disrupted, it could not be localised to a specific organ. [...] Addison further challenged Bright's student, Snow, when in 1839 Snow suggested from case studies and laboratory analysis that oedema was associated with an increase in albumin in the blood. [...] Addison dismissed this as a mere epiphenomenon. [...] Bird disagreed with Snow's proposed treatment, but his arguments clearly show him to be on the radical side of the debate, and he completely avoided whole-body arguments. [...] Snow had found that the proportion of urea in the urine of his patients was low and concluded from this that urea was accumulating in the blood, and therefore proposed bloodletting to counter this. [...] Bird disputed that increased urea in the blood was the cause of kidney disease and doubted the effectiveness of this treatment, citing the results of François Magendie, who had injected urea into the blood, apparently with no ill effects. [...] It is not clear whether Bird accepted Snow's reasoning that urea must be accumulating, or whether he merely adopted it for the sake of argument; while a student in 1833, he had disputed this very point with another of Bright's students, George Rees.|$|E
500|$|Some {{employees}} of ANA speculated that approximately ten minutes after take-off {{the crew of}} Amana {{were aware of the}} seriousness of rough running on number 4 engine so decided to shut it down. Company procedures specified that if an operational problem occurred prior to reaching Kalgoorlie, [...] east of Perth, the aircraft was to return to Perth; but if a problem occurred after reaching Kalgoorlie the flight could continue to Adelaide. The Douglas DC-4 was capable of flying from Perth to Adelaide with one engine inoperative. The crew of Amana on the fatal flight might have decided to wait until past Kalgoorlie before making a radio call to report one engine had been shut down, and then continue to Adelaide. To manage fuel usage and balance the weight of fuel across the wing, the crew might have selected some of the operating engines to draw fuel from number 4 tank. The DC-4 had a complex fuel selection system and, either deliberately or inadvertently, all operating engines might have been connected to number 4 tank. If the drain cock in the cross-feed pipe was still open to the atmosphere, air would be drawn into the pipe, causing an interruption of fuel supply to the engines, all engines to stop operating and their propellers to move to fine pitch. When the crew realised engines 1, 2 and 3 had all suddenly failed and that cross-feeding of fuel was the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> they would have changed the fuel selections and restored fuel to the engines, causing the sudden screaming noise heard by witnesses as the engines burst back into life with their propellers in fine pitch. Amana had been flying at lower altitude than usual so there was inadequate height for the crew to arrest the high rate of descent before the aircraft struck high ground on the Inkpen family property. (At the Air Court of Inquiry, George Pape, representing ANA, described as [...] "fantastic" [...] any suggestion that the crew of the Amana would be cross-feeding fuel from one wing to the engines on the other wing at such an early stage of the flight.) ...|$|E

He informed the press that neither he nor his team identified the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> but appreciated assistance: [...] "To try and drive slowly in certain places didn't make any difference so I don't understand it really. Wherever we finished it's pretty disappointing. Not being able to solve certain issues is frustrating. Hopefully something comes up and we find what the issues are." [...] Similarly, Alonso complained his car had severe tyre vibrations in the final two laps, reducing his visibility: [...] "I tried to control the pace. I was asking for a gap from behind to cross the line just in front of them. But then Vettel overtook [...] Magnussen and {{there was no time to}} save any more so on the last lap I was flat out with huge vibrations." [...] The Williams performance chief Rob Smedley suspected minor issues including Massa's slow pit stop prevented his team from finishing on the podium but praised Ricciardo's performance. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner explained that Vettel's first lap pit stop for medium compound tyres was performed with the intention of not using soft tyres for the rest of the race.|$|E
