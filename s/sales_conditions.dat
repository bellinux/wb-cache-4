In this paper, I analyze a model that allows for an endogenous split-up of consumers between sales channels. Competing sellers might set different prices across channels, depending on the platform tariff and presence of a NDR. I find that the platform operator imposes a NDR if he faces high transaction costs, if seller competition is weak, and if the initial distribution of consumers on channels is strongly skewed.

40|$|Abstract — According to {{the usual}} {{paradigm}} in electronic commerce, a consumer wants to buy something from a merchant, but neither party is much concerned with privacy. In an earlier paper, we introduced the concept of Blind Electronic Commerce, in which both parties should enjoy a maximum of privacy, and we gave solutions {{for some of the}} problems that arise in this context. Ideally, the customer should be able to remain anonymous, hide her browsing pattern and even hide from the merchant what she is interested in buying. Conversely, the merchant should not have to reveal anything unnecessary about his catalogue, especially prices. The issue considered here concerns the negotiation of a fair price in this context. This is challenging because the merchant does not know for what item he is negotiating, nor even his own starting price! Nevertheless, he must be prepared to reduce the price and/or introduce better <b>sales</b> <b>conditions,</b> or risk losing the sale. But of course, the consumer should have to negotiate without being able to guess anything about the merchant’s strategy, such as the minimum selling price for the item under negotiation. In this paper, we provide cryptographic solutions to solve this Blind Negotiation conundrum. I...|$|E

40|$|Examination of {{new data}} of the Mexican {{government}} securities primary auctions shows, not only that there exists underpricing {{with respect to the}} secondary market in CETES of 28, 91, 182, and 365 days maturity, but also that such underpricing tends to increase over time, especially during the period of 1996 - 2000. This study also finds that changes to the auction format employed by the Mexican Treasury do not fully account for this pattern because in spite that since 1995 the discriminatory format is in place, some modifications have been adopted with the purpose of improving <b>sales</b> <b>conditions</b> in the primary auctions, like setting common maximum bidding limits for all participants or reopening securities issues with high observed interest rates. Usual factors assumed to affect auction prices by existing models, like competition level, bidder participation and market uncertainty seem to play a role. However, evidence is also found that some factors related to secondary market features suggested by the finance microstructure literature, like liquidity, inventory and adverse selection costs may be playing an even more important role. Overall, these findings provide confirmation of the relevance of resale markets and suggests that: 1) it may be fruitful to add some of these latter features in future theoretical models about government securities markets and 2) to improve secondary market conditions may be important to enhance efficiency in the primary market...|$|E
