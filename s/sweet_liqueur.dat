40|$|The myrtle liqueur {{industry}} is developed in Sardinia {{by using the}} myrtle berries harvested from spontaneous plants as raw material. The market growth of this liqueur changed them from a home-made product to an industrial one, with increasing export to the national and international consumers. Myrtle liqueur is just {{an example of the}} typical regional <b>sweet</b> <b>liqueurs</b> of low alcohol content that recently are appreciated to a world level. Fruit harvests from spontaneous plants are well organized but the yield is not predictable depending on meteorological factors and on the occurrence of some events such as fires. Also the quality of the raw material is out of the control of harvesters and liqueur factories. The need to have an alternative system of raw material production and to reduce the ecological pressure over spontaneous plants generate a ten year long research for the optimisation of growing models of the species and the cultivar selection. The main results of the research program for myrtle cultivar selection and evaluation are reported. In particular, plant phenology and fruit technological characteristics for liqueur production were carefully observed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Myrtle berries {{have had}} a long history of {{application}} in the perfumery, cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries as well as being used for the industrial formulation of typical <b>sweet</b> <b>liqueurs.</b> However, no data is currently available on the metabolite composition and distribution in the different parts of the berry. OBJECTIVE: In the present study a metabolomics approach followed by multivariate data analysis and phytochemical characterization of (poly) phenolic metabolites, using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry, was developed to identify novel markers in different parts of myrtle berries and to understand which part of the fruit has the most influence on the metabolomics classification of berries, based on geographic origin of the plant and the cultivars. RESULTS: By using LC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS analysis, 35 compounds were tentatively identified on the base of their retention time, UV/Vis spectra,MSspectra andMSfragmentation patterns. 19 compounds, pertaining mainly to polyphenol compounds like flavonoids and to a new class of hydrolysable tannins, were detected and identified {{for the first time in}} these berries (mainly in seeds). CONCLUSIONS:Byusing multivariate statistical analysis, predictive classification models for authenticity and geographical origin, assessment was obtained. With this study, flavonoids and anthocyanins, mainly found in the peel and pulp of the myrtle berry, were recognized as putative marker compounds to assess the geographic origin of these berrie...|$|R
