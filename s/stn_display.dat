40|$|Native subtypes of NMDA receptors with {{distinct}} {{developmental and}} anatomical distribution {{are present in}} the brain. Knowledge of their function and pharmacology greatly helps in understanding the involvement of NMDA receptors in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system. Multiple patch-clamping methods were carried out in my experiments. First, the single-channel properties of native NMDA receptors were studied in outside-out patches excised from neuronal cell bodies in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) from 7 -day old rats. The steady state channel activations produced by NMDA (100 nM or 200 uM) and glycine (10 uM) were studied at - 60 mV. The results showed that both large and small conductance channels are present on STN and SNc neurons. These large conductance NMDA channels from SNc and <b>STN</b> <b>display</b> a high ifenprodil sensitivity, suggesting NR 2 B-containing NMDA receptors are present on SNc and STN neurons. In addition, direct transition analysis suggests that the small conductance channels may be due to NR 2 D-containing NMDA receptors. Second, whole-cell patch-clamp recording of bath application-induced NMDA receptor-mediated currents (Inmda) in dopaminergic neurons of SNc in brain slices from P 7 rats was used to characterize the ifenprodil inhibition and voltage-dependence of Mg 2 + block of NMDA receptors. The NMDA-induced whole-cell currents were evoked by NMDA (10 uM or 200 uM) and glycine (10 pM). There are two main findings from the whole-cell experiments. (1) The NMDA-induced whole-cell currents display a high ifenprodil sensitivity, suggesting the presence of NR 2 B-containing NMDA receptors on P 7 rat SNc neurons. (2) The combined application of Mg 2 + and ifenprodil reduced the voltage-dependent Mg 2 + block, which is consistent with recombinant NR 2 D-containing NMDA receptors that have a lower affinity for Mg 2 +. This suggests that NR 2 D-containing NMDA receptors are present in P 7 rat SNc. Third, in order to evaluate the deactivation kinetics of extrasynaptic NMDARs, outside-out patches containing multiple channels were obtained from P 7 rat dopaminergic neurons of SNc and stimulated with a brief synaptic-like (l- 4 ms) pulse of ImM glutamate. The results suggested that the triheteromeric NR 1 -NR 2 B-NR 2 D rather than diheteromeric NR 1 -NR 2 D NMDA receptors are present on extrasynaptic sites of SNc neurons. In addition, in order to investigate voltage-dependent Mg 2 + block and memantine block, several channel block models were developed to evaluate multiple Mg 2 + effects on native NMDA receptors and competition between Mg 2 + and memantine for block of NMDAR channels...|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{guest host}} {{displays}} usually require higher operating voltages than TN or <b>STN</b> <b>displays.</b> For example, the polymer dispersed {{liquid crystal display}} (also called a P.D.L.C. display), is usually operated at voltages from 4.5V to 24V to as high as 100V.

50|$|A super-twisted nematic <b>display</b> (<b>STN)</b> {{is a type}} of {{monochrome}} passive-matrix {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD). This type of LCD was invented at the Brown Boveri Research Center, Baden, Switzerland, in 1983. For years a better scheme for multiplexing was sought. Standard twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with a 90 degrees twisted structure of the molecules have a contrast vs. voltage characteristic unsuitable for passive-matrix addressing as there is no distinct threshold voltage. <b>STN</b> <b>displays,</b> with the molecules twisted from 180 to 270 degrees, have superior characteristics. The main advantage of STN LCDs is their more pronounced electro-optical threshold allowing for passive-matrix addressing with many more lines and columns. For the first time, a prototype <b>STN</b> matrix <b>display</b> with 540x270 pixels was made by Brown Boveri (today ABB) in 1984, which was considered a breakthrough for the industry.|$|R
50|$|Owing {{to the way}} {{rows and}} columns in the display are addressed, and charge is pushed around, the data on {{one part of the}} display has the {{potential}} to influence what is displayed elsewhere.

40|$|A process {{capability}} index C-pm that fits nominal-the-best type quality characteristics is an effective tool for assessing {{process capability}} since the index can adequately reflect a centring process capability and process yield. A valuable method using C(p) estimators was developed by Chou [7] for practitioners to use {{to determine whether or}} not two processes have equal capability. However index C-p failed to measure process yield and process centring with bilateral specifications and in addition, more than two suppliers can be selected in an actual application. This study proposes a fuzzy inference method to select the best among the competing suppliers based on an estimated capability index of C-pm calculated from sampled data. This method has the advantages of fuzzy systems where a grade can be obtained instead of a more specific exact evaluation result. An illustrated example of colour <b>STN</b> <b>displays</b> demonstrates that the proposed method is effective and feasible for the evaluation of competing process capability...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{deals with}} liquid crystal displays where the incident light and reflected light {{going through the}} display are not specularly related. The incident light can be at a range of angles to the display while the reflected light, i. e. the viewing direction is at or nearly normal to the display. For such nonspecular liquid crystal displays, the polarizer angles, the input/output directors of the liquid crystal cell, and liquid crystal cell retardation have to be specially optimized to obtain the best viewing effects. Conventional liquid crystal display modes do not work optimally in this nonspecular situation. We also disclose the new image-mode and shadow-mode nonspecular liquid crystal displays. Such displays have very bright background and are free from viewing glare common in most liquid crystal displays. The present invention applies to all twist angles. e. g. the 90 ° TN, the 120 ° and 150 ° HTN, the 180 °, 240 ° and 270 ° <b>STN</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R

40|$|Restricted AccessRecently we {{developed}} [1] a novel {{liquid crystal display}} device employing discotic nematic material. This device exhibits the following improvements over a conventional twisted nematic (TN) display device using a calamitic nematic material. The device (i) is simple to fabricate and (ii) has excellent viewing angle characteristics showing a wide and symmetric viewing angle profile, (iii) has much less difference in the pixel capacitance between the ON and OFF states resulting in reduced cross talk problem. However the response time of the device is slower than conventional TN devices. An obvious {{solution to this problem}} is to reduce the viscosity of the material. To achieve this we have doped, in small concentrations, a long chain alkane compound to the parent room-temperature discotic nematic material. Systematic studies show that both the switch ON and switch OFF response times show a significant decrease, i. e., the device switches faster, {{in the case of the}} mixtures. It should be mentioned that wide and symmetric viewing angle characteristics remain unaffected by the addition of the dopant material. However both the switch ON and switch OFF response times are still an order of magnitude slower compared to that of conventional TN devices. Considering the fact that these response times are not very different from those for the <b>STN</b> <b>displays,</b> the achievement of symmetric and wide viewing angle characteristics with a simple fabrication process makes this device quite interesting. To make them attractive enough to be considered for commercial applications new materials with faster response have to be developed. Efforts in this direction are underway in our laboratory...|$|R

The passive matrix displays based on Super Twisted Nematic (<b>STN)</b> Liquid Crystal <b>Displays</b> (LCDs) are popular due to their low cost. However, the response times of these displays are in the range of 200 ms. The improvement of response times of STN LCDs to about 50 ms results in poor contrast ratio, when conventional addressing technique is used. This is due to the frame response phenomenon in fast responding LCDs. Novel addressing techniques to suppress the frame response phenomenon are presented. These techniques lead to a high contrast ratio, good brightness uniformity and lower supply voltage as compared to the conventional technique. The basic principle of these addressing techniques and methods for displaying gray shades are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Functional and {{connectivity}} {{changes in}} corticostriatal {{systems have been}} reported in the brains of patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD); however, the relationship between basal ganglia activity and OCD severity has never been adequately established. We recently showed that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a central basal ganglia nucleus, improves OCD. Here, single-unit subthalamic neuronal activity was analysed in 12 OCD patients, in relation to the severity of obsessions and compulsions and response to STN stimulation, and compared with that obtained in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). STN neurons in OCD patients had lower discharge frequency than those in PD patients, with a similar proportion of burst-type activity (69 vs 67 %). Oscillatory activity was present in 46 and 68 % of neurons in OCD and PD patients, respectively, predominantly in the low-frequency band (1 – 8 [*]Hz). In OCD patients, the bursty and oscillatory subthalamic neuronal activity was mainly located in the associative–limbic part. Both OCD severity and clinical improvement following STN stimulation were related to the STN neuronal activity. In patients with the most severe OCD, STN neurons exhibited bursts with shorter duration and interburst interval, but higher intraburst frequency, and more oscillations in the low-frequency bands. In patients with best clinical outcome with STN stimulation, <b>STN</b> neurons <b>displayed</b> higher mean discharge, burst and intraburst frequencies, and lower interburst interval. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a dysfunction in the associative–limbic subdivision of the basal ganglia circuitry in OCD's pathophysiology...|$|R
2500|$|Bistable LCDs do {{not require}} {{continuous}} refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an <b>STN</b> type <b>display</b> that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extreme high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel however may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these bistable displays is rather complex, reason why these displays did not {{made it to the}} market. That changed when in the 2010 [...] "zero-power" [...] (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks showing still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while that information remains readable. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated long time on just a small battery only. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images.|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{burst firing}} in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) {{is one of}} the {{hallmarks}} of dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease. Here, we have determined the postsynaptic effects of dopamine in the STN and the functional consequences of dopamine receptor modulation on burst firing in vitro. <b>STN</b> cells <b>displayed</b> regular spiking activity at a rate of 7. 9 +/- 0. 5 Hz. Application of dopamine (30 mu M) induced membrane depolarisations accompanied by an increase in firing rate of mean 12. 0 +/- 0. 6 Hz in all 69 cells. The dopamine effect was mimicked by the dopamine D 1 /D 5 receptor agonist SKF 38393 (10 mu M, 17 cells) and the dopamine D 2 -like receptor agonist quinpirole (10 mu M, 35 cells), partly reduced by D 1 /D 5 antagonist SCH 23390 (2 mu M, seven cells), but unaffected by the D 2 antagonists sulpiride (10 mu M, seven cells) or eticlopride (10 mu M, six cells). Using voltage ramps, dopamine induced an inward current of 69 +/- 9. 4 pA at a holding potential of - 60 mV (n = 17). This current was accompanied by an increase in input conductance of 1. 55 +/- 0. 35 nS which reversed at - 30. 6 +/- 2. 3 mV, an effect mimicked by SKF 38393 (10 AM, nine cells). Similar responses were observed when measuring instantaneous current evoked by voltage steps and {{in the presence of the}} I-h blocker, ZD 7288, indicating effects independent of I-h. The increase in conductance was blocked by SCH 23390 (2 mu M, n = 4), mimicked by the activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin (10 mu M, n = 7) and blocked by H- 89, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase A (10 PM, n = 6). These results indicate that the dopamine depolarisation is in part mediated by D 1 /D 5 receptor mediated activation of a cyclic-nucleotide gated (CNG) non-specific cation conductance. This conductance contributes to the membrane depolarisation that changes STN neuronal bursting to more regular activity by significantly increasing burst duration and number of spikes per burst...|$|R
