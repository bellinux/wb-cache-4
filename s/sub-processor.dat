50|$|To make {{best use}} of {{mainframe}} computer processor time, input/output tasks were delegated to separate systems called Channel I/O. The mainframe would not require any I/O processing at all, instead would just set parameters for an input or output operation and then signal the channel processor {{to carry out the}} whole of the operation. By dedicating relatively simple <b>sub-processors</b> to handle time-consuming I/O formatting and processing, overall system performance was improved.|$|R
40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper concerns information processing, {{and focuses}} on the methods and mechanisms used by marketers and academics in attempting to explore mental processes, particularly regarding perception and cognitive mapping in relation to marketing communications. The paper reviews the extensive literature in this domain, deriving information and models {{from a wide variety}} of disciplines including: 1. cognitive information processing, 2. attitudes and attitudinal change, 3. elaboration and receiver involvement, sub-routines and <b>sub-processors,</b> semiotics, cognitive science and psycholinguistics. The paper concludes by suggesting that each of these disciplines has a role to play in terms of future research direction, and that the field of information processing still provides a rich and fertile basis for significant developments to take place...|$|R

The {{performance}} tests and {{the requirements of}} experiments on aircraft alighting gear actuating cylinder in the salt spray and hot and humid environment are presented in this paper, and the hydraulic system of experimental device is designed. The host computer software is developed by Lab Windows/CVI for actuating cylinder on test parameters settings, monitoring, and storage and record, The Siemens PLC are used at the <b>sub-processors</b> to control the salt spray experimental device. The field-test shows that the device control precision is higher to pressure, flow rate, and the parameters such as temperature, and it can realize the simulation for different salt spray and hot and humid environments. The test on aircraft landing gear by using actuating cylinder has a good human-computer interaction and communication function. The device is safe, reliable and it can reach the test requirements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of computer-mediated communication on collaboratively solving design problems. When setting up a virtual design community, choices must be made between a variety of tools, choices dictated by budget, bandwidth, ability and availability. How do you choose between the tools, which is useful and how will each affect {{the outcome of the}} design exchanges you plan? A commonly used method is to analyze the work done and to identify tools which support this type of work. In general, research on the effects of computer-mediation on collaborative work has concentrated mainly on social-psychological factors such as deindividuation and attitude polarization, and used qualitative methods. In contrast, we propose to examine the process of collaboration itself, focusing on separating those component processes which primarily involve individual work from those that involve genuine interaction. Extending the cognitive metaphor of the brain as a computer, we view collaboration in terms of a network process, and examine issues of control, coordination, and delegation to separate <b>sub-processors.</b> Through this methodology we attempt to separate the individual problem-solving component from the larger process of collaboration...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is the development of an automatic video surveillance system for industrial workroom environments. The objective of this system is the prevention of collisions between an industrial robot and human workers as well as the monitoring of the robot's motion. Contrary to conventional safety measures that do not process any motion information, and therefore require restrictive regulations for the operation of robots, the described video processor detects and monitors moving objects in the workroom from digital images taken by a stationary camera. The processor consists of two parallel sub-units, each specialized for a certain class of moving objects. The first is based on the statistical analysis of original and difference pictures, and is applied to objects with unknown features. In the second <b>sub-processor,</b> scene-invariant features of the moving machinery are extracted and tracked. Both sub-processors can cope with varying conditions of illumination. Motion models derived from the history of observation are employed for the prediction of the trajectories of the moving objects, and thus permit collision forecasting and limited tracking capability in case of object occlusion.
