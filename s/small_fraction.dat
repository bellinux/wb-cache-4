5|$|Only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of reparations {{were ever}} paid. In fact, the {{historian}} Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal {{to four times}} the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|Thomson's {{plum pudding}} model was disproved in 1909 {{by one of}} his former students, Ernest Rutherford, who {{discovered}} that most of the mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.|$|E

40|$|Toxic metals {{contaminate}} soil {{worldwide and}} thus serve as sever environmental threat. Therefore {{the purposes of}} this study were to investigate in which soil fractions that different heavy metals (Fe, As, Cu, Zn and Pb) could be found in contaminated soils and if it is possible to use sieving as a method for decontamination. Soil samples were collected from three different locations, the Nasa silver mine, the Blaiken-mine and Svalget environmental station. The samples were oven dried and later on sieved into six different fractions 8 mm, 4 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 250 mm, 0. 063 mm and < 0. 063 mm. The fractions 4 mm, 0. 5 mm and < 0. 063 mm from each location were analyzed in an x-ray fluorescence detector. The results showed that in general the <b>smallest</b> <b>fractions</b> contained the highest concentration of heavy metals which was very clear for Pb where 5 out of 6 samples had the highest concentration in the <b>smallest</b> <b>fraction.</b> The highest concentration of Cu (1147 ppm) and Zn (1117 ppm) were found in the <b>smallest</b> <b>fraction</b> in samples from the location Svalget. The highest concentration of Pb (10042 ppm) was also found in the <b>smallest</b> <b>fraction</b> in samples from Blaiken. In similarity the highest concentration of As (13305 ppm) was found in the <b>smallest</b> <b>fraction</b> in samples from the Nasa mine. However, in most samples the difference between the <b>smallest</b> <b>fractions</b> and the coarser material was small. Sieving may therefore not be the best way to decontaminate soil because even the larger fractions contained high concentrations of heavy metals...|$|R

5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the {{contaminated}} spray was thrown {{back into the}} air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|Ancestry {{information}} {{reported in}} the 2000 Census reflects the diversity of Teaneck residents, with no single country accounting {{for more than a}} <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the population. Residents listed Italian (6.2%), German (6.0%), Russian (5.3%), Irish (5.1%) and Polish (4.2%) as the most common countries of ancestry, and an additional 4.3% listed United States. 6.3% of residents identified themselves as being of West Indian ancestry, of which 3.4% were from Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} way, the {{particular}} energetic {{stability of the}} helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion.

5|$|Many {{prominent}} scientists {{argued that}} the system was futile. Hans Bethe, along with IBM physicist Richard Garwin and Cornell University colleague Kurt Gottfried, wrote an article in Scientific American which analyzed the system and concluded that any putative enemy could disable such a system {{by the use of}} suitable decoys that would cost a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the SDI program.|$|E
5|$|Only a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of {{the diamond}} ore {{consists}} of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds {{are located in}} the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury {{to a greater extent}} than NAP.|$|E

5|$|The {{average cost}} of {{crystalline}} boron is $5/g. Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the residues that {{come in contact with}} the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of a second. The second {{problem was that the}} planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E

5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is {{measured in terms of}} the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.|$|E

5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 37 players have represented the Hong Kong national team in ODIs, since its debut in 2004.

5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the zircon is {{converted}} to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> of the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E
