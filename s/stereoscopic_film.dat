[...] Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, Dickson Greeting and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower.

50|$|A {{three-dimensional}} <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film</b> (also {{known as}} three-dimensional film, 3D film or S3D film) is a motion picture that enhances {{the illusion of}} depth perception, hence adding a third dimension. The most common approach {{to the production of}} 3D films is derived from stereoscopic photography. In it, a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives (or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production), and special projection hardware and/or eyewear are used to limit the visibility of each image in the pair to the viewer's left or right eye only. 3D films are not limited to theatrical releases; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods, especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D.|$|E
50|$|What most film {{histories}} {{leave out}} is that the Lumière Brothers were trying to achieve a 3D image even prior to this first-ever public exhibition of motion pictures. Louis Lumière eventually re-shot L'Arrivée d’un Train with a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film</b> camera and exhibited it (along {{with a series of}} other 3D shorts) at a 1935 meeting of the French Academy of Science. Given the contradictory accounts that plague early cinema and pre-cinema accounts, it's plausible that early cinema historians conflated the audience reactions at these separate screenings of L'Arrivée d’un Train. The intense audience reaction fits better with the latter exhibition, when the train apparently was actually coming out of the screen at the audience. But {{due to the fact that}} the 3D film never took off commercially as the conventional 2D version did, including such details would not make for a compelling myth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stereoscopic</b> <b>films</b> largely {{remained}} dormant for {{the first}} part of the 1960s, with those that were released usually being anaglyph exploitation films. One film of notoriety was the Beaver-Champion/Warner Bros. production, The Mask (1961). The film was shot in 2-D, but to enhance the bizarre qualities of the dream-world that is induced when the main character puts on a cursed tribal mask, these scenes went to anaglyph 3D. These scenes were printed by Technicolor on their first run in red/green anaglyph.|$|R

5000|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19 mm (3/4 inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that each frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.On May 20, 1891, the first public demonstration of a prototype Kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the National Federation of Women's Clubs. The New York Sun described what the club women saw in the [...] "small pine box" [...] they encountered:In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....The man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as Dickson Greeting.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{television}} sets {{are available in}} the market and are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. However, viewing 3 D films has potential adverse effects such as asthenopia and visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). The phenomenon of VIMS is not fully understood yet. One cause of VIMS has been considered to be sensory conflict, ie,, the disagreement between vergence and visual accommodation, while viewing a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film.</b> VIMS can be analyzed in subjective and physiological terms. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effect of viewing a long <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film</b> on the human body. An electrocardiogram was obtained for subjects viewing an hour-long <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film.</b> We also conducted stabilometric analysis for the subjects in the Romberg posture, flicker tests, and subjective questionnaires to detect fatigue and eye strain every 20 minutes. Statistical significance was observed for subjective averages of the test results obtained before exposure to the film and 40 minutes after the initiation of the measurement (p < 0. 05). Symptoms of VIMS could be detected during the exposure to the hour-long 3 D film. Based on this result, guidelines will be devised to ensure safety in viewing 3 D movies...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} new {{technologies}} in cinema, theatre and virtual reality together with increasing demands for new content, are pushing the boundaries of filmmaking and storytelling {{to the limits of}} our imaginations. The potential for 3 D film to blur the line between virtual storytelling and social network gaming is not just hypothetical. These technologies now incorporate audiences and players that are actors in the virtual world themselves. They often encounter other actors they are familiar with in virtual or real-life. In social psychology, familiarity is a robust phenomenon demonstrating that just being familiar to someone causes preference and increased positive affect to them. In this paper, the role of familiarity in the visual perception and user experience is investigated. To test our findings, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film</b> scenarios were developed. An experiment has been conducted to see if annoyance present on a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film</b> content outweighs the user experience over familiarity. This paper argues that a stereoscopic 3 D film technology seems to gain more from increased emotional relevance than from higher quality resolutions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{workflow}} {{that can be}} effectively used to integrate CG elements into live-action stereoscopic footage, while ensuring a comfortable viewing experience for the viewer. In stereoscopic 3 -D footage, each eye is presented with a slightly different image of the same scene {{in order to create}} the perception of depth. The key question explored in this research is: how do stereoscopic images affect the integration workflow of CG elements into live-action stereoscopic 3 -D footage? Stereoscopic 3 -D has been around since the 1800 ’s with the first public viewing of a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>film</b> occurring in 1922.

The interest in documentary films led the author to experiment with various techniques of stereoscopic filming, as well as analyze various documentary films in both 2 D and S 3 D.

This paper intends to investigate theoretical issues related to the use of these technologies in filming S 3 D documentaries and its immersive function.
