50|$|To produce {{cavities}} {{within the}} casting - such as for liquid cooling in engine blocks and cylinder heads - negative forms {{are used to}} produce cores. Usually <b>sand-molded,</b> cores are inserted into the casting box after removal of the pattern. Whenever possible, designs are made that avoid the use of cores, due to the additional set-up time and thus greater cost.|$|E
50|$|The Luce County Jail and Sheriff's House is {{a three-story}} {{structure}} built with three wings in an irregular plan. Two side wings adjoin the main front section, {{with a third}} two-story wing, housing the jail, attached at the rear. The structure sits on a split fieldstone foundation. The first story is faced with Jacobsville sandstone, the second is faced with red, <b>sand-molded</b> brick, while the upper story is covered with fishscale shingles. The roofing was originally wood shakes but is now asphalt shingling. A metal-roofed cupola is on {{one corner of the}} building. Romanesque detailing on the building include the cut stone, arches over the windows and doors, and the polished granite columns supporting the front porch overhang.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of process parameters on shape stability and surface smoothness of cylindrical and rectangular castings produced by fused spinning deposition (FSD) method was investigated. The optimum conditions {{to control the}} shape and smoothness of side surface of the castings produced by the FSD method without water-cooling were limited to a narrow range of process parameters. The casting with a stable shape and a smooth side surface was obtained {{with the aid of}} water-cooling. The tensile strength of the castings produced by the FSD method was 1. 4 times higher than those of the specimens cast into metal-mold and <b>sand-mold,</b> due to a finer equiaxed grain structure of the FSD castings. Employing the combination of the deposition patterns for tube and solid castings, some practical metallic components were fabricated by the FSD method...|$|R
40|$|High-strength {{aluminum}} alloy {{are widely used}} for structural components in aerospace, transportation and racing car applications. The objective {{of this study is}} to enhance the strength of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy used for gravity casting process. All alloys cast into stepped-form sand mold (<b>Sand-mold</b> Casting; SC) and Y-block shaped metal mold(Permanent mold Casting; PC) C and then two –step aged at 398 - 423 K after solution treated at 743 K for 36 ks. The tensile strength and total elongation of the two-step aged SC alloys were 353 - 387 MPa and about 0. 4 % respectively. This low tensile properties of the SC alloys might be caused by remaining of undissolved crystallized phase such as Al 2 CuM, MgZn 2 and Al-Fe-Cu system compounds. However, good tensile properties were obtained from PC alloys, tensile strength and 0. 2 % proof stress and elongation were 503 - 537 MPa, 474 - 519 MPa and 1. 3 - 3. 3 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper compares {{mechanical}} properties of {{two types of}} cast aluminum components made in sand molds and cast iron molds, respectively. For each type of the castings, a total of 12 fracture tests are performed under {{a wide range of}} stress states including 6 tensile tests on notched and unnotched round bars and 6 biaxial loading tests on butterfly specimens. Using a combined experimental–numerical approach, the plasticity and fracture properties of the components are characterized in terms of the true stress–strain curve and the ductile fracture locus. It is found that the <b>sand-molding</b> component is of higher yield resistance and lower ductility than the metal-molding one. Meanwhile, the fractographic study reveals that there exist two competing failure mechanisms: the internal necking of the matrix at high positive stress triaxialities and void sheeting due to shear at negative stress triaxialities. The transition of the failure modes occurs in the intermediate range. This suggests that a ductile fracture locus formulated in the space of the stress triaxiality and the effective fracture strain consist of three branches rather than a monotonic curve...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the optimal design of feeding system in steel <b>sand-mold</b> {{castings}} is considered. The {{first part of}} this research includes fundamental studies on the physics of shrinkage defect formation during the casting process. The results of these studies lead to new findings on the mechanism of shrinkage defect formation, effect of melt quality on the distribution of defects within the castings and the connection between shrinkage and gases defects. The theoretical analysis of thermal criterion functions for the prediction of shrinkage defects in castings and introducing new criterion function with fewer shortcomings can be accounted as the other finding of this part. A new model was introduced {{in the second part of}} this research for the purpose of optimal design of feeding system in the shape casting processes. In this model the optimal design problem is formulated as a point-wise constrained topology optimization problem. Unlike alternative methods, the presented method does not require any predesigned feeding system as an initial guess. Using the functional analysis on the infinite-dimensional function spaces, a numerically efficient method was introduced to solve the optimal design problem in this study. By using extensive numerical experiments, capabilities and limitations of the presented method were studied in the last part of this research...|$|R
