"In strange {{contrast}} with this Dandiacal Body stands another British Sect, originally, as I understand, of Ireland, where its chief seat still is; but known {{also in the}} main Island, and indeed everywhere rapidly spreading. As this Sect has hitherto emitted no Canonical Books, it remains {{to me in the}} same state of obscurity as the Dandiacal, which has published Books that the unassisted human faculties are inadequate to read. The members appear to be designated by a considerable diversity of names, according to their various places of establishment: in England they are generally called the Drudge Sect; also, unphilosophically enough, the White Negroes; and, chiefly in scorn by those of other communions, the Ragged-Beggar Sect. In Scotland, again, I find them entitled Hallanshakers, or the Stook of Duds Sect; any individual communicant is named Stook of Duds (that is, Shock of Rags), in allusion, doubtless, to their professional Costume. While in Ireland, which, as mentioned, is their grand parent hive, they go by a perplexing multiplicity of designations, such as Bogtrotters, Redshanks, Ribbonmen, Cottiers, Peep-of-Day Boys, Babes of the Wood, Rockites, Poor-Slaves: which last, however, seems to be the primary and generic name; whereto, probably enough, the others are only <b>subsidiary</b> <b>species,</b> or slight varieties; or, at most, propagated offsets from the parent stem, whose minute subdivisions, and shades of difference, it were here loss of time to dwell on. Enough for us to understand, what seems indubitable, that the original Sect is that of the Poor-Slaves; whose doctrines, practices, and fundamental characteristics pervade and animate the whole Body, howsoever denominated or outwardly diversified.|$|E
40|$|Background: A snowbed {{community}} with much Deschampsia flexuosa {{has long been}} recognised in Norway, but not hitherto as a separate type in Scotland. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to check provisional observations that similar vegetation occurred frequently in the Cairngorms massif, and describe its composition, soils and snow-lie. Methods: For seven sites on Cairn Gorm and Ben Macdui, all with substantial extent of this vegetation, vegetation composition was recorded, soil profiles assessed and information assimilated from a separate long-term study of snow patches. Results: Deschampsia flexuosa was predominant in this vegetation and the occurrence of other higher plants was low. The main <b>subsidiary</b> <b>species</b> were bryophytes, indicating that the community was related to NVC U 12 in the British classification of vegetation. Soils were free-draining alpine podzols. On average, snow-lie continues from the end of June to mid July, which is later than on snowbed vegetation dominated by Nardus stricta, but earlier than on moss-dominated snowbeds. Conclusions: We suggest that this vegetation is sufficiently distinctive to be considered a separate sub-community of NVC U 12.

40|$|Mediterranean {{sclerophyllous}} {{forests are}} coenoses worthy of great care {{because of their}} inherent bio-ecological value. The suspension of harvesting following the crisis of fuel wood market ruled the evolutive pattern of maquis over the last decades. In this phase, site quality {{seems to be the}} major driver of the holm oak-dominated forest recovery {{as well as of the}} lasting permanence of the sclerophyllous shrub forest. In this connection, stand dynamics has been monitored in three plots located in the strictly protected area of the &# 8220;Parco Regionale della Maremma&# 8221; (Grosseto - Tuscany), where natural evolution is in progress since at least five decades. The monitored stands are representative of different evolutive phases from the holm oak-dominated coppices to the typical maquis, as a function of the original stand structure and composition but also of the intensity and length of the applied coppice management system. The analysis was carried out by permanent transects; two inventories were undertaken in 1991 and 2006 to evaluate both compositional and structural variability and the dynamics in progress. Results at now highlight the role played by the residual site quality and specific composition in driving the evolutive pattern of tree species community. Under the absence of any silvicultural practice and better site conditions, the progress and specific incidence of regular mortality and the related aboveground biomass redistribution, supported the vegetation of holm oak and the other <b>subsidiary</b> <b>species</b> typical of more mature stages. The overall forest dynamics seemed anyway to proceed slowly and resulted in a steady physiognomy over a long time since the suspension of the historical disturbance made of repeated harvesting on short rotations...|$|E
40|$|Managing large complex {{stochastic}} systems, including competitive interests, {{when one}} or several players {{can control the}} behavior {{of a large number of}} particles (agents, mechanisms, vehicles, <b>subsidiaries,</b> <b>species,</b> police units, etc), say $N_k$ for a player $k$, the complexity of the game-theoretical (or Markov decision) analysis can become immense as $N_ko infty$. However, under rather general assumptions, the limiting problem as all $N_ko infty$ can be described by a well manageable deterministic evolution. In this paper we analyze some simple situations of this kind proving the convergence of Nash-equilibria for finite games to equilibria of a limiting deterministic differential game...|$|R

40|$|Cover {{crops and}} living mulches form an {{integral}} component of conservation agriculture promoting soil health and minimising external inputs. The OSCAR Project (Optimising Subsidiary Crop Applications in Rotation) aims to improve practices of conservation agriculture in farming systems across Europe. The principal {{output of the}} project {{is to develop a}} toolbox to make technical and scientific information publically available to farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders. The continually evolving toolbox is currently available online at www. covercrops. eu and will consist of three facets (1) An interactive user-fed wiki providing information on <b>subsidiary</b> crops <b>species</b> and machinery use with links to published literature. (2) A searchable database on subsidiary crops and technology. This will detail climatic and soil specific plant traits and will form a decision support tool to aid choices of subsidiary crops. (3) A discussion forum will also facilitate the exchange of information between farmers, researchers and stakeholders on conservation agricultural systems across European countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} variability (over 27 months) in abun-dance, {{depth of}} life in the sediment, and species diversity of hard-shelled, live (stained) foraminifera in an inter-tidal area has been determined. Throughout the inves-tigation period, the same three species (Haynesina ger-manica, Ammonia beccarii (tepida), Elphidium excava-tum) were dominant at the two investigated stations, the maximum abundance of all species (dominant and sub-sidiary) was in the surface 0. 25 cm, and there was a general lack of seasonal change in the vertical distribu-tion of the foraminifera. Seasonality {{does not seem to be}} a controlling factor for the vertical distribution of indi-viduals in this area and none of the foraminifera showed high subsurface abundances. Because of the difference in depth position of the redox boundary within the sed-iment (often 1 cm) and the maximum abundance of in-dividuals (surface 0. 25 cm) the former cannot be the main factor limiting their vertical distribution of abun-dance. The generally high dominance of individuals in the surface few millimeters is probably related to the presence there of microalgal food and limited burrowing activity of the sparse macrofauna. <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>species</b> col-onized the area ephemerally, thus the number of species recorded varied from one season to another. The mini-mum and maximum number of species found at any sin-gle sampling event were 5 and 22, whereas the cumula-tive number of stained species found throughout the in-vestigation period was 35 (plus at least three soft-shelled forms). Species diversity is one of the principal univar-iate methods used to assess both natural variability and possible human impacts. The large natural seasonal var-iability demonstrated here suggests that caution should be taken in assessing the significance of diversity changes when based on occasional sampling only...|$|E
40|$|Time-series {{studies are}} {{essential}} for defining short and long-term variability in environments and without such records {{it is difficult to}} make well-founded judgments about faunal or environmental change. Datasets of intertidal benthic foraminifera from the Exe and Hamble estuaries, England, intertidal zone of Bahrain, Arabian Gulf, and subtidal Lim channel, Adriatic, have been analysed to provide information on patterns of species richness. Living assemblages comprise one or two dominant species plus two or three <b>subsidiary</b> <b>species</b> and a variable number of ephemeral rare species, the latter being the main control of species richness. The cumulative increase in species from month to month follows a pattern which approximates a log series. None of the datasets follows a broken stick or log normal pattern. The final plateau in cumulative species increase is reached in periods ranging from 5 â€“ 10 months (Lim channel) to 22 â€“ 23 months (estuaries). The cumulative maximum number of species gives an estimate of the carrying capacity for species, i. e. the maximum number of species for the environment. The species present in each area represent the species pool related to that environment (e. g. estuarine intertidal zone) together with introductions from a species pool in a different environment nearby (e. g. inner shelf). The time-averaged accumulation of successive live assemblages that form the dead assemblage is not identical with the cumulative total. Some live taxa are unrepresented in the dead assemblage either through taphonomic loss or the introduction of new species that have not yet left a dead record. In addition, the Exe estuary dead assemblage includes a large number of dead tests transported in from the adjacent shelf. It does not conform to any of the three possible patterns. At present the few time-series studies of benthic foraminifera that are available are either intertidal or very shallow water. There remains a need for further studies {{in a wide range of}} environments in order to understand more fully the faunal response to dynamic change. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Temperate grassy box {{woodlands}} are {{the predominant}} native vegetation of the "wheat-sheep" belt of south-eastern Australia. In New South Wales, {{a number of}} different eucalypt species form the overstorey of these woodlands, with changes in dominance from Eucalyptus melliodora (Yellow Box) and Eucalyptus albens (White Box) in the east to Eucalyptus microcarpa (Grey Box) and Eucalyptus populnea (Poplar Box) in the west. Most grassy Box woodlands have now been cleared or modified for agriculture, and their conservation is dependent on adequate knowledge of the distribution, ecology and management needs of remaining woodlands. In this study we describe the understorey flora of high quality remnants of grassy Box woodlands along an east-west gradient in central New South Wales, comparing sites with a history of minimal livestock grazing (cemeteries) with sites with a history of intermittent livestock grazing (travelling stock reserves). With some important exceptions relating to Eucalyptus melliodora, dominant overstorey eucalypts were good indicators of understorey changes along the east-west gradient. A particular disjunction, involving changes in the dominant grasses from Themeda australis and Poa sieberiana to Austrostipa scabra, Austrodanthonia and Enteropogon species, distinguishes "eastern" (Eucalyptus melliodora, Eucalyptus albens) from "western" (Eucalyptus microcarpa, Eucalyptus populnea) Box woodlands, and has significant implications for understorey management. Notable changes in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>species</b> included changes in the main genera of shrubs and daisies, and a number of trends at the family level. Families such as Dilleniaceae, Haloragaceae, Epacridaceae and Ranunculaceae were more frequent or diverse in eastern Box woodlands, and gave way to species of the families Malvaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Myoporaceae, Amaranthaceae and Brassicaceae in the west. Intermittent grazing influenced understorey composition in all box woodlands sampled, although influences in western Box woodlands were less pronounced. Effects of grazing included a decline in shrub abundance and loss of a range of native perennials across all woodlands, changes to the dominant grasses and a considerable increase in exotic annuals in the east, and a decline in native grass diversity and increase in native annuals in the west...|$|E
