5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of S.spraguei appear olive-brown in color, {{although}} this changes to clay or tawny-olive after drying. Microscopically, the spores have smooth surfaces, measuring 9–11 by 3–4.5µm; in <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore attaches to the basidia), while in face view they appear oblong. The spores are not amyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are thin-walled, four-spored, and have dimensions of 17–19 by 5–7.8µm. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, they appear hyaline (translucent), and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer's reagent.|$|E

25|$|The round {{designs were}} the oldest types. The very first round design in 1953 {{featured}} Kim Il-sung's <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> in military uniform, much like their Chinese counterparts. Kim's {{face from the}} front began {{to be used in}} the 1980s. Rectangular badges appeared in the 1980s and were at first reserved for those working in state security organizations. The flag-shaped badges began to be made in the early 1980s. They featured a symbol related to a party, state, or youth organization. The one bearing the emblem of the Workers' Party became the most popular.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with the previous generation model, the redesigned Lexus SC {{was intended as a}} convertible from its inception. The development team was led by chief engineer Yasushi Nakagawa from 1996 to 2000. Lexus designers from Europe and Japan worked together to create a streamlined design. A design theme was chosen in 1997 developed by Sotiris Kovos, who in return was named chief designer. Led by Kovos, designers traveled to the Côte d'Azur to develop the vehicle's exterior shape, and studied the region's architecture, lifestyle, and harbors. The resulting convertible of 1998 received character lines similar to the region's yachts, in {{contrast with}} traditional waveform lines. The vehicle's <b>side</b> <b>profile,</b> the product of extensive wind tunnel testing, was intended to channel air around the passenger compartment at high speed during top-down driving. Design patents were filed in Japan, at the Japan Patent Office on 14 June 1999 under patent number 1095312.|$|E
500|$|Lexus {{released}} an official photograph of its restyled XF40 series in July 2012. The substantial update incorporates the new Lexus corporate fascia, comprising the [...] "spindle" [...] grill and consequently sees the fitment of a redesigned hood, reshaped front fenders and headlamps, plus a new bumper. These styling revisions see {{the retention of}} the <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> and doors, including rear fenders. Thus, the newly designed tail-lamps, trunk lid, and rear bumper are only partially modified. For the first time, an F-Sport variant is being offered.

In this painting, the emperor is painted in a <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> and has a white jama (upper garment) attire adorned with a turban in a background of blue colour. In 1670, Hindus had assembled at the jharokha to protest against the jizya tax imposed on them by Aurangzeb. However, Aurangzeb who was a [...] "puritanical" [...] and practiced strict Islamic codes of conduct in his [...] personal life, stopped this practice on the basis that it was idolization of human beings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} for facial template synthesis based on features extracted from multiple facial instances with varying pose. The proposed system extracts the rotation, scale and translation invariant SIFT features, also having high discrimination ability, from the frontal and half {{left and right}} profiles of an individual face images. These affine invariant features obviate the need of ad-hoc algorithms to register features of <b>side</b> <b>profiles</b> against frontal profiles for feature-set augmentation. An augmented feature set is then formed from the fusion of features from frontal and <b>side</b> <b>profiles</b> of an individual, after removing feature redundancy. The augmented feature sets of database and query images are matched using the Euclidean distance and Point pattern matching techniques. The experimental results are compared with the system using only frontal face images for both the matching strategies. The reported results prove {{the efficacy of the}} proposed system...|$|R

2500|$|Completely {{redesigned}} and now sharing {{design features}} with the XV10 series Toyota Windom and styling cues with the LS 400, {{the model was}} renamed the ES 300 to reflect the half-liter increase in engine displacement to 3.0-liters. The second-generation ES was significantly larger and more curvaceous than its predecessor, gaining [...] in length and [...] of width. On the front fascia, the ES gained projector headlamps in a curved housing and a three-slat grille with the Lexus emblem moved above on the hood. The <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> featured an invisible B-pillar and frameless-window doors. The rear deck lid featured an integrated spoiler effect similar to the flagship LS 400, improving the ES model's aerodynamics, now rated [...]|$|E
2500|$|In <b>side</b> <b>profile,</b> turret deck ships resembled other {{merchant}} vessels with flush decks or {{with small}} forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section {{the differences between}} turret deck vessels and more conventional ships are apparent. There was no gunwale; the vertical side of a turret ship curves inward above the load line to a horizontal plane. This flat area {{was known as the}} harbour deck. Further inboard, this [...] "deck" [...] arced to the vertical again by a reverse curve. That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced {{exclusively}} to Japan in July 1990, the Camry V30 carried forward the four-door sedan and a differently styled hardtop sedan. Like before, either shape could {{be had in}} a Vista branded variety with revised styling. Both bodies would also {{form the basis of}} enlarged wide-body XV10 versions from September 1991, aimed primarily at international markets. The V30 remained smaller than the XV10 to offer buyers a vehicle within the [...] "five-number" [...] registration category concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement for Japanese vehicle size regulations. The rules required a body width under , length under , and engines at or below 2000cc. Sedans in the wide-body format would sell overseas as the Camry XV10—identical to the smaller V30 in most respects except for the front- and rear-end styling grafted to an otherwise unchanged body and interior. Hardtop sedans would engender the luxury Lexus ES 300 (XV10), which again would couple the existing <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> with rehashed front, rear, and interior designs. The export-oriented ES 300 would sell as the Toyota Windom in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{commercial}} {{would begin}} in a predictable manner; the protagonist {{would do something}} that would be considered defiant (in one commercial, an old woman rocked sternly in her chair on her porch, while the rest of her development was being razed to make room for a condominium). In each commercial, the protagonist would say [...] "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!", usually only showing their <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> to the camera. After uttering the slogan, viewers would see the smoker's face, which had a noticeable [...] "black eye" [...] (in reality makeup), proving their willingness to fight for what they believed in, whether it be their tough decision of the day, or their choice to smoke Tareyton cigarettes. In the aforementioned example, the old woman's fighting spirit won out, and her house remained where it was, although the condominium was built alarmingly close to her property. Her son came to visit her, and it was revealed that he was a Tareyton smoker as well [...] he also had a black eye.|$|E
2500|$|As styling {{development}} commenced it was realised that {{to design}} another coach {{to match the}} success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite's most striking feature, notably the size of the windows and the curves that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by utilising the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the centre panel depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were squared up and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with [...] overriders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was slatted on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The <b>side</b> <b>profile</b> again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the windows curved into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite.|$|E
