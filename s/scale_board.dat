In this game, the player must keep their balance while climbing an angled rope ladder that can pivot and invert the player. The object of the game is to climb the ladder, without falling off, and ring a bell {{at the end of the}} climb. Another game that tests the physical abilities of the player is [...] "Ring the Bell". The player uses a large mallet to strike a pivot board on the game, this causes an indicator to be driven vertically up an indicator <b>scale</b> <b>board.</b> By hitting the pivot hard enough, the indicator will ring a bell mounted at the top of the indicator <b>scale</b> <b>board</b> indicating a win. Cover the spot is a game that involves covering a giant red spot with five smaller discs dropped by hand; all red (or color) must be covered to win.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} a {{methodology}} to model the mechanical properties of Pinus Radiata takes place from the nanoscopic cell fiber [3] to the <b>board</b> <b>scale</b> level. Gibson and Ashy had generalized wood cells into hexagonal cells, previous work [2] extends the model specifically for Pinus Radiata. Unfortunately, earlier work was done on published data from various sources, not necessary related to Pinus Radiata nor from a common reference piece of characterized Pinus Radiata, making correlation with experimental work [4] difficult. Further work {{was done by the}} author on a characterized sample of Pinus Radiata to correlate elastic properties with actual cellular geometry and experimental result. Critical geometrical parameters were studied for a feasible mathematical idealization as necessary parameters to further refine the FEM model. Two approaches were used in evaluating <b>board</b> <b>scale</b> modeling; actual wood cells geometry and idealized hexagonal models. These models are extended to Growth ring model to predict growth ring mechanical properties and validated with experimental results as a preliminary <b>Board</b> <b>scale</b> model. Stol had modeled Wood cells as hexagonal cellular material using Gibson's [1] analytical solution in his work with orthotropic wood wall's properties [2]. Sto 1 's analytical solution neglects the longitudinal dimension, which in realism is closer to plate than beam. Gibson and Asbhy's work on prediction of cellular properties analytically formed the basis of formulation analytical solution using energy method (Ritz's method) with plate type stiffness function and further extended with shear and longitudinal boundary coupling effect. The plate analytical solution was validated by FEM to be in close agreement, within a 5 % error. The model based on real cell geometry and its equivalent regular array of identical cell has broad agreements with experimental values. Further refinements of this model are important steps {{in the development of a}} definitive model.

For example, debates on acquisition pressure and the system of appointing external directors regarding joint-stock companies can apply to banks that have adopted the joint-stock company system, but the same is not true of shinkin banks, which are cooperative financial institutions. In this paper we focus on the shinkin bank board of directors, the core entity for conduct of business by shinkin banks and business oversight functions. Specifically, we analyze the factors that determine the <b>scale</b> of the <b>boards</b> of directors of shinkin banks and the relationship between the <b>scale</b> of those <b>boards</b> and the banks' management performance. As regards the former, we confirm that the larger the scale of a shinkin bank's assets, the larger its board of directors tends to be. We also confirm, however, that compared with the number of employees, the number of directors has a weak correlation with the scale of shinkin banks' assets, and factors other than asset scale play a considerable role in determining the number of directors. In regard to the latter, we find that, unlike previous research conducted on joint-stock companies, {{it is not possible to}} discern any clear correlation between <b>board</b> <b>scale</b> and management performance. ...|$|R

40|$|The game of Go has {{attracted}} much attention from the artificial intelligence community. A key feature of Go is that humans begin to learn on a small board, and then incrementally learn advanced strategies on larger boards. While some machine learning methods can also <b>scale</b> the <b>board,</b> they generally only focus on {{a subset of the}} board at one time. Neuroevolution algorithms particularly struggle with scalable Go because they are often directly encoded (i. e. a single gene maps to a single connection in the network). Thus this paper applies an indirect encoding to the problem of scalable Go that can evolve a solution to 5 × 5 Go and then extrapolate that solution to 7 × 7 Go and continue evolution. The scalable method is demonstrated to learn faster and ultimately discover better strategies than the same method trained on 7 × 7 Go directly from the start...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a one-third scale model of full-size (prototype) metal-plate-connected (MPC) wood truss joints using similitude theory. The prototype metal connector plates in MPC joints were modeled using thin galvanized sheet metal and short staples. Truss grade wood material was ripped to one-third scale dimensions to be used as the modeling material. Prototype tension splice joints were modeled with 48, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model connection with each pair of prototype teeth approximated by a single staple tooth. Heel joints were modeled with 60, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model heel joint connection. The remaining truss connections were developed from projections based on tension splice joint and heel joint designs. To provide verification of the model material properties, a modulus of elasticity (MOE) study was performed that compared prototype and one-third <b>scale</b> model <b>boards.</b> The results indicated that although the variation in MOE of the model was 11...|$|R
