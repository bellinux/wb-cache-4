5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of cancer}} was {{proposed}} in 1971 {{to depend on}} at least two mutational events.

40|$|Promoter hypermethylation of tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> {{seems to}} be an early event in breast {{carcinogenesis}} and is potentially reversible. This makes methylation a possible therapeutic target, a marker for treatment response and/or a prognostic factor. Methylation status of 40 tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> was compared between 53 primary breast tumors and their corresponding metastases to brain, lung, liver, or skin. In paired analyses, a significant decrease in methylation values was seen in distant metastases compared to their primaries in 21 / 40 individual tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Furthermore, primary tumors that metastasized to the liver clustered together, in line with the finding that primary breast carcinomas that metastasized to the brain, skin, or lung, showed higher methylation values in up to 27. 5 % of tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> than primary carcinomas that metastasized to the liver. Conversion in methylation status of several genes from the primary tumor to the metastasis had prognostic value, and methylation status of some genes in the metastases predicted survival after onset of metastases. Methylation levels for most of the analyzed tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> were lower in distant metastases compared to their primaries, pointing to the dynamic aspect of methylation of these tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> during cancer progression. Also, specific distant metastatic sites seem to show differences in methylation patterns, implying that hypermethylation profiles of the primaries may steer site-specific metastatic spread. Lastly, methylation status of the metastases seems to have prognostic value. These promising findings warrant further validation in larger patient cohorts and more tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Usually, oncogenes are dominant, as {{they contain}} gain-of-function mutations, while mutated tumor {{suppressors}} are recessive, as they contain loss-of-function mutations. Each cell has {{two copies of}} the same gene, one from each parent, and under most cases gain of function mutations in just one copy of a particular proto-oncogene {{is enough to make}} that gene a true oncogene. On the other hand, loss of function mutations need to happen in both copies of a tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> to render that gene completely non-functional. However, cases exist in which one mutated copy of a tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> can render the other, wild-type copy non-functional. This phenomenon is called the dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations.|$|E

40|$|Extract] Cancer is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} in Iran, after {{coronary}} heart disease and accidents (Mousavi and Somi 2009). Apart from alterations in the various cellular oncogenes, dysregulation of tumour <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> is an important event in the pathogenesis of cancer. Tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> especially those involved in call cycle regulation, are inactivated frequently in a variety of cancers (Cunningham and Roussel 2001). Two closely linked tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> p 15 ⁱⁿᵏ⁴ᵇ and p 16 ⁱⁿᵏ⁴ᵃ, are located at chromosome 9 p 21; they encode their respective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) - p 15 ⁱⁿᵏ⁴ᵇ and p 16 ⁱⁿᵏ⁴ᵃ...|$|R
25|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} – If the DNA {{is integrated}} in a sensitive {{spot in the}} genome, for example in a tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> the therapy could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a retrovirus, and {{this led to the}} development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients. One possible solution is to add a functional tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> to the DNA to be integrated. This may be problematic since the longer the DNA is, the harder it is to integrate into cell genomes. CRISPR technology allows researchers to make much more precise genome changes at exact locations.|$|E
25|$|The first direct {{evidence}} for DCC as a tumour <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> {{was published in}} 1995.

25|$|Since it {{was first}} {{discovered}} in a colorectal cancer study in 1990, DCC {{has been the focus}} of a significant amount of research.

50|$|The {{affected}} {{genes are}} divided into two broad categories. Oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction. Tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> are genes that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{hereditary}} {{factors can}} increase the chance of cancer-causing mutations, including the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> The functions of various onco- and tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> can be disrupted {{at different stages of}} tumor progression. Mutations in such genes can be used to classify the malignancy of a tumor.|$|R

25|$|Chromosome 18 LOH {{tends to}} occur in clusters. One major cluster is at 18q21, which agrees with the {{location}} of DCC. This cluster includes the marker D18S51, and is flanked by the D18S1109 and D18S68 loci. This segment spans 7.64cM, which is a relatively large section of DNA that could easily encompass more than one tumour <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E
25|$|DCC can be {{considered}} a conditional tumour <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> as well as a conditional oncogene. When DCC is present and not activated by netrin it is proapoptotic, and represses tumour formation. When DCC is present and netrin-activated it promotes cell survival, acting as an oncoprotein. Netrin-activated DCC is known to activate the CDC42-RAC1 and MAPK1/3 pathways, both of which are activated in cancer and promote tumour development.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 1. 4 {{million new}} cancers were diagnosed, {{and more than}} 564 000 deaths from cancer were expected, in the United States in 2006 (1). The {{majority}} of these cancer-related deaths will be due to tumor metastasis {{rather than to the}} primary tumors. Thus, the major clinical challenge is to combat systemic metastatic disease.

40|$|Cancer is {{a genetic}} disease; tumor cells differ from their normal {{progenitors}} by genetic alterations that affect growth-regulatory genes. There exist 2 classes of such cancer genes: the oncogenes, which function as positive growth regulators, and the tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> which function as negative growth regulators. Oncogenes are widely conserved among diverse {{forms of life}} and are active in transmitting growth signals from the cell periphery to the cell nucleus. These signaling functions can be disturbed by many types of genetic change; {{the result of an}} altered growth signal is often cancer. Tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> have an attenuating effect on cell growth that is lost as a result of inactivating mutations or deletion of the gene; in DNA virus-transformed cells, it is abrogated by neutralization of the tumor suppressor protein through a viral <b>gene</b> product. Tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> were first recognized in inherited cancers; defects in a tumor suppressor transmitted through the germ line can lead to increased tumor incidence in the offspring. Tumor suppressors also play important roles in nonheritable cancer, however; many tumors in humans show defects in tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Most cancers harbor multiple genetic changes in oncogenes as well as tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Oncogenes induce aberrant growth through a gain in function; tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> contribute to oncogenesis through a loss of function. Both types of mutation work together to produce cancer; the changes are not constant but increase in number as the tumor develops from benign to more and more malignant. Cancer results from the accumulation of genetic changes. Oncogenes and tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> provide important insights into the regulation of cell growth. This knowledge can now be used to develop gene-specific therapies for cancer...|$|R
