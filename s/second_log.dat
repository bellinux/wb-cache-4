2500|$|The {{owners of}} George M. Brown were {{themselves}} sued in April 1928, by E.J. “Bud” Rowland, {{who claimed that}} the tug {{was supposed to have}} towed two log rafts from Siletz Bay to the Multnomah County Lumber & Box Company, at Portland, with delivery to have been made between early September and October 10, 1927. [...] According to Bud Rowland, the first raft of 320,000 board feet of timber, was ready to be taken under tow on October 14, 1927, and was taken as far as Tillamook Bay, where the tug, it was claimed, negligently tried to cross the bar in a heavy sea, causing the raft to break free, and as a result became a total loss. [...] The <b>second</b> <b>log</b> raft, comprising 258,247 board feet of lumber, was tied to a piling in Siletz Bay in later October 1927, but on February 6, 1928, the raft came loose and went ashore. [...] Rowland claimed that as a result, it had suffered damages of $11,121. [...] Ultimately, following a trial, the owners of George M Brown were found not liable.|$|E

60|$|He dropped {{upon the}} timber, {{and the gap}} he splashed into closed up {{suddenly}} as he whipped out his leg. Then, with Brooke behind him, he crawled over the grinding logs, and by and by drove {{the point of the}} auger into one that seemed to run downwards through the midst of them. It was a good many feet in girth, and Brooke gasped heavily when he also laid hold of the auger crutch. The hole they made was charged with one of the yellow rolls, and, moving to a <b>second</b> <b>log,</b> they bored another, while the mass shook and trembled under them, and twice a great spout of water fell splashing upon them. The logs were apparently endued with vitality, for they moved under and over their fellows, and ground upon them with the pulsations of the stream that brought down fresh accessions and found a fresh channel that promptly closed again. The jam might resist the pressure for another week, or break up at any moment, and whirl down the gully in chaotic ruin. Still, with the rain beating down upon them, the pair toiled on until several sticks of explosive had been embedded, when Brooke rose very stiffly and straightened himself as he took a little case out of his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|But {{here again}} the cunning of these horses {{surprised}} me. On one very steep pitch, for instance, I saw before me two logs across the path, two feet {{and more in}} diameter, and what was worse, not two feet apart. How the brown cob meant to get over I could not guess; but as he seemed not to falter or turn tail, as an English horse would have done, I laid the reins on his neck and watched his legs. [...] To my astonishment, he lifted a fore-leg out of the abyss of mud, put it between the logs, where I expected to hear it snap; clawed in front, and shuffled behind; put the other over the <b>second</b> <b>log,</b> the mud and water splashing into my face, and then brought the first freely out from between the logs, and--horrible to see--put a hind one in. Thus did he fairly walk through the whole; stopped a moment to get his breath; and then staggered and scrambled upward again, {{as if he had}} done nothing remarkable. Coming back, by the by, those two logs lay heavy on my heart for a mile ere I neared them. He might get up over them; but how would he get down again? And I was not surprised to hear more than one behind me say, 'I think I shall lead over.' But being in front, if I fell, I could only fall into the mud, and not {{on the top of a}} friend. So I let the brown cob do what he would, determined to see how far a tropic horse's legs could keep him up; and, to my great amusement, he quietly leapt the whole, descending five or six feet into a pool of mud, which shot out over him and me, half blinding us for the moment; then slid away on his haunches downward; picked himself up; and went on as usual, solemn, patient, and seemingly stupid as any donkey.|$|E

40|$|A New Zealand {{stand of}} Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden was pruned up to height 8 m and grown for 15 years at low {{stocking}} to 57 cm diameter at breast height. This stand provided 15 trees, preselected {{for a range}} of wood density. Lumber and veneer were cut from the 5 -m butt logs, veneer was peeled from the <b>second</b> <b>logs</b> from height 7 to 13 m, and each tree was evaluated for production of appearance-grade lumber and rotary-peeled veneer. Butt-log quality was good as pruning had effectively restricted the knotty core, and there was little decay from branches in either butt logs or veneer billets. Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing timber conversion in some trees. Collapse and internal checking were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated splitting. Knots severely downgraded structural plywood veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the <b>second</b> <b>logs</b> being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned butt logs. Stiffness of veneer sheets was successfully measured using a sonic device (Pundit™) to sort veneers for manufacture of laminated veneer lumber...|$|R

5000|$|Up to {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the bulk of the redwood forest lay in the Redwood Creek valley, with {{extensions}} to the surrounding ridges. In 1826 British navy captain Frederick William Beechey used the [...] "Navigation Trees", two particularly tall redwood trees along the ridges, to help them navigate in San Francisco Bay. However, logging from 1845 to 1860 wiped out the original trees, leaving only their stumps. A <b>second</b> <b>logging</b> occurred after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In this instance the second growth redwoods (approximately 50 years old) as well as the stumps from the first generation trees were logged, the site of which is registered as California Historical Landmark #962. The redwoods contained in today's regional park are third-growth trees, many of which are over 100 years old. Only one old-growth redwood remains in the area, a 93 feet m feet tall tree that seems to grow miraculously out of a rock on a cliff face near Merritt College and probably too difficult to reach for loggers to bother with.|$|R

50|$|Finally, Zorba's {{elaborate}} contraption {{to transport}} timber {{down the hill}} is complete. A festive ceremony, including lamb on a spit is held, and all the villagers turned out. After a blessing from the priests, Zorba signals the start by firing a rifle in the air. A log comes hurtling down the zip line at a worrying pace, destroying the log itself and slightly damaging part of the contraption. Zorba remains unconcerned and gives orders for a <b>second</b> <b>log.</b> This one also speeds down and shoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have grown fearful and head for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and orders a third log, which accelerates downhill with such violence that it dislodges the entire contraption, destroying everything. The villagers flee, leaving Basil and Zorba behind.|$|E
30|$|Computer re-grading of the unpruned logs removed of all {{the dead}} and rotten knots from <b>second</b> and third <b>logs</b> (simulated “brashing”). The butt log timber grades for this {{scenario}} were from the computer re-graded prune log (above). Brashing the <b>second</b> and third <b>logs</b> resulted in a substantial shift in volumes of sawn timber calculated on a stand area basis from the four lowest value grades (Construction Common, Construction Heart, Merchantable Common and Merchantable Heart) to four highest value grades (Heart B, B Common, Clear Common or Clear All Heart) (33 % of all pieces, Table  7). Approximately 10 % of boards were re-graded to Clear All Heart and Clear Common, the greatest shift being from Merchantable and Construction to B grades.|$|R
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of heart splitting during the crosscutting of logs was discussed {{in relation to}} the released strain on Eucalyptus spp. logs. The strains released in the longitudinal and tangential directions were measured by the strain-gauge method and were correlated with the length of the heart split measured on the same logs. There were differences in the longitudinal strain; however, no significant correlation was found with the diameter that could be converted to a mean annual increment (i.e., a relation with the growth rate). The initial splits expand with the time after felling. The longer the initial split, the longer is the length 1 week after felling. The split length was significantly smaller at the butt end of the first log of every tree than at the other end, but {{there were no significant differences}} between the split length at the top of the first logs and at either end of the <b>second</b> <b>logs,</b> although there were differences among individual trees. The length of the heart split correlated with the released strain near the pith, which was estimated using Kubler’s equation. The longitudinal released strain measured on the surface of logs is a good indicator of the heart splitting when crosscutting logs.|$|R
40|$|Southeast Asia is a hotspot of imperilled biodiversity, {{owing to}} {{extensive}} logging and forest conversion to oil palm agriculture. The degraded forests that remain after multiple rounds of intensive logging are often {{assumed to be}} of little conservation value; consequently, {{there has been no}} concerted effort to prevent them from being converted to oil palm. However, no study has quantified the biodiversity of repeatedly logged forests. We compare the species richness and composition of birds and dung beetles within unlogged (primary), once-logged and twice-logged forests in Sabah, Borneo. Logging had little effect on the overall richness of birds. Dung beetle richness declined following once-logging but did not decline further after twice-logging. The species composition of bird and dung beetle communities was altered, particularly after the <b>second</b> <b>logging</b> rotation, but globally imperilled bird species (IUCN Red List) did not decline further after twice-logging. Remarkably, over 75 per cent of bird and dung beetle species found in unlogged forest persisted within twice-logged forest. Although twice-logged forests have less biological value than primary and once-logged forests, they clearly provide important habitat for numerous bird and dung beetle species. Preventing these degraded forests from being converted to oil palm should be a priority of policy-makers and conservationists...|$|R
