50|$|Tipping {{points with}} a very small {{separation}} distance between equilibrium states are used in microswitches. Large switches use separate <b>springs,</b> <b>levers,</b> and hinges to construct the tipping point, but the microswitch uses a very small kinked metal leaf spring. The strip is secured at one end {{very close to the}} kink, which bends the strip in an upward direction.|$|R

50|$|In 1855, John Ramsbottom, later {{locomotive}} {{superintendent of}} the LNWR, described {{a new form of}} safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central <b>spring.</b> This <b>lever</b> was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the <b>spring</b> <b>lever</b> by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.|$|R
5000|$|In 1806, Binny & Ronaldson {{acquired}} from William Duane some {{tools and equipment}} that Benjamin Franklin had purchased from Pierre Simon Fournier in France twenty years earlier. In 1812 the foundry issued the first type specimen book ever produced in the United States. Archibald Binny created a <b>spring</b> <b>lever,</b> which improved the efficiency of type casting. Binny patented three improvements to type-founding: an improved printer's mold, a method of [...] "smoothing or rubbing printers' types", and molds for casting printing types.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple-levers: Having {{at least}} two <b>spring</b> loaded <b>levers</b> that are each {{operated}} with one hand action to unlock the next ones movement, the last (third or later) action opening the gate.|$|R
5000|$|The same {{procedure}} {{is used to}} make printed circuit boards, foil-stamping dies and embossing dies. It {{is also used to}} make nameplates, commemorative plaques and other decorative engravings. It {{can be used to make}} flat <b>springs,</b> <b>levers,</b> gears and other practical components that would otherwise be fabricated from sheet metal by cutting, drilling, jigsawing or stamping. A very high degree of precision is possible. In these applications, it is properly called photochemical machining, but the terms photochemical milling, chemical milling and photoetching are sometimes used. A similar process called photolithography is used to make integrated circuits.|$|R
50|$|Guitarist and {{engineering}} student Cosmos Lyles {{came up with}} a device to keep his guitar in tune, {{and with the help of}} engineer Paul Dowd produced a prototype of the EverTune bridge, which uses a <b>spring</b> and <b>lever</b> system that maintains string tension.|$|R
40|$|In {{winding-up}} {{motor drive}} systems, {{such as that}} used in textile industry, it is very important&# 13; to get a constant tension force for the winding strip material (thread) and to reduce its oscillations. This&# 13; study recommends a transducer with a special design {{to be used in}} the mentioned motor drive systems. &# 13; By using a piston damper, <b>spring,</b> <b>levers,</b> slider and other simple components the suggested sensor&# 13; (transducer) can be used to control the motor speed for getting the required thread tension force. Also&# 13; the suggested transducer avoids the disadvantage of other used conventional transducer: the parasitic&# 13; (detrimental) oscillations of the thread tension force, which affect the quality of the produced strip&# 13; material...|$|R
5000|$|The Nikkormat FT was an all-metal, {{mechanically}} (<b>springs,</b> gears, <b>levers)</b> controlled, manual focus SLR with match-needle exposure control, {{manufactured in}} Japan from 1965 to 1967. It {{was available in}} two colors: black with chrome trim and all black. The unmetered version was designated [...] "Nikkormat FS." ...|$|R
50|$|However large <b>springs</b> and <b>levers</b> {{can produce}} a loud {{clunking}} noise as they suddenly release. In homes this noise is undesirable, resulting {{in the development of}} much simpler tipping point mechanisms of low mass, using leaf springs and a very small strip of metal as the contact actuator.|$|R
5000|$|The devices do {{a variety}} of things, though {{not all of them}} will fit all guitars. The Third Hand Capo and the SpiderCapo (appearing in 2008) are the only {{universal}} capos. Each can clamp any of the 63 combinations of strings at any fret of any guitar, although only the SpiderCapo can produce any combination at a given fret without repositioning the capo. Shubb and Kyser each make a 3-string [...] "E-sus" [...] capo as well as a 5-string [...] "Drop-E" [...] capo. The Esus capo creates a sound similar to the popular DADGAD guitar tuning. Woodie's G-Band capos clamp 1 or 2 outer strings, and Kyser now makes a series of [...] "K-Lever" [...] capos that incorporate a <b>spring</b> <b>lever</b> to allow temporary fretting of some notes that lie under the capo.|$|R
50|$|Bing and Bong design gadgets to {{discover}} the properties of <b>springs,</b> wheels, <b>levers,</b> pulleys, balance, forces, gears and structures. The planet consists of a massive detailed brass sphere, with four tethered satellites: two cubes and two spheres. The action takes place inside this planet, {{with an emphasis on}} structures and principles of physics.|$|R
50|$|Because {{hinge points}} are {{eliminated}} and the motion {{is due to}} stressing of a thin metal strip, microswitches are extremely reliable, operating for millions of cycles without failure. A larger switch constructed of separate <b>springs</b> and <b>levers</b> wears out more quickly, due to the hinge points rubbing together under the high pressure of the tipping point spring.|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{frame on}} non-electronic {{mechanical}} markers simply use {{a series of}} <b>springs</b> and <b>levers</b> to drop a sear, which propels the hammer in the body forward. On electronic markers, the trigger frame houses the electronics that control the solenoid, as well as features such as ball detection systems. Upgraded circuit boards that add improved features are available.|$|R
50|$|The {{final version}} of the Webley-Fosbery was {{released}} in 1914. It had a shorter cylinder than on earlier models and the trigger <b>spring</b> and recoil <b>lever</b> were strengthened.|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{measurement}} of acoustic startle response in mice is described. The technique utilizes a <b>spring</b> suspended <b>lever,</b> commercially available strain-gauge transducer, and polygraph. Individual startle responses are recorded as upward (flexion) and downward (extension) pen deflections, {{the force of}} either component being lin-early related to the amplitude of the vertical pen deflec-tions. The apparatus, with minor modifications, {{may be used to}} measure startle responses in larger rodents...|$|R
5000|$|Delayed {{blowback}} (also {{known as}} Hesitation): This action is found where recoil is light enough that a fully locked breech is not necessary. Like simple blowback, it is case movement {{that opens the}} breech. This is a more robust version of simple blowback. Sometime a <b>spring</b> loaded <b>lever</b> is used to increase the resistance inertia of the slide/breech to keep {{the case in the}} chamber long enough to be safe.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon FE was a {{conservative}} design compared to its competitors. It {{can be described}} as a twin of the Nikon FM mechanical (<b>springs,</b> gears, <b>levers)</b> camera with precision electronic controls grafted on. Its unusual roots were most obvious in its backup ability to operate without batteries - albeit in a very limited fashion: completely manual mechanical control with two shutter speeds (1/90th second, marked M90, or Bulb) and without the light meter.|$|R
50|$|Locking carabiners {{have the}} same general shape as {{non-locking}} carabiners but have an additional mechanism securing the gate. These mechanisms may be either threaded sleeves ("screw-lock"), spring-loaded sleeves ("twist-lock"), magnetic <b>levers</b> ("Magnetron"), other <b>spring</b> loaded unlocking <b>levers</b> or double-gates ("Twin-Gate"),.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} reasons for its failure. Foremost was the Reising's complex design of many small pins, plungers, <b>springs</b> and <b>levers.</b> Dis{{assembly}} and assembly was difficult even under normal conditions. Simple maintenance was problematic as there was no bolt hold-open device. Chambering a cartridge was awkward as the action bar was hard to grasp in the forearm and could be obstructed by the sling. Worse, the safety/selector switch couldn't be sensed by feel at night if {{it was in the}} safe, semi, or automatic position.|$|R
5000|$|The Nikkormat EL was an all-metal, electromechanically (some {{solid-state}} electronics, {{but mostly}} <b>springs,</b> gears and <b>levers)</b> controlled, manual-focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture-priority autoexposure, manufactured in Japan from 1972 to 1976. It {{was available in}} two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.|$|R
5000|$|On a guitar, {{the bridge}} has six <b>springs</b> and <b>levers,</b> {{one for each}} of a guitar's six strings, such that [...] "when a string {{stretches}} or slips, the springs apply the opposing force necessary to compensate for the shift, thus maintaining the correct tension and tuning." [...] In theory, the device can work with any stringed instrument, according to the inventors. The mechanism has been patented. A guitar with one installed is no longer tuned by turning the pegs {{at the end of the}} guitar's neck but rather with a screw on the bridge.|$|R
2500|$|A toggle {{light switch}} is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal <b>springs</b> and <b>levers.</b> The toggle light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on/off position. The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|R
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a <b>sprung</b> <b>lever</b> so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|R
50|$|Originally {{called the}} Barber-Colman Impressor, the Barcol impressor was {{developed}} by Walter Colman as a hand-held, portable means of assessing the hardness of a material during World War II. The United States Army Air Corps required a hand-held method of checking the hardness of rivets due to concerns that aircraft could be sabotaged by replacing normal rivets with soft lead or wooden ones which would fail during flight. The impressor operates when the tip is pressed against the material in question. The hardness of the material determines how far the tip indents and this is transferred by a tension <b>spring</b> and <b>lever</b> to be read on a dial.|$|R
5000|$|The L.R.5 {{emerged in}} 1945 as a single-engined, wooden, low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, {{powered by a}} [...] Blackburn Cirrus Minor 4-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted, in-line piston aircraft engine. The spacious side-by-side configuration cockpit was covered by a large plexiglas canopy with car-type entry doors on both sides. The undercarriage included <b>levered</b> <b>sprung</b> main legs and a steerable nosewheel.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} experiments in anti-magnetic watch-making are in 1846. Watchmakers from Vacheron Constantin {{were among the}} first to experiment with anti-magnetic features of a watch. However, they succeeded in assembling the first antimagnetic watch only several decades later. That watch was able to withstand magnetic fields because some of its parts were made of non-magnetic metals: the palladium-made balance wheel, balance <b>spring</b> and the <b>lever</b> shaft.|$|R
50|$|The FM10 is a {{mechanically}} (<b>springs,</b> gears, <b>levers)</b> controlled manual focus SLR with {{manual exposure}} control. It is operable without batteries, which are only required (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) {{for the light}} metering information system. This consists of an internal 60/40 percent centerweighted, silicon photodiode light meter linked to a center-the-LED exposure control system using vertically arranged +/•/- light emitting diodes (LEDs) {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the meter versus the actual camera settings. The focusing screen also has 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids. Overall, the FM10 has the features of a typical late 1970s SLR.|$|R
50|$|The K1000 is an almost-all metal, {{mechanically}} (<b>springs,</b> gears, <b>levers)</b> controlled, manual-focus SLR with manual-exposure control. It {{is completely}} operable without batteries. Batteries are only required (one A76 or S76, or LR44 or SR44) {{for the light}} metering information system. This consists of a centre-the-needle exposure control system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving between vertically arranged +/- over/underexposure markers at {{the right side of}} the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS)battery light meter versus the actual camera settings. The meter does not have a true on/off switch and the lens cap must be attached to the lens to prevent draining the K1000's battery when it is not in use.|$|R
5000|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 39 mph. [...] There is a {{transmission}} brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake <b>lever.</b> <b>Springing</b> is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear of some of the cars. Artillery type wheels were fitted.|$|R
40|$|A silicon {{capacitive}} force/torque sensor {{is designed}} and realized {{to be used}} for biomechanical applications and robotics. The sensor is able to measure the forces in three directions and two torques using four parallel capacitor plates and four comb-structures. Novel <b>spring</b> and <b>lever</b> structures are designed to separate the different force components and minimize mechanical crosstalk. The fabrication process is based on deep reactive ion etching on both sides of a single silicon-on-insulator wafer and uses only two masks making it a straight-forward and robust process. The sensor has a force range of 2 N in shear and normal direction and a torque range of more than 6 Nmm. It has a high sensitivity of 38 fF/N and 550 fF/N in shear and normal direction respectively...|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F2 is an all-metal, mechanically-controlled (<b>springs,</b> gears, <b>levers),</b> manual focus SLR with manual {{exposure}} control. The camera itself needed no batteries, though the prism light meter did (and {{of course the}} motor drive if added). The F2 replaced the Nikon F, adding many new features (a faster 1/2000 second maximum shutter speed, a swing open back for easier film loading, a wider assortment of detachable finders and metering heads, a 250 exposure film back, a larger reflex mirror to ensure no vignetting, and a shutter release nearer {{the front of the}} camera for better ergonomics). It also offered a detachable motor drive, something the F only had as a custom modification. It was the last all-mechanical professional-level Nikon SLR.|$|R
5000|$|In 1862, Vacheron Constantin {{became a}} member of the Association for Research into {{non-magnetic}} materials. In 1885, the company created the first nonmagnetic timepiece which included a complete lever assortment made of materials able to withstand magnetic fields. Its construction included a balance wheel, balance <b>spring</b> and <b>lever</b> shaft that were made of palladium, the lever arms—in bronze and the escape wheel was in gold. In 1877, [...] "Vacheron & Constantin, Fabricants, Geneve" [...] became the official name of the company. In 1880, Vacheron & Constantin started using the Maltese cross as its symbol, which it still does as of 2016. This was inspired by a component of the barrel, which had a cross-shape and was used for limiting the tension within the mainspring.|$|R
