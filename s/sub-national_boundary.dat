50|$|The border {{changed from}} being an {{international}} border to a <b>sub-national</b> <b>boundary</b> (boundary of a division within a country) and vice versa several times. It became an international border after the cession of Singapore to the East India Company by Johor in 1824 as Johor was de jure a sovereign state. In 1914, the border became that of between two British-ruled territories when Johor became a British protectorate while Singapore remained a British crown colony.|$|E
50|$|The phrase {{territorial}} {{police force}} varies in precise meaning {{according to the}} country {{to which it is}} related, generally distinguishing a force whose area of responsibility is defined by <b>sub-national</b> <b>boundaries</b> from others which deal with the entire country or a restricted range of crime.|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} for transboundary protected areas Special consideration {{should be given}} by governments (national or sub-national) to establishing border-contiguous protected areas, and to engaging in management of abutting protected areas in the following situations: Where boundaries are located in shared water bodies such as rivers or lakes, and perhaps even for shared underground aquifers, e. g., Rio Grande at Big Bend/Cañon Santa Elena (USA–Mexico). Where an important earth feature such as a mountain or a glacier or a coral reef contains national or <b>sub-national</b> <b>boundaries,</b> e. g., Mount Kanchenjungma (In-dia, Nepal, China), Israel-Jordan Coral reef in Red Sea; needed for Mont Blanc, which has no protection, between Italy, France, and Switzerland. Where a natural ecological system straddles one or more boundaries {{and needs to be}} managed as a single ecological unit in order to preserve essential species, communities, and ecological processes, e. g., ibex in La Vanoise and Gran Para-diso, which move across the Alps in winter–summer ranges from Italy to France...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the European Commission {{endorsed}} a future company tax strategy {{that would allow}} EU companies the option of calculating their EU profits on a common consolidated tax base and allow Member States to tax their share of that base at national rates. Implementing this strategy requires developing a formula to distribute the common tax base across the Member States. Although EU Member States currently do not use formulary methods to distribute a common consolidate tax base across national boundaries, Canada and the United States have extensive experience using formulary methods to distribute income across <b>sub-national</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Thus, the European Union can turn to North America to gain valuable insights into {{the design of a}} formulary apportionment system with common base taxation. This paper evaluates key issues that may arise when implementing common consolidated base taxation with formulary apportionment in the EU. These issues include the formula design, the definition of the company group and the definition and scope of the tax base. The paper also discusses potential economic consequences that may arise and suggests a potential apportionment system for the European Union.

40|$|There is no {{accurate}} contemporary global map of {{the distribution}} of malaria. We show how guidelines formulated to advise travellers on appropriate chemoprophylaxis for areas of reported Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria risk can be used to generate crude spatial limits. We first review and amalgamate information on these guidelines to define malaria risk at national and <b>sub-national</b> administrative <b>boundary</b> levels globally. We then adopt an iterative approach to reduce these extents by applying a series of biological limits imposed by altitude, climate and population density to malaria transmission, specific to the local dominant vector species. Global areas of, and population at risk from, P. falciparum and often-neglected P. vivax malaria are presented for 2005 for all malaria endemic countries. These results reveal that more than 3 billion people were at risk of malaria in 2005...|$|R
