50|$|Methodological reductionism is the {{position}} that the best <b>scientific</b> <b>strategy</b> is to attempt to reduce explanations to the smallest possible entities. Methodological reductionism would thus include the claim that the atomic explanation of a substance's boiling point is preferable to the chemical explanation, and that an explanation based on even smaller particles (quarks and leptons, perhaps) would be even better. Methodological reductionism, therefore, is the opinion that all scientific theories either can or should be reduced to a single super~theory through the process of theoretical reduction.|$|E

The <b>scientific</b> <b>strategy</b> of the EPIC study is based firstly on recognising that {{cancer is a}} complex process involving multiple environmental and genetic factors. Secondly, the strategy understands that making progress in terms of scientific knowledge of the causal relationship between dietary exposure and other environmental factors, and cancer, requires an innovative approach that simultaneously includes the combination of traditional epidemiology instruments, {{with the use of}} biochemical and biological markers of exposure, as well as genetic susceptibility markers. The study of the interaction of environmental factors with genetic factors is a key part of aetiopathogenesis.|$|E
