We consider the inherent challenges that such a problem formulation presents and try to use a relational Markov network model that learns over the individual attributes as well as the relations among the entities. We apply the model to a dataset containing Amazon product items, which has complementary and <b>substitute</b> <b>item</b> relations.

40|$|Retailers {{as well as}} {{manufacturers}} {{can suffer}} substantial revenue losses {{as a result of}} product discontinuations. The magnitude of this sales loss is dependent on how the consumer responds, which in turn is affected by various product and consumer factors. To date empirical research on consumer responses to product unavailability has focussed on out-of-stocks {{and to a lesser extent}} permanent assortment reductions implemented by the retailer. A critical area that has not been explored to date is that of examining consumer responses to manufacturer product discontinuations and how those responses will affect product category sales. Drawing on insights from past empirical research on product unavailability, this original research investigates the short-term impact of three different types of product discontinuation on the shoppers’ switching behaviour and on sales within the product category. The research also examines whether varying purchase levels of the preferred discontinued product moderates the switching behaviour. Several propositions are developed and tested using scanner data collected from Flybuys’ customers across three product categories and 48 New World stores within the Auckland region. Results from the study indicate that although the dominant switching behaviour to a preferred-product discontinuation is to substitute within the product category, both the retailer and the manufacturer experience short-term sales losses. Findings suggest that prior purchasers of the discontinued product do not spend as much in the product category in the three month period following the discontinuation. Furthermore; shoppers are more likely to substitute with products that have similar attributes in terms of flavour, form or benefit and this switching behaviour is moderated by varying purchase levels of the discontinued product. The findings suggest that retailers should be cautious in assuming that shoppers will continue to spend the same amount on a <b>substitute</b> <b>item</b> after the discontinuation and should ensure there are a number of acceptable alternatives available on shelf. The results further suggest that the retailer may wish to explicitly signal the products with similar attributes to heavy purchasers of the discontinued product to help mitigate sales losses. By empirically investigating consumers’ responses to preferred-product discontinuations this study adds to the body of knowledge in the area of consumer responses to product unavailability. Finally, a number of limitations are discussed and suggestions made for future research...|$|E
40|$|Demand {{uncertainty}} frequently draws business's {{attention and}} this burden of demand variability becomes tougher {{to cope with}} when managers face the often seen complex supply chains. Firms attempt to employ various approaches {{to take advantage of}} the risk-pooling effect. In this study, we investigate the risk-pooling effect of demand switching ratio for multiple products and its impact on selecting among various paths. We develop a model and a comparison framework to evaluate the various paths: three paths and two paths, with possible demand switching ratio for multiple products. The challenges in this decision lie in “how” and “how much” to switch. Demand substitution by persuading customers to purchase the <b>substitute</b> <b>item</b> instead of the original item they had in mind has been frequently used to reduce the total demand variability and thus reduce the need for inventory. Next, we point out the influence of the demand substitution in profit of the companies on various paths. In our study, it is found that demand substitution will not always reduce the costly consequences associated with uncertainty of demand. We also proposed a new Algorithm to reduce time that practitioners can get optimum and exacter product switching rates of demand substitution with multiple products. It is also interesting to note that the total profit in four cases may be influenced by various paths and original correlations coefficients. At last, our numerical examples help managers to gain the managerial insight of taking advantage of the risk-pooling effect, and to illustrate the application of the proposed various paths. 當管理者面對複雜的供應鏈時，需求的不確定性以及變異性是管理者所必須處理的首要難題。他們會企圖使用各種不同的方式去獲取在風險共擔（Risk-pooling）中有利的條件。在本篇論文中，我們研究多重產品間需求轉換比例在風險共擔之效用。在不同的需求轉換下，我們發展出一套量化模型及評估架構（多重產品間需求轉換比例）去比較多種轉換路徑對公司之影響。其中，主要的挑戰在於「如何轉換」及「轉換多少」。需求轉換是藉由說服顧客去購買某項替代商品，理論上利用風險共擔之效用，採購者可因此降低商品總需求的變異而達到存貨減低的目的。之後我們提出多重產品間需求轉換比例對公司利益之影響。在本研究中，我們發現多重產品在某些情況之下需求轉換不一定可以獲得風險共擔之效用。我們也提出新的演算法來幫助公司在多重產品的不同轉換路徑及產品相關性中更快獲得最佳轉換比率。最後，我們亦提供數值範例來驗證風險共擔之效益，並圖解闡述多種轉換路徑評估架構之應用。Contents CHAPTER 1 	INTRODUCTION	 1 CHAPTER 2 	LITERATURE REVIEW	 6 2. 1.

30|$|As we {{know that}} at any retails or {{supermarket}} the occurrence of temporary stock-outs is a very common phenomenon in the categories of frequently purchased items {{and it is also}} very common to see at any retails or supermarket, customers who willing to purchase certain items will be willing to purchase the <b>substitute</b> <b>items,</b> if they faced the situation of the stock-outs. A survey report of Anupindi et al. (1998) also observed the same phenomenon, in which he found that 82 – 88 % of buyer would be willing to buy the <b>substitute</b> <b>items</b> if the desired items are out of stock. The substitutable items in which sufficient deterioration can take place during the normal storage period of the units and consequently this loss {{must be taken into account}} when analyzing the inventory system of substitutable items, i.e. the effect of deterioration plays a vital role in the decision of ordering quantity of substitutable deteriorating items. When substitution will take place an additional cost is incurred, known as substitution cost. Such substitution costs may arise due to a variety of reasons: the cost of the reworking required on an item to make it substitutable for the other, loss of a customer’s goodwill due to substitution, etc. Deterioration of physical goods in stock is a very realistic feature and there is a big need to consider it in the inventory modelling of substitutable items. Tang and Yin (2007) categorizes the substitution as stock-out-based substitution, price-based substitution and assortment-based substitution. Recently, Kim and Bell (2011) categorizes the substitution as symmetrical substitution and asymmetrical substitution. As they define, the definition of these categories are: stock-out based substitution corresponds to a situation in which a customer may purchase another product as a substitute, when the preferred product is out of stock, price-based substitution corresponds to a situation in which a retailer uses different pricing to make certain products substitutable, assortment-based substitution occurs when products with similar attributes are substitutable while symmetrical substitution occurs when all of the unfulfilled demands of one items are completely fulfilled by the demands of the <b>substitute</b> <b>items</b> and asymmetrical substitution occur when partial fraction of unfulfilled demands are added to the demands of the substitutable item. Based on the categories defined as above, this paper lies in the category of asymmetrical stock-out-based substitution. In the recent years, little bit attention has been given in the research for the stock-out-based substitution within the EOQ setting under deterministic demand and to the best of our knowledge no one consider the concept of deterioration for the substitutable items with deterministic demand and joint replenishment. Recently, Salameh et al. (2014) developed the joint replenishment policy for substitution by considering the deterministic demand, closely related to this paper, but they have not considered the concept of deterioration which is more realistic to determine the accurate optimal ordering quantity in the current era of competitive business strategies. Large numbers of the literature are available in inventory modelling of substitutable and deteriorating item separately. Thus, in subsequent paragraph, first, we discuss about recent and previous advancement in the inventory modelling of deteriorating items then inventory modelling of substitutable items.|$|R

In this inventory model the inventory level of both items depleted due to demands and deterioration and when an item is out of stock, its demands are partially fulfilled by the other item and all unsatisfied demand is lost. Each <b>substituted</b> <b>item</b> incurs a cost of substitution and the demands and deterioration is considered to be deterministic and constant. Items are order jointly in each ordering cycle, to take the advantages of joint replenishment. The problem is formulated and a solution procedure is developed to determine the optimal ordering quantities that minimize the total inventory cost. We provide an extensive numerical and sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effect of different parameter on the model. The key observation on the basis of numerical analysis, there is substantial improvement in the optimal total cost of the inventory model with substitution over without substitution.|$|R

Understanding how consumers respond to stockouts is therefore {{the starting point for}} retailers who wish to improve on-shelf availability.

[...] Although these responses differ in severity, each entails negative consequences for retailers. Stockouts cause lost sales, dissatisfy shoppers, diminish store loyalty, jeopardize marketing efforts, and obstruct sales planning, because substitution disguises true demand. Moreover, shopper surveys reveal stockouts to currently be the most prevalent annoyance to shoppers. Shoppers spend a considerable amount of time looking for and asking for out-of-stock items. [...] Shopper response to stockouts has been investigated by researchers with respect to cognitive response (e.g. perceived availability), affective response (e.g. store satisfaction), behavioural response (e.g. brand switching) and aggregated response in terms of category sales effects.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of public goods {{such as the}} radio spectrum is a difficult task that the government must face. Currently, auctions are becoming an important tool {{to deal with this}} duty. In this context, the rules that the auctioneer establishes are particularly relevant, as the final outcome depends on them. When auctioning many related items, such as spectrum licenses, the bidders’ values for one item may depend on the number of items already obtained (complements and <b>substitutes</b> <b>items).</b> In such circumstances, combinatorial auctions are the most appropriate alternative for allocating lots. This paper analyzes the implications of selecting a particular pricing mechanism on the final result in a combinatorial sealed-bid auction. The following pricing rules are selected: the first-price mechanism, the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism, and the bidder–Pareto–optimal (BPO) core mechanism, a core-selecting auction. To test these pricing rules, a simulator of the auction model has been developed. Then, to tackle the complex problem of simulating bidders’ behavior, a co-evolutionary system has been designed to identify improved strategies. The results revealed that the first-price mechanism yields inefficient outcomes and a notable reduction in the seller's revenues. Both the VCG and BPO mechanisms yield outcomes that are closer to the efficient allocation, and differences in revenues are affected by the presence of asymmetries.
