5000|$|Another {{method of}} flow {{measurement}} involves placing a bluff body (called a <b>shedder</b> <b>bar)</b> {{in the path}} of the fluid. As the fluid passes this bar, disturbances in the flow called vortices are created. The vortices trail behind the cylinder, alternatively from each side of the bluff body. This vortex trail is called the Von Kármán vortex street after von Kármán's 1912 mathematical description of the phenomenon. The frequency at which these vortices alternate sides is essentially proportional to the flow rate of the fluid. Inside, atop, or downstream of the <b>shedder</b> <b>bar</b> is a sensor for measuring the frequency of the vortex shedding. This sensor is often a piezoelectric crystal, which produces a small, but measurable, voltage pulse every time a vortex is created. Since the frequency of such a voltage pulse is also proportional to the fluid velocity, a volumetric flow rate is calculated using the cross sectional area of the flow meter. The frequency is measured and the flow rate is calculated by the flowmeter electronics using the equation where [...] is the frequency of the vortices, [...] the characteristic length of the bluff body, [...] is the velocity of the flow over the bluff body, and [...] is the Strouhal number, which is essentially a constant for a given body shape within its operating limits.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{compares the}} results from a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) {{and the result of}} two Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements. The work focuses on a model of a vortex flow meter, a common flow meter type in process industry. Its {{measuring}} principle is that the frequency of a vortex street, generated by a <b>shedder</b> <b>bar,</b> is acquired by pressure or velocity sensors. The shedding frequency is proportional to the bulk flow rate. Tests are performed at a Reynolds number of 61400, based on the pipe diameter. A complementary LDV measurement is also performed at a Reynolds number of 62800. All results are normalized with the bulk velocity to be comparable to each other. A comparison of the mean streamwise velocity profiles shows excellent agreement between the numerical and experimenta l methods. The variance of the two velocity components is also in good agreement between the in vestigated results. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} capture the vortex shedding frequency by analysis of primary LDV data at the investigated Reynolds number. Velocity fluctuations due to secondary vortices are highlighted both in the LES and LDV results. Post-processing of the frequency spectra is implemented utilizing Bayesian probability theory which strengthens the dominating frequencies and attenuates the noise. The fundamental shedding frequencies found by nu merical and experimental methods are shown to be within the limits of theoretical estimations. The redundant results strengthens the reliability of each individual method. The results from flow simulations and measurements are assoc iated with uncertainties. The different types of uncertainty contributions are described and the results are evaluated taking calculated uncertainty contributions into account. For the LDV cases, estimated uncertainty con- tributions from the test setup, are included in the end results...|$|E

6000|$|Long {{before the}} last rumble ceased every night-gong in the village had taken up the warning. To these were added the hoarse {{screaming}} of conches in the little temples; the throbbing of drums and tom-toms; and from the European quarters, where the riveters lived, McCartney's bugle, a weapon of offence on Sundays and festivals, brayed desperately, calling to [...] "Stables." [...] Engine after engine toiling home along the spurs after her day's work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the far bank. Then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood and not fire; conch, drum, and whistle echoed the call, and the village quivered {{to the sound of}} bare feet running upon soft earth. The order in all cases was to stand by the day's work and wait instructions. The gangs poured by in the dusk; men stopping to knot a loin-cloth or fasten a sandal; gang-foremen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the tool-issue <b>sheds</b> for <b>bars</b> and mattocks; locomotives creeping down their tracks wheel-deep in the crowd, till the brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the river-bed, raced over the pile-work, swarmed along the lattices, clustered by the cranes, and stood still, each man in his place.|$|R
