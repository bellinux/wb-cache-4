50|$|The {{resulting}} horizontal {{sweep speed}} was uncalibrated because the sweep rate was adjusted by changing {{slope of the}} <b>sawtooth</b> <b>generator.</b> The time per division on the display depended upon the sweep's free-running frequency and a horizontal gain control.|$|E
50|$|Early {{oscilloscopes}} used a synchronized sawtooth {{waveform generator}} {{to provide the}} time axis. The sawtooth would be made by charging a capacitor with a relatively constant current; that would create a rising voltage. The rising voltage would be fed to the horizontal deflection plates to create the sweep. The rising voltage would also be fed to a comparator; when the capacitor reached a certain level, the capacitor would be discharged, the trace {{would return to the}} left, and the capacitor (and the sweep) would start another traverse. The operator would adjust the charging current so the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>generator</b> would have a slightly longer period than a multiple of the vertical axis signal. For example, when looking at a 1 kHz sinewave (1 ms period), the operator might adjust the horizontal frequency to {{a little bit more than}} 5 ms. When the input signal was absent, the sweep would free run at that frequency.|$|E
40|$|Principal Methods Employed in Improving the Linearity of the Output of a <b>Sawtooth</b> <b>Generator</b> are Briefly Described. The Non-Linearity Caused by Loading is also Critically Examined. A Technique Developed to Compensate for the Non-Linearity is then Presented. It is Shown {{that the}} Technique also Enables one to Obtain a Reverse Curvature {{which may be}} of Importance in Case the Sawtooth Output Needs to be Amplified {{before it can be}} of Practical use...|$|E
40|$|Principles of Transistor Circuits, Seventh Edition {{discusses}} the fundamental concepts of transistor circuits. The book {{is comprised of}} 16 chapters that cover amplifiers, oscillators, and generators. Chapter 1 discusses semiconductors and junction nodes, while Chapter 2 covers {{the basic principles of}} transistors. The subsequent chapters focus on amplifiers, where one of the chapters discusses bias and D. C. The book also talks about sinusoidal oscillators and covers modulators, demodulators, mixers, and receivers. Chapters 13 and 14 discuss pulse <b>generators</b> and <b>sawtooth</b> <b>generators,</b> respectively...|$|R
30|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{modes of}} laser {{were separated by}} changing the length of SF–PI by a piezoelectric device (PZD) connected to the mirror M. The <b>sawtooth</b> wave <b>generator</b> drives PZD, which controls the vibration of mirror M. The laser light after transmitting through SF–PI is detected by the optical detector (PT), whose electronic signal after amplifying by the amplifier (AMP) is observed via the oscilloscope. The measurement shows that the laser has two longitudinal modes very often, but with the change of laser length arising from the thermal expansion; when one of modes is closed to the central frequency in the gain profile, the third mode may also appear.|$|R
5000|$|PPI {{displays}} {{are actually}} {{quite similar to}} A-scopes in operation, and appeared fairly quickly after the introduction of radar. As with most 2D radar displays, {{the output of the}} radio receiver was attached to the intensity channel to produce a bright dot indicating returns. In the A-scope a <b>sawtooth</b> voltage <b>generator</b> attached to the X-axis moves the spot across the screen, whereas in the PPI the output of two such generators is used to rotate the line around the screen. Some early systems were mechanical, physically spinning the deflection magnets, but the electronics needed to do this in a [...] "solid-state" [...] fashion were not particularly complex, and were in use in the early 1940s.|$|R
40|$|Size {{and cost}} of a {{switched}} mode power supply can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency. The maximum switching frequency and the maximum conversion ratio are limited by the duty cycle of a PWM signal. In DCDC converters, a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>generator</b> is the fundamental circuit block to generate the PWM signal. The presented PWM generator is based on two parallel, fully interleaved PWM generator stages, each containing an integrator based <b>sawtooth</b> <b>generator</b> and two 3 -stage highspeed comparators. A digital multiplexing of the PWM signals of each stage eliminates the dependency of the minimum on-time on the large reset times of the sawtooth ramps. A separation of the references of the PWM comparators in both stage allows to configure the PWM generator for a DCDC converter operating in fixed frequency or in constant on-time mode, which requires an operation in a wide frequency range. The PWM generator was fabricated in an 180 nm HV BiCMOS technology, {{as part of a}} DCDC converter. Measurements confirm minimum possible ontime pulses as short as 2 ns and thus allows switching frequencies of DCDC converters of > 50 MHz at small duty cycle of < 10 %. At moderate duty cycles switching frequencies up to 100 MHz are possible...|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary input}} to the A-scope was the amplified return signal {{received}} from the radar, which was sent into the Y-axis of the display. Returns caused the spot to be deflected downward (or upward on some models), drawing vertical lines on the tube. These lines were known as a [...] "blip" [...] (or [...] "pip"). The X-axis input was connected to a <b>sawtooth</b> voltage <b>generator</b> known as a time base generator that swept the spot across the display, timed to match the pulse repetition frequency of the radar. This spread out the vertical traces across the display according to {{the time they were}} received. Since the return time of the signal corresponds to twice the distance to the target divided by the speed of light, the distance along the axis directly indicates the range to any target. This was usually measured against a scale above the display.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—High {{performance}} {{induction motor}} (IM) drive system fed from space vector pulse width modulated (SVPWM) inverter {{and based on}} optimal preview control theory is realized. The synthesized control algorithm achieves motor speed control, constant flux control and field orientation control via an optimized control input command contains the synchronous angular speed and the two synchronously rotating components of the stator voltage vector. The novel error system used in building the optimal preview controller can cure the adverse phenomena caused by parameter uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. With few feature values of the desired and disturbance signals the transient performance can be improved. A laboratory prototype was built and the overall control system is implemented using low cost multifunction data acquisition card (DAC). Where, the SVPWM switching patterns representing the control input command is realized by generating successive sector dependent digital words on DAC digital lines. Accordingly, the storage memory is minimized and the <b>sawtooth</b> carrier <b>generator</b> is eliminated. Extensive experimental results {{have been carried out}} to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} aspects of pitch perception of auditors when presented with musical tones whose frequencies were modulated. Research problems were: estimation of the effect of musical training upon pitch perception; estimation of the effect of stimuli of differing tonal qualities and frequency ranges upon perception; and estimation of the effect of solo and ensemble performances upon pitch perception. Subjects for the study were thirty musicians and thirty nonmusicians. Subjects were students at North Texas State University and Paris Junior College who had volunteered for the study. A test containing thirty-six items was developed which required subjects to match a tone created by a <b>sawtooth</b> wave <b>generator</b> to a simultaneously presented musical tone performed with vibrato. Each subject was tested individually, and allowed three attempts to match each test item. After the third playing of each item, a reading was taken of the frequency selected by the subject, Using the split half method, reliability for the test was found to be. 86 for nonmusicians and. 88 for musicians. ANOVA evaluation of responses of subjects indicated that there was a significant difference. in the location of pitch among musicians and nonmusicians, with musicians locating the pitch somewhat higher in the frequency spectrum than nonmusicians. Neither group located the pitch of modulated musical tones at the geometric mean of the modulation. Differences located in responses of the groups were consistant with regard to stimuli of varying frequency levels and timbres, and were unaffected by either solo or ensemble performance of the stimulus. Subsidiary findings indicated that among musicians no significant differences in pitch perception may be traced to the major performing instrument of the subject; differences in these subgroups and nonmusicians were consistant with the findings comparing musicians as "a whole and nonmusicians. Suggestions were made concerning application of the findings to musical training and concerning possibilities for further investigation in perception of pitch...|$|R
