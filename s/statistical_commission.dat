The Joint Program in Survey Methodology was selected through a process administered by the National Science Foundation. Funding now comes through a contract with participation from twelve statistical agencies. Present and future agency employees participate in academic and short courses and seminars and are enrolled in citation, certificate, and graduate degree programs. Survey problems are addressed in courses that allow transfer of knowledge between the work environment and the academic learning experience. This partnership has substantially enhanced the capabilities of the federal statistical workforce. The paper reviews challenges and successes through this partnership. 1. SURVEY RESEARCH- PRACTICE AND ACADEMIC PREPARATION The survey research sector in the United States consists of activities of commercial organizations, academic/scientific organizations, and government agencies. The commercial sector is by far the largest, consisting of roughly 50, 000 - 60, 000 professional staff in over thousands of companies. The commercial sector generates annual revenues of $ 7 - 8 billion. These revenues include those from audience/readership measurement firms (Nielsen, Arbitron, and Mediamark), health measurement (IMS Health), customer satisfaction measurement, opinion research, and a wide variety of market research.

At a production facility in Anytown, U. S. A., Company A makes product B on production line C. Product B comes in a variety of colors, custom-converted widths and types. Throughout the production process many of the product’s physical attributes are monitored. Characteristic D is one such physical attribute. Characteristic D is measured, in E units, before product conversion and after product conversion. Personnel that work closely with product B had hypothesize that a correlation between pre-converted and post-converted test values exists. The problem of the study is to determine if there is a relationship between characteristic D values of product B created on production line C before and after conversion. If a quantifiable relationship exists, then post-converted test values could be predicted and post-converted testing eliminated, creating greater economies of operator labor and test equipment use.

A total of 60 milk samples were collected from retail stores of five regions in June 2011.

AFM 1 was found in 100 % of the examined milk samples by average concentration of 16. 16 ng/L and the contamination level ranging between 2 and 64 ng/L. The concentration of AFM 1 in all the samples was lower than the Iranian national standard and Food and Drug Administration limit (500 ng/L), and only in one (1. 6 %) of the samples, the concentration of AFM 1 was greater than the maximum tolerance limit (50 ng/L) accepted by European Union and Codex Alimentarius <b>Commission.</b> <b>Statistical</b> evaluation showed no significant difference between the mean concentrations of AFM 1 in milk samples taken from different regions (p> 0. 05) ...|$|R
5000|$|NIED {{began to}} develop {{in the late nineteenth}} century, but only in a very limited form, in the sense that plaintiffs could recover for {{consequential}} emotional distress as a component of damages when a defendant negligently inflicted physical harm upon them. By 1908, most industrial U.S. states had adopted the [...] "physical impact" [...] form of NIED. However, NIED started developing into its more mature and more controversial form in the mid-20th century, as the new machines of the Second Industrial Revolution flooded the legal system with all kinds of previously unimaginable complex factual scenarios. Courts began to allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress resulting from negligent physical injuries to not only themselves, but other persons with whom they had a special relationship, like a relative. The first step, then, was to remove the requirement of physical injury to the actual plaintiff while keeping the requirement of physical injury to someone. In the 1968 landmark decision of Dillon v. Legg, the Supreme Court of California was the first court to allow recovery for emotional distress aloneeven {{in the absence of any}} physical injury to the plaintiffin the particular situation where the plaintiff simply witnessed the death of a close relative at a distance, and was not within the [...] "zone of danger" [...] where the relative was killed. [...] A 2007 <b>statistical</b> study <b>commissioned</b> by the Court found that Dillon was the most persuasive decision published by the Court between 1940 and 2005; Dillon has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how policy {{constructs}} {{the objects}} {{it seeks to}} regulate, taking as its case the setting of penal policy in contemporary Scotland. It employs two distinctive theoretical frames to develop the analysis: Science and Technology Studies (STS) and ‘scene theory’ {{a body of work}} in cultural studies. These offer distinctive lenses that bring into focus how the technologies of policy – <b>statistical</b> reports, independent <b>Commissions,</b> research advice – help produce populations that require intervention. The penal policy setting in question, we argue, can be understood {{in the same way as}} a crime scene, where investigators must re-construct forensically a narrative that will be legally validated. In line with the theme of this book, it offers a reflexive account of how researchers themselves are drawn into and participate as key witnesses in the scene, testifying to ‘facts’ about a crime that may have never taken place. The article aims to make the case for the potential of STS and scene theory in producing insights about our understanding of policy, particularly criminal justice policy. In doing this, it also offers a critique of the formation of the criminological discipline in a way that has side-lined policy as an ‘administrative’ rather than critical intellectual issue...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative analysis on stock market performance and augmentation of frontier economies: Nigeria and Mauritius. Using a Paired-Samples T-test statistical modus-operandi, data of Market Capitalization and Gross Domestic Product {{were obtained from}} the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin and Annual Financial Services <b>Commission</b> <b>Statistical</b> Bulletin of Mauritius during 2006 - 2010. The findings revealed that stock market performance for Mauritius was superior to Nigeria and same for GDP. In addition, the negativity shows that stock market performance has a negative impact on economic progress in Nigeria and Mauritius. This {{may be due to the}} fact that frontier markets give attention to money market while relegating stock market to the background. On this note, since stock market contributes significantly to economic growth, efforts by both governments should be that of developing policies aimed at further strengthening stock market. These policies should not be ‘written-policies’ but policies that can be put into practice. Also, market capitalization can be stimulated by encouraging investments in stock market. This can be done by ensuring investors are fail-safe of their investments. When investors perceive a safety of their investment, they may want to commit their resources and in turn make the economy to flourish...|$|R
