25|$|Australia's 2011 {{season began}} with a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to Manu Samoa in Sydney, (23-32) but they {{would go on to}} win that year's Tri-Nations series; a tournament which they had not won in ten years since the 2001. They however failed the {{following}} season in their attempt to win the expanded version of the competition in 2012 called The Rugby Championship.|$|E
25|$|Mirza and Hingis then {{proceeded}} to the inaugural St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy and won the title there, defeating Dushevina/Krejčíková in the final. They next played at the Qatar Open, where they suffered a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to Daria Kasatkina/Elena Vesnina. That loss ended Hingis and Mirza's 41 match winning streak. They then played the Indian Wells Masters, where they played their first tournament together, and surprisingly lost their 2nd round match against Vania King/Alla Kudryavtseva.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, FIBA allowed {{professionals}} {{to play in}} their tournaments. This caused the BAP to have {{an agreement with the}} PBA in which the latter will form national teams for the Asian Games, while the former will do so in other tournaments. In the 1989 Southeast Asian Games, the BAP-sponsored team suffered a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to Malaysia in the gold medal game, the only time the Philippines failed to win the gold medal at the Southeast Asian Games in which basketball was played.|$|E
40|$|Deep {{underground}} mines {{are highly}} energy consuming {{due to the}} need to overcome the growing airflow resistance. The multi-fan station ventilation system (MFSVS), formed by several parallel fans at different locations in an underground mine generally, has greatly reduced energy costs by using high-quantity and low-pressure energy-saving fans. However, experimental data still indicates that 30 – 70 % of the fan pressure is used to overcome the severe <b>shock</b> <b>losses</b> in a parallel fan station (PFS), in spite of more than 80 % operating efficiency, and the <b>shock</b> <b>losses</b> greatly weaken the superiority and the service capacity of PFS. Based on the investigation and measured data of several PFSs in a MFSVS in an underground mine, a three-dimensional PFS model was developed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to demonstrate airflow performance and variation characteristics of velocity, pressure and turbulence. First, the fan characteristic in the PFS was discussed and compared with the fan operating performance under standard conditions; the <b>shock</b> <b>losses</b> were then presented {{from both sides of the}} inlet <b>shock</b> <b>losses</b> and the outlet <b>shock</b> <b>losses</b> in the PFS; meanwhile, the effects of blade angle variation and airflow mutual interference were conducted to determine whether they exert a significant influence on the <b>shock</b> <b>losses.</b> The results show that the <b>shock</b> <b>losses</b> are primarily generated in the range of 0 to 3. 0 m from the fans’ exits, due to the intensely change in air velocity in the PFS. The study also provides several directions and references for recovering air pressure and reducing energy consumption in the parallel fans’ structure...|$|R

25|$|The club had a -year hiatus {{during the}} WW2 period, and {{returned}} to once again dominate the competition in B Grade, going undefeated until their <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to East Ringwood in the semi final. The promotion to A Grade saw them struggle again, {{and a return to}} B Grade in 1947/48 saw the 1st XI claim its 3rd flag in 12 seasons. The winning team consisted of Allan, Arthur, Adrian & Colin Chapman, Stan Houghton, Jim Lee, Jack McAuley, Clive & George Smith, Horace Smith Junior and Senior, {{and is one of the}} greatest to ever take the field for Warrandyte.|$|E
25|$|After their <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to Zimbabwe, Australia {{needed to}} beat England {{in order to}} {{progress}} through to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. England won the toss and their captain Paul Collingwood sent Australia in to field. The Australians put in a very disciplined performance with the ball, taking wickets at regular intervals and keeping the run rate low throughout the innings. Nathan Bracken and Mitchell Johnson each took 3 wickets, while Stuart Clark and Brett Lee took 2 and 1 respectively. Several of England's batsmen got starts, however failed to convert them with their top scorer being Andrew Flintoff, reaching 31.|$|E
25|$|By the end {{of round}} twelve, critics began speculating that the {{pre-season}} favourites, the Crusaders, were losing their form after a draw against the winless Western Force and then a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to the Stormers. However they bounced back against the Bulls with a 4 try bonus point victory. After a few results fell in their favour {{they were able to}} comfortably beat the Brumbies, and finished for the second consecutive season on top of the ladder. The Crusaders won the Super 14 after defeating the Hurricanes in Christchurch in the final, 19-12 in misty conditions. There was 94 matches held over three and a half months, with each team playing one full round robin against the 13 other teams and the playoffs involving two semi-finals and a final. Every team got one bye over the 14 rounds.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 2014 season, {{his first}} as a Swan, Franklin opted to {{continue}} wearing the number 23 guernsey that he previously wore for Hawthorn. He made his debut for the Sydney Swans in the round 1 Sydney Derby against cross-town rivals Greater Western Sydney at Spotless Stadium, and finished the game with one goal in a <b>shock</b> <b>loss.</b> After a slow start for both Franklin and the Swans, when they lost three of their first four matches, Franklin returned to form against Fremantle at the SCG, kicking four second-half goals in {{what would be the}} first of a club record-equalling twelve successive wins, during which he twice narrowly avoided suspension. In round 8 against Hawthorn at ANZ Stadium, Franklin kicked seven successive behinds in the first three quarters, before kicking two fourth-quarter goals to seal an upset victory in Franklin's first match against his former side.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lead}} up to the US Open, Dementieva took part in three tournaments. At the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, she {{advanced}} to the semi-final defeating Daniela Hantuchová en route. In the semis, Dementieva was crushed by Venus Williams 6–0, 6–1. At the Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open in Cincinnati, she defeated Yanina Wickmayer and Caroline Wozniacki to reach the semifinal. In a bizarre match, Dementieva the fell to Jelena Janković, 6–7(2), 6–0, 6–7(6), despite leading 6–2 in the final set tiebreak having already saved three match points herself prior. At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Dementieva defeated Serena Williams 7–6(2), 6–1 to reach her fourth final of the year. In the final, she defeated an unseeded Maria Sharapova 6–4, 6–3 in the final to win her third title {{of the year and}} 14th of her career. As a result of her performances in these three tournaments, Dementieva secured the US Open Series crown. Entering the US Open as one of the favourites, Dementieva suffered a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to the world No. 70 Melanie Oudin, 5–7, 6–4, 6–3.|$|E
25|$|The Swans {{started off}} the 2016 {{season with a}} convincing 80 point round 1 win against Collingwood, with new Swans recruit Michael Talia {{suffering}} a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit Callum Sinclair kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with Lance Franklin kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, Isaac Heeney starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain Kieren Jack and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the unfortunate spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless {{for the first time}} in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.|$|E

500|$|France's 2011 {{campaign}} {{was marked by}} turmoil within the camp; reports before the tournament indicated as many as 25 of the 30-member squad had turned against head coach Marc Lièvremont. In pool play, France had unimpressive wins over Japan and Canada, an expected loss to New Zealand, and a <b>shock</b> <b>loss</b> to Tonga. During this stage, Lièvremont heavily criticized the team in the media, further angering many of his players, with veteran back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy publicly critical of Lièvremont. Despite the losses, they qualified for the knockout stage. At this time, the players effectively rebelled against Lièvremont; after the tournament, Harinordoquy would tell the French rugby publication Midi Olympique, [...] "We had to free ourselves from his supervision." [...] The team responded by defeating England 19–12 in the quarter final and controversially beating Wales 9–8 in the semi-final after Welsh captain Sam Warburton was sent off. The French proved admirable opponents in the final, however, losing out to New Zealand 8–7 to finish second {{for the third time}} in a Rugby World Cup ...|$|E

He also suffered early exits from both Wimbledon and the US Open, losing {{in the second round}} and third round, respectively. His indoor season, however, was a success, as he won his ninth career title at the 2008 Stockholm Open, defeating Robin Söderling 6–2, 5–7, 6–3, in the finals. He was defending champion at the Madrid Masters, but was quickly eliminated by fellow Argentine Juan Martín del Potro in the third round.
