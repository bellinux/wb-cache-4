5|$|The {{next major}} {{incident}} was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in {{to take charge of}} the search for <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> secure the part of the building left standing. Over the next three days they located six <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> the bodies of ninety-one victims.

5|$|To replace these officers, Second Lieutenant Innes of 1 Company {{was ordered}} forward {{to gather the}} <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> withdraw, forming up at a {{barricade}} {{on the edge of}} the Hollow. Innes regrouped the <b>survivors</b> <b>and,</b> following a heavy bombardment from supporting artillery and with his own company providing covering fire, assisted the Coldstream Guards in a second attack at 10:15. Weighed down with entrenching equipment, the attacking Coldstream Guardsmen faltered and began to suffer heavy casualties. Innes too came under heavy fire from a German barricade to their front equipped with a machine gun.|$|E
5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team {{felt they}} had the proper {{equipment}} for the mission. In {{the early hours of}} Monday morning, June 25 – and despite discovering signs of life – rescue work was suspended due to the danger of additional concrete falling on the potential <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> the HUSAR rescuers.|$|E
5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men come down from the top and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Argolic Gulf a Staffel of nine Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers from Jagdgeschwader 77 {{attacked}} the convoy at either 06:45 or 07:15. Slamat was hit, set afire and began to abandon ship. Calcutta ordered Diamond to go alongside Slamat to rescue survivors {{while the rest of the}} convoy continued to try to reach Souda Bay in Crete. At 08:15 Diamond reported that she was still rescuing <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> still under air attack. By then three destroyers had reinforced the convoy so Calcutta sent one of them, , to assist Diamond. Slamat was afire from stem to stern when Diamond fired a torpedo that sank her in a coup de grâce. Diamond reported at 09:25 that she had rescued most of the <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> was proceeding to Souda Bay. An hour later Wryneck signalled a request for aircraft cover.|$|E
5|$|The American {{victims of}} the Wave Dancer boat wreck were flown back to the Richmond, Virginia area {{following}} the storm.

5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E

5|$|Again coincidentally {{about this}} same time, the Saratoga strike force arrived and {{attacked}} Ryūjō, hitting and heavily damaging her with {{three to five}} bombs and perhaps one torpedo, and killing 120 of her crew. Also during this time, several U.S. B-17 heavy bombers attacked the crippled Ryūjō but caused no additional damage. The crew abandoned the heavily damaged Japanese carrier at nightfall and she sank soon after. Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze rescued Ryūjōs <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> the aircrews from her returning strike force, who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby. After the rescue operations were complete, both Japanese destroyers and Tone rejoined Nagumo's main force.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E

5|$|As {{they hide}} {{in a parking}} lot, Kyle {{explains}} to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware {{in the near future}} and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.|$|E
5|$|At 4:10am, the RMS Carpathia {{arrived at}} the site of the sinking and began rescuing survivors. By 8:30am, she picked up the last {{lifeboat}} with <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> left the area at 08:50 bound for Pier 54 in New York City. Of the 711 passengers and crew rescued by the Carpathia, six, including first class passenger William F. Hoyt, either died in a lifeboat during the night or on board the Carpathia the next morning, and were buried at sea.|$|E
5|$|Corbulo {{had placed}} {{a large number}} of his {{auxiliaries}} in a line of forts near the Armenian frontier under a former primus pilus, Paccius Orfitus. Disobeying Corbulo's orders, he used some newly arrived auxiliary cavalry alae to stage a raid against the Armenians, who appeared to be unprepared. In the event, his raid failed, and the retreating troops even spread their panic amongst the garrisons of the other forts. It was an inauspicious start for a campaign, and Corbulo severely punished the <b>survivors</b> <b>and</b> their commanders.|$|E
