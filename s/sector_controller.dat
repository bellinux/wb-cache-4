40|$|Today {{air traffic}} {{management}} divides the airspace into <b>sectors.</b> <b>Controllers</b> are responsible {{for one of these}} sectors and all the air traffic within.

Controllers are assigned individual aircraft which they are responsible for from their entry into the airspace to their exit. This implies that the controllers have to manage flights which are not in the same geographic region but can be anywhere in the airspace and hence also in different traffic situations. Such a change of concept influences the way controllers work and calls for different support tools. Naturally, the question of safety arises with regard to standard operations as well as special situations. This discussion paper investigates the different safety aspects relevant in a sectorless concept. It highlights the differences between a conventional sectored and the proposed sectorless approach.

This study developed and examined the pilot s and controller s procedures and information requirements for creating aircraft pairs for closely spaced parallel runway operations.

In this paper, the role of the controller, as examined in an integrated study of controllers and pilots, is presented. The controllers utilized a pairing scheduler and new pairing interfaces to help create and maintain aircraft pairs, in a high-fidelity, human-in-the loop simulation experiment.
