30|$|A more {{substantial}} {{body of literature}} on the topic {{can be found in}} the broader field of social sciences in publications by Harkness and her team [27 – 29], notably the description of a similar technique called advance translation. In this process, experienced survey translators and survey researchers are asked to translate a pre-final version of the <b>source</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> and to comment on the problems encountered stemming either from the original questionnaire or related to the language into which it was translated. The purpose is “to get input from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds before finalizing the <b>source</b> <b>questionnaire</b> for cross-cultural implementation [29].” Advance translation is thus used as a method for improving the original version and the final translation process before it actually starts. As Janet Harkness writes: “When source instruments can still be changed, translators can report back and thus help improve the <b>source</b> <b>questionnaire</b> [28 -p. 46].” In the health outcomes field, researchers are left to wonder about the current approaches to TA, what distinguishes them, and the practical recommendations that could be made to optimize TA and avoid translation difficulties during PRO instrument development and implementation.|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} model developed for prediction {{of the electric}} load profile of a residential area is briefly outlined in the paper. The model based on a "bottom-up" approach in order to reproduce customers' daily behaviour concerning elcctricity usage, has been applied for validation to reproduce load diagrams of a sample residential area where field measurements of power demand arid a combined mail survey had been previously conducted. Since the residential electric load was almost exclusively of the discretionary, weather-independent type, the survey ques tionnairc regarded mainly thc lifestyle of customers, thus evidencing the need for probabilistic processing of the data collected by the survey. To this end customers' presence at home and appliance usage have been considered as normal distributions around a incan value as ensued from the survey data. In the paper, a sensitivity analysis is performed on standard deviation values of the above distributions, which allows quite good matching of recorded data with simulation risults. A heuristic approach is proposed for correcting the dispersions of normal distributions {{to compensate for the}} averaging inherent in the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> compared with actual random behaviour of the persons concerne...|$|R

A history of wheezing was obtained in 16 · 2 per cent; 1 · 8 percent had had wheezing alone, while the majority (14 - 4 per cent) gave a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Productive cough alone was reported in a further 32 · 5 per cent The parents reported that 17 · 1 per cent of seven-year-old children had {{more than two or three}} colds a year, 5 - 7 per cent had 2 ̆ 7 hay fever’, and 6 - 8 per cent had both. There was a close association between upper and lower respiratory symptoms, the prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms ranging from 15 - 5 per cent in those with no lower respiratory symptoms to 60 · 4 per cent in those with a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Despite considerable overlap, “colds” tended to be associated with productive cough and 2 ̆ 7 hay fever 2 ̆ 7 with wheezing. According to the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies,</b> lower respiratory symptoms were commoner (48 · 6 percent) than upper respiratory symptoms (29 · 6 percent). Episodes of productive cough were longer in duration, less frequent and started later in life than episodes of wheezing.

Eczema and other indices of atopy were associated with a history of wheezing, and also, after elimination of the effect of wheezing, with hay fever.

The research utilises this function of the VR program in architectural design studios. The main objective is to investigate how and to what extend students would benefit from applying this new potential of the VR function. The hypothesis was that the function potential would assist students to have more understanding of the structural system selected, which would be simultaneously beneficial on the architectural design level. The students used the VR programme during the design process in the stage of proposing and exploring the structural system. The used application focuses on providing the students with an effective tool to select and visualise a structural system and its construction process. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to the students to record their remarks and opinions of using the VR function. The <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> indicate and open more areas than the hypothesis. The research methodology is to use mainly qualitative analysis and secondarily quantitative analysis, to have evaluation that indicates the effectiveness of Virtual Reality as an educational tool in the architectural design studio. The research employs the VR Studio programme in order to introduce new visualization potentials other than what are currently used. The research concludes to solid results {{of the use of}} VR in the architectural design studio, and proceeds further to open new research venues...|$|R
