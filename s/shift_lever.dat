25|$|The direct-shift gearbox uses a {{floor-mounted}} transmission <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> {{very similar}} to that of a conventional automatic transmission. The lever is operated in a straight 'fore and aft' plane (without any 'dog-leg' offset movements), and uses an additional button to help prevent an inadvertent selection of an inappropriate <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> position.|$|E
25|$|N {{position}} of the floor-mounted <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> means that the transmission is in neutral. Similar to P above, both clutch packs and all gear-sets are fully disengaged; however, the parking lock is also disengaged.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} line, for now, {{is limited}} to the Highline version, with respect to Active, added {{automatic}} climate (climatronic), electric mirrors, electric windows with automatic up/down and full driver side control, chrome inserts on the dashboard, gear <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> steering wheel and speed brake handles and lined in leather, finally with fog lights.|$|E

50|$|Alfine is {{the name}} of a comfort and urban {{oriented}} product series by Shimano. It is mainly known for internally geared hubs, but includes also hydraulic disc brakes and levers, chain tensioners, dynamo hubs, cranksets, <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> and complete wheels.|$|R
25|$|The {{vehicle was}} the second mass-produced hybrid on the American market, after the two-seat Honda Insight. While the larger Prius could seat five, its battery pack {{restricted}} cargo space. The vehicle interior featured a dash-mounted <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> and a small touch screen with a hybrid powertrain display. This feature showed the vehicle operation regarding the interplay between gasoline engine, battery pack, and electric motors, and could also show a bar graph of fuel economy results.|$|E
25|$|These {{operate in}} an {{identical}} manner as the floor mounted <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> {{when it is}} placed across the gate in manual mode. The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep {{both hands on the}} steering wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.|$|E
25|$|The cruiser also ceded {{market share}} to muscle and lowrider bikes {{featuring}} banana seats, oversized <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> and ape-hanger bars inspired by West coast motorcycle customizers—which in turn {{gave birth to}} the modern BMX bike, while the cruiser went into a steep sales decline.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1990s many {{manufacturers}} made derailleurs, including Simplex, Huret, Galli, Mavic, Gipiemme, Zeus, Suntour, and Shimano. However, {{the successful}} introduction {{and promotion of}} indexed shifting by Shimano in 1985 required a compatible system of <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> derailleur, sprockets, chainrings, chain, shift cable, and shift housing.|$|R
50|$|Specialized <b>shift</b> <b>levers</b> (known as bar-end shifters) {{do exist}} {{that can be}} {{installed}} on some triathlon bars {{so that they can}} be reached without moving the hands from the aerodynamic position. The complementary brake levers in this handlebar configuration are placed in the ends of the accompanying pursuit bars.|$|R
25|$|Cars are {{equipped}} with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated {{by a combination of}} the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.|$|E
25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E
500|$|A single dry-plate clutch and an unsynchronized three-speed gearbox were {{bolted to}} the engine. [...] The gearbox was {{operated}} directly with a central <b>shift</b> <b>lever.</b> The drive shaft was enclosed in a torque tube and drove the live rear axle through a spiral bevel drive.|$|E

25|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On racing {{bicycles}} and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube. On older racing bicycles, the <b>shift</b> <b>levers</b> were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.|$|R
50|$|Bicycle {{handlebar}} or bicycle handlebars {{refers to}} the steering mechanism for bicycles; {{the equivalent of a}} steering wheel. Besides steering, handlebars also often support a portion of the rider's weight, depending on their riding position, and provide a convenient mounting place for brake <b>levers,</b> <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> cyclocomputers, bells, etc. Handlebars are attached to a bike's stem which in turn attaches to the fork.|$|R
500|$|The arcade {{version of}} Crazy Taxi was {{released}} in 1999, and featured only the San Francisco-inspired map (known as [...] "Arcade" [...] in the first console game, and later as [...] "West Coast" [...] in sequels). The [...] "Standard Version" [...] arcade cabinet included a cockpit seat, steering wheel, a gear <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> (for forward and reverse gear) and a brake and acceleration pedal; a more compact [...] "Naomi Cabinet Version" [...] also existed without the cockpit seat. The arcade game {{was one of the}} first to use the Sega NAOMI hardware processor, which is based on the Sega Dreamcast and was unveiled as part of Sega's exhibition at the 1999 Amusement Operators Union exposition in Japan.|$|E
500|$|The Camry in the Philippines offers three grades: {{the base}} G, {{offering}} a 2.4-litre engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission, has 2 SRS airbags, has fabric seats {{and has a}} foot-type parking brake. The 2.4 V is almost {{the same as the}} G variant, however, it has a 4-spoke steering wheel with wood grain, 2 SRS airbags, and has a leather-wrapped wood grain with chrome <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> and knob. The 3.5 Q is the top-of-the-line segment, offering a 3.5 2GR-FE V6, 24V, DOHC and dual VVT-i. It is mated to a six-speed gate-type automatic transmission, adaptive front lighting system, automatic rain sensor, dual exhaust tail pipe, tri-color/Optitron with multi-information display, 2 SRS front airbags, side SRS airbags, and a push start system. All of the variants has an integrated type / tuner/ in-dash 6 CD changer / MP3 / WMA. All of the variants use a foot-type parking brake, welcome the driver whenever the ignition is set to [...] "ON", displaying on the central console [...] "Welcome to Camry". All of the variants also have 4 front and 2 rear speakers.|$|E

50|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On racing {{bicycles}} and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube.

50|$|Shift by wire is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear <b>shifting</b> <b>lever</b> and the transmission. The transmission shifting was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.|$|R
50|$|The {{other common}} lever/grip size {{is used for}} {{mountain}} and city handlebars, including flat bars, riser bars, some porteur bars, etc. On these bars the lever and grip areas have a 22.2 mm diameter. Hence, thumb <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> grip type shifters, MTB brake levers and Rapidfire type shifters will only fit on this smaller diameter - none could fit on a road or cyclocross bar.|$|R
2500|$|P {{position}} of the floor-mounted gear <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> means that the transmission is set in park. [...] Both clutch packs are fully disengaged, all gear-sets are disengaged, and a solid mechanical transmission lock {{is applied to the}} crown wheel of the DSG's internal differential. [...] This position must only be used when the motor vehicle is [...] [...] Furthermore, this is the position which must be set on the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> before the vehicle ignition key can be removed.|$|E
2500|$|R {{position}} of the floor-mounted <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> means that the transmission is in reverse. [...] This functions {{in a similar way}} to D, but there is just one reverse gear. When selected, R is highlighted in the instrument display.|$|E
2500|$|Power for the XR-400 was {{supplied}} by a standard Ambassador two-barrel [...] AMC V8 engine. The engine bay could accommodate any of AMC’s I6 or V8 engines. The transmission was an automatic (not typical of sports cars) controlled through a floor console mounted <b>shift</b> <b>lever.</b> Braking {{was provided by}} an experimental front disc brake system.|$|E
50|$|The SRAM i-Motion {{series of}} {{products}} is a sport, urban, and trekking oriented product series developed and manufactured by SRAM Corporation. Branded i-Motion are internally geared hubs, <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> and dynamo hubs. Related to the i-Motion series are also changeable free or fixed single speed hubs, hybrid epicyclic and derailleur gear hubs, and hydraulic disc brakes. The i-Motion series of products were developed at SRAMs Schweinfurt R&D and manufacturing plant in Germany, formerly of Sachs.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, Shimano {{introduced}} their STI <b>shifting</b> <b>levers</b> {{for road}} bicycles, which completely integrated the brake lever and shifter. It also redesigned the brake [...] "hoods" [...] where riders commonly rest their hands. This new design {{worked like a}} normal brake lever in the longtitudinal plane, but also allowed the rider to shift to a larger cog by pushing the lever so that it pivots laterally. Behind the brake lever, there is a smaller <b>lever</b> that <b>shifts</b> to a smaller cog when pushed towards the inside.|$|R
5000|$|January 1972: Introduction of the Renault 5 in L and TL forms. Both models (which were {{available}} as three-door hatchbacks) had folding rear seats, grey bumpers, wind up front windows, and dashboard-mounted gear <b>shift</b> <b>levers.</b> The TL was better equipped, {{and had a}} vanity mirror for the front seat passenger, three ashtrays (one under the gear shift and two in the rear), two separate reclining front seats instead of one bench seat, front pull handles, and three stowage pockets {{as well as a}} heated rear window.|$|R
2500|$|MY 1993: Base 3.3L engine had [...] and {{standard}} non-touring suspension. A six-disc trunk-mounted Mopar CD changer with wire remote and an alarm system were dealer installed options. This {{was the first}} car, along with Intrepid and Vision, to have the 3.5L 24-valve SOHC V6. A Panasonic cell phone with externally mounted antenna could be ordered. The split bench seat with column <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> was not yet available, but planned from the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} mechanical <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> {{was replaced}} by a Shift by wire shifter, as introduced in the 2007 E70 X5 and the 2008 LCI update of the E60 5 Series. The LCD and iDrive scroll button on the steering wheel became standard equipment. GPS navigation and an [...] widescreen display were included in the Technology and Navigation packages. Other options include heated front seats and split-fold rear seats. Rear headroom, leg room and shoulder room has increased, compared with its E90 predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|With its {{distinctly}} modernist influence, {{the interior}} styling of the SM is {{as dramatic as}} the exterior. The small oval steering wheel is matched by oval gauges. The manual <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> 'boot' is a highly stylized chrome gate. The seats are highly adjustable buckets with centre padding composed of many individual 'rolls'. High-quality materials are used throughout. The bonnet is aircraft grade aluminum, while the external bright work is stainless steel, rather than ‘cheaper’ chrome (except for [...] "plastichrome" [...] "SM" [...] trim at the rear base of the rain gutter).|$|E
30|$|GDyn {{has been}} shown to be able to realistically capture {{dynamics}} in several ways (Ianchovichina et al. 2014). 2 Furthermore, GDyn model captures the capital mobility due to specific policy shocks, by different channels; firstly, the changes in fundamentals of these economies owing to cost reduction facilitated by trade can help allocate investment more or less in a region depending on the extent to which it has become competitive and investment-friendly; secondly, there are direct <b>shifting</b> <b>levers</b> that can shock the extent of policy facilitation that can encourage investment.|$|R
50|$|The DragStar/V-Star {{gathered}} followers early on, {{which led}} to the addition in 2000 of the Classic model. As opposed to the Custom's bobbed rear fender, 5 and 3/4 headlight, aluminum rims with spokes, exposed forks, 110 front tire and other custom touches, the Classic had longer fenders, floorboards, cast magnesium wheels, thicker brake and <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> a 7-inch headlight, substantial fork covers and a 130 front tire. Later a Silverado model, which included such amenities as a windscreen, passenger back rest, and soft sidebags was introduced as an upscale model.|$|R

However, due to the higher cost of low production, Think USA announced {{that the price of}} the first 100 units was [...] before any incentives. The first 100 Th!nks were delivered in late 2010 mostly to fleet customers in Indiana. Sales to the general public were expected to begin by mid-2011. Think North America issued three recalls on the first cars produced at the Elkhart plant for defects to its gear <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> seat belts and defrosting systems.|$|R
