50|$|The {{activated}} sludge and partially treated sewage {{pass on to}} the final <b>settlement</b> <b>tanks,</b> where the sludge settles out. Some of the sludge is fed back into the aeration lanes, to assist {{the start of the}} secondary treatment process, while some is surplus, so is dewatered and passes on to the sludge treatment process. The liquid from the final <b>settlement</b> <b>tanks</b> is of sufficient quality that it can be discharged into Salmons Brook, from where it makes its way into the Lee Navigation. Before discharge, some of the water is passed through a tertiary treatment phase, where a fine filter is used to remove residual fine particles. The woven mesh membrane must be washed periodically to remove any accumulated sediments. Disk filters capable of treating between 40 and 50 percent of the works flow were installed in 2012, and Thames Water hoped to increase this to allow all of the flow to be filtered by 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The cleared flow {{is passed}} to the primary <b>settlement</b> <b>tanks,</b> where solid {{material}} settles out onto {{the floor of the}} tank.

Larval nutrition was provided by commercially available micro-algae concentrates, Instant Algae® (“Isochrysis 1800 ®” and “Pavlova 1800 ®”, Reed Mariculture Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Larvae were first transferred to <b>settlement</b> <b>tanks</b> on day 17 when their mean antero-posterior measurement (APM) was 240. 2 ± 8. 6 μm. Approximately 6. 4 % of larvae survived to day 17 and more than 700, 000 eyed pediveligers were transferred to <b>settlement</b> <b>tanks</b> between day 17 and day 25. Approximately 33, 000 spat were harvested from spat collectors on day 105, representing a survival rate of 4. 7 % from the eyed pediveliger stage. Growth and development of larvae in this study were superior to those reported in a prior study that used a ternary live micro-algae diet to feed P. penguin larvae. Our results indicate that the products used in this study proved nutritious for P. penguin larvae and supported normal growth and development through settlement. The use of commercially available micro-algae concentrates as a replacement for live micro-algae in pearl oyster hatcheries supports development of simplified larval rearing protocols, without live micro-algae culture, that are more appropriate to Pacific island nations...|$|R

40|$|This {{project reports}} {{results of a}} hydro-geochemical study of {{leachate}} production at the Silent Valley landfill, Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, UK. Silent Valley landfill site is an active unlined landfill in South Wales. It lies on interbedded sandstones and mudstones of the Rhondda Beds, which are overlain by a mixture of boulder clay, head deposits and made ground. The annual rainfall recorded in the area is approximately 1250 mm. Resistivity surveys were performed across part of the site to help improve {{the understanding of the}} internal structure of the landfill. Instrumentation to measure leachate discharge, conductivity and meteorological inputs installed at the Silent Valley landfill site are described and relationships between the rainfall and discharge data are analysed. Regression analysis is used to model the discharge of leachate from the measured meteorological data. Water balance analysis has demonstrated that groundwater is entering the site. The leachate generated on site is collected by a series of drains that feed into the <b>Settlement</b> <b>Tank,</b> which then discharges to foul sewer. The discharge through the <b>Settlement</b> <b>Tank</b> shows a rapid response to rainfall events with dilution effects indicated by conductivity readings and chemical analysis. The volume of discharge from the <b>Settlement</b> <b>Tank</b> is shown to have a long-term upward trend. A preliminary study was undertaken to investigate the use of neural networks to model the discharge in the <b>Settlement</b> <b>Tank.</b> Feedforward backpropogation neural networks were constructed using the measured meteorological data to produce predictions of daily discharge for the <b>Settlement</b> <b>Tank.</b> Ion Chromatography analysis was performed on the leachate to complement the historical leachate analysis data.

The influence {{of the color of}} spat collector material on recruitment was investigated using a second type of spat collector composed of onion bags as the outer bag and inner substrate ("bag" type). Bags were prepared in 3 different outer/inner (O/I) color combinations of green/green, green/black, and red/black (O/I). Both types of collectors were deployed at different depths within <b>settlement</b> <b>tanks.</b> Approximately 2. 7 % of the initial larval population survived, resulting in 35, 583 spat.

30|$|The {{conventional}} (plug flow) {{activated sludge}} process uses an aeration tank, a settling tank (clarifier), and a sludge return line to treat wastewater. Wastewater and return sludge from the secondary clarifier enter {{the head of}} the aeration tank to undergo a specific period of aeration. The main characteristic of a plug flow configuration is a high ratio of organic loading (i.e., F/M) to the mixed liquor {{at the beginning of the}} tank. There is little longitudinal mixing in a plug flow tank except for that which is caused by diffused aeration; therefore, as the liquor flows through its length, substrate is used up and the mass of microorganisms increases due to cell reproduction. If the F/M is sufficiently low in the latter stages of the tank, much of the oxygen is consumed by nitrification and endogenous respiration. The lack of longitudinal mixing reduces the ability to handle shock loads; there is little dilution of the inflow so microorganisms may be affected by toxic material. Plug flow has the advantage of discouraging the excessive growth of filamentous organisms which can cause settlement problems in the secondary <b>settlement</b> <b>tank</b> (EPA 1997).|$|E
