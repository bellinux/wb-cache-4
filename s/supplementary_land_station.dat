50|$|Before {{satellite}} communication systems were widely available, {{the only way}} ships at sea had {{to communicate with the}} rest of the world was via radio connections to <b>land</b> <b>stations.</b> To talk to people who did not operate radio equipment, a vessel at sea would make contact with a <b>land</b> <b>station,</b> usually using high frequency AM or single-sideband (SSB) radio. The operator of the <b>land</b> <b>station</b> would patch the radio connection though to a telephone call made over the regular telephone system (referred to as a landline). The AT&T High Seas Service was a commercial radio-to-telephone connection system using the above <b>land</b> <b>stations.</b> The charges were typically settled by making the landline connection a collect call. Larger vessels maintained accounts with AT&T, but the service was available to any vessel with a marine HF radio. In the 1980s the radio link was priced at several dollars per minute plus the long distance landline charge from the High Seas station.|$|R

(Special <b>land</b> <b>stations</b> were a class of stations used by experimenters, technical and training schools, and certain amateur radio operators.) With this license students at North Central High School could now learn telegraphy and radio theory, and then apply what they learned in real life.|$|R
