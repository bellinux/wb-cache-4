5|$|Trafford Town Hall <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large site at the {{junction}} of Talbot Road and Warwick Road, directly opposite the Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Work on the building, designed by architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope of Bolton, began on 21 August 1931.|$|E
5|$|The Ebenezer Avery House was {{originally}} located on Latham Street and Thames Street in Groton, Connecticut, United States. The {{date of the}} house's construction is unknown, but it {{is believed to be}} from the 1760s and it was the house of Ebenezer Avery. The Ebenezer Avery House was the location where the British brought the injured soldiers after the Battle of Groton Heights on September 6, 1781. In 1971, the house was moved to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park in Groton and restored. Though it <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state park, the historic house museum continues to be maintained by the Avery Memorial Association.|$|E
5|$|The schoolhouse {{was built}} in 1883, {{in the village of}} Chana, Illinois. Due to the {{elimination}} of the Chana School District, the school was abandoned by the 1960s. A restoration effort was undertaken in the late 1990s, ending with a move and refurbishment in 2002 and 2003. The building now <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public park along the Rock River in Oregon, Illinois. Its interior also features architectural elements which set it apart from the typical 19th-century schoolhouse. From a distance, the building is dominated by its bell tower.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the site}} of the old Stagg Field is {{occupied}} by the University's Regenstein Library, which was opened in 1970, and the Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which was opened in 2011. A Henry Moore sculpture, Nuclear Energy, <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small quadrangle just outside the Regenstein Library. It was dedicated on 2 December 1967, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of CP-1 going critical. The commemorative plaques from 1952, 1965 and 1967 are nearby. A graphite block from CP-1 can be seen at the Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, New Mexico; another is on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E
5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E

5|$|With {{her right}} leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a little (the pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals drinking the blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E

25|$|A second tarn to {{the east}} of Dow Crag <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small hollow below Brown Pike. This is Blind Tarn, so named because it has no visible inlet or outlet. About a hundred yards across and twenty feet deep, the tarn has a respectable {{population}} of trout. Whilst other theories are possible, it must be assumed they have been introduced for sport.|$|E
25|$|In 1826, Saint Martin's Church of Ireland was built, {{and later}} renamed Saint Mark's. Before this, Church of Ireland members {{attended}} either Drumcree Parish Church or Seagoe Parish Church.

25|$|Breton musician, teacher, and luthier Youenn Le Bihan {{invented the}} piston in 1983. The piston is a {{contemporary}} {{development of the}} hautboy or baroque oboe, influenced by the bombard. It is typically rooted in the key of D and features simple system key-work to expand its range. The tone of the piston <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> warm and rich middle ground between the trumpet-like tone of the bombard {{and that of the}} baroque oboe.|$|E
25|$|The two-manual organ, {{built by}} Bishop in 1882 and rebuilt by Morgan & Smith of Brighton in 1927, <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chamber in the apse. When first opened, worshippers sat in box pews. Unusually for the time, {{more than half}} the seats in the church were free, i.e. no pew rents were charged, and many such free seats were in central {{positions}} in the nave. The box pews have since been replaced by open benches.|$|E
