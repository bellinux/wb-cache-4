Point level sensing of adhesives and high-viscosity materials such as oil and grease can result in the build-up of material on the probe; however, this can be minimized by using a self-tuning sensor.

We show results from our analysis of three months of data from the GNSS‐based tide gauge at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) on the west coast of Sweden. The GNSS-derived time series of local sea level is compared with independent data from two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges at Ringhals and Gothenburg about 18 km south and 33 km north of OSO, respectively. A high degree of agreement is found in the time domain, with correlation coefficients of up to 0. 96. The root‐mean‐square differences between the GNSS‐derived sea level and the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge observations are 5. 9 cm and 5. 5 cm, which is lower than for the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges together (6. 1 cm). A frequency domain comparison reveals high coherence of the data sets up to 6 cycles per day, which corresponds well to the propagation of gravity waves in the shallow waters at the Kattegat coast. Amplitudes and phases of some major tides were determined by a tidal harmonic analysis and compared to model predictions. From the GNSS‐based tide gauge results we find significant ocean tidal signals at fortnightly, diurnal, semi‐diurnal, and quarter‐diurnal periods. As an example, the amplitudes of the semi‐diurnal M 2 and the diurnal O 1 tide are determined with 1 σ uncertainties of 11 mm and 12 mm, respectively.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} guided radar level measurements of liquid materials in large metal tubes, socalled <b>stilling</b> <b>wells,</b> bypass or still pipes. In the RF domain these tubes function as overmoded circular waveguides and mode-matched excitation structures like waveguide tapers {{are needed to}} avoid higher order waveguide modes. Especially for high-precision radar measurements the multimode propagation effects need to be minimized to achieve submillimeter accuracy. Therefore, a still pipe simulator is introduced with the purpose to fundamentally analyze the modal effects. Furthermore, a generalized design criterion is derived for the spurious mode suppression of compact circular waveguide transitions under the constraint of specified accuracy levels. According to the obtained results, a promising waveguide taper concept will finally be presented. © Author(s) 2008...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} main types of sleeve valves: inline, angle pattern and {{downflow}} pattern. Inline sleeve valve {{can be installed}} in the pipeline or {{at the end of}} the pipeline for free discharge. Inline sleeve valve have an inlet section which allows upstream media to flow into an outer annular area. The flow then takes a 90° turn through the sleeve and collides with flow from the opposite side dissipating the energy. The flow then travels downstream through an exit spool on the downstream end. The angle pattern sleeve valve is installed at a 90° bend in place of an elbow. Angle pattern sleeve valves employ a similar design as the inline sleeve valve by creating an outer annular area to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow. The difference is that the flow direction after passing through the sleeve changes by 90°. Downflow pattern sleeve valves are installed at the end of a pipeline and discharge into sumps, reservoirs, <b>stilling</b> <b>wells</b> or tanks. Unlike inline and angle pattern the discharge of a downflow pattern is outward and is not contained by the valve itself.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} way to observe sea level {{is to use}} tide gauges, resulting in measurements relative to the Earth’s crust. However, {{in order to measure}} the sea-level change due to changes in ocean water volume and/or other oceanographic phenomena, all types of crustal motion at the measurement site need to be known. We present a remote sensing technique for measuring local sea level using standard geodetic-type Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. The installation consists of a zenith-looking Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antenna, receiving the direct signals, and a nadir-looking Left Hand Circular Polarized antenna, receiving the signals reflected of the sea surface. Each antenna is connected to a receiver and the antenna pair is deployed back-to-back at a coastal site. Estimating the vertical baseline between the two antennas, using standard geodetic analysis, the local sea level and its temporal variations can be determined. The advantage of this technique is that it allows to measure both sea surface height changes with relative positioning and land surface height changes, e. g., by precise point positioning of the RHCP antenna. Furthermore, the combined measurements of local sea level are automatically corrected for land motion, meaning that this installation could provide continuously reliable sea-level estimates in tectonic active regions. This GNSS-based tide gauge has been operating continuously at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) on the west coast of Sweden since September 2010. We present results from several months of operations and compare them to sea-level measurements from two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges about 18 km south and 33 km north of OSO.

40|$|The Utah Water Research Laboratory, in {{conjunction}} with the State of Utah, initiated a study to determine the accuracy {{of a wide variety of}} flow measurement devices in Utah. The project selected 70 sites with flow measurement devices throughout the state. During the assessment each device had its physical condition and flow measurement accuracy documented. Although a wide variety of flow measurement devices were tested, the majority were Parshall flumes. Many of the assessed Parshall flumes were not measuring flow to the specified ± 5 percent design accuracy. Problems in flow measurement were due to issues with the staff gauge location and incorrect entrance geometry. Laboratory tests were conducted at the Utah Water Research Laboratory in an attempt to provide accurate flow measurement from flumes with these issues. The tests simulated incorrect locations for measuring upstream head with different entrance geometries on a 2 -ft-wide Parshall flume. The flume was tested with three different entrance wingwall configurations, eighteen <b>stilling</b> <b>wells,</b> and two point gauges, allowing water surface profiles to be collected throughout the flume. Corrections for incorrect head measurement locations and entrance geometries were created. The objective of this thesis is to provide water users and regulators with the information necessary to help improve open-channel flow measurement accuracies. An overview of design accuracies and flow measurement devices is given. In addition, a method to correct for incorrect head readings in Parshall flumes, a widely used flow measurement device in Utah, is presented.

40|$|Sea-level rise due {{to global}} warming is {{predicted}} to have a large impact on human society, especially for populations living in coastal regions and on islands. It is therefore of great importance to monitor the sea level and to increase {{the understanding of the}} local hydrodynamic and meteorological responses to a global sea-level rise. Presented in this thesis is a technique to measure local sea level using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. This GNSS-based tide gauge acquires both the directly received GNSS signals and the GNSS signals that are reflected off the sea surface, using standard geodetic GNSS receivers. With the directly received signals the installation measures land-surface height changes, whereas the reflected signals are used to measure sea-surface height changes. Both measurements are done with respect to the Earth's centre of mass. By combining these observations it is possible to estimate the local sea level, which {{is directly related to the}} volume of the ocean. Several GNSS-based tide gauge campaigns have been carried out at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) on the west coast of Sweden. Today the installation is still in place and continues to record GNSS data with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. In this thesis, data from the campaigns are analysed in a post-processing mode with an in-house developed software. Sea-level estimates are produced with a temporal resolution from 5 s to 20 min and compared to independent sea-level observations from <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges located approximately 18 km south and 33 km north of OSO. The results for three months of GNSS-derived sea level show an agreement, with respect to the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge sea level, with typical root-mean-square differences of better than 6 cm and correlation coefficients of higher than 0. 95. Additionally, using an ocean-tide analysis of three months of sea-level observations from the GNSS-based tide gauge, it was possible to determine several tidal components, i. e., M 2, S 2, N 2, O 2, and M 4. The amplitudes and phases show reasonable agreement with the ones derived from one year of <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge sea-level data. </p...|$|E
