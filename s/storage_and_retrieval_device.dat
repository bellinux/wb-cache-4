40|$|Phase change {{material}} (PCM) based {{latent heat}} thermal storage (LHTS) systems offer a challenging option {{to be employed}} as an effective energy <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>device.</b> The performance of LHTS systems {{is limited by the}} poor thermal conductivity of PCMs employed. Successful large-scale utilization of LHTS systems thus depends {{on the extent to which}} the performance can be improved. A great deal of work both experimental and theoretical on different performance enhancement techniques has been reported in the literature. This paper reviews the implementation of those techniques in different configurations of LHTS systems. The influence of enhancement techniques on the thermal response of the PCM in terms of phase change rate and amount of latent heat stored/retrieved has been addressed as a main aspect. Issues related to mathematical modeling of LHTS systems employing enhancement techniques are also discussed.

However, the performance of LHTS systems is limited by the poor thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCMs) employed. A numerical study is carried out to investigate the performance enhancement of a LHTS unit of shell and tube configuration due to the dispersion of high conductivity particles in the PCM during charging process (melting). Temperature based governing equations have been formulated and solved numerically following an alternate iteration between the temperature and thermal resistance. Exergy based performance evaluation is taken as a main aspect. The numerical results are presented for several mass flow rates and inlet temperatures of heat transfer fluid (HTF). The results indicate a significant improvement in the performance of the LHTS unit when high conductivity particles are dispersed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the music {{business}} should be regarded as an activity trading in information. The paper begins with a review of key themes in the conceptualisation of the music industry within the cultural economies tradition. These are the tensions between creativity and commerce and between global and local processes, and the characterisation of the industry in the terms of the flexible specialisation and reflexive accumulation theses. It is then suggested that these debates have downplayed a key characteristic of the contemporary music industry, its involvement with the creation, production, and distribution of information. The emergence of a global music business over the past decade is documented and analysed by means of this framework. Subsequently, two aspects of the integration processes taking place in the music industry are considered in terms of their relationship to the information economy: copyright protection and branding, and competition between producers of information <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>devices.</b> The paper concludes that interpreting music as an information industry sheds new light on the music business, and points to important questions for further research within the information economy literature. ...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{models of}} {{representation}} as encodings {{of what is}} represented yield models of knowledge as banks of such encodings. Learning, in such a view, is the transmission of new encodings into those storage banks in the mind. Technology, therefore, can be a wonderful aid in enhancing the accessibility and transmission of these encoded representations — in enhancing learning as viewed in this model. Every component and every step of this framework, however, is false, beginning with the central presuppositions {{about the nature of}} representation. This chapter outlines the fatal critiques of standard encoding models, introduces an alternative model of representation that solves and dissolves these aporia, and shows that this alternative model of representation forces a model of learning as construction, and a functional model of scaffolding that puts scaffolding, selfscaffolding, and the scaffolding of self-scaffolding, at the center of educational aims. This framework places technology at the center of an agentive and social process that participates in and nurtures such scaffolding, rather than just a high bandwidth <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the urgent threats {{presented}} by climate change and rapid urbanisation, interest in ‘smart city systems’ is mounting. In contrast to scholarship that poses ‘smartness’ as {{something that needs to}} be added to cities, recent developments in spatial morphology research pursue a view of the built fabric of cities as an extension of the cognitive human apparatus, as well as a material formulation of social, cultural and economic relations and processes. The built fabric of cities needs to be understood as a highly intelligent artefact in itself, rather than simple, dead matter. The current focus on high-tech systems risks concealing the fact that the machine is already there. In contrast to the technological ‘implements’ of smart city systems, this article looks at cities as ‘facilities’ – that is, as technologies that slow down, store and maintain energy as a resource for a variety of purposes. The article builds on space syntax research in order to give precision to the understanding of the affordances the cities offer their various processes and the ways in which cities operate as information <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>devices</b> for individuals <b>and</b> for society. The city must be considered, we argue, in terms of a range of tangled, interdependent systems, reaching from individual buildings to the whole city, an understanding anchored in notions of ‘diversity’ and ‘density’ (recently gathered under the concept of ‘spatial capital’) and in research addressing how the distribution of space and artefacts serve as means of knowledge communication (specifically, in complex buildings such as libraries and department stores). In conclusion, we argue that existing discussions on ‘smart city systems’ would benefit acknowledgement of the role of cities as facilities...|$|R

This work has been {{concerned}} with theoretical, computational and experimental studies {{of a variety of}} flow and transport problems that are of generic interest and applicability in energy-related and energy-intensive processes. These include the follow: (1) Problems associated with oil recovery [...] the global economy continues to be dependent on the stable and predictable supply of oil and fossil fuels. This wil remain the case for the near term, as current estimates are that world production of oil will peak between 2025 and 2100, depending on assumptions regarding growth. Most of these resources reside in porous rocks and other naturally occurring media. Studies of flow-induced instabilities are relevant to the areas of secondary and enhanced oil recovery. (2) Small scale and Stokes flows [...] flows in microgeometries and involving interfaces and surfactants are of interest in a myriad of energy-related contexts. These include: pore-level modeling of the fundamental processes by which oil held in porous materials is mobilized and produced; heating and cooling energy cycles involving significant expenditure of energy in conditioning of human environments, heat pipes, and compact heat exchangers; and energy efficiency in large scale separation processes such as distillation and absorption [...] processes that underlie the chemical process industries.

Now the research is focus on suitable method to incorporate PCMs with building. There are several methods to use phase change materials (PCMs) in thermal energy storage (TES) for different applications. Microencapsulation is one of the well known and advanced technologies for better utilization of PCMs with building parts, such as, wall, roof and floor besides, within the building materials.

These systemsare used in practice when the need for pallet places is high and the throughput capacity is relatively low.

With the proposed analytical travel time models, average travel time of the <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> machine, from which the performance of multi aisle automated <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>retrieval</b> systems can be evaluated is determined.
