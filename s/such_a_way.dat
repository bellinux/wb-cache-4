5|$|The {{scene where}} Saul Tigh has {{the vision of}} {{shooting}} William Adama was not filmed in one shot, but was edited in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that the cut would only become noticeable {{if one looks at}} the scene closely.

5|$|The urban {{morphology}} of Skopje {{was deeply}} {{impacted by the}} 26th of July 1963 earthquake which destroyed 80% {{of the city and}} by the reconstruction that followed.

5|$|This {{class of}} {{objections}} is more radical than the above, claiming {{that a major}} aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.|$|E

5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that the independent sets satisfy properties {{modeled after the}} properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E

5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).

5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, {{to ensure that the}} less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E
5|$|In August, twelve {{engineers}} were hired on contract with Baneservice, {{at the time}} a subsidiary of the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The {{engineers were}} subsequently re-certified for the Y1 class, as well as being given a service course. While other engineers in the country are required to take an 18-month course, Timetoget felt it could meet sufficient safety standards with a six-week course. Arne Wam, chief executive officer of NSB, stated that he could not permit that a subsidiary ignore safety in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> and announced he would stop operations.|$|E

5|$|In VLSI {{integrated}} circuit design, if {{a collection of}} modules must be connected by wires that can each bend at most once, then again there are two possible routes for the wires, {{and the problem of}} choosing which of these two routes to use, in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that all wires can be routed in a single layer of the circuit, can be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{emotional}} {{part of the}} collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions.

Works that feature gay characters {{are more likely to}} be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E
