In these notes the assumptions used by PBR are considerably weakened, to further restrict the class of possible models. The `factorisability' assumption used by PBR {{is replaced by a}} far weaker `compatibility' assumption for uncorrelated quantum subsystems which, moreover, does not require the assignation of <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> properties to each subsystem (i. e, reductionism). Further, it is shown that an assumption of measurement independence may be dropped to obtain a related result having the same experimental significance (at the expense of a weaker conceptual significance). The latter is a remarkable feature of the PBR approach, given that Bell inequalities, steering inequalities and Kochen-Specker theorems all require an assumption of this type...|$|R

40|$|Behaviorally, psychopathy {{and anxiety}} display {{opposite}} patterns of threat sensitivity and response inhibition. However, {{it is unclear}} whether this is due to shared or to <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> processes. To address this question, we evaluated whether the threat sensitivity of psychopathic and anxious offenders relates to similar or different components of Gray and McNaughton’s (2000) Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory using a sample of 87 prisoners and a task that crossed threat onset with attentional focus. Psychopathy was associated with significantly weaker fear-potentiated startle (FPS) under conditions that presented threat cues after alternative, goal-directed cues. Conversely, anxiety was associated with significantly stronger FPS when threat appeared first and was the focus of attention. Furthermore, these differences were statistically independent. The results suggest that the abnormal sensitivity to threat cues associated with psychopathy and anxiety relate to different underlying processes and have implications for understanding the relationship between low- and high-anxious psychopathy...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{contrast}} three implementations of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) {{as applied to}} epileptic scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, these are; Spatial (Ensemble) ICA, Temporal (single-channel) ICA and Spatio-Temporal ICA. These techniques are based on information derived from both multi-channel as well as single channel biomedical signal recordings. We assess the suitability of the three techniques in isolating and extracting out epileptic seizure sources. Although our results are preliminary in nature, we show that standard implementations of ICA (ensemble ICA) are lacking when attempting to extract complex underlying activity such as ictal activity in the EEG. Temporal ICA performs well in <b>separating</b> <b>underlying</b> sources, although it is clearly lacking in spatial information. Spatio-Temporal ICA {{has the advantage of}} using temporal information to inform the ICA process, aided by the spatial information inherent in multi-channel recordings. This work is being expanded for seizure onset analysis through scalp EEG...|$|R

This approach is supported by an extensible data model that implicitly captures the relationships between information provided by <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> systems and facilitates the incremental construction of global smart spaces since the underlying systems to be incorporated are largely decoupled.

Self-reports reflected the emotion but not the motivational direction induction. Univariate and multivariate analyses of 24 somatovisceral variables and 2 a priori defined summary variables showed that anger and fear had specific response profiles with effect sizes correlating r = 0. 53 with the respective effect sizes from a previous study. Approach and withdrawal profiles varied only in intensity. Emotion and motivational direction did not interact and had independent somatovisceral effects.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} plural in Achole, a {{language}} of Uganda and Kenya {{which is part of}} the Western Nilotic family. In this thesis, I analyze a phonological phenomenon of the Acholi plural. Like other languages of the Western Nilotic family, Acholi exhibits a voicing alternation between the singular and plural nominal forms in which voiceless obstruents become voiced. I use data from other Nilotic languages and draw upon previous analyses of the plural voicing alternation to better understand the behavior of the Acholi plural. I propose a new analysis of the Acholi plural using Strong Lexicon Optimization. This differs from traditional Optimality Theoretic analyses in that it allows for multiple underlying representations of the same word. In this thesis, I propose that when a voicing alternation occurs in between the singular and plural in Acholi, there are two <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> representations: one for the singular form and one for the plural...|$|R
40|$|The ever {{expanding}} {{multimedia content}} (such as images and videos), {{especially on the}} web, necessitates effective text query-based search (or retrieval) systems. Popular ap-proaches for addressing this issue, use the query-likelihood model which fails to capture the user’s information needs.

Our approach assumes two <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> distributions for query and the document respectively. We then, deter-mine the extent of similarity between these two statistical distributions for the task of ranking. Furthermore we extend our approach, using Active Learning techniques, to address the question of obtaining a good performance without re-quiring a fully labeled training dataset. This is done by taking Sample Uncertainty, Density and Diversity into ac-count. Our experiments on the popular TRECVID corpus and the open, relatively small-sized USC SmartBody corpus show that we are almost at-par or sometimes better than multiple state-of-the-art baselines...|$|R

40|$|Circadian rhythms are endogenously-generated rhythmic bodily {{processes}} that occur with {{a period of}} approximately 24 hours. They occur {{at every level of}} biological organization, and fundamentally underlie almost every physiological, neurological, and behavioral function undergone by an organism. It should not be surprising, therefore, that circadian disturbances are a common symptom of diseases and disorders of the nervous system, and that this disturbance feeds back into the disease mechanisms to worsen symptoms. Circadian phenotypes of mouse models of Rett syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Huntington’s disease have been extensively studied in our lab. This thesis further examines these models to determine if a common underlying histopathology is present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central clock of the mammalian brain. Tracing of Nissl stains was used to determine if there were any changes in the gross morphology of the SCN, and immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to look for possible loss of SCN neuropeptide-expressing subpopulations of neurons. Ultimately, no common histoanatomical phenotype was observed between the three mouse models, leading to the conclusion that <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> phenotypes must be converging on common patient symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Despite good early rhythm {{processing}} abilities, {{and clear}} enjoyment of music, infants appear {{not to be}} able to spontaneously synchronize their movement to the beat of a song (Zentner and Eerola, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107, 2010, 5768). We present a new social bell-ringing task designed to facilitate synchronous movement to music in infants. Ten-month-olds, 18 -month-olds, and adults were played musical tracks of various tempos and given handheld bells to ring, in the presence of either a live experimenter or an animated nonsocial stimulus. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure the timing of arm movements during periods of bell ringing. Infants showed no evidence of synchronous bell ringing at any tempo. However, while the 10 -month-olds did not modulate their ringing to the music tempo, the 18 -month-olds showed tempo-flexibility. Moreover, 18 -month-olds displayed more associated behaviors such as bouncing and rocking in the absence (rather than presence) of a social partner, whereas the behavior of the 10 -month-olds was not modulated by the presence or absence of a social partner. The results suggest a distinction between “moving together” and “moving to the beat,” which may have <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> mechanisms and developmental trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Despite known {{overlaps}} in {{the pattern}} of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SZA), few studies have examined the extent to which cognitive performance validates traditional diagnostic boundaries in these groups. Method Individuals with SZ (n= 49), schizoaffective disorder (n= 33) and BD (n= 35) completed a battery of cognitive tests measuring the domains of processing speed, immediate memory, semantic memory, learning, working memory, executive function and sustained attention. Results A discriminant functions analysis revealed a significant function comprising semantic memory, immediate memory and processing speed that maximally separated patients with SZ from those with BD. Initial classification scores {{on the basis of this}} function showed modest diagnostic accuracy, owing in part to the misclassification of SZA patients as having SZ. When SZA patients were removed from the model, a second cross-validated classifier yielded slightly improved diagnostic accuracy and a single function solution, of which semantic memory loaded most heavily. Conclusions A cluster of non-executive cognitive processes appears to have some validity in mapping onto traditional nosological boundaries. However, since semantic memory performance was the primary driver of the discrimination between BD and SZ, it is possible that performance differences between the disorders in this cognitive domain in particular, index <b>separate</b> <b>underlying</b> aetiologies...|$|R
