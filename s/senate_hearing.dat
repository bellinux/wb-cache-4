5|$|Fox Broadcasting Company aired {{a special}} {{entitled}} Mutant Watch {{to promote the}} movie that partially includes in universe scenes of a <b>senate</b> <b>hearing</b> featuring Senator Robert Kelly.

5|$|In the afternoon, {{the crew}} {{became the first}} shuttle crew to ever testify live from orbit in a United States <b>Senate</b> <b>hearing.</b> Barbara Mikulski, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, and former {{astronaut}} Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, spoke with the crew {{about the importance of}} spaceflight and the repair of Hubble. The first person to give testimony from space was John L. Phillips, who testified before the House Science Committee, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in June 2005 while a member of Expedition 11 on board the International Space Station. The crew of Atlantis later spoke with reporters from the major networks CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX before going to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the <b>Senate</b> <b>hearing</b> in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's B movie-esque quality, warped humor, and smooth video animation, but criticized the shallow gameplay. The title is particularly notable for {{being one of}} the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with Mortal Kombat. Night Trap was cited during the hearing as promoting gratuitous violence and sexual aggression against women. Toy retailers pulled the game from shelves that December, and Sega withdrew the game from the market by January. The <b>Senate</b> <b>hearing</b> eventually {{led to the creation of}} the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was re-released and ported to other consoles. These later ports received more harsh reviews due to the aging appeal of full motion video. A re-release of Night Trap in celebration of its 25th anniversary was released on August 15, 2017.|$|E

25|$|Since this time, some of Karpinski's {{claim of}} {{top-level}} authorization have been affirmed by revelations {{of what are}} known as the Torture Memos, legal opinions prepared by political appointees including John Yoo in the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice. His memo of March 14, 2003, five days before the US began its invasion of Iraq, concluded that federal laws related to torture and other abuses did not apply to interrogators working overseas; it was issued to William J. Haynes, the General Counsel of DOD, and finally revealed in 2008 {{as a result of a}} <b>Senate</b> <b>hearing</b> into enhanced interrogation techniques.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Pallop's order to storm the mosque contravened a direct order by Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh {{to seek a}} peaceful resolution to the stand-off {{no matter how long}} it took. Pallop was immediately ordered out of the area, and later tendered his resignation as commander of the Southern Peace Enhancement Center. The forward command of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), which Pallop headed, was also dissolved. A government investigative commission found that the security forces had over-reacted. The Asian Centre for Human Rights questioned the independence and impartiality of the investigative commission. On 3 May 2004 during a <b>senate</b> <b>hearing,</b> Senator Kraisak Choonhavan noted that most of those killed at Krue Se Mosque {{had been shot in the}} head and there were signs that ropes had been tied around their wrists, suggesting they had been executed after being captured.|$|E

500|$|Regarding foreign policy, {{during his}} first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on arms control issues. [...] In {{response}} to the refusal of the U.S. Congress to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, he took the initiative to meet the Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, educated him about American concerns and interests, and secured several changes to address objections of the Foreign Relations Committee. [...] When the Reagan administration wanted to interpret the 1972 SALT I Treaty loosely {{in order to allow}} the Strategic Defense Initiative to proceed, Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty's terms. He clashed again with the Reagan administration in 1986 over economic sanctions against South Africa; he received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George P. Shultz at a <b>Senate</b> <b>hearing</b> because of the administration's support of that country, which continued to practice the apartheid system.|$|E
500|$|Metal {{artists have}} had to defend their lyrics {{in front of the}} U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister {{frontman}} Dee Snider was asked to defend his song Under the Blade at a U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>hearing.</b> At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery. In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song Suicide Solution. A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death. In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement [...] "do it" [...] in a Priest song. While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed. In 1991, UK police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an [...] "...unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity".|$|E
