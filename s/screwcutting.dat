50|$|Watchmakers lathes are {{delicate}} but precise metalworking lathes, usually without {{provision for}} <b>screwcutting,</b> {{and are still}} used by horologists for work such as the turning of balance staffs. A handheld tool called a graver is often used in preference to a slide-mounted tool. The original watchmaker's turns was a simple dead-center lathe with a moveable rest and two loose head-stocks. The workpiece would be rotated by a bow, typically of horsehair, wrapped around it.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when <b>screwcutting</b> or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|E
