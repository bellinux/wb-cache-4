5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to <b>stay</b> <b>inside.</b> Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the Union.|$|E
5|$|Fearing for {{the safety}} of his wife's {{relatives}} in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., to <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the walls of the Alamo. Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of the Alamo fortress. Bowie had been ill, and twodoctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army began a siege of the Alamo on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag to warn the defenders that no quarter would be given.|$|E
5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn 1996, Garsia and Haiman {{introduced}} a bivariate analogue of the Catalan numbers that counts multiplicities {{of the sign}} character in a certain doubly graded Sn-module. Haglund conjectured a combinatorial interpretation for this sequence by defining two statistics {{on the set of}} lattice paths <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> the triangle bounded by x= 0, y=x, and y=n. This conjecture was eventually proved by Garsia and Haglund. Later, the present author introduced similar statistics for lattice paths <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> other triangles, whose generating function is conjectured to give the higher q,t-Catalan sequences of Garsia and Haiman. This article generalizes these combinatorial statistics to lattice paths within certain trapezoidal regions. We introduce a five-variable generating function for these paths and prove formulas, bijections, and recursions involving this generating function. An open question is to find representation-theoretical interpretations for these statistics analogous to those previously conjectured for the paths <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> triangular regions...|$|R

5|$|Nariman House, a Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre in Colaba {{known as}} the Mumbai Chabad House, {{was taken over by}} two attackers and several {{residents}} were held hostage. Police evacuated adjacent buildings and exchanged fire with the attackers, wounding one. Local residents were told to <b>stay</b> <b>inside.</b> The attackers threw a grenade into a nearby lane, causing no casualties. NSG commandos arrived from Delhi, and a naval helicopter took an aerial survey. During the first day, 9 hostages were rescued from the first floor. The following day, the house was stormed by NSG commandos fast-roping from helicopters onto the roof, covered by snipers positioned in nearby buildings. After a long battle, one NSG commando Havaldar Gajender Singh Bisht and both perpetrators were killed. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka Holtzberg, who was six months pregnant, were murdered with four other hostages inside the house by the attackers.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{it was not}} as {{successful}} as her previous records in Japan. It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and stiff competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve this after Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E

The Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI) certified the album platinum for sales of 60,000 units. Sale el Sol debuted atop the Portuguese Albums Chart — Shakira's first album to accomplish the feat in the country — and spent two weeks at number one. It was able {{to stay within the}} top 10 for 23 consecutive weeks. It was certified platinum by the Associação Fonográfica Portuguesa (AFP) for selling 15,000 units in Portugal. Sale el Sol was Shakira's first studio album since Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005) to peak at number one on the Spanish Albums chart after it debuted at the top position. It spent a total of 63 weeks on the chart and was certified double-platinum by the Producers of Spanish Music (PROMUSICAE) for shipments of 80,000 units. Sale el Sol entered and peaked at number two on the Swiss Albums Chart and was kept from attaining the top position by American rock band Kings of Leon's album Come Around Sundown, which debuted at number one. It charted for 49 weeks in total. In Switzerland, it was certified double-platinum by IFPI for selling 40,000 units.|$|E

40|$|The paper shows {{selected}} {{aspects of}} the microclimate change in the occupied zone of the large-volume buildings. The air temperature and some other microclimate parameters change because of heat emission from people <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> there. There are shown exemplary methods and results of research conducted in sacral buildings and residential apartment buildings. It is based on author's research. The novelty is the research of the human heat emission {{in case of a}} big number of people <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> sacral buildings. It can be useful for a large-volume buildings design (especially for the sacral buildings) and for microclimate shaping in many types of buildings and residential buildings also. In some buildings with a big number of people <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> at the same time (such as the sacral buildings) heat emitted from people significantly influences on microclimate. Another situation is observed in residential apartment buildings, where heat and moisture gain are distributed in separate rooms. Human heat streams can be useful {{as a part of the}} heat balance of the room especially in case the big number of people staying in the room...|$|R
