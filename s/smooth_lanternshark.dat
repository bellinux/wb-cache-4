25|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>smooth</b> <b>lanternsharks,</b> {{predominantly}} juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, {{and to a}} lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed bottom nets, in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the velvet belly lanternshark (E. spinax) and the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus). Most captured <b>smooth</b> <b>lanternsharks</b> are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The <b>smooth</b> <b>lanternshark's</b> slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, catch rates currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the <b>smooth</b> <b>lanternshark's</b> wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern.|$|R

50|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is close to}} the {{pectoral}} than the pelvic fins, and bear a straight, grooved spine in front. The second dorsal fin is half again as tall as the first and bears a longer, curved spine. The pectoral fins are rounded at the tips, with the distance between them and the medium-sized, angular pelvic fins about equal to the distance between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is absent. The caudal peduncle is narrow, leading to a caudal fin with a well-developed lower lobe and a broad upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The small, blocky dermal denticles are densely but irregularly arranged, each with a flat, truncate crown. The coloration is brown or gray above, with a pale spot over the pineal gland, and black below extending in faint markings over the sides of the head, under the pectoral fins, over the pelvic fins, and below the caudal peduncle. Like other lanternsharks, the blurred lanternshark possesses a species-specific light-emitting photophores, which are not placed in prominent bands. The blurred lanternshark is very similar to the <b>smooth</b> <b>lanternshark,</b> but is larger and can be reliably differentiated by the number of turns in the spiral valve intestine (16 - 19 versus 10 - 13).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{provides}} the first {{description of the}} feeding ecology of the <b>smooth</b> <b>lanternshark</b> Etmopterus pusillus based on stomach contents of specimens caught as bycatch in the Algarve (southern Portugal) with bottom trawling and bottom longline. The diet of E. pusillus consists mainly of fish (dry weight (% W) = 87. 1 %; frequency of occurrence (%FO) = 28. 6 %; number (%N) = 30. 3 %), crustaceans (%W= 7. 7 %; %FO= 36. 7 %; %N= 3. 4 %) and cephalopods (%W= 4. 7 %; %FO= 11. 3 %; %N= 11. 1 %). The diet did not vary between sexes. Ontogenic changes were detected: crustaceans decreased in importance as the sharks increased in size and fish became dominant in the diet of adults. Combining two fishing methods provided broad information on the diet of E. pusillus, as bottom trawling caught smaller specimens and longlines caught larger individuals. E. pusillus feeds mainly on non-commercial species, and therefore does not compete directly with commercial fisheries. Finally, E. pusillus feeds {{in various parts of}} the water column and thus it can access a wide range of prey; however, this also means that it can be caught by both gears, making it more vulnerable in terms of conservation...|$|E
