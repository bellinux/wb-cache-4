5000|$|Spray {{application}} of herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides {{is essential to}} distribute these materials over the intended target surface. Pre-emergent herbicides are sprayed onto soil, but many materials are applied to the plant leaf surface. Agricultural sprays include the spraying of cropland, forest, turf grass, and orchards. The sprayer may be a hand nozzle, on a ground vehicle, or on an aircraft. Herbicides, insecticides and pesticides are spray applied to soil or plant foliage to distribute and disperse these materials. See aerial application, pesticide application, sprayer.The control of spray characteristics is critical to provide the coverage of foliage and to minimize off target drifting of the spray to adjacent areas. (pesticide drift). Spray drift is managed by applying only in appropriate wind conditions and humidity, and by controlling drop size and drop size distribution. Minimizing {{the height of the}} <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> above the crop reduces drift.

5000|$|The main design {{criteria}} were {{set by the}} disposable nature of the aircraft's load and its rugged and hazardous working environment. The first required the load in its hopper to be placed at the aerodynamic center, about 25% chord; safety demanded a good view from the cockpit in all directions but particularly forwards, so the cockpit was placed high behind the hopper with the forward fuselage sloping downwards at 15°. The seat was designed to withstand 40g's [...] The cockpit was open but with two strong, curved longitudinal frames to ease any obstructions, cables and the like, safely over the pilot's head. The leading edges of the undercarriage legs were sharpened to cut through similar hazards. Good low-speed flight characteristics, even with a heavy load, were also essential, calling for a high-lift wing. The all-metal Ag-1 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with an unusually thick (thickness/chord 21%), constant chord wing, fitted with full span slotted flaps and slot-lip ailerons. [...] It had a short centre section with no dihedral and outer panels with 5° of dihedral. The legs of the fixed, conventional undercarriage, with wheels fitted with low pressure tyres, were mounted on this inner wing section, which also contained internal tanks, capacity 150 UG gal (125 Imp gal, 568 L) for crop spraying liquid. The wing tip tip to tip <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> was contained within the wing profile.|$|E

40|$|In This Issue: HERBICIDE APPLICATION Weed {{control with}} {{herbicides}} {{depends on the}} uniform application of dependable herbicides. A sprayer is needed which will allow for both uniform application and correct droplet size at desired spray volumes. The sprayer should be of sufficient capacity to handle the acreage involved. AGITATION Agitation of most spray solutions is necessary. Any separation will vary the spray concentration. For a simple orifice jet agitator, a flow of 6 gallons per minute for every 100 gallons of tank capacity is usually adequate. SPRAY BOOMS The use of gauge wheels helps maintain the proper distance between the spray nozzle and the target especially on uneven ground, going across terraces, etc. A <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> where the height and angle of the spray nozzles can be changed is also desirable. The supply lines to and on the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> must be of adequate size for even distribution. It is best to have the supply line coming {{to the center of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> section and distribute from that point rather than coming in on the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> and running the chance of less pressure at the far end. Many sprayers, now, are being designed with wet booms and are fitted with assemblies that protrude 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 way into the boom which take the spray solution out of the middle of the boom. PVC Schedule 80 makes an excellent wet boom if supported adequately. The wet boom, which takes the spray solution from the middle, will help keep materials like sand and rust in the bottom of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> which can be flushed out of the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> when it is cleaned.

40|$|Abstract.

40|$|Purpose: The {{appearance}} {{western corn rootworm}} (Diabrotica virgifera LeConte) in Slovenia brings {{new challenges}} to machines used for pesticide spraying of corn. The control of western corn rootworm is difficult due to {{the height of the}} corn crop in July-August. The current paper presents the exploitation characteristics of mistblower with cannon and field sprayer with high-mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>boom</b> and vertical tube extension with distributing nozzles on pesticide distribution over the corn plant. Design/methodology/approach: Two field experiments with different air adjustments and driving speed (mistblower with cannon) and nozzle flow and driving speed (field sprayer with high-mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>boom)</b> were reserachFindings: The ventilator of the mistblower spread the pesticide over the wider band of the field as the field sprayer, however the pesticide distribution measured as coefficient of variation did not fulfil the legislative requirements. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied under similar equipment adjustment, working speed and growing conditions of the corn plant (78. 000 / ha and the height of 2. 70 m). Practical implications: The field sprayer with high-mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>boom</b> and vertical tube extension was proved as an efficient machine for controlling of western corn rootworm adults in the developed corn growing over 2. 70 m.

This continues to be a major problem in applying agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this research is to measure the amount of sedimenting drift from a horizontal boom sprayer for different (drift reducing) spray application techniques under field conditions and to compare the results with the results from a reference spray, taking into account variations in meteorological conditions during the field drift experiments. Field drift measurements were performed for several combinations of nozzle type (standard flat-fan, low-drift, air inclusion) and size (ISO 02, 03, 04, and 06), spray pressure (2. 0, 3. 0, and 4. 0 bar), driving speed (4, 6, 8, and 10 km h(- 1)), and <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> height (0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 75 m) according to ISO 22866 by sampling in a defined downwind area at 24 different positions using horizontal drift collectors.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decreasing}} availability of authorized plant protection products, adequate pest control becomes more difficult in many ornamental crops and almost no information is available about the optimization of spray application techniques in ornamental crops. Yet, <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> systems-instead of the still predominantly used spray guns-might improve crop protection management in greenhouses considerably. Application rate, nozzle type, and configuration will influence the spray deposition and, as such, its efficiency. In this study, spray deposition in ivy pot plants [Hedera algeriensis cv. Montgomery, Hibb. ], grown on hanging shelves in greenhouses, was compared with a traditional spray gun with a disc-core nozzle and a manually pulled trolley equipped with two vertical spray booms. The sprayings with the spray gun were performed at an application rate of 8500 L. ha(- 1). For the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system, two different reduced application rates (2500 and 5000 L. ha(- 1)) with five different combinations of nozzle type, size, and pressure for each application rate were investigated. This research underlined that, besides the application rate, also the spray application equipment used has an important effect on the spray depositions. Nozzle type, size, and pressure on the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system only had a minor effect on the spray deposition.

Relating to hand held equipment, leaf deposits result from: a) the equipment characteristics and its positioning relative to target; b) operator velocity exchange during the treatment; c) position of the sampled leaves.

50|$|Post-emergent {{pesticide}} application {{requires the}} use of specific chemicals chosen minimize harm to the desirable target organism. An example is 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which will injure broadleaf weeds (dicots) but leave behind grasses (monocots). Such a chemical has been used extensively on wheat crops, for example. A number of companies have also created genetically modified organisms that are resistant to various pesticides. Examples include glyphosate-resistant soybeans and Bt maize, which change the types of formulations involved in addressing post-emergent pesticide pressure. It is important to also note that even given appropriate chemical choices, high ambient temperatures or other environmental influences, can allow the non-targeted desirable organism to be damaged during application. As plants have already germinated, post-emergent pesticide application necessitates limited field contact in order to minimize losses due to crop and soil damage. Typical industrial application equipment will utilize very tall and narrow tires and combine this with a sprayer body which can be raised and lowered depending on crop height. These sprayers usually carry the label ‘high-clearance’ as they can rise over growing crops, although usually not much more than 1 or 2 meters high. In addition, these sprayers often have very wide booms in order to minimize the number of passes required over a field, again designed to limit crop damage and maximize efficiency. In industrial agriculture, <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> 120 feet (40 meters) wide are not uncommon, especially in prairie agriculture with large, flat fields. Related to this, aerial pesticide application is a method of top dressing a pesticide to an emerged crop which eliminates physical contact with soil and crops.|$|R
