40|$|Background: Saliva {{collection}} {{can provide}} clinical information about individual patients. However, {{a correlation between}} ranking buffering capacity using resting and <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> is still unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the pH change after HCl titration into resting and <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> for a salivary buffering capacity test. Methods: Resting and <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> (by chewing paraffin wax) were collected from 80 patients. After the pH of both saliva samples was measured using a hand-held pH meter, the saliva samples were titrated with 0. 1 N HCl to evaluate the buffering capacity. Correlations of ranking buffering capacity (high, medium, low) between <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> and resting saliva with 30 μL HCl titration and between <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> and resting saliva with 40 μL HCl titration were statistically analysed by Spearman Rank Correlation Test (p< 0. 05). Results: At 50 μL HCl titration, <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> buffering capacities were ranked into high (above pH 5. 5), medium (pH from 5. 5 to 4. 5) and low (below pH 4. 5). At 30 - 40 μL HCl titration, the resting saliva buffering capacities were ranked into the same categories. Spearman Rank Correlation indicated significant positive coefficients for the <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> and resting saliva buffering capacity at 30 μL titration and the <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> and resting saliva at 40 μL titration.

25|$|Gum chewing is {{regarded}} as a helpful way to cure halitosis (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by <b>stimulating</b> <b>saliva,</b> which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally <b>stimulates</b> <b>saliva</b> production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to demineralize the teeth.|$|R

In total, 137 metabolites were identified and quantified. The concentrations of 44 metabolites in <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> were significantly higher than those in unstimulated saliva. Pathway analysis identified the upregulation of the urea cycle and synthesis and degradation pathways of glycine, serine, cysteine and threonine in <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva.</b> A principal component analysis revealed that the effect of masticatory stimulation on salivary metabolomic profiles was less dependent on sample population sex, age, and smoking. The concentrations of only 1 metabolite in unstimulated saliva, and of 3 metabolites <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva,</b> showed significant correlation with salivary secretion volume, indicating that the salivary metabolomic profile and salivary secretion volume were independent factors. Masticatory stimulation affected not only salivary secretion volume, but also metabolite concentration patterns.

Since TIMP- 1 resides in most tissues and bodily fluids, we evaluated the potential of using saliva to obtain reproducible TIMP- 1 measurements in a non-invasive manner. Material and methods. Samples of unstimulated and <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> and saliva collected from individual glands were analysed for TIMP- 1 content. A TIMP- 1 ELISA was validated for use in saliva testing and the most optimal sampling and handling procedures for reproducible measurements identified. Western blotting and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used for confirmatory analyses. Results. The TIMP- 1 ELISA was found suitable for saliva measurements. All saliva secretions contained TIMP- 1, but in different concentrations ranging from 2. 81 ng/mL in submandibular/ sublingual saliva to 173. 88 ng/mL in parotid saliva. TIMP- 1 concentrations were influenced to a varying degree by fluctuations in flow.

Patients with active primary SS, {{as determined by the}} revised American-European Consensus Group criteria, and a rate of <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> secretion of >= 0. 15 ml/minute were treated with either rituximab (1, 000 mg) or placebo infusions on days 1 and 15. Patients were assigned randomly to a treatment group in a ratio of 2 : 1 (rituximab: placebo). Followup was conducted at 5, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. The primary end point was the <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> flow rate, while secondary end points included functional, laboratory, and subjective variables. Results. Thirty patients with primary SS (29 female) were randomly allocated to a treatment group. The mean +/- SD age of the patients receiving rituximab was 43 +/- 11 years and the disease duration was 63 +/- 50 months, while patients in the placebo group were age 43 +/- 17 years and had a disease duration of 67 +/- 63 months. In the rituximab group, significant improvements, in terms of the mean change from baseline compared with that in the placebo group, were found for the primary end point of the <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> flow rate (P = 0. 038 versus placebo) and also for various laboratory parameters (B cell and rheumatoid factor [RF] levels), subjective parameters (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory [MFI] scores and visual analog scale [VAS] scores for sicca symptoms), and extraglandular manifestations.

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the correlation between dental health status and environmental factors: oral hygiene, nutrition, salivary pH and the flow rate of <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva</b> in children. Materials and methods: Research was done in children with caries and in children with healthy teeth of both gender and the age of 12. Questionnaire method was used to obtain data about the time of consuming refined carbohydrates and oral hygiene. Oral hygiene level was determined using the Silness-loe plaque index and saliva was analyzed by measuring the flow rate of <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva,</b> as well as measuring pH of non-stimulated and <b>stimulated</b> <b>saliva.</b> Results: Examining the correlation of seven analyzed characteristics it was possible to determine the presence of 14 (66, 7 %) correlations out of 21 possible, with statistical significance and various p-values starting from p= 0. 038 (tau-b= 0. 229) up to p< 0. 001 (r= 0. 667). Out of seven analyzed characteristics, the time of carbohydrate consumption, the presence of caries (group) and pH of non-stimulated saliva are predominantly correlated with other characteristics. Conclusion: The results of this examination show caries appearance in children to be in highly significant correlation with frequency of carbohydrate consumption, plaque index and pH values of non-stimulated saliva. In other words, children with caries consume carbohydrates often between meals, have high plaque index and lower pH values of non-stimulated saliva...|$|E
40|$|Mean salivary {{secretion}} {{and bite}} force decrease with advancing age. Previous {{studies have shown}} that salivary flow rates are influenced by mastication. In the present study, we examined the relationship between salivary flow rates and maximal bite force in a community-based sample of men and women 35 years of age or older. Salivary flow rates for unstimulated whole and unstimulated submandibular/sublingual (SMSL) saliva as well as citrate-stimulated parotid and SMSL saliva were measured in 399 subjects. Bite force was assessed with a bilateral force transducer. Pearson correlation analysis yielded significant positive correlations between bite force and flow rates for unstimulated whole saliva (r = 0. 24, p < 0. 0001), <b>stimulated</b> parotid <b>saliva</b> (r= 0. 13, p < 0. 03), unstimulated SMSL (r = 0. 14, p < 0. 0001), and stimulated SMSL (r = 0. 16, p < 0. 003). When adjusted for age and gender, the partial correlations between bite force and salivary flow rates remained significant for unstimulated whole saliva (r 0. 10, p < 0. 05), <b>stimulated</b> parotid <b>saliva</b> (r 0. 13, p < 0. 02), and <b>stimulated</b> SMSL <b>saliva</b> (r = 0. 14, p < 0. 006). Subjects were divided into four groups based on their maximal bite force score (low, medium low, medium high, and high). For each saliva type, the flow rate of the high-bite-force group was significantly greater than that of the low-bite-force group {{as well as that of}} the medium-high-bite-force group. These results confirm an age-related decrease in bite force and salivary flow rates and show that, regardless of age or gender, bite force is correlated with salivary flow...|$|R
40|$|Up to present, plaque {{control is}} the most {{effective}} method to maintain oral hygiene. Using chewing gum after eating food and snacks can <b>stimulate</b> <b>saliva,</b> promote remineralization and reduce potential dental plaque. To know whether using chewing gum can reduce plaque index as good as toothbrushing, thus an experimental study was performed. Sample was the first grade of junior high school students. After selection according to the requirements, the sample size was 35 students. Each sample got two different treatments, In the first day, they used chewing gum and the next day they were instructed to brush their teeth. Before and after using chewing gum and toothbrushing their dental plaque was scored. The mean of plaque score before using chewing gum was 2. 24 and after using chewing gum was 1. 28, statistically {{there was a significant difference}} (t = 33 : df – 34; p< 0, 001). The mean of plaque score before toothbrushing was 2. 26 and after toothbrushing 1. 10, statistically there was a significant difference. Using chewing gum and toothbrushing can reduce plaque score, though the reduction of plaque score by toothbrushing was greater compared with using chewing gum. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the later oral consequences of chemotherapy on the oral health of children with emphasis on the cariological status and the major and minor salivary gland function. Method: Thirty-eight 12 -year-old children (mean age 12. 3 +/- 0. 58 years) who underwent chemotherapy were evaluated after 5 years of treatment. Forty age- and sex-matched healthy children with similar socioeconomic backgrounds served as controls. Subjects' cariological status was explained by the number of decayed, filled, missing permanent teeth (DMF-T), and unstimulated and <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> flow rates were measured by the spitting method. Palatal saliva flow rate using a Periotron meter (Oraflow Inc., Plainview, NY) and salivary buffer capacity using CRT buffer (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Lichtenstein) were also investigated. Results: Children who underwent chemotherapy had significantly more decayed teeth than healthy controls (3. 97 +/- 3. 58 vs 0. 84 +/- 1. 75, respectively, p < 0. 001). Recipients of chemotherapy had significantly lower <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> flow rate (0. 84 +/- 0. 35 vs 1. 13 +/- 0. 46 ml/min, p < 0. 05) compared to the controls. Palatal saliva flow rate was at the same time significantly higher in the test group compared to the controls (1. 64 +/- 0. 87 vs 0. 46 +/- 0. 32 ml/min/cm 2, respectively, p < 0. 001). High levels of buffer capacity of the saliva could be detected in a significantly higher prevalence in the patient group compared to the controls (high: 81. 6 % vs 40 %). Conclusions: According to these results, chemotherapy in children might result in a decreased <b>stimulated</b> whole <b>saliva</b> flow rate, hyposalivation, and, consequently, increased caries risk. Although these processes might be compensated to a limited extend by the increased minor saliva flow rate, resulting in a higher buffer capacity, nutrition and oral hygiene control of children obtaining cancer therapy is essential in the preservation of the oral tissues...|$|R
