40|$|Nonstationary {{stochastic}} {{periodic review}} inventory problems with proportional costs {{occur in a}} number of industrial settings with seasonal patterns, trends, business cycles, and limited life items. Myopic policies for such problems order as if the salvage value in the current period for ending inventory were the full purchase price, so that information about the future would not be needed. They have been shown in the literature to be optimal when demand "is increasing over time," and to provide upper bounds for the stationary finite horizon problem (and in some other situations). Some results are also known, given special salvaging assumptions, about lower bounds on the optimal policy which are near-myopic. Here analogous but stronger bounds are derived for the general finite horizon problem, without such special assumptions. The best upper bound is an extension of the heuristic used by industry for some years for end of season (EOS) problems; the lower bound is an extension of earlier analytic methods. Four heuristics were tested against the optimal obtained by stochastic dynamic programming for 969 problems. The simplest heuristic is the myopic heuristic itself: it is good especially for moderately varying problems without heavy end of season <b>salvage</b> <b>costs</b> and averages only 2. 75 % in cost over the optimal.

40|$|The pricing {{problem in}} a multi-period setting is a {{challenging}} problem and has attracted much attention in recent years. In this thesis, we consider a monopoly and an oligopoly pricing problem. In the latter, several sellers simultaneously seek an optimal pricing policy for their products. The products {{are assumed to be}} differentiated and substitutable. Each seller has the option to set prices for her products at each time period, and her goal is to find a pricing policy that will yield the maximum overall profit. Each seller has a fixed initial inventory of each product to be allocated over the entire time horizon and does not have the option to produce additional inventory between periods. There are no holding costs or back-order costs. In addition, the products are perishable and have no <b>salvage</b> <b>costs.</b> This means {{that at the end of}} the entire time horizon, any remaining products will be worthless. The demand function each seller faces for each product is uncertain and is affected by both the prices at the current period and past pricing history for her and her competitors. In this thesis, we address both the uncertain and the competitive aspect of the problem. First, we study the uncertain aspect of the {{problem in a}} simplified setting, where there is only one seller and two periods in the model. (cont.) We use ideas of robust optimization, adjustable robust optimization, dynamic programming and stochastic optimization to find adaptable closed loop pricing policies. Theoretical and numerical results show how the budget of uncertainty, the presence of a reference price, delayed resource allocation, and feedback control affect the quality of the pricing policies. Second, we extend the model to a multi-period setting, where the computation becomes a major issue. We use a delayed constraint generation method to significantly increase the size of the problem that our models can handle. Finally, we consider the pricing problem in an oligopoly setting. We show the existence of solution for both the best response subproblem and the market equilibrium problem for all of the models we discuss in the thesis. We also consider an iterative learning algorithm and illustrate through simulations that an equilibrium pricing policy can be computed for all of our models. by Lei Zhang. Thesis (S. M.)

In this setting we derive a base-line optimal order path, described by a simple newsvendor solution with safety stocks increasing towards the end of a review period. We then show that for the general, multi-period problem, the optimal policy in a period is to first arrive at this path by not ordering until the excess buffer stock from the previous review period is depleted, then follow the path by continuous ordering, and stop ordering towards the end to limit excess stocks for the next review period. An important managerial insight is that, typically, no order should be placed at a review moment, although this may seem intuitive and is also the standard assumption in periodic review models. We illustrate that adhering to the optimal ordering path instead can lead to cost reductions of 30 - 60 percent compared to pure periodic ordering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Liability {{insurance}} in claims disputes 1. Object of the Study Liability insurances have {{a central role}} in the control of damage and liability. Among other things, liability insurances have an effect on the cover of those suffering the damage, compensation norms and compensation practices. The liability for damages is also of special nature as an insurance risk, since it requires the acknowledgement of a normative legal relationship, i. e. liability for compensation. The developmental span of an insured event can be remarkably long and extend from the act which caused the damage to the res judicata award of damages. Despite the significance and the special nature of liability insurances, it has not been the subject of actual insurance law studies published in Finland. The purpose of this study is, for its own part, to make up for this deficiency. In particular, the study focuses on problems during the stage of filing insurance claims. The study investigates the relationship of the insurer and the insured from three different thematic perspectives, these being: 1) the legal repercussions and requirements of an insurer s claims settlement decision, 2) the insurer s right to control the insured event and 3) the distribution of expenses between the insurer and the insured. Each of these segments is divided into several individual legal questions, of which interpretational recommendations will be made. These more particularised questions will also be subjected to evaluations on how well the Finnish Insurance Contracts Act (ICA) accounts for the special characteristics of general liability insurances and how the established terms and conditions of insurance policies relate to the said Act s provisions. In spite of the focus on general liability insurance, this approach enables the evaluation of several questions of a general significance with regard to insurance law. The status of the damaged party will mainly be looked at only from the perspective of the mutual relationship between the insurer and the insured. The study s scope encompasses both corporate and consumer insurances. It will also take note of the terms and conditions prevalent in the industry and propose interpretational recommendations thereof. The following consists of a markedly simplified summary of this investigation s results. 2. An Insurance Company s Decision-making When deciding upon the payment of insurance compensation against liability insurance, the insurer usually has three options. It can either deny its liability for compensation based on the policy s limitation on liability, approve the claim and pay the settlement, or acknowledge the alleged liability of the insured to fall within the scope of the policy s coverage but deny liability for compensation on the grounds that the insured is not liable for damages. In the latter case, the insurer according to the terms and conditions of the policy is usually obligated to initiate investigations to clarify the insured s liability for damages. The decision-making of the insurer involves a number of issues with legal import, which are discussed in chapter 3. Pursuant to the provisions of section 70 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is obligated to initiate activities on behalf of the insured. The period of time is calculated on the basis of obtaining the clarification concerning the liability, meaning that settling the claims on behalf of the insured first is not required. The burden of proof is divided according to conventional compensation debt relations so that it is the obligation of the insured to prove that a liability for compensating a third party has arisen, and the obligation of the insurer to prove the grounds for limited liability possibly applicable to the case. In reality, the actual burden of proof concerning the insured s liability for damages in general liability insurances is usually borne by the party claiming damages. From the perspective of the insurer s and the insured's mutual relation, however, the burden of proof rests with the insured. The insurer despite the limitation on liability referred to in section 9 (2) of the Insurance Contracts Act can be found to be liable to compensate the damage, provided that the insured will be granted with a sufficient degree of trust regarding the settlement of claims. An effect of this kind may occur as a result of, e. g. the insurer s continued defence of the insured against the claim for damages while being aware of a limitation-of-liability factor possibly applicable to the case. The insurer is entitled to recover a compensation already paid only in exceptional cases. On the other hand, should such an entitlement arise, the insurer may not only be entitled to recover the actual compensation paid but the costs incurred in the insured s defence, regardless of whether the insurer s liability for costs was originally based on the provision concerning <b>salvage</b> <b>costs</b> as set forth in the Insurance Contracts Act (section 61) or the terms and conditions of the policy. The option of recovery may also arise as a consequence of the insured being found liable to compensate the insurer with the settlement which the latter has had to pay to the party claiming damages without cause. However, the usual prerequisite for recovery is that the insured has provided the insurer with misleading or incorrect information. In principle, the party suffering the damage is not liable to restore the compensation paid solely on the basis of an insurance coverage s inapplicability if the damaged party has been found to be entitled to the damages in the first place. 3. An Insurance Company s Right to Control an Insured Event A liability for compensation may arise through the long-term development of an insured event. This places emphasis on the insurer s need and its possibilities to participate in the control of an insured event in various ways. In practice, the insurer is always entitled to negotiate the compensation with the party claiming damages on the basis of the terms and conditions of the insurance and to take care of the legal proceedings on behalf of the insured. Nonetheless, an insurer s right to control the development of the insured event is often, all things considered, dependent on the interpretation of the norms of insurance law and, on an even wider scale, the definition of the relationship between the insurer and the insured. The purpose of chapter 4 is to evaluate issues relating to this. The problems surfacing in the chapter may have limited significance in connection with other types of insurance, in which the insurer is capable due to the development of the insurance risk of participating in the control of the insured event, in one way or another. The insured always has the ultimate right to decide its own status in a claims matter. The insurer, however, is, regardless of the terms and conditions of the policy, entitled to act on the insured s behalf without limitations even when the insured would be opposed to this, provided that the appropriate handling of the claims issue so demands. In accordance with section 32 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is entitled to give precautionary guidelines on how to prevent insured events. Should the insured not comply with such guidelines and the damage consequentially expand in scale, the insured will, as a rule, lose its right to compensation. However, in order to be considered binding, the insurer s guidelines must, in addition to being pertinent to the prevention of insured events, also be reasonably predictable as to their outcome. The commitment undertaken by the insurer on behalf of the insured and concerning the grounds for, or the amount of, compensation does not bind the insured, even to the extent of the deductible. Instead, in accordance with Finnish legal praxis (the Supreme Court 1990 : 12), the insured, with certain preconditions fulfilled, can become bound to a commitment concerning the insurer s procedures (the aforementioned ruling involved an extension of the time limit for the tort claim). According to typical insurance terms and conditions, the insurer is entitled to abandon further clarifications on a matter if it can come to agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid with the party suffering the damage, but the insured refuses to accept the settlement. Such terms and conditions also mean that the insurer s aggregate financial liability will be given a maximum limit. What these terms and conditions do not limit, however, is the insurer s liability in case the claim of the third party is clearly unjustified. The insurer nevertheless retains quite an extensive right, starting from the financial encumbrance brought on by legal proceedings, to make decisions as to the risks of litigation also in cases in which there is no certainty that the entered defence would be successful. The insurer s right to control the insured event requires that it receive information of the impending event at a sufficiently early time. However, section 73 of the Insurance Contracts Act does not stipulate that a claim be filed until a year from when the party entitled to compensation has become aware of such a right. The precise time of the commencement of the said period has been unclear with respect to liability insurance. This study recommends based on, inter alia, the judicial practice of the Insurance Complaints Board that the time be calculated from when the insured has become or should have become aware of its possible liability. The terms and conditions of general liability insurances which in practice require a more rapid notice than this are null and void when the Insurance Contracts Act is applied to them as statutory regulation. The terms and conditions determining the procedures of liability insurances, when considering their ultimate purpose, have to be viewed as the precautionary instructions referred to in section 31 of the Insurance Contracts Act. This also means that the insurer may decrease the compensation on the basis of the insured having neglected an obligation pursuant to these terms and conditions only if such negligence has caused damage. The insurer s right to represent the insured in an insurance compensation dispute may yield should the interests of the insurer and the insured be in clear conflict in the procedure. This can take place when, e. g. the insurer is also the claimant (due to, for instance, its right of recourse) or when the success of the claim demands circumstances which simultaneously translate into the application of the limitation of insurance coverage. Furthermore, a conflict of interest may be the consequence of, e. g. the insured having been the subject of other claims as well, the response to which is largely of no consequence or interest to the insurer. 4. The Distribution of Costs Defence against liability claims may result in substantial costs. Moreover, the usefulness of the costs is uncertain if the outcome of the claim is difficult to predict beforehand. Chapter 5 deals with questions relating to this. In particular, attention is given to the duty of salvage of the insured (section 32 of the Insurance Coverage Act) and the related norms concerning the insurer s liability for costs (section 61 of the said Act). As a starting point, the insured s right to receive compensation against <b>salvage</b> <b>costs</b> pursuant to section 61 of the Insurance Contracts Act includes a right to be compensated for legal expenses. According to the legal praxis, the insured s right to compensation also includes such costs which [...] when interpreted in the narrowest sense no longer have an effect on the prevention of liability risks, but which are nonetheless naturally connected to the action that removed the liability risk (Supreme Court 1997 : 51, which concerned costs incurred by the removal of contaminated soil). According to this, compensation is likely to include, for example, the legal costs of the counterparty. Based on the opinion presented in this study, the insured is entitled to full compensation even when the costs benefit responses other than merely the response provided to the grounds concerning the claim. As a principle, the insurer is liable only to the extent of the insured amount. However, according to section 61 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is responsible for <b>salvage</b> <b>costs</b> exceeding the insured amount. In corporate insurance, the insured amount usually also figures in the costs incurred in the defence against claims. The study proposes that the insurer also carry liability for such excesses of the insured amount which are the result of risk assumption where the insurer has been the sole beneficiary. A situation of the kind may surface, e. g. when the insurer upon exercising its decision-making powers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the insurance contract disputes a draft settlement of the counterparty that has been within the limits of the insured amount, due to which the insured amount is exceeded in the resulting legal proceedings. The liability of the insurer includes the excess of insured amounts resulting from both the extension of a claim and legal expenses. 5. Finally In the context of the Insurance Contracts Act, general liability insurances have been observed largely by regulating the status of the damaged party. From the perspective of the questions studied, however, it can be noted that many issues having an impact on the liability of the insurer and the insured are significant in various ways and that they also have a bearing on the status of the damaged party. In fact, it is a result of the insurance practice that the settings of the claims-phase are often very similar, regardless of whether the procedure is based on a notice filed by the insured itself or on a claim against the insurer filed directly by the damaged party, as set forth in sections 67 or 68 of the Insurance Contracts Act. The Insurance Contracts Act does not contain provisions on all the issues significant from the point of view of general liability insurances. Even to the extent that the Insurance Contracts Act offers a solution to a particular question, the provisions have clearly not been drawn up with situations typical to liability insurances in mind. However, this may not lead to serious problems if the systematics of the Insurance Contracts Act provides sufficient room for insurance type specific interpretations. Some exceptions notwithstanding, the Insurance Contracts Act fulfils this requirement. On the other hand, reasonable interpretations demand that the claim, as an insured event, not be tied down to a single criterion or moment, but that the characteristics of an insurance risk are evaluated separately through the perspective of each norm s objective. Typical insurance terms and conditions largely follow the provisions of the Insurance Contracts Act. However, the terms and conditions pertaining to statutory notifications concerning the insured event may lead to the insured s obligation to disclose arising too rapidly from the perspective of the Insurance Contracts Act. The fundamental problem herein, however, lies rather in the law than in the terms and conditions of insurance contracts, of which the premises are largely understandable.

Analysis of large numbers of tissue samples, improved tissue <b>salvage,</b> <b>cost</b> reduction, ease of interpretation, and significant time saving were realized by using the arrays. Material and Methods: Two-hundred and eighty cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma were arrayed. Immunohis-tochemical stains of TMA sections were performed for survivin, bcl- 2, and p 53. Cases were followed up for 5 years. Results: Survivin was detected in 147 of 230 cases (63. 9 %). No expression of survivin was observed in normal tissues. There was no correlation between survivin immu-noreactivity and age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, histo-pathologic subtype, tumor grade and clinical stage (p> 0. 05). Prevalence of survivin expression was significantly higher in bcl- 2 positive than in bcl- 2 negative cases (88. 1 % versus 42. 1 %, p< 0. 0001), but was not associated with p 53 (p= 0. 09). The 5 -year disease free survival (DFS) for patients with survivin positive colorectal adenocarcinoma was significantly lower than that for patients with survivin negative tumors (46 % versus 68. 7 %, p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Survivin expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma provides an important prognostic param-eter and targeted antagonists of survivin may be beneficial as apoptosis-based therapy for colon cancer...|$|R

40|$|Colonies of Apis florea, {{which only}} abscond a short distance, usually return to salvage old nest wax; but, those colonies, {{and all other}} {{honeybee}} species which go considerably further, do not. Wax salvage would clearly be counter-productive unless the energy input/energy yield threshold was a profitable one. There are two possible trade-offs in this scenario, the trade-off between the energy expended to recover the wax (recovering hypothesis) as against that of replacing the wax by new secretion (replacing hypothesis). In order to compare the two hypotheses, the fuel <b>costs</b> involved in <b>salvaging</b> wax on one return trip, the average flower handling time, flight time and relative values for substituting the salvaged wax with nectar were calculated. Moreover, the energy value of the wax was determined. Net energy gains for salvaged wax were calculated. The energy value of the salvaged wax was 42. 7 J/mg, thus too high to be the limiting factor since <b>salvaging</b> <b>costs</b> are only 642. 76 mJ/mg (recovering hypothesis). The recovery costs (642. 76 mJ/mg) only fall below the replacement costs for absconding distance below 115 m thus supporting the replacing hypothesis. This energetic trade-off between replacing and recycling plus the small absconding range of A. florea might explain why A. florea is probably the only honeybee species known to salvage wax and it parsimoniously explains the underlying reasons why A. florea only salvages wax from the old nest if the new nesting site is less than 100 – 200 m away—energetically, it pays off to recycle.

The first shelf is for normal sales shelf and includes a number of single items. The second shelf is for sales promotion and consists of multiple items. We show that there exists an optimal policy so as to minimize the expected total cost for N items consisting of a general convex inventory or <b>salvage</b> and penalty <b>cost</b> functions. We also explore an optimal ordering policy of a finite horizon inventory model with a sales promotion shelf capacity constraint under the newsboy problem setting...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Randomness is {{a common}} and yet quite an {{expensive}} challenge that every manufacturing and marketing system faces. In this research we focus on products for which the malfunction likelihood of the production outputs are not independent of one another, such as flu vaccine and semiconductors. Production has random yield that is interpreted as {{the ratio of the}} faultless items in a production batch. We also assume that these products have a limited marketing season, suggesting the news-vendor model with randomness on the supply side is an outstanding platform to analyze the production and marketing processes of such products. Our base model studies a single manufacturer present in a single market, where the manufacturer dynamically selects the production commitment and the price {{at the beginning of the}} production season and marketing season, accordingly. Also, we assume that demand is deterministic but price dependent. For strategically important products such as the flu vaccine, the government may find it necessary to intervene in the pricing or manufacturing process in order to coordinate the market. The need for coordinating the market may also be met by other consumer interest groups such as distribution channel owners, think-tanks or policy making agencies. We incorporate the presence of a social planner in our model by studying the centralized case and the socially optimum production commitment and pricing schema. The challenge is to find contracts that can set the conditions for the manufacturer in a way that his optimum production and pricing policy is exactly the same as the one of the social planner. Our study introduces three contracts that can coordinate the market. In the second phase of this research, we study the same problem for the cases where there are two symmetrical manufacturers with inter-dependent demands. By the third phase, we study the case with one manufacturer who has the option to provide the product to two different markets with different characteristics. Our study shows that production commitment is smaller if there is no randomness and the yield ratio is known. We also show that the production commitment of the centralized setting can be either less or more than the production commitment of the decentralized setting, depending on the <b>salvage</b> <b>cost.</b> Numerical analysis, managerial insights, and conclusions are presented at the end of each chapter...|$|R

This problem involves capital cost, scrap value or <b>salvage</b> value, maintenance <b>cost</b> or operating cost, and rate of interest having an imprecise value. Here, we assume the imprecise values as positive trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Moreover, we consider {{that the value of}} money changes with fuzzy rate of interest due to market fluctuations. To deal with this type of problem, we first find out the present worth value of money and then determine the fuzzy annualized costs. By using Yager’s ranking method, comparison of fuzzy annualized costs is done to obtain an optimal replacement policy. Numerical example is provided to check the validity of the proposed method...|$|R
