5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park <b>service</b> <b>facilities.</b> Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{survey of}} the {{understanding}} about Health <b>Services</b> <b>Facility</b> for the Elderly was performed among medical staffs (doctors and nurses) in Yamaguchi Prefecture in order to expand its effective use. The results were as follows: 1) They knew Health <b>Services</b> <b>Facility</b> for the Elderly, but the understanding about {{its role in the}} medicine was not enough. 2) Medical staffs who were working in the field of senior medicine and psychosomatic medicine had comparatively enough understanding to Health <b>Services</b> <b>Facility</b> for the Elderly. 3) Medical staffs who were working in the general hospital had only a little understanding to Health <b>Services</b> <b>Facility</b> for the Elderly. 4) The ratios of medical staffs who were willing to use Health <b>Services</b> <b>Facility</b> for the Elderly were only 20 - 30 %. It was suggested that the education to medical staffs was necessary to performe the effective and practical use of Health <b>Services</b> <b>Facility</b> for the Elderly...|$|R

5|$|The royal {{rooms were}} {{positioned}} {{on the first}} floor of a range of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained <b>service</b> <b>facilities,</b> with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally similar to that of the 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.|$|E
5|$|The trend had {{substantial}} {{implications for}} many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail {{was removed from}} the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new <b>service</b> <b>facilities.</b> Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as upmarket housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle hugs a rocky coastal {{ridge of}} grey {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{and much of}} the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared. The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an inner and outer ward, with four large towers on each side. The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat. Conwy's outer ward was originally crowded with administrative and service buildings. The inner ward was separated from the outer by a wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. Inside, it contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and <b>service</b> <b>facilities.</b> On {{the east side of the}} inner ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th century, {{the castle}} became {{increasingly}} valued for its hunting facilities {{rather than its}} military defences. It fell into disrepair and, despite {{the construction of new}} living quarters and <b>service</b> <b>facilities,</b> {{by the middle of the}} 16th century it was derelict. Henry VIII sold the property to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the castle buildings were demolished. It was not until the 19th century, when Mary and Fulke Greville Howard inherited the property, that the castle was renovated and restored. Victorian scholars examined the site, and it was opened to the public. In 1958 the castle passed into the custody of the state, which carried out further stabilisation work and a programme of archaeological investigation. In 1998 English Heritage passed the management of the site back to its current owner, Baron Howard of Rising, who continues to operate the castle as a tourist attraction.|$|E

25|$|The revolt was {{initiated}} by the ratings of the Royal Indian Navy on 18 February 1946.

25|$|Terminal 1 is {{the main}} {{building}} and features large landside and airside areas containing several shops and <b>service</b> <b>facilities.</b> It consists of two check-in halls, the older one containing 13 desks (1–13), and the newer one housing 68 desks (37–89 and 90–106). The joint departures area features 29 gates, {{most of which are}} equipped with jet-bridges, with 7 of them designated to non-Schengen destinations. As the airport features several more apron stands, bus boarding is also frequently used here. Most airlines use Terminal 1, including TAP Air Portugal and its Star Alliance partners.|$|E

25|$|Owing to its {{proximity}} to central London and its location in the London Docklands area, London City Airport is small compared with several other airports serving London, such as Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted or Luton. The airport features one single, two-storey passenger terminal building. The ground floor contains the check-in desks and some <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> {{as well as a}} staircase leading to the security control on the upper level after which the airside waiting area and several more shops can be found. The waiting area is connected to piers on both sides where corridors on the upper floor lead to the departure gates on the ground level. As the airport has no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used on all stands.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistan {{high command}} was {{fully aware that}} the IAF {{considerably}} outnumbered the PAF eastern detachment, and that they held the qualitative edge {{as well in the}} eastern theater. Pakistani planners had anticipated the PAF being neutralized within 24 hours of the IAF commencing combat operations over East Pakistan. There was only one fully functional, extended combat-capable airbase (at Tejgaon near Dhaka) in all of East Pakistan, as all satellite air bases lacked the <b>service</b> <b>facilities</b> for sustaining prolonged operations. The PAF had plans to deploy a squadron of Shenyang F-6 planes at Kurmitola (now Shahjalal International Airport) in 1971. These planes were temporarily deployed but ultimately withdrawn because, although the runway was functional at that base, the base was not fully functional enough to support the planes, and the lack of infrastructure meant PAF could not deploy any additional planes. This marginalization and neglect of East Pakistani defenses since 1948 had hamstrung the PAF Eastern contingent in 1971, when its capabilities were put to the test.|$|E
