Using this method, we are able to rapidly measure heat discharge rates without the need for specialized apparatus. Applying Ice Box Calorimetry to the Nishiyama <b>steaming</b> <b>ground</b> at Usu volcano, Japan in September 2006, we identified local variations in heat discharge rates. The total heat discharged from the entire geothermal area in September 2006 is estimated to be 27 MW, which represents just 1 % of the rate immediately following an eruption from the volcano in 2000.|$|E

The method of X-rays diffraction is supplied to these samples bacause they show that the upper stratum of forty meters in thickness which rests on unaltered andesite have been almost perfectly altered by geothermal activity. The result makes it possible to distinguish two layers in the altered zone, one of which is called the Montmorillonite layer and the other of which is known as the Kaoline layer. The former layer is limited to the lower side of the cliff only and occupies relatively deeper region. Temperature in this layer is considerably high and some of the holes tapping this discharge steam. In contrast, temperature in the Kaoline layer is rather low and becomes lower higher up the slope of the cliff. This agreement between distributions of ground temperature and clay minerals supports the theory that water infiltration through a Kaoline layer changes the stratum more permeably by acid alteration under hydro-thermal condition, and the temperature in the Montmorillonite layer which is occupied by steam is gradually reduced so that the layer becomes saturated by liquid water. It is assumed that such a process of reducing <b>steaming</b> <b>ground</b> may be applied to the problem as to how the area controled only by volcanic heat in ancient times has changed to the present hydrothermal system separating recharge and discharge zones as studied in the usual hot spring districts. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} self-potential (SP) profiling or mapping {{in three}} volcanic fields, Rishiri (northern Hokkaido), Kusatsu-Shirane (central Honshu) and White Island (northern New Zealand). The SP profile {{on the western}} flank of Rishiri volcano showed a remarkable high in the summit side, {{which is similar to}} many other active volcanoes. Assuming a negative ζ-potential, it is likely that Rishiri volcano has a large hydrothermal circulation system, and therefore still has enough thermal energy to maintain this circulation. Kusatsu-Shirane volcano inversely showed a decreasing trend toward the summit. It is a contradictive result to the previous knowledge that a volcano with remarkable hydrothermal system shows negative SP on the top. We suspect that the low pH of ground water in this area makes ζ-potential null or positive, resulting in the reversed surface SP profile to ordinary cases. This idea should be examined by laboratory experiments in the future. In the Main Crater of White Island volcano, we found some small-scale anomalous patches associated with fumaroles and <b>steaming</b> <b>ground.</b> The small variability of SP is probably attributed to the very low resistivity of the ground. 1...|$|E

The acidic water samples with pH of about 2, which come from a <b>steaming</b> <b>ground</b> and are discharging near the summit of Mt. Muayat, are identified to have a water chemistry of SO 4 type.

40|$|We {{estimate}} heat-discharge {{rates for}} a geothermal area formed during the 2000 eruption of Usu volcano, Japan. Field observations {{carried out in}} September 2006 reveal that heat-discharge rates from fumaroles, areas of steaming grounds and crater lakes are 8, 9. 2, and 2 MW, respectively. The total heat-discharge rate measured in September 2006 represents just 1 % of the rate immediately following the eruption. Integration of the heat-discharge rate from April 2000 to September 2006 yields an accumulated discharge of approximately 2. 3 × 10 ^[16]J, equating to the cooling of 8 × 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 of magma.

The reservoir is hosted in a volcanic environment comprises of tuff breccias with minor andesite lavas, and quartz diorite intrusions.

One hundred and eighty magnetotelluric (MT) stations recorded in 1996 and 1997 {{were used to assess}} the clay cap extension. One-dimensional MT interpretations were performed. A north-south MT profile crossing the entire field was chosen to show the extent of the possible resources. The profile shows a very thick conductive layer (1 - 10 Ω m) extending 7 km northward from the Bodas Crater. The thickness of the conductive layer is about 1000 - 1200 m having a base at about 200 - 300 meters above sea level. Between 7 - 12 km north of the crater the layer thins (to 700 m), and the resistivity increases slightly to 14 Ω m.

Analysis of the waters for anion, cation and stable isotope composition shows that the waters discharging at the surface fall into two groups (see Table). Reoka type fluids have the high sulfate, low pH, and enriched δ 18 O and δD values typical of steam heated acid sulfate waters, where shallow groundwater is heated by rising steam and gas. Isotopically light H 2 S is oxidised in the near surface environment to produce the sulfate content. Rembokola type fluids have chemistry distinct from the Reoka type fluids, despite the two being found within close proximity (&# 60; 10  m). Rembokola Type fluids produce a carbonate sinter, so {{are assumed to be}} saturated with bicarbonate. The aqueous sulfate has heavy δ 34 S, suggesting that it is not exclusively produced by the oxidation of H 2 S in the near surface environment. We suggest that condensation of volcanic gases (including CO 2 and isotopically heavy SO 2) into meteoric-derived groundwater in the upper levels of the volcanic edifice produces these carbonate–sulfate waters.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to provide more {{information}} on the fumarolic vs. diffusive contribution to the hydrothermal CO 2 output. Our test site is Furnas volcano, a quiescent polygenetic volcano located {{in the eastern part of}} São Miguel island, in the Azores, an archipelago of nine volcanic islands located in the North Atlantic Ocean at the triple junction between American, Eurasian, and Nubian plates (Searle 1980). Furnas volcano has frequently been active in the Holocene (the oldest volcanic products are dated back 100, 000  years BP; Moore 1990). The last “magmatic” eruption occurred in 1630 (Cole et al. 1995). In recent times, hydrothermal explosions have re-occurred (in 1840 – 1841, 1944, and 1990) from the hydrothermal vent (named “Asmodeu”) belonging to the Furnas Village fumarolic field (Ferreira, T: Contribuição para o estudo das emanações gasosas associadas a processos de vulcanismo no arquipélago dos Açores, unpublished Master thesis). Hydrothermal activity is widespread on the island and includes soil diffuse degassing areas (Ferreira et al. 2005; Viveiros et al. 2010), <b>steaming</b> <b>ground,</b> thermal springs, cold CO 2 -rich springs, and low-temperature fumaroles (95 – 100  °C), mostly concentrated inside the Furnas caldera (where three main fumarolic fields are observed; Viveiros et al. 2010; Caliro et al. 2015). Further studies have been done since the early nineties to study CO 2 diffuse emissions. The first soil CO 2 surveys (Baubron et al. 1994; Baxter et al. 1999) in the Furnas caldera identified a CO 2 degassing area in the proximity of Furnas village. Recently, Viveiros et al. (2010, 2012) estimated the soil CO 2 fluxes emitted from the Furnas volcanic system using the accumulation chamber method (Chiodini et al. 1998); this led to identifying the presence of several diffuse degassing structures (DDS). The diffuse hydrothermal-volcanic CO 2 output from Furnas volcano (Furnas caldera and the southern Ribeira Quente village area) was estimated at ~ 968  t day− 1 (Viveiros et al. 2010), and the groundwater CO 2 transport was evaluated at ~ 12  t day− 1 (Cruz et al. 1999).

40|$|The volcano–hydrothermal {{system of}} El Chichón volcano, Chiapas, Mexico, is {{characterized}} by numerous thermal manifestations including an acid lake, steam vents and boiling springs in the crater and acid and neutral hot springs and <b>steaming</b> <b>ground</b> on the flanks. Previous research on major element chemistry reveals that thermal waters of El Chichón can be divided in two groups: (1) neutral waters discharging in the crater and southern slopes of the volcano with chloride content ranging from 1500 to 2200 mg/l and (2) acid-toneutral waters with Cl up to 12, 000 mg/l discharging at the western slopes. Our work supports the concept that each group of waters is derived from a separate aquifer (Aq. 1 and Aq. 2). In this study we apply Sr isotopes, Ca/Sr ratios and REE abundances along with the major and trace element water chemistry in order to discriminate and characterize these two aquifers. Waters derived from Aq. 1 are characterized by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios ranging from 0. 70407 to 0. 70419, while Sr concentrations range from 0. 1 to 4 mg/l and Ca/Sr weight ratios from 90 to 180, close to average values for the erupted rocks. Waters derived from Aq. 2 have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr between 0. 70531 and 0. 70542, high Sr concentrations up to 80 mg/l, and Ca/Sr ratio of 17 – 28. Aquifer 1 is most probably shallow, composed of volcanic rocks and situated beneath the crater, within the volcano edifice. Aquifer 2 may be situated at greater depth in sedimentary rocks and by some way connected to the regional oil-gas field brines. The relative water output (l/s) from both aquifers can be estimated as Aq. 1 /Aq. 2 – 30. Both aquifers are not distinguishable by their REE patterns. The total concentration of REE, however, strongly depends on the acidity. All neutral waters including high-salinity waters from Aq. 2 have very low total REE concentrations (b 0. 6 μg/l) and are characterized by a depletion in LREE relative to El Chichón volcanic rock, while acid waters from the crater lake (Aq. 1) and acid AS springs (Aq. 2) have parallel profile with total REE concentration from 9 to 98 μg/l. The highest REE concentration (207 μg/l) is observed in slightly acid shallow cold Ca-SO 4 ground waters draining fresh and old pyroclastic deposits rich in magmatic anhydrite. It is suggested that the main mechanism controlling the concentration of REE in waters of El Chichón is the acidity. As low pH results from the shallow oxidation of H 2 S contained in hydrothermal vapors, REE distribution in thermal waters reflects the dissolution of volcanic rocks {{close to the surface}} or lake sediments as is the case for the crater lake...|$|E
40|$|After water vapour, CO₂ is {{the most}} {{abundant}} gas associated with magmatic hydrothermal systems. The detection of anomalous soil temperature gradients, and/or a significant flux of magmatic volatiles, is commonly the only surface signature of an underlying high temperature reservoir. For both heat (as water vapour) and gas to ascend to the surface, structural permeability must exist, as the unmodified bulk permeability of reservoir rock is too low to generate the focussed fluid flow typical of magmatic hydrothermal systems. This thesis reports {{the investigation into the}} surface heat and mass flow of the Ohaaki hydrothermal field using detailed surface measurements of CO₂ flux and heat flow. Detailed surface measurements form the basis of geostatistical models that quantify and depict the spatial variability of surface heat and mass flow, across the surface of both major thermal areas, as high resolution pixel plots. These maps, in conjunction with earlier heat and mass flow studies, enable: (i) estimates of the pre-production and current CO₂ emissions and heat flow for the Ohaaki Field; (ii) interpretation of the shallow permeability structures governing fluid flow, and; (iii) the spatial relationships between pressure-induced ground subsidence and permeability. Heat flow and CO₂ flux surveys indicate that at Ohaaki the soil zone is the dominant (≥ 70 % and up to 99 %) pathway of heat and mass release to the atmosphere from the underlying hydrothermal reservoir. Modelling indicates that although the total surface heat and mass flow at Ohaaki is small, it is highly focused (i. e., high volume per unit area) relative to other fields within the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). Normalised CO₂ emissions are comparable to other volcanic and hydrothermal fields both regionally and globally. Despite 20 years of production, there is little difference between pre-production and current CO₂ emission rates. However, the similarity of CO₂ emission rates masks a 40 % increase in CO₂ emissions from new areas of intense <b>steaming</b> <b>ground</b> that have developed in response to production of the field for electrical energy production. This increase in thermal ground emissions is offset by emission losses associated with the drying up of all steam heated pools and alkali-Cl outflows from the Ohaaki West (OHW) thermal area, in response to production-induced pressure decline. The location of surface thermal areas is governed by the occurrence of buried or partially emergent lava domes, whereas the magnitude of CO₂ flux, mass flow, and heat flow occurring within each thermal area is determined by the proximity of each dome (thermal areas) to major upflow zones. Buried or partially emergent silicic lava domes act as cross-stratal pathways for fluid flow, connecting the underlying reservoir to the surface, and bypassing several hundred metres of the poorly permeable Huka Falls Formation (HFF) caprock. For each dome complex the permeable structures governing fluid flow are varied. At Ohaaki West, thermal activity is controlled by a deep-rooted concentric fracture zone, developed during eruption of the Ohaaki Rhyolite dome. Within the steam-heated Ohaaki East (OHE) thermal area, flow is controlled by a high permeability fault damage zone (Broadlands Fault) developed within the apex of the Broadlands Dacite dome. Structures controlling alkali-Cl fluid flow at OHW also iii appear to control the occurrence and shape of major subsidence bowls (e. g., the Main Ohaaki Subsidence Bowl), the propagation of pressure decline to surface, and the development and localization of pore fluid drainage. Across the remainder of the Ohaaki field low amplitude ground subsidence is controlled by the extent of aquifer and aquitard units that underlie the HFF, and proximity to the margins of the hot water reservoir. The correlation between the extent of low amplitude ground subsidence and the margins of the field reflects the coupled relationship between the hot water reservoir and reservoir pressure. Only where thick vapour-phase zones buffer the vertical propagation of deep-seated pressure decline to the surface (i. e., OHE thermal area), is ground subsidence not correlated with subvertical structural permeability developed within the HFF. This thesis makes contributions to regional and global research on geothermal and hydrothermal systems by: (i) quantifying the origin, mass, and upward transport of magmatic carbon from geothermal reservoirs; (ii) assessing the changes to the natural surface heat and mass flow of the Ohaaki Field following 20 years of production; (iii) establishing the utility of surface CO₂ flux and heat flow surveys to identify major upflow zones, estimate minimum mass flow, and determine the enthalpy of reservoirs; (iv) providing insight into the hydrothermal, structural and lithological controls over hydrothermal fluid flow; (v) demonstrating the influence of extinct silicic lava domes as important structural elements in the localisation of hydrothermal fluid flow; (vi) identifying the hydrostructural controls governing the spatial variability in the magnitude of pressure-induced ground subsidence, from which predictive models of subsidence risk may be defined, and; (vii) developing new technologies and characterising methods used for detailed assessment of surface heat and mass flow...|$|E
40|$|In two feeding trials, {{the use of}} whey, <b>steam</b> rolled or <b>ground</b> oats, {{fishmeal}} or {{meat and}} bone scraps in starter diets for the weaned pig was evaluated. In Trial I, pigs fed the basal corn-soybean meal diet gained 5 % slower than pigs fed diets containing 8. 75 % whey, with either 8. 75 % <b>steam</b> rolled or <b>ground</b> oats and 2. 5 % fishmeal or meat and bone scraps. The pounds of feed required per pound of gain were similar for all diets, resulting in the cheapest gain with the corn-soybean meal basal diet. In Trial II, 192 lighter pigs were used (13 to 24 lbs., initial weight) with similar results. No significant difference was observed in rate of gain, average daily feed intake, or feed efficiency when whey, <b>steamed</b> rolled or <b>ground</b> oats, or fishmeal or meat and bone scraps {{were added to the}} basal ration. All diets contained approximately 17. 5 % crude protein, 1. 08 % lysine,. 88 % calcium, and. 75 % phosphorus. No beneficial effect seemingly is gained using more expensive feedstuffs (steam rolled oats and fishmeal) than more common feeds (ground oats and meat and bone scraps). The cheapest feed. cost per lb. of gain in both trials was observed with the basal corn-soybean meal fortified diet...|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of steam cooking {{have been found in}} Cochise County, Arizona, where steam pits were used for cooking about 10,000 years ago. [...] In China's Yellow River Valley, early steam cookers made of stoneware have been found dating back as far as 5000 BCE. From the eighth century CE, thin cypress strips were used to make steamers; today they are constructed from bamboo with slatted bases. The classic steamer has a chimney in the center, which distributes the steam among the tiers.In Western cooking, steaming is most often used to cook vegetablesit is rarely used to cook meats. However, steamed clams are prepared by steaming. With Chinese cuisine, vegetables are usually stir fried or blanched and seldom steamed. Seafood and meat dishes are steamed. For example: steamed whole fish, steamed crab, steamed pork spare ribs, <b>steamed</b> <b>ground</b> pork or beef, steamed chicken and steamed goose. Rice can be steamed too, although in Chinese cooking this is simply referred to as [...] "cooking" [...] rather than [...] "steaming". In Thailand steaming is the definition of minimalist cooking. Steaming fish in Thai-style gently cooks the fish until just tender. Wheat foods are steamed as well. Examples include buns and Chinese steamed cakes.|$|R
