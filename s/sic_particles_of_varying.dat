ABSTRACT: The indentation hardness of Al-SiCp metal-matrix composites synthesized by stir casting process was investigated. Stir casting method {{was selected as the}} casting method due to its simplicity, flexibility and applicability. This method allows a conventional metal processing route to be used which minimizes the cost of the product. The silicon carbide particles to be used were first ball milled for size reduction. These particles were then sieved in a mechanical shaker to obtain different <b>particle</b> sizes. <b>SiC</b> <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> size 74 µm corresponding to mesh 200 were selected for addition to the Al matrix. The composite was prepared by adding preheated <b>SiC</b> <b>particles</b> to the Aluminium melt via stir casting. Test specimens were prepared by varying the wt % of SiC (1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 % and 9 %). As the SiCp additions were increased, the hardness of the composite increased to a large extent.

40|$|In the {{photovoltaics}} industry, {{the largest}} market share {{is represented by}} solar cells made from multicrystalline silicon, which is grown by directional solidification. During the growth process, the silicon melt is {{in contact with the}} silicon nitride coated crucible walls and the furnace atmosphere which contains carbon monoxide. The dissolution of the crucible coating, the carbon bearing gas, and the carbon already present in the feedstock, lead to the precipitation of silicon carbide, and silicon nitride, at later stages of the growth process. The precipitation of Si 3 N 4 and <b>SiC</b> <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> up to several hundred micrometers in diameter leads to severe problems during the wire sawing process for wafering the ingots. Furthermore the growth of the silicon grains can be negatively influenced by the presence <b>of</b> <b>particles,</b> which act as nucleation sources and lead to a grit structure of small grains and are sources for dislocations. If doped with Nitrogen from the dissolved crucible coating, SiC is a semi conductive material, and can act as a shunt, short circuiting parts of the solar cell. For these reasons, the incorporation <b>of</b> such <b>particles</b> needs to be avoided. In this contribution we performed model experiments in which the transport <b>of</b> intentionally added <b>SiC</b> <b>particles</b> and their interaction with the solid-liquid interface during float zone growth of silicon in strong steady magnetic fields was investigated. <b>SiC</b> <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> 7 m and 60 m size are placed in single crystal silicon [100] and [111] rods of 8 mm diameter. This is achieved by drilling a hole of 2 mm diameter, filling in the particles and closing the hole by melting the surface of the rod until a film of silicon covers the hole. The samples are processed under a vacuum of 1 x 10 (exp - 5) mbar or better, to prevent gas inclusions. An oxide layer to suppress Marangoni convection is applied by wet oxidation.
