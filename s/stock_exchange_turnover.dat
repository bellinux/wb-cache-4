40|$|Problem: An {{efficient}} market fully reflects all available {{information about a}} company in its share price. Furthermore any new information presented about a company will lead to an instant adaptation in the share price. Henceforth an investor can not reach abnormal returns on an {{efficient market}}. The Stockholm <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> is afairly large <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> with a <b>turnover</b> of SEK 14000 millions per day. Prior studies conducted regarding {{the efficiency of the}} Stockholm <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> have stated that the <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> was efficient on a semistrong level. However these studies were conducted with a time frame of several weeks and therefore the authors distinguished a need for a study aiming at short term efficiency. Furthermore this thesis aims to investigate the effects of the presentation of positive annual and interim reports. A positive report is defined as a report that leads to an increase in share price the day it is presented and consequently includes all events {{on the day of the}} presentation, e. g. the press conference. The thesis was written from an investors’ perspective, who is about to buy shares. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to describe and analyze the Stockholm <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> market’s efficiency. This was done during the days surrounding the presentation of annual and interim reports rendering an increase in share price. Furthermore the possibilities of making abnormal returns by buying shares during this period were investigated. Method: To investigate the efficiency of the Stockholm <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> an event study was carried out. Data regarding the performance of the shares of the fifteen most traded com-panies on the Stockholm <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> were collected from the OMX groups’ homepage. The chosen companies together represented more than fifty percent of the turnover of the OMXS 30 index. The index was used as a benchmark for measuring the efficiency. The share price movement was analyzed with a quantitative approach through a statistical T-test with the assistance of the SPSS 13. 0. Result: The authors claim that the Stockholm <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> is not efficient on a semistrong level the day after the presentation of a positive report, as the shares displayed a negative abnormal deviation from the OMXS 30 index. The deviation was statistically verified. However the authors state that no abnormal returns can be reached by buying shares during this period since the deviation was negative. The period as a whole and the other tested days came out as efficient on a semi-strong level...|$|R
40|$|In Bangladesh, {{primary and}} {{secondary}} mutual fund markets behave {{in a completely different}} way, where initial public offering (IPO) investors of mutual funds earn more than 250 percent rerun, whereas secondary market investors cannot even manage to cover the opportunity cost of their investment. There are few other abnormalities present in this market – unlike everywhere in the world, most of the mutual funds are closed-end (92 percent) and closed-end mutual funds are barred to issue bonus or right shares. A total of 714 day’s observations, from January 2008 to December 2010, of four variables– DSE (Dhaka <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange)</b> general index return, DSE general index turnover, mutual funds’ return and mutual funds’ turnover– are utilized. Stationarity of the variables are tested with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test and found that variables are in different order of integration. Long-term equilibrium relationships among the variables are tested with Johansen cointegration and it is found that DSE general index return and mutual funds’ return are cointegrated. Toda-Yamamoto (TY) version of granger non-causality test is employed and bidirectional causality is found moving from DSE (Dhaka <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange)</b> general index <b>turnover</b> to DSE general index return, whereas unidirectional causality is found moving from mutual fund’s return to DSE general index return, mutual funds’ return to mutual funds turnover, and DSE general index turnover to mutual funds turnover.
