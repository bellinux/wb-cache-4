50|$|The Lodge {{includes}} a common lobby, dining spaces and a recreation hall, known as Geyser Hall, of log {{construction in the}} National Park Service Rustic style. The roof structure of the 136 ft by 100 ft Geyser Hall is reminiscent of Gothic wood construction, with a height of 73 ft to the ridge. The hall is arranged with a central nave-like structure, with <b>subsidiary</b> <b>side</b> aisles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{need for}} a {{separate}} parliament building for Northern Ireland emerged {{with the creation of}} the Northern Ireland Home Rule region within Ulster in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Pending the construction of the new building, Parliament met in two locations, in Belfast City Hall, where the state opening of the first Parliament by King George V took place in on 22 June 1921, and in the nearby Presbyterian Church in Ireland's Assembly's College. In 1922, preparatory work on the chosen site, east of Belfast, began. The original plans for a large domed building with two <b>subsidiary</b> <b>side</b> buildings, housing all three branches of government - legislative, executive and judicial - gave rise to the plural in the official title still used today. Alongside the parliament and [...] "Ministerial Building" [...] the site would have been host to the Northern Ireland High Court.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Easley {{settled at}} the site of Freeport circa 1804 after {{migrating}} from Virginia. The date at which he built the house is unknown, although it was certainly no later than 1820. Later in life, Easley journeyed farther west and established the city of Freeport in Stephenson County, Illinois. Before leaving, he sold his home to the family of John Reaves, who gained a posthumous {{reputation as one of the}} village's significant early residents. As a civilian, he was among Harrison County's earliest teachers, and villagers honored him as the first Harrison County resident to die in the war of the rebellion; he was even the first man in the village to enlist after the fall of Fort Sumter. Reaves' home is a small brick building with a central entrance on the facade, as well as a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>side</b> door. The building is one and one-half stories tall, resting on a stone foundation, with walls that rise to side-facing gables topped with chimneys. [...] Following Reaves' death, the house was converted into a commercial building; by 1888, it had become home to Freeport's first bank. In later years, it was later given to village officials, who employed it as the village hall and as a museum. It has since become a library, the Clark Memorial branch of the Cadiz-based Puskarich Public Library.|$|R
50|$|Tenerife {{suffered}} from serious economic {{problems in the}} following years, owing more than €40 million. President Pérez was replaced with Víctor Perez de Ascanio, who resigned due to bad management, leaving his position to Miguel Concepción, who negotiated with local politicians and businessmen, also creating a construction company as a <b>subsidiary</b> of the <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|The company {{continued}} to make engines until 1927, when it was sold to Fulton Iron Works of St Louis, Missouri. George Foos, John's son, was the company president at the time. John had died in 1908. Fulton continued making Foos engines in Springfield until 1942. They then transferred the engine-making to St Louis. Fulton's are now a <b>subsidiary</b> of South <b>Side</b> Machine Works.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The paper {{seeks to}} explain the {{collaborative}} intent trust development, and conflict resolution in a headquarters-subsidiary relationship in a new product launch context in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach - Grounded theory development is employed through personal interviews with senior executives of selected multinational firms operating in Turkey. Findings - A major challenge in collaboration is convincing both parties to the dyad that the expertise of the other party is essential for effective collaboration. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based solely on looking at the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>side</b> of the subsidiary-HQ dyad in a single country, which limits their generalizability. Since we did not interview the HQ side of this dyad, speculations made about the possible reactions of HQ personnel to subsidiary actions must be interpreted with caution. Practical implications - The perceptions of both parties play a far more important role than the facts or perceptions of just one party {{when it comes to}} relationships and conflict resolution. Both parties need {{to pay more attention to}} the possible causes of means incongruence and take perception gaps and the other side's needs and expertise into account when approaching collaboration and conflict resolution. Originality/value - Agency theory is extended to a multinational firm-subsidiary context in order to suggest mechanisms for resolving conflict through increased communication, greater trust in each other's capabilities, and greater collaboration in meeting common challenges. A diagnostic and prescriptive framework and mechanisms are also offered through which disruptive conflict can be transformed into functional conflict and collaboration...|$|R
50|$|Graig Goch is a 586m high {{hill in the}} Gwynedd area in Wales {{and lying}} within Snowdonia National Park. The hill falls within the {{communities}} of Llanfihangel-y-Pennant and Corris, the summit being located in the former. The hill {{takes the form of}} a NE-SW aligned ridge with a broad top which rise to <b>subsidiary</b> tops either <b>side</b> of the main summit. These are the 540m+ top of Mynydd Cedris (OS grid ref SH 707080) and the 504m top of Mynydd Rugog (OS grid ref SH 722092). The hill’s most notable feature is the large cliff which stretches the length of its northwestern face overlooking Tal-y-llyn, in part a major rock-slope failure.|$|R
50|$|The Putnam Bridge {{was built}} by the New York City & Northern Railroad, a {{predecessor}} of the NY&P, and operated by its <b>subsidiary,</b> the West <b>Side</b> & Yonkers Railway (not {{to be confused with}} the West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway, the original operator of the 9th Avenue line). The location for the bridge was formally approved by the Board of Parks Commissioners on January 7, 1880. Construction was authorized by the Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners on February 18, 1880, was underway by April of that year, and completed April 28, 1881; train service began running on the following Sunday, May 1, 1881. The construction was marred by an accident on November 26, 1880, when a truss that was being moved into position flipped over unexpectedly, knocked a second truss loose, and caused both to fall through the scaffolding, killing one laborer and injuring four others, but otherwise proceeded without notable incident.|$|R
40|$|Sustainable urban {{mobility}} aims to encourage movement behavior that reduce automobile dependency and induce non-automobile and public mobility. As cities continue to change, planners {{are facing the}} challenge of designing {{urban mobility}} systems that are sustainable on social, economic, and ecological levels. They aim to reduce transportation energy consumption; increase social interaction between residents; and increase <b>subsidiary</b> effects of <b>side</b> path through movement. There is a growing calls for planners to shift paradigm of urban mobility to enable economic activity, social connectivity, and ecology. Movement behavior is influenced by different factors, part of them due to socioeconomic variables, others due to urban form. Some neighborhoods seem to support alternative modes of movement of non-motorized or public motorized as feasible mobility solutions and meet resident's expectations and accordingly {{reduce the need for}} high level of motor vehicle ownership; Where other neighborhoods don't and encourages residents to depend on private alternatives accordingly increase fuel consumption, cost, and environmental pollution. Based on a case study of six neighborhoods that represent chronological development of neighborhood types in greater Cairo region, this research provides an understanding of how urban mobility was influenced by neighborhoods urban patterns. This research suggests that some specific neighborhood features can efficiently influence people mobility, demand and travel behavior than others, accordingly enhance achieving sustainable urban mobility and overall sustainability of development...|$|R
5000|$|An {{internal}} stair {{within the}} thickness of the pulpitum gives access to a broad upper platform, which commonly supports the cathedral organ. The pulpitum is invariably pierced by a central passage, leading immediately into the choir stalls to the (ritual) east. Many pulpita, as those of Glasgow Cathedral, Exeter Cathedral and Southwell Minster, incorporated <b>subsidiary</b> altars either <b>side</b> of their central passages. In the late medieval period, there would have always have been a rood screen or rood beam placed one bay {{to the west of the}} pulpitum (i.e. further away from the high altar of the cathedral); which would have had the main nave altar for the use of lay worshippers set against its western face; and which was pierced by lateral doors, left and right, for processional access to the nave; and through which pilgrims could pass into the eastern arm of the church so as to proceed via the ambulatory to the feretory or shrine, commonly located behind the high altar. Most cathedral rood screens were demolished at the English Reformation, although the cathedrals of Peterborough and Canterbury retained their separate rood screens into the 18th century; and in the collegiate church of Ottery Saint Mary, both sets of screens remained until the early 19th century. At the former monastic churches of Saint Albans and Ewenny the rood screen survives, while the pulpitum does not.|$|R
