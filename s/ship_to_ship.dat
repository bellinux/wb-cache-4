25|$|On July 13, 1586 {{near the}} island of Pantelleria, between Tunis and Sicily, they soon sighted a number of ships {{that turned out to}} be galleys eleven in all {{supported}} by two frigates. Wilkinson ordered the ships to venture close to the coast of the island so that they could not be surrounded and then ordered the ships ready for action. The sakarins, culverins and demi culverins would show how well they fared since in <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship</b> combat they had yet to be tested at sea in English service.|$|E
25|$|A later {{addition}} was {{the ability}} to track the velocity of the targets, a concept taken from the US work on their X2 model. This used an integrating circuit to measure the difference in position between subsequent measurements of any given track. This information was also fed to a separate analog computer that automatically calculated intercept locations, making the plotting of multiple intercepts much easier. This version also added additional inputs that transmitted readiness information from the aircraft carriers and missile cruisers, allowing the intercept officers to choose what weapons to assign to a given target. This information was passed from <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship</b> using a new data link known as the Digital Plot Transmission (DPT) system that could also share the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Generally cannons {{were placed}} in the bow or stern, with the boat {{absorbing}} the guns' recoil. The whole vessel had to be turned to deliver salvoes. Compared to European use of naval cannon, such artillery saw limited use in <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship</b> engagements, or shore bombardments. As stand-off weapons covering troop landings or raiding missions however, they had serviceable anti-personnel value, particularly when combined with muskets. In Nigeria, large war canoes are reported, some mounting up to twenty pairs of swivel-guns on cross-beams at intervals of five or six feet. In 1841, the ruler of Abo was reported to muster some 300 canoes, many armed with muskets and bow/stern cannons. Some canoe fleets however relied on traditional weapons. On Lake Chad in the early 19th century the piratical Buduna fielded a fleet of some 1,000 reed canoes, using spears and shields for armament, and in East Africa, native kingdoms sometimes vied for supremacy with large numbers of canoes on the region's great lakes.|$|E

500|$|... "Commonsense {{suggests}} that buying fish from fishermen at sea for resale is an activity related to fishing under the SFPA," [...] wrote Moskowitz.

2500|$|A major {{difference}} from the Kuma class was in {{the configuration of the}} bridge, which incorporated an aircraft hangar. Initially, a [...] platform was mounted above the No.2 turret, extending over the forward superstructure below the bridge. This was later replaced by an aircraft catapult. Even so, the arrangement proved unwieldy, and the catapult was moved to the rear of each ship, between the No.5 and No.6 turrets during retrofits in 1929-1934. The silhouette of the bridges varied somewhat from <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship,</b> as Abukuma has a [...] rangefinder located on top of the bridge, whereas Nagara and Isuzu had [...] instruments, Natori had a , and Yura and Kinu were equipped with [...] instruments.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May, as {{the fleet}} was finally {{preparing}} to leave Corunna, the men demanded their six months of pay or threatened to strike. Houblon refused to acquiesce to these demands, but Admiral O'Byrne, seeing {{the seriousness of the}} situation, wrote to England asking for the money owed to his men. However, on 6 May some of the sailors were involved in an argument with Admiral O'Byrne, and it was probably around this time that they conceived of a plan to mutiny and began recruiting others. One of the men recruiting others was Henry Every. As William Phillips, a mariner on the Dove, would later testify, Every went [...] "up & down from <b>Ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>Ship</b> & persuaded the men to come on board him, & he would carry them where they should get money enough." [...] Since Every {{had a great deal of}} experience and was also born in a lower social rank, he was the natural choice to command the mutiny, as the crew believed he would have their best interests at heart.|$|E

2500|$|Barret Bonden is Aubrey's highly competent, {{highly valued}} coxswain.

He is {{described}} as [...] "a fine open-looking creature, tough without brutality, cheerful, perfectly in his place and, of course, a prime seaman - bred to the sea from childhood." [...] In this same novel, Aubrey asks Bonden {{to become a member}} of the quarter-deck, but Bonden declines, responding, [...] "I ain't got the learning, sir." [...] (p.275). Nevertheless, Bonden's obvious abilities and trustworthiness enable Aubrey to entrust him with many missions of his own, several of which involve looking after Maturin during Maturin's activities as an intelligence agent. He appears in The Ionian Mission and Treason's Harbour. Bonden also proves to be valuable in always taking care to get the perpetually clumsy doctor safely on and off ship. Maturin returns the favor by teaching Bonden how to read and write. Bonden, along with his cousin, Joe Plaice, follows Aubrey from <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship.</b> He was killed in an engagement with a xebec in [...] "The Hundred Days". [...] In the 2003 , Bonden was portrayed by Billy Boyd.|$|E
2500|$|Preserved Killick is Aubrey's shrewish steward, {{inherited}} from Captain Allen when Aubrey assumes command of HM Sloop Sophie in Master and Commander. He also comes to unofficially care for Maturin (The Fortune of War, p.57), particularly his long-suffering uniforms and clothes, and never resists {{the opportunity to}} nag either of them (though mostly Maturin, his habits generally leaving him looking much shabbier than Aubrey) for their carelessness in appearance. He is also known to listen in on their private conversations, steal from the captain's private stores, and drain more than his fair share of wine from the captain's table. Despite all these shortcomings, he is a highly valued, fiercely loyal and well-respected member of Aubrey's crew. Killick follows Aubrey from <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> <b>ship.</b> He is in The Ionian Mission. It {{is no surprise that}} larger dictionaries define killick as a small anchor. Killick's star does fade slightly in the nineteenth book, The Hundred Days, when an assistant at one of Aubrey's dinners [...] "in a paroxysm of adolescent drunkenness, spewing improbable jets of Madeira," [...] contrives to trip Killick and the poor steward cracks Stephen's sacrosanct narwhal horn (p.89).

2500|$|On 10 April 1853 she sailed {{again for}} the Mediterranean, {{arriving}} at Malta early June to join the Mediterranean fleet under vice-admiral James Dundas. The ship had a new commander, George Le Geyt Bowyear, who reported that Tryon was now signal officer. Considerable competition existed between Vengeance and the fleet flagship in manoeuvres, where Vengeance [...] frequently performed best. Part of Tryon's duties included keeping watch on the flagship before exercises, including going out in a boat at night to see what preparations were being made for the following day. The fleet took station in Bashika Bay outside the Dardanelles between June and October, because of the increasing tension with Russia before the Crimean War. In October the fleet moved through the Dardanelles to the Bosphorus and moored at Beikos Bay. On 30 November, the Russian fleet destroyed a squadron of Turkish ships at Sinop, just after Turkey declared war. Britain was not yet at war with Russia, but Vengeance visited Sinop January 1854 and saw {{the remains of the}} ships, which had been caught at anchor by the Russians. The British fleet moved into the Black Sea to land troops at Varna and took part in the bombardment of Odessa on 22 April. Cholera broke out through the fleet in August and eighteen died on board Vengeance.
