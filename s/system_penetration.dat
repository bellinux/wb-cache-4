50|$|Norhydrocodone is {{the major}} {{metabolite}} of the opioid analgesic hydrocodone. It is formed from hydrocodone in the liver via N-demethylation predominantly by CYP3A4. Unlike hydromorphone, a minor metabolite of hydrocodone, norhydrocodone is described as inactive. However, norhydrocodone is actually an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with similar potency to hydrocodone, but {{has been found to}} produce only minimal analgesia when administered peripherally to animals.

50|$|During phase I human {{clinical}} trials {{for the treatment}} of cocaine abuse, development of JDTic was halted due to the incidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, a type of arrhythmia that can potentially be life-threatening.

50|$|With oral administration, {{domperidone}} is extensively metabolized in {{the liver}} (almost exclusively by CYP3A4/5, though minor contributions by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 have also been reported) and in the intestines. Due to the marked first-pass effect via this route, the oral bioavailability of domperidone is low (13-17%); conversely, its bioavailability is high via intramuscular injection (90%). The terminal half-life of domperidone is 7.5 hours in healthy individuals, but can be prolonged to 20 hours in people with severe renal dysfunction. All of the metabolites of domperidone are inactive as D2 receptor ligands. The drug is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter, and animal studies suggest {{that this is the}} reason for the low central nervous <b>system</b> <b>penetration</b> of domperidone.|$|E

Unlike some other detection systems, our design also lends itself to a distributed detection architecture, permitting non-obtrusive attack signature updating and operating system portability.

40|$|AbstractThroughout the European Union {{there is}} an {{increasing}} amount of wind generation being dispatched-down due to the binding of power system operating constraints from high levels of wind generation. This paper examines the impact a <b>system</b> non-synchronous <b>penetration</b> limit has on the dispatch-down of wind and quantifies the significance of interconnector counter-trading to the priority dispatching of wind power. A fully coupled economic dispatch and security constrained unit commitment model of the Single Electricity Market of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangement {{was used in this}} study. The key finding was interconnector counter-trading reduces the impact the <b>system</b> non-synchronous <b>penetration</b> limit has on the dispatch-down of wind. The capability to counter-trade on the interconnectors and an increase in <b>system</b> non-synchronous <b>penetration</b> limit from 50 % to 55 % reduces the dispatch-down of wind by 311 GWh and decreases total electricity payments to the consumer by € 1. 72 /MWh. In terms of the European Union electricity market integration, the results show the importance of developing individual electricity markets that allow system operators to counter-trade on interconnectors to ensure the priority dispatch of the increasing levels of wind generation...|$|R

50|$|GLP-1 is {{also shown}} to inhibit food intake, presumably via {{activation}} of central hypothalamic centers regulating satiety, but GSK716155 cannot cross the {{blood brain barrier}} since it is a large peptide2. However, GSK716155 rapidly reduces food intake and inhibits gastric emptying in preclinical studies within minutes of administration, suggesting that direct central nervous <b>system</b> <b>penetration</b> of GLP-1R agonists may not be required for GLP-1R dependent actions in the brain. The anorectic properties of GLP-1 and its peptide analogs {{are thought to be}} due in part to both inhibition of gastric emptying and deactivation of central satiety centers coupled with reduction of energy intake. GSK716155 may not be as potent at reducing these effects, but other GLP-1 receptor agonists must be injected once or twice daily and GSK716155 is a step towards developing longer circulating half-lives2.|$|E

Most dextrans were trapped in the wall. A dramatic improvement in transfer of dextrans was observed when the cells were treated by dithiothreitol before pulsation. A cytoplasmic protein leakage was detected after the electric treatment suggesting that an irreversible damage took place in the walls of many pulsed cells. Electroloading of macromolecules in intact yeast cells appears to be controlled by a field induced short lived alteration of the envelope organization...|$|R
