Switch-mode hydraulic {{control is a}} compact and theoretically efficient alternative to throttling valve control or variable displacement pump control. The virtually variable displacement circuit created by a pulse-width modulated high-speed valve has drawbacks, such as large energy losses due to throttling and compressibility during valve transitions. Hydraulic <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> was proposed as method of reducing the throttling energy loss, by absorbing, in a small variable volume chamber, the flow that would normally be throttled across the transitioning high speed valve. An active locking mechanism was presented by Van de Ven that overcomes the main challenge with <b>soft</b> <b>switching,</b> which is a lock mechanism that releases quickly and with precise timing. A numerical model is developed for a switch-mode pumping circuit, utilizing the proposed <b>soft</b> <b>switch.</b> The model is then used {{as a means of}} designing a proof of concept prototype to further verify the model and provide a future optimization tool. The prototype design includes methods for controlling the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> spring preload, travel distance, piston displacement required to unlock the <b>soft</b> <b>switch,</b> valve command duty ratio, switching cycle length, and load pressure. Testing demonstrated that the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> circuit performed as expected within a set of parameter values, defining normal operation. High control valve switching periods, high load pressures, high flow rates, low <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> unlocking distances, and low spring preloads caused the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> to unlock prematurely in the switching cycle. This resulted in the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> to failing to absorb the switched volume pressure spike during control valve transitions, leading to low efficiencies. Under normal operating conditions, the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> circuit was calculated to be 60. 9 % efficient, which is lower than the 62. 1 % efficiency for same circuit without a <b>soft</b> <b>switch,</b> and also lower than the 70. 5 % efficiency predicted by the numerical model. The discrepancies between the numerical and experimental model can be attributed to poor resolution in the measurement instruments, as well as the model not accurately capturing flow dynamics through the check valves behind the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> piston. Since the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> parameters were chosen to validate the lock release concept, and not to maximize efficiency, it was not unexpected that the baseline <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> case had lower efficiency than the control case. Using the insights gained from these model comparisons, an efficient locking <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> can be designed for use in a dual <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> circuit scheme, shown by Van de Ven to reduce energy losses by 66 % compared to a control circuit. A successful hydraulic <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> circuit will allow for the use of slower switching valves, which will reduce component cost as well as energy consumption...|$|R

WedgeTail has no reliance on pre-defined rules by an administrator for its detection and may be easily imported into SDNs with different setups, forwarding devices, and controllers. The process begins by mapping forwarding devices as points within a geometric space and storing the path packets take when traversing the network as trajectories. Before inspection, the forwarding devices are clustered into groups of varying priority based on the frequency of occurrence in packet trajectories over specified time periods.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is the {{analysis}} and design of a DC/DC converter for aircraft applications. This converter {{is part of the}} output of an isolated rectifier unit for the distribution of electric power inside the airplane. This work is part of the research effort done by the Center of Industrial Electronics in Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid (CEI-UPM), in the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) topic. The system works as a rectifier of the current obtained at the turbines, the generator of the plane. A three-phased current flows to a device for eliminating the electronic interference (EMI). Then, a buck rectifier reduces the current, and finally a DC/DC converter adjusts its input voltage to the voltage at the load. The objective of this project is designing an efficient and lightweight DC/DC converter in order to reduce fuel consumption on the plane. Its input voltage come from the rectifier. Output voltage is 28 V as it is nowadays integrated in most planes. It is formed by active elements (switches and control) and by passive elements (transformer and bridge). The topology chosen is full-bridge as isolation is needed and transformer is simpler than in half-bridges. Inside full-bridge, there are different possibilities: phase shifted, dual active bridge, resonant dual active bridge and triangular full bridge. The Triangular Full-Bridge is the chosen topology because the <b>soft</b> <b>switches</b> on both bridges at the primary and the secondary, and it only needs one magnetizing component, which gives the leakage needed for obtaining the triangular wave form. Due to the high ripple on this current, high capacitance is needed at the output. This capacitance can cover a big volume, being a disadvantage for this topology. It is mandatory to avoid Continuous Current Mode (CCM) and always operate with Discontinuous Current Mode (DCM), as behavior control of the converter changes and less hard-switchings are required. ZCS is achieved on most switches and less losses and noise on output are produced. Anyway, there are some disadvantages that must be considered: â€¢ High number of transistors: The main disadvantage of a full-bridge topology is that it needs minimum eight transistors. Because of this the total voltage drop in transistors duplicates of that in case of center-tap rectifiers, if both sides of the transformer are connected as rectifiers. Losses are increased and conversion efficiency is somewhat reduced. â€¢ High RMS currents: The RMS current is the equivalent steady DC value which gives the same effect and therefore the same losses on transformer and transistors, as they have internal resistances. Another disadvantage of high RMS current is high ripple, that leads to high capacitance on the output. With interleaving ripples can be compensated and capacitance can be smaller. There are three different states per cycle on current waveform. The Dead state allows to have ZCS. Different types of power semiconductor switches are designed for functioning in diverse conditions. Voltage, current and switching frequency of the application are the parameters that need to be considered for electing the right switch. Increasing frequency allows the transformer to be smaller. As converterâ€™s layout depends {{on the size of the}} transformer and specifications establish that it is needed a high power density. Therefore, a high frequency is obligatory. MOSFET is the technology that best fits these exigencies. Some IGBTs are also good solutions. There are different kinds of MOSFETs depending on their material: Silicon MOSFETs are the traditionally used; Silicon Carbide MOSFETs are good for preforming with high voltages and high power, Gallium Nitride MOSFETs are excellent for high frequencies. Interleaving consists in producing a multiphase current thanks to various converters connected in parallel. There are as many phases as converters. The main advantage is that every converter handles less power so current peaks are lower. In this application, interleaving helps to take advantage of the leakage inductance of the transformer. With a single converter, for most turn ratios it is mandatory to add another external inductance to the circuit. This is a big disadvantage as it would force to operate with specifications that would not produce the less losses possible, or to place an external inductance that would drop power density. In order to evaluate the efficiency of this converter, a proper calculation of losses in the devices as well as in the transformer is required. As it was explained before, the design and optimization of the transformer is out of the aim of this work so it will not be calculated. However, the optimized design is going to take into account some of the restrictions on the transformer design and the integration of the magnetizing components needed to achieve a good power density. The parameters regarded for the design space are: â€¢ Frequency â€¢ Inductance â€¢ Turns ratio of the transformer. â€¢ Number of devices in parallel (Primary and secondary) â€¢ Diodes or MOSFET in secondary â€¢ Number of Parallel converters â€¢ Stability â€¢ Maximum current on devices Primary bridge MOSFETs operate with 400 V, therefore the best materials are Silicon and Silicon Carbide. It is possible to discriminate two types of MOSFET side: - High side has switching, conduction and reverse recovery losses. Consequently, the number of MOSFET in parallel per side and the MOSFET employed are determined by the configuration that reaches the lower losses. - Low side only has conduction losses. For that reason, the MOSFET chosen is the one with less RDS at temperature of operation. Also a high number of MOSFET per side is desired. Secondary bridge performs with 28 V, for that reason GaN MOSFETs and diodes can be taken into account as alternatives to Silicon and Silicon Carbide MOSFETs. Secondary side mainly has conduction losses. Therefore, the same configuration selection as in low MOSFETs in primary is applicable. An important fact to take into account is that devices have to be able to endure the current that flows through them without breaking. With low frequencies, the time demanded for reaching the current peak that delivers on output the correct power is bigger than in high frequencies. Consequently, slope is smaller and inductance bigger in low frequencies than in high frequencies. But with more converters, different turn ratios produce different waveforms at the output, and consequently ripple changes as well. Ripple drops and capacitance thus is not forced to be that big. Its size changes with turn ratio as well. However, there are some turn ratios where adding more converters ripple increases. Losses in transformer are reduced by ZVS. But, in order to achieve zero voltage, some magnetizing current is required. As a consequence, on dead state there is no zero current and ZCS on MOSFETs is not achieved. Therefore, switching losses increase in configurations where high magnetizing current is needed. It is not possible to determine which is the best solution. Future research lines on the transformer will allow to choose the configuration with lower volume, weight and losses...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> two phase boost {{converter}} for photovoltaic (PV) system. The important parameters that affect the system performance are input current and voltage ripples. The advantages of two phase boost converter include increased efficiency, reduced size and improved reliability. This converter can be used in such applications for interfacing. By adopting <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> method, reduction in switching losses and also reduction in ripples can be achieved so that system efficiency is improved. The simulation study of two phase <b>Soft</b> <b>Switching</b> boost converter fed by PV source is carried out using MATLAB and results are presented in this paper. The comparative analysis is also made among the two phase converter with different inductor coupling.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> between two model predictive controllers. The motivation for this work comes from the control of large scale hierarchical systems where different operating scenario asking for different control objective makes a single model predictive controller (MPC) unsuitable. The proposed <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> approach shows much better switching performance both in system output and control input than the traditional hard switching. The stability of the designed <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> process is analysed and sufficient conditions for stability are derived. Numerical examples with simulation results show that the proposed approach can be useful in practical applications. Copyright Â© 2005 IFA...|$|R

The topology {{is composed of}} a general dual-boost converter and an auxiliary resonant circuit including one switch, inductor, capacitor and two diodes. The auxiliary resonant circuit helps the main switch to operate under ZVT condition. The auxiliary switch is also operated at <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> mode. Furthermore, the proposed circuit removes the voltage stress on the main and auxiliary <b>switches.</b> Under <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> conditions {{the efficiency of the}} converter increases.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{significantly}} reducing the losses {{associated with an}} on/off controlled hydraulic system is proposed. There has been a growing interest {{in the use of}} on/off valves to control hydraulic systems as a means of improving system efficiency. While on/off valves are efficient when they are fully open or fully closed, a significant amount of energy can be lost in throttling as the valve transitions between the two states when the switching times are not negligible. A <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> approach is proposed as a method of eliminating the majority of these transition losses. The operating principle of <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> is that fluid can temporarily flow through a check valve or into a small chamber while valve orifices are partially closed. The fluid can then flow out of the chamber once the valve has fully transitioned. Thus, fluid flows through the valve only when it is in its most efficient fully open state. A model of the system is derived and simulated, with results indicating that the <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> approach can reduce transition and compressibility losses by 81 % and total system losses by 64 %. The <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of on/ off controlled systems and is particularly beneficial as switching frequencies are increased. The <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> approach will also facilitate the use of slower on/off valves for effective on/off control; in simulation, a valve with <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> matched the efficiency of an on/off valve that was 4. 4 times faster.
