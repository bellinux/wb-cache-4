5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E
5|$|Six {{divisions}} of MiG-9s, each with two regiments of 31 aircraft, {{were transferred to}} China in November–December 1950 for air defense and training duties. The 17th Guards Fighter Aviation Division (GIAD) defended Shenyang, the 20th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) guarded Tangshan, and the 65th IAD protected Guangzhou. The 144th IAD defended Shanghai, the 309th guarded Gongzhuling and the 328th IAD protected Peking. These units later handed their aircraft over to the 6th, 7th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 17th Fighter Divisions of the People's Liberation Army Air Force when their training was complete. The Chinese considered <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> MiG-9s to Korea in 1951 under Soviet pressure, but reconsidered when the PLAAF commanders reported that they believed {{that it would be}} better to retrain MiG-9 pilots on MiG-15s.|$|E
5|$|The 1880s was {{a decade}} of growing {{national}} prosperity, and increasing numbers of families from the expanding middle classes were <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> sons to boarding schools. The B.O.P. editor, George Hutchison, felt that such schools would provide the ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero (or heroes) could display Christian principles and strength of character {{in the face of}} temptations, and planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a boarding school, was not the obvious choice as the writer. However, the skill and imagination he had displayed in his short school stories convinced Hutchison that Reed should be given the assignment.|$|E

5|$|The Flames {{entered the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft without a {{selection}} {{in the first}} two rounds. They would have picked 13th overall, however that pick was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes as part of a 2009 trade for Olli Jokinen. Their second round pick went to the Chicago Blackhawks as part of a 2008 deal in which Calgary acquired Rene Bourque. The Flames' first selection was early in the third round, a pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Anton Stralman. They selected Max Reinhart with that pick. His father Paul was also a former Flames draft pick. Calgary made one trade at the draft, <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> sixth round pick (163rd overall) to the Sharks in exchange for goaltender Henrik Karlsson.|$|E
5|$|The Nawab of Junagadh, a princely state {{located on}} the {{south-western}} end of Gujarat and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing {{that it could be}} reached from Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh—Mangrol and Babariawad—reacted to this by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the Nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the states. The rulers of neighbouring states reacted angrily, <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> troops to the Junagadh frontier and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by Samaldas Gandhi, formed a government-in-exile, the Aarzi Hukumat ("temporary government").|$|E
5|$|The episode depicts {{its main}} characters' final hours before a British {{offensive}} on the Western Front of the First World War, and Captain Blackadder's attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after {{he fails to}} convince General Melchett, and Field Marshal Haig's advice proves useless, he resigns himself to {{taking part in the}} push. Goodbyeee has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in machine-gun fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of gallows humour, its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves.|$|E

5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the federal and state governments left Philadelphia, but the city continued for some years to be the country's cultural and financial center. Its large free black community aided fugitive slaves and founded the first independent black denomination in the nation, the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Philadelphia {{became one of the first}} U.S. industrial centers with a variety of industries, the largest being textiles. It had many economic and family ties to the South, with southern planters maintaining second homes in the city and having business connections with banks, <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> daughters to French finishing schools run by refugees from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), selling their cotton to textile manufacturers, which in turn sold some products to the South, for instance, clothing for slaves. At {{the beginning}} of the American Civil War, there were many southern sympathizers, although most city residents became firmly Union as the war went on.|$|E
5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E

5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than these}} major European powers, the only others were the Italian city-states. Genoa and Venice were both {{enemies of the}} Ottomans, but also of each other. The Venetians {{considered}} <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> fleet up to attack the fortifications guarding the Dardanelles and the Bosporus, thereby relieving the city but the force was too small and arrived too late. The Ottomans would have overpowered any military assistance provided by one city, even one as large and powerful as the Venetian Republic. In any case some 2,000 mercenaries, mostly Italian under Giovanni Giustiniani Longo, arrived {{to assist in the}} defence of the city. The city's entire defence fell to these mercenaries and 5,000 militia soldiers raised from a city whose population had been seriously eroded by heavy taxation, plague and civil conflict. Though poorly trained, the defenders were well armed in many weapons, except for any cannons to match the Ottoman's own artillery.|$|E
5|$|Realizing Calgary's {{path to the}} Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access {{to the left side}} of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the Oiler players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4–4 tie. The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9–3 in their final regular season meeting, a game that ended with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other was <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> goons out after talented players.|$|E

5|$|Some Muslims, {{especially}} those living near the southern coast, took {{the option of}} exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to believe and practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted en masse, and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the Moriscos. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food and beverages forbidden by Islamic law.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{were taken}} by {{surprise}} when the city fell, as the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their customary strategy, they reacted by <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles. However, the Venetians were by now ready to disengage themselves from this profitless venture, and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace. In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby the Republic recognised its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, and acknowledged, in exchange of an annual tribute of 236 ducats, Ottoman overlordship over Patras in the Morea. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: Durazzo, Scutari, and Antivari.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E
