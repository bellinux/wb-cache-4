30|$|In this paper, a <b>seamless</b> {{transfer}} <b>control</b> strategy {{based on}} local agents is presented. The microgrid can switch from islanded to interconnected {{mode of operation}} fast without frequency and voltage oscillations. The agent system consists of the MCS agent and the inverter agents.

The inverter agents are responsible for their operation mode and the synchronization process during the reconnection. The agents exchange information so that the reconnection is <b>seamless.</b> The synchronization <b>control</b> achieves firstly voltage and frequency and then phase synchronization.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses control {{strategies for}} power electronic converters that improve {{the reliability and}} stability of renewable energy systems. Three approaches are proposed to improve the control performance of a dc-dc converter and a distributed generation (DG) inverter under different operation modes and fault conditions. First, a <b>seamless</b> <b>control</b> for a dc-dc converter with both discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM) is proposed. The plant models in DCM and CCM are different in the frequency domain. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} design a controller with stable operation and fast response in both modes. The proposed controller can make mode transitions between DCM and CCM seamlessly with a mode tracker, and then the boost converter can autonomously operate by selecting the appropriate control loop in both modes. Second, a <b>seamless</b> <b>control</b> for the DG inverter with both a grid connected (GC) mode and a standalone (SA) mode is presented. With increasing renewable DGs, fast and stable mode transition technologies are necessary not only for sending the power to the grid in the GC mode, but also for protecting DGs from grid fault conditions in the SA mode. The proposed controller consists of a current controller and a feedforward voltage controller to minimize the grid overvoltage and improve the voltage response. Third, a control strategy to suppress a dc power oscillation of the DG inverter under grid voltage unbalance is discussed. Due to voltage unbalance, the dc power oscillation is generated, which impacts the lifespan of the renewable energy sources. A modified synchronous reference frame based current control with improved current reference is proposed. With the proposed current loop, the dc power oscillation is reduced effectively. The proposed control strategies reduce the impact of the renewable energy and the load under faults or disturbance conditions. And the stable operation of the power electronic converters will also enhance the stability and reliability of the renewable energy, the grid, and the load...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Demand {{response}} (DR) {{has traditionally}} targeted peak shaving for the optimal allocation of electricity consumption on a time scale {{that ranges from}} minutes to hours. However, with the availability of advanced monitoring and communication infrastructure, the potential of real-time DR for providing ancil-lary services to the grid {{has not yet been}} adequately explored. In this work, we propose a low-overhead decentralized DR control mechanism, henceforth called Grid Explicit Congestion Notifica-tion (GECN), intended for deployment by distribution network operators (DNOs) to provide ancillary services to the grid by a <b>seamless</b> <b>control</b> of a large population of elastic appliances. Contrary to classic DR approaches, the proposed scheme aims to continuously support the grid needs in terms of voltage control by broadcasting low-bit rate control signals on a fast time scale (i. e., every few seconds). Overall, the proposed DR mechanism is designed to i) indirectly reveal storage capabilities of end-cus-tomers and ii) have a negligible impact on the end-customer. In order to estimate the benefits of the proposed mechanism, the evaluation of the algorithm is carried out by using the IEEE 13 nodes test feeder in combination with realistic load profiles mixed with non-controllable demand and non-dispatchable generation from photovoltaic distributed generation.

40|$|The {{morphing}} wing can {{be considered}} as a wing with <b>seamless</b> <b>control</b> surfaces and high-lift devices, which is capable of changing its shape during flight. As a result, an aircraft with the morphing wing can fly multi-mission tasks effectively and efficiently. The morphing wing should be stiff in spanwise direction to withstand aerodynamic and actuation loads while, in chordwise direction, the wing should be compliant in order to allow shape change. In this thesis, corrugated carbon fibre reinforced polyurethane composite is introduced as a candidate for the skin of morphing wing applications as the corrugated composite is considered highly anisotropic. A parametric study of three corrugated profiles (sinusoidal, trapezoidal and U-shape) with differnet amplitudes and unit cell lengths was performed numerically using finite element analysis and compared with analytical model in order to investigate the effects of the corrugation geometry on the mechanical response under tensile load. The results indicate that the trapezoidal profile offers the lowest extensional stiffness followed by U-shape and sinusoidal, respectively. In terms of corrugation geometry, the extensional stiffness of the corrugation is inversely proportional to both unit cell length and amplitude. An aerodynamic analysis of an aerofoil with corrugated lower skin was performed experimentally at four different Reynolds numbers and compared with an aerofoil with smooth skin. The conclusion drawn from the wind tunnel testing is that the aerofoil with corrugated skin on the pressure side is feasible to be used for a morphing wing of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that operates at Reynolds number of approximately 10 [superscript 5]. A bench-top demonstrator was constructed as a proof of concept and experimentally tested for repeatability and structural integrity. Moreover, the mechanical advantage was evaluated through a simple experiment. Imperial Users Onl...|$|E
40|$|The {{smart grid}} is a {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{that aims to}} revolutionize the whole electricity supply chain including generation, transmission and distribution systems in order to overcome the multiple challenges currently facing the electric power grid. The smart grid {{could be seen as}} a modern electrical power grid in which information as well as electricity flows among all nodes in the system, information is continuously collected, processed and hence used to control and coordinate the different system components such as distributed generation (DG) units, capacitor banks, voltage regulating transformers, etc. Therefore distributed intelligence and two-way data communication links are essential components in implementing the smart grid vision. There are numerous research efforts that focus on implementing the smart grid vision in electrical power distribution systems, most of which only target one aspect of the distribution system control and operation, e. g. a control system for voltage control, another one for DG control, a third one for protection, etc. The coexistence of such control strategies in a distribution system raises some concerns about their overall performance, their interactions with the other control strategies, and whether these control systems can adapt to changes in distribution system connectivity. In this PhD thesis we try to address these issues by proposing an implementation of the smart grid vision for distribution systems that provides an integrated design of power systems, communication systems and control strategies. A unified and flexible framework that incorporates all the different aspects of distribution system control and operation is proposed. Distributed processing units equipped with wireless communication capabilities are used to continuously process the local data along with the data received from other nodes and forward the results to neighboring nodes in the system, which in turn process the received data and share the results with their neighbors. Consequently, changes in any of the system components (load values, status of DG etc.) are taken into account in the calculations as soon as they occur, and the results are forwarded to relevant nodes in the systems. This way the information “propagates” throughout the system resulting in a <b>seamless</b> <b>control</b> and coordination among all the system components. Simulation of the electrical power distribution and the communication systems reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework to control and coordinate multiple capacitor banks, DG units and voltage regulating transformers with changing load levels. It also reveals the potential of the proposed framework to operate in real-time by combining the real-time measured quantities with computer analysis in order to control the different system components within the time frame of normal non-emergency operating conditions. An experimental setup is built and used as a test bed for the proposed framework in order to assess the performance of the different ideas and techniques proposed in this thesis...|$|E
