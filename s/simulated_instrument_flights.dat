40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the Malcolm Horizon (MH) in a controlled, <b>simulated,</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> environment was examined. Eight flight parameters were used to compare performance under experimental and control conditions.

40|$|A joint NASA/university/industry {{program was}} {{conducted}} to flight evaluate a potentially low cost separate surface implementation of attitude command in a Beech 99 airplane.

ATPs must also have a commercial certificate and an instrument rating. ATPs may instruct other pilots in air transportation service in aircraft in which they are rated. ATPs must have a current Class I medical exam (which is more stringent than Class II or Class III), which must be renewed every six months or one year (depending on age). Like all pilots, they must re-validate their certificates every 24 months with a flight review.|$|R
40|$|Five highly {{experienced}} professional pilots performed {{instrument landing}} system approaches under <b>simulated</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> conditions in a Cessna 172 airplane and in a Link-Singer GAT- 1 simulator while {{under the influence of}} orally administered secobarbital (0, 100, and 200 mg). Tracking performance in two axes and airspeed control were evaluated continuously during each approach. Error and RMS variability were about half as large in the simulator as in the airplane. The observed data were more strongly associated with the drug level in the simulator than in the airplane. Further, the drug-related effects were more consistent in the simulator.

40|$|In an {{experiment}} designed {{to examine the}} effect of crew composition and automation level on flight performance, fifty pilot-copilot crews flew a <b>simulated</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> mission between three Michigan cities. Half of the crews were of homogeneous composition (both low or both high time), while half were heterogeneous consisting of one senior high time member and one junior low time member.

Results indicated that automation improved flight performance and lowered workload. between homogeneous and heterogeneous crews, the latter group appeared to benefit more from the advantages that automation had to offer.

40|$|An {{in-flight}} <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules (IFR) procedures trainer {{capable of}} providing <b>simulated</b> indications of <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> in a typical general aviation aircraft independent of ground based navigation aids was developed. The IFR navaid related instruments and circuits from an ATC 610 J table top simulator were installed in a Cessna 172 aircraft and connected to its electrical power and pitot static systems. The benefits expected from this hybridization concept include increased safety by {{reducing the number of}} general aviation aircraft conducting IFR training flights in congested terminal areas, and reduced fuel use and instruction costs by lessening the need to fly to and from navaid equipped airports and by increased efficiency of the required in-flight training. Technical feasibility was demonstrated and the operational feasibility of the concept was evaluated.

40|$|A {{control theory}} {{analysis}} of a VTOL flight director {{and the results of}} a fixed-based simulator evaluation of the flight-director commands are discussed. The VTOL configuration selected for this study is a helicopter-type VTOL which controls the direction of the thrust vector by means of vehicle-attitude changes and, furthermore, employs high-gain attitude stabilization. This configuration is the same as one which was <b>simulated</b> in actual <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> tests with a variable stability helicopter. Stability analyses are made for each of the flight-director commands, assuming a single input-output, multi-loop system model for each control axis. The analyses proceed from the inner-loops to the outer-loops, using an analytical pilot model {{selected on the basis of}} the innermost-loop dynamics.

5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains <b>simulated</b> <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|R
5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature <b>simulated</b> <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|R
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with <b>simulated</b> <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|R

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to assess the}} potential benefits afforded by a vertical-velocity command system (VVCS) for VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft.

500|$|Former flight {{instructor}} Peter James, {{who had worked}} on Flight Unlimited II, {{assumed the role of}} lead designer. He was largely responsible for Flight Unlimited IIIs lessons, planes and <b>simulated</b> <b>flight</b> <b>instruments.</b> James believed that other flight simulators had holes with regard to realism, and he hoped to create a more accurate experience. Photographs were captured of each plane's real-world counterpart, and construction of the 3D plane models was led by artist Duncan Hsu, a former car modeler at Papyrus Design Group. The flight physics were coded by Kevin Wasserman and involve real-time calculations of force vectors, such as those acting against a plane's yaw, pitch and roll. This system was more advanced than that of Flight Unlimited II, which was also based on force calculations. The physics code was informed by [...] "real aircraft data" [...] and the personal experience of pilots, and each of the planes was flown as research for the game. Because the plane cockpits of previous Flight Unlimited games had been criticized by pilots, the team tried to make Flight Unlimited IIIs cockpits extremely authentic. Kemal Amarasingham recorded the planes' sound effects, which he said involved [...] "risking his life" [...] by standing near jet engines and under wings.|$|R
