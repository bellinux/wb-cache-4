6000|$|... "I'm {{not quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you," [...] said the young officer. [...] "People who {{want me to}} have to talk plain. Still, I suppose one has always a certain sympathy for the fellow who gets himself killed decently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you {{object to}} {{illustrate}} your meaning, Mr. Bruff, so that I may be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it? Suppose you found Miss Verinder quite unaccountably {{interested in what}} has happened to Mr. Ablewhite and Mr. Luker? Suppose she asked the strangest questions about this dreadful scandal, and displayed the most ungovernable agitation when she found out the turn it was taking?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked so}} attentively {{at me that}} I looked attentively at him and felt <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{not quite}} <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you, sir,' {{answered}} Mr. Gilfil, who felt annoyed at the consciousness {{that he was}} turning pale.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you," [...] replied Fan, {{with a little}} hesitation. [...] "Do you mean religious, Mr. Travers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't {{think you}} would {{appreciate}} my motives, especially as I'm not quite <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> them myself. Anyway, I did it, and that, of course, implies {{that there can be}} no further understanding between you and me. I don't mean to question the morality of what we purposed doing, but, to be quite frank, I've had enough of it." ...|$|E
60|$|The two men {{had gone}} back to the Métropole and had parted with a firm handclasp outside the glare of the big doorway. Chatteris went {{straight}} in, Melville fancies, but he is not <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> Melville had some private thinking to do on his own account, and I conceive him walking away in a state of profound preoccupation. Afterwards the fact that the Sea Lady was not to be abolished by renunciations, cropped up in his mind, and he passed back along the Leas, as I have said. His inconclusive interrogations elicited at the utmost that Lummidge's Private and Family Hotel is singularly like any other hotel of its class. Its windows tell no secrets. And there Melville's narrative ends.|$|E
6000|$|This {{brings me}} to my own part. If we had anyone, or could get anyone, for Wilmot, I could do (I think) {{something}} so near your meaning in Sir Gilbert, that I let him go with a pang. Assumption has charms for me--I hardly know for how many wild reasons--so delightful, that I feel a loss of, oh! I can't say what exquisite foolery, when I lose a chance of being someone in voice, etc., {{not at all like}} myself. But--I speak quite freely, knowing you will not mistake me--I know from experience that we could find nobody to hold the play together in Wilmot if I didn't do it. I think I could touch the gallant, generous, careless pretence, with the real man at the bottom of it, so as to take the audience with him from the first scene. I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> your meaning; and I am absolutely certain that as Jerrold, Forster, and Stone came in, I could, as a mere little bit of mechanics, present them better by doing that part, and paying as much attention to their points as my own, than another amateur actor could. Therefore I throw up my cap for Wilmot, and hereby devote myself to him, heart and head! ...|$|E
60|$|Grown-up {{folks with}} their {{contradictory}} ways were a continual puzzle {{to me in}} those days; <b>I</b> am not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>understand</b> them even now, myself included.|$|R
40|$|A {{well-known}} Uzbek musician told me {{that music}} was "in the blood, ” tapping the veins in his arm to make <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood.</b> He explained that his children were fine musicians although he had taught them nothing. To be a musician, rhythm {{had to be in}} the blood, "Just a little, " he said, but it had to be there. For him, the ability to play Uzbek music was a hereditary...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>understand</b> it," [...] said Mrs. Ray. But {{she became}} {{silent on the}} subject, and {{the reading of the}} {{newspaper}} was passed over to Rachel.|$|R
60|$|Whether {{or not he}} {{ever came}} to {{understand}} me--and I have been so tossed about since then that I am not very <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> myself--he soon perceived that I was perfectly in earnest; and after about ten days of argument, suddenly dropped the subject, and {{announced that he was}} wasting capital, and must go home at once. No doubt he should have gone long before, and had already lingered over his intended time {{for the sake of our}} companionship and my misfortune; but man is so unjustly minded that the very fact, which ought to have disarmed, only embittered my vexation. I resented his departure in the light of a desertion; I would not say, but doubtless I betrayed it; and something hang-dog in the man's face and bearing led me to believe he was himself remorseful. It is certain at least that, during the time of his preparations, we drew sensibly apart--a circumstance that I recall with shame. On the last day he had me to dinner at a restaurant which he knew I had formerly frequented, and had only forsworn of late from considerations of economy. He seemed ill at ease; I was myself both sorry and sulky; and the meal passed with little conversation.|$|E

5000|$|The Guardian {{reported}} that:'Circumstances,' he said, {{once through}} to the Governor of Texas, 'have changed. I need to withdraw my concession until the situation is clear'. 'Let me make <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> Mr Vice-President,' said Bush. 'You're calling me back to retract your concession'. 'There's no need to get snippy about it,' said Gore. Bush replied that his brother Jeb was the Governor {{in charge of the}} Florida ballot. Gore's voice retorted: 'It may surprise you but your younger brother is not the ultimate authority on this.' 'Mr Vice-President,' said Bush's voice, 'You need to {{do what you have to}} do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Stackpole seemed unmoved by this consideration; she was {{thinking}} of something else and presently expressed it. [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you about Lord Warburton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} can, Julian," [...] he admitted. [...] "Sometimes I am not quite <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you. That's {{the worst of}} a man with the gift for silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} that is metaphysical," [...] said Meta, [...] "but <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> it. One must know oneself to be worse than one knows any one else to be." ...|$|R
50|$|When he {{introduced}} the Tenth Amendment in Congress, James Madison explained that many states {{were eager to}} ratify this amendment, despite critics who deemed the amendment superfluous or unnecessary:I find, from looking into the amendments proposed by the State conventions, that several are particularly anxious {{that it should be}} declared in the Constitution, that the powers not therein delegated should be reserved to the several States. Perhaps words which may define this more precisely than the whole of the instrument now does, may be considered as superfluous. I admit they may be deemed unnecessary: but there can be no harm in making such a declaration, if gentlemen will allow that the fact is as stated. I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it so, and do therefore propose it.|$|E
5000|$|Manning told ESPN's Lisa Salters {{about the}} reports, on an {{interview}} {{on the morning of}} the 27th for ESPN Sunday NFL Countdown: [...] “Disgusted is how I feel. Sickened by it. I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> how someone can make something up about somebody, admit he’s made it up and yet somehow it gets published in a story. I don’t understand that. Maybe you can explain it to me, somebody else can. It’s completely fabricated, complete trash, garbage. It makes me sick it brings Ashley into it. Her medical history, her medical privacy being violated. That makes me sick. I don’t understand that. It’s not right. I don’t understand it.” [...] Salters pointed other cases have been seen in which athletes deny first and then eventually admit allegations and Manning answered he can't speak for others and he know how hard he worked. Nevertheless, Manning also stated he had visited the Guyer Institute 35 times during 2011 and that he had received both medication and treatment from Guyer during this time. Sly recanted his story and requested the report not to be aired via a YouTube video following the release of the report.|$|E
5000|$|Krauss weaves his cosmic story {{around the}} life of a single oxygen atom, from the time it was just a twinkle in the universe's eye to the {{eventual}} death of its constituent particles. This denouement may come to pass in some distant part of the cosmos long after we have all passed away, but, if we are really lucky, it may just happen in an enormous tank of minutely scrutinised water currently located down a mineshaft in Japan. If and when it does, physicists the world over will jump up and down with excitement, because they will have learned something truly profound. Exactly what would take too long to explain, which is a relief, because I'm not at all <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it. Read the book and try for yourself... I am {{in a better position to}} judge Krauss's geology and biology, subjects he admits he had to learn from scratch before writing Atom. Not only has he mastered them, he often finds lyrical ways of explaining ideas in both fields. Indeed, the standard of writing in Atom is perhaps even higher than in his 1995 bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've read it,' Selah answered, carelessly, 'and I {{thought it}} all very pretty. Of course Swinburne always is very pretty: but I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{never try to}} {{discover}} what on earth he means by it. I suppose father would say I don't read him tearfully and prayerfully--at any rate, I'm quite <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> never <b>understand</b> what he's driving at.' ...|$|R

30|$|Some {{families}} {{might choose}} one [outcome] from each [outcome area. Another family] might choose {{a whole bunch}} of goals from each category. Others might be very focused on, “I’ve got six months, I’ve {{got to take care of}} my house and I’ve got to make <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the services because my child is going to need the service system when the time comes”. Or, “I’m really, very…unsure about how I should be relating [to] my child who has a disability. Is it different? Is it the same? I need some advice about…how to have that positive relationship as we get started”.|$|E
40|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{believe that}} {{the passage of time}} is a real phenomenon. And some of them find a reason to believe this when they attend to features of their conscious experience. In fact this “argument from experience” is supposed {{to be one of the}} main arguments for passage. What exactly does this argument look like? Is it any good? There are in fact many different arguments from experience. I am not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> them all. In this paper I want to talk about the three most interesting arguments that I do understand. I am going to argue that all three of them fail...|$|E
40|$|Subject: Section 4 Attached is {{the draft}} writeup you {{requested}} earlier today. I {{would like to}} emphasize {{that this is a}} draft. Because I just completed the calculations this morning that Mike Cheok requested last week, I have not had time to fully analyze the results.

6000|$|Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, {{plucked a}} pink-petalled daisy from the grass, and {{examined}} it.

40|$|A major {{paradigm}} shift {{in mental health}} {{has led to the}} ascendance of the view that chronic psychopathology results from perturbed neural development. While most work in this area examines schizophrenia, the current report extends the paradigm to bipolar disorder (BD) in youth, thus demonstrating traction (not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> what you mean here) in the developmental-psychobiology perspective. To study the role of amygdala dysfunction, we examined the neural mechanisms mediating face processing in 22 youth (mean age 14. 21 + 3. 11 years) with BD and 21 controls of comparable age, gender, and IQ. Event-related fMRI compared neural activation when attention was directed to emotional aspects of faces (hostility, subjects’ own fearfulness) vs. non-emotional aspects (nose width). Compared to controls, patients perceived greater hostility in neutral faces, and reported more fear when viewing them. Also, compared to controls, patients had greater activation in the left amygdala, accumbens, putamen, and ventral prefrontal cortex when rating face hostility, and greater activation in the left amygdala and bilateral accumbens when rating their own fear of the face. There were no between-group behavioral or neural differences in the non-emotional conditions. Results implicate deficient emotion-attention interactions in the pathophysiology of BD in youth, and suggest that developmental psychobiology approaches to chronic mental illness have broad applicability...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to Professor Rorty’s reaction to Professor Habermas’s paper in this symposium, I confess that I am still not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> Rorty’s hostility to ideals {{such as the}} ideal of truth. Such ideals as the ideal of truth [...] and ideals like those of reason and morality surely stand and fall with the ideal of truth [...] seem plainly to have an enormous pragmatic value. They lure us out of our too-constrained, too-limited ethnocentric or idiosyncratic frames of reference. It is always possible, of course, that such ideals may be abused; they have frequently been deployed, in particular, as clubs used to beat down views and modes of behavior that are threatening or otherwise disliked. But they need not be abused. Their proven and potential value is quite extraordinary. They offer us standards which pay explicit respect to the principle that the criteria we use for evaluating ideas and modes of behavior should be nonethnocentric and nonidiosyncratic. They offer us standards that we can appeal to in luring ourselves or others to step outside of our relatively narrow present points of view here and now and toward a broader perspective that can serve us better tomorrow and elsewhere...|$|E
5000|$|He later reflected, [...] "Nobody quite <b>understood</b> what <b>I</b> {{was trying}} to do, and I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> what <b>I</b> {{was trying to}} do at the time. I see now quite clearly what I was doing. I was making a movie about people who couldn't talk to each other. It was about people who couldn't communicate, so they talked in {{greeting}} cards. They bought greeting cards in the form of songs, and they sang songs 'cause they didn't {{know what to say to}} each other. It wasn't really a musical in the conventional sense, which is why we did everything live. I didn't care so much about the musical part of it. I wanted it to seem like people talking, only they were singing. [...] " ...|$|R

50|$|While {{a student}} at Duke University, Driesell eloped with his wife, Joyce on December 14, 1952. The two had met while in the ninth and eighth grades, respectively. The couple has four children. His son, Chuck, was hired as an {{assistant}} on the Maryland coaching staff under Gary Williams in 2006, and served from 2010-2015, as the head basketball coach at The Citadel. Chuck also served as an assistant for his father, while at JMU. While coaching under his father, saw firsthand just how hard his dad worked. “Dad gave {{me a lot of}} responsibility, and we worked hard. As a son and as a player, I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> how hard he worked. I figured it out pretty quickly.” Chuck is currently the head coach at the Maret School in Washington, D.C.|$|R
