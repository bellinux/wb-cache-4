40|$|MBA - WBSHighly {{competitive}} {{and with a}} rapidly evolving customer base, the South African fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry is facing new challenges. Composed of two distinct players, the FMCG manufacturer and the retailer, the industry has traditionally relied on branding to stimulate purchase. A proliferation of brands clutter supermarket shelves, and the noise of mass marketing media combined with new media, makes building brand equity less effective. As such, the FMCG customer is becoming more important, and building Customer Equity will give organisations a competitive advantage. The purpose of this research report is to investigate the key drivers and sub-drivers of Customer Equity in the FMCG industry, and to determine their relative importance. Specifically, the research investigates the non-alcoholic ready to drink (NARTD) category within the FMCG market. Coca-cola, Pepsi and a house brand are {{measured in terms of}} performance against these sub-drivers. Data was collected from 216 respondents, using structured questionnaires. Data was collected over email surveys, via in-home and mall-intercept surveys. The literature highlights three key drivers of Customer Equity. These are value equity, brand equity and retention equity. Six industry experts interviewed in the qualitative analysis verified that these key drivers are appropriate in the FMCG industry in South Africa. A principle components factor analysis was used to determine the sub-drivers of each key driver, and the relative importance of each was determined. A key highlight is that value equity is disproportionately more important compared to brand and retention equity. Taste, a <b>sub-driver</b> of value equity, is the most important <b>sub-driver.</b> Coca-cola, Pepsi and a house brand were then compared to the seven product sub-drivers, to determine the relative performance of the key players in the category. Recommendations to the FMCG industry are offered. Recommendations are also made to the relevant organisations, to add perspective in terms of their marketing strategie...|$|E
40|$|MBA 2012 ABSTRACT The South African {{retail banking}} {{industry}} is facing new competitive challenges. The Competition Commission and the Treasurer are currently investigating ways increasing {{competition in the}} South African banking industry. It is expected that recommendations will be made resulting in changes {{to some of the}} operational and pricing aspects of the industry to make it more competitive. Another challenge is that customers increasingly expect banks to offer value that is comparable to the high cost of banking. This research report investigates the drivers of Customer Equity in the South African retail banking industry, and ranks these in order of importance. The research focuses on the four big banks: Standard Bank, ABSA, First National Bank and Nedbank. A review of the literature on Customer Equity highlighted three key drivers, which are: value equity, brand equity and retention equity. The focus groups validated these drivers as well as identified 19 sub-drivers. 192 Respondents were asked to rate the importance of the sub-drivers on a scale of 1 - 5 and then rate the performance of their banks on these drivers. A Principal Components Analysis was used to analyse the results of the quantitative survey and determined the relative importance of each of the sub-drivers as well as the performance of South Africa’s Big Four banks. Value Equity was found to be disproportionately more important compared to Brand and Retention Equity. The most important <b>sub-driver</b> was Reliability of banking systems, which is a <b>sub-driver</b> of Value Equity. Recommendations are made on how South African Retail banks can improve their marketing strategies to maximize Customers Equity. These recommendations are based on the relative importance of the identified sub-drivers as well as the performance of the banks...|$|E
40|$|For multi-Gb/s/pin {{parallel}} dynamic {{random access}} memory (DRAM) interface, a crosstalk cancelling voltage-mode driver is proposed. The voltage-mode driver is composed of a main driver and <b>sub-drivers</b> where the cancellation signal is generated by the <b>sub-drivers.</b> The outputs of the main driver and <b>sub-drivers</b> are combined by a capacitive coupling so the direct current (DC) output swing is not affected by the crosstalk cancellation and the <b>sub-drivers</b> may not consume DC power. The proposed crosstalk cancelling voltage-mode driver implemented in a 0. 11 -mu m complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology improves the horizontal eye openings by 22. 6 ps at 4 -Gbps/pin.

40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT The {{speed at}} which {{technology}} is progressing forces organisations to constantly evaluate their marketing approach to become or remain successful. The multitude of smartphone options available to the consumer when selecting a device encourages manufacturers {{to move away from}} marketing a product and instead adapt their approach to market to the customer. Customer equity led marketing strategy concentrates an organisation’s attention on the core drivers that increase a firm’s profit earned from customers over their lifetimes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the customer equity performance of smartphone manufacturers in South Africa. The objective is to determine the drivers and <b>sub-drivers</b> of customer equity, measure their relative importance and evaluate the manufacturers performance against these drivers. Literature and qualitative interviews with local industry experts were used to determine the drivers and <b>sub-drivers</b> for South Africa specifically. This formed the basis for the quantitative measurement instrument in a mixed methodology approach. A sample of 136 respondents, who purchased a smartphone in the last 2 years, completed the online survey. Data was collected on the importance of the drivers and <b>sub-drivers</b> and the relative performance of the smartphone brands against the customer equity drivers. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse and interpret the data qualifying the drawn conclusions. The main drivers of customer equity were determined as value equity, brand equity and relationship equity, with value equity broken down into quality and price. Quality carries the highest importance for customers. The results of the individual <b>sub-drivers</b> and the brands performance therein are further explored. Recommendations were made thereafter to the smartphone manufacturers to improve their performance in the South African smartphone market...|$|R

40|$|MBA thesisThe South African vehicle {{market is}} on the way to {{recovering}} from the effects of the global financial crisis. Vehicle manufacturers are under pressure to increase sales volumes in an environment where more brands and models are entering the market, and the year on year sales growth is declining. Marketers need to focus their strategies around a customer-focused approach to Customer Equity as opposed to the traditional product-focused approach. Improving their Customer Equity will allow manufacturers to become more competitive and increase the lifetime value of their current and future customers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the drivers of customer equity in the South African sports utility vehicle (SUV) market. The main objective is to identify the drivers and <b>sub-drivers</b> of Customer Equity together with their relative importance and to evaluate the performance of the South African SUV brands against these drivers. The research follows a mixed method approach whereby the qualitative study together with the literature review makes up the measuring instrument that is used in the quantitative study. The quantitative study has a sample of 106 respondents who currently own and drive SUV’s. Respondents completed an online questionnaire from which data was collected on the importance and relative performance of SUV brands against the Customer Equity drivers. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse and interpret the data to draw conclusions. Three main groups of Customer Equity drivers were identified together with twenty underlying <b>sub-drivers.</b> Brand, Relationship, and Value are the main drivers with the Value driver carrying the highest importance for SUV customers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-A novel {{high and}} low speed output buffer circuit is {{proposed}} for Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface applications. Operation principles of this novel buffer are developed based on slew rate control and delayed turn-on technique. The mechanism for slew rate control is process variation self compensating. So, both precise rise and fall times of the output signal have been obtained for low speed operation. Moreover, the pull-up and pull-down output drivers are divided into several <b>sub-drivers</b> in parallel with the delayed turn-on characteristics. Therefore, the change of rate of di/dt decreases. And the simultaneous switching noise, based on simulations, are reduced from maximum overshoot 3. 47 V to 3. 36 V and maximum undershoot from- 0. 427 V to- 0. 068 V, respectively. This proposed output buffer design is low cost due to its easy realization in a digital CMOS process. The disclosed output buffer has been integrated in a complete USB transceiver circuit. Based on measured silicon data, satisfactory functions of the whole USB application IC have been obtained...|$|R
40|$|MBA thesisOrganisations {{increasingly}} {{require a}} firm {{understanding of what}} drives customers {{to do business with}} them and to continue doing business with them into the future. More importantly however is that organisations need to adopt an inward facing view or customer centric approach if they are to become or remain relevant in the hyper competitive consumer electronics market. As product differentiation becomes more difficult to achieve in mature markets organisations need to shift their focus from their self-stated drivers to the drivers and <b>sub-drivers</b> of importance as stated by their customers –customer equity drivers. Customer equity is a metric used by marketers to assign value to the intangible concept of their customers. This approach sums the lifetime values ofan organisation’s current and future customers {{in order to determine the}} value of the organisation. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the customer equity performance of South African Information Technology (IT) consumer notebook vendors. Specifically, thisresearch aims to determine thecustomer equity drivers and their relative importance and to evaluate theperformance of the South African IT vendors against these drivers. The existing approaches to customer equity were reviewed and the Driver modelwas selected as the appropriate model for evaluating the South African consumer notebook industry. A sample of 80 respondents who have purchased a consumer notebook within South Africa was used. Respondents completed an online questionnaire to collect data on the importanceand performance of IT vendorsrelative to customer equity. Statistical analysis wasconducted through CommonFactor Analysis. This resulted in a model that was interpreted to determine thedrivers of customer equity, their relative importance and the performance of IT vendors within South Africa. Recommendations were then made to vendors to improve theirperformanc...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSThis {{research}} report aims {{to define the}} drivers of Customer Equity in the South African Consulting industry. The Driver Model of Customer Equity was used to formulate this research. This report uses a supply-side qualitative survey, and a demand-side quantitative survey to test if the propositions put forward from the literature review and the qualitative survey held true. The identification of the drivers was done through the literature review, and the qualitative survey that was conducted among the suppliers of management consulting services. Five supply-side managers and senior practitioners within consulting firms {{were used in the}} qualitative round; the research instrument was a semi-structured interview. The quantitative survey was designed to elicit demand-side responses about what customers considered as important in choosing a consulting firm. The quantitative survey had 36 respondents. The responses to the quantitative questionnaire were tested using a distribution fitting approach and exploratory factor analysis. The distribution fitting approach found the following attributes within the drivers of customer equity to be significantly important: Value Equity - the quality of services rendered; Brand Equity – the customer’s perception of brand ethics, based on the <b>sub-drivers</b> of ethical behaviour and the high regard received from the community/ society; Industry Specific Drivers – the ability to deliver based on a proven track record of successful delivery, as well as the knowledge and intellectual capability of the firm, based on the drivers of intellectual ability and having the right calibre of people to get the job done. The exploratory factor analysis helped to show the interdependent relationships among the variables in the quantitative questionnaire and the underlying constructs that existed in the responses. The factor analysis resulted in a 5 - factor solution. The factors obtained were described as: Familiarity, Value, Low-risk, Brand and Retention or Prior experience based purchase decision...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{increasingly}} acknowledged {{as one of}} the greatest threats facing humanity in the 21 st century. Given the enormity of the potential impact of global warming, worldwide collective action from all sectors of society appears to be the only appropriate way to address the problem. Within the corporate sector companies appear to be responding to the threat through the introduction of climate change mitigation strategies. Understanding the motivations driving such action could provide insights into how best to engage companies to ensure a sustainable future. The purpose of this study was to determine the motivation for corporate investment in sustainability projects, with a focus on the voluntary climate change mitigation actions of South African companies. The first phase of the study focused on conceptual research through a literature review which investigated sustainability in a corporate context with a view to understanding motivational drivers. The second phase of the study empirically tested the insights obtained from the literature. The literature review led to the development of a proposed conceptual framework which illustrated proposed linkages between business and the natural environment. The key motivational drivers supporting these linkages appeared to be legitimacy concerns, the financial business case and moral responsibility. The empirical phase took the form of an exploratory case study focused on six South African companies across three industries. An interpretive research process was followed using pattern models to analyse the data. To enhance transparency and rigour, qualitative data analysis software was used in the analytical process. Three key areas were investigated and the main findings were as follows: Overview of sustainability values: The sustainability values of the companies reflected top management commitment to environmental issues and a shift away from a purely technocentric view of the business relationship with the natural environment however, these sentiments were not necessarily translated into actions. Motivations for sustainability initiatives: As suggested by the proposed conceptual framework, company motivations were driven by legitimacy concerns, the financial business case and moral responsibility. In addition, the study revealed a number of <b>sub-drivers</b> which provided additional information regarding motivations. Impact of voluntary action on company value: From a value perspective there was limited disclosure regarding the financial implications of climate change mitigation, however there was general agreement that the financial impact of mitigation action would be either neutral or positive as current strategies focus predominantly on energy and operational efficiencies. Therefore, while companies appear to be motivated by a range of factors, the key consideration in decisions taken focus predominantly on aspects linked to the current paradigm dominated by financial concerns. There is little evidence of an evolution of sustainability consciousness which could potentially lead to a new sustainable business paradigm. In light of these findings, it would appear that current solutions to climate change issues need to send financial signals to companies to ensure adoption of mitigation actions. Further work is required to understand what will drive a fundamental value shift in the way companies operate to ensure a sustainable future.
