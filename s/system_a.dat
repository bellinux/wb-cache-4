The randomized <b>system</b> has <b>a</b> trajectory induced by the trajectories of the original <b>systems.</b> <b>A</b> theorem is proved giving fairly general conditions under which the randomized system trajectory is generated by a strongly continuous semigroup of bounded linear operators in a Banach space. An example is presented for <b>a</b> <b>system</b> represented by <b>a</b> quadratic integral operator. 1...|$|R
