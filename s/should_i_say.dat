Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was {{involved}} in, as hinted {{in the opening}} couplet: [...] "I once had a girl, or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> she once had me". Though Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave, or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue (e.g. in guitarist Peter Asher's bedroom). McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: [...] "In our world the guy had {{to have some sort}} of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental." ...|$|E

500|$|On 1 March, Diamandis {{unveiled}} the album artwork {{for the standard}} version of Electra Heart, which depicts a blonde Diamandis wearing several hair rollers. The singer later revealed {{that because of the}} dye, her hair started to fall out, so she got a boy's haircut and wore a wig. Becky Bain from Idolator complimented its [...] "retro film stock look" [...] and opined that it [...] "is just a snapshot from some 1970s exploitation movie", while Bradley Stern from MuuMuse jokingly referenced the album track [...] "Homewrecker" [...] when stating that she [...] "looks like a proper Suzy Homemaker! (Or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> Suzy Homewrecker?)" [...] The artwork for the deluxe version features the same picture of Diamandis, although it is tinted purple. The track listing for the standard version was confirmed on 1 March, while the track listing for the deluxe version was announced on 5 March. A limited edition box set of Electra Heart contained the deluxe version of the record, four photo art cards, a ring, perspex, necklace, and pocket mirror.|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} mixed point of {{views on the}} episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres [...] "desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern" [...] helped the episode reach {{a high level of}} entertainment: [...] "The look, or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched by the look she gave to George when he opened the door, clearly ready for Callie once more." [...] She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing [...] "a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as [...] "unhealthy" [...] for the evolution of his [...] "fresh relationship" [...] with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that [...] "it was kind of funny to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode".|$|E

2500|$|Since 2008, Android {{has seen}} {{numerous}} updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named {{in alphabetical order}} after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being called [...] "Cupcake", [...] "Donut", [...] "Eclair", and [...] "Froyo", respectively. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that [...] "Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert", although a Google spokesperson told CNN {{in an interview that}} [...] "It’s kind of like an internal team thing, and we prefer {{to be a little bit}} — how <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> — a bit inscrutable in the matter, I’ll say".|$|E
2500|$|According to Girard, the {{substitution}} of an immolated victim for the first, is [...] "the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids". [...] Girard also says {{this is the first}} time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of representation and language, but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: [...] "It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Minister of Agriculture Gerry Ritz, who {{has already}} been criticized by Canada's food {{scientists}} for {{his handling of the}} 2008 listeriosis outbreak, has also been criticized for making inappropriate comments, further angering the families of those affected. Ritz had joked about the outbreak while he was on a conference call with scientists and political staffers on August 30, saying the political fallout from the outbreak was [...] "like a death by a thousand cuts, or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> cold cuts". In addition, when he was informed of a listeriosis-related death in Prince Edward Island, he quipped: [...] "Please tell me it's [...] Wayne Easter". Despite calls for Ritz's resignation from the other parties and the public, Stephen Harper has supported Ritz and rebuffed calls for his resignation.|$|E

2500|$|On September 17, 2008, Agricultural Minister Gerry Ritz made {{national}} news when comments he made on an August 30, 2008 {{conference call with}} government officials were made public. Ritz was quoted as saying, [...] "This is like a death by a thousand cuts. Or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> cold cuts." [...] Then, when told of a death in Prince Edward Island, Ritz said, [...] "Please tell me it's (Liberal MP) Wayne Easter." [...] Ritz apologized for his remarks, but various groups called for his resignation. New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton responded by saying, [...] "Canadians are dying because of the mismanagement of our government... there should absolutely never {{be that kind of}} humour.... It illustrates the government is not taking this matter as seriously as they should." [...] A spokesman for Prime Minister Harper released a statement saying Ritz's comments were tasteless and completely inappropriate. Stephen Harper refused to seek Ritz's resignation.|$|E
2500|$|However {{although}} {{words are}} occasionally {{shown to be}} powerful and deeply persuasive, they also often fail in their signifying role, exposed as incapable of adequately representing reality. This idea is introduced by Gloucester at Henry V's funeral, where he laments that words cannot encompass the life of such a great king: [...] "What <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> His deeds exceed all speech" [...] (1.1.15). Later, when Gloucester and Winchester confront one another outside the Tower of London, Gloucester champions the power of real action over the power of threatening words: [...] "I will not answer thee with words but blows" [...] (1.3.69). Similarly, after the French capture Rouen and refuse to meet the English army in the battlefield, Bedford asserts, [...] "O let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason" [...] (3.2.48). Another example {{of the failure of}} language is found when Suffolk finds himself lost for words whilst attempting to woo Margaret: [...] "Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak./I'll call for pen and ink and write my mind./Fie, de la Pole, disable not thyself!/Hast not a tongue?" [...] (5.4.21–24). Later, Joan's words, so successful during the play in convincing others to support her, explicitly fail to save her life, as she is told by Warwick, [...] "Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee./Use no entreaty, for it is in vain" [...] (5.5.84–85).|$|E
2500|$|Tolstoy's poetry {{had certain}} qualities {{that made it}} unusual and even unique, one being the [...] "half-spoken" [...] nature of the verse. [...] "It's good for poetry when a thought is only half-fulfilled, so that readers can {{complete}} it – each in their own way," [...] he explained {{in a letter to}} Sophia Miller in 1854. This view translated into a technique of writing. One of the things Tolstoy was criticized and even jeered for were [...] "bad rhymes" [...] which he used consciously, as part of his [...] "poetic system". [...] "Imperfect rhyming, if kept in bounds of course, can be seen as corresponding to the Venetian school in painting which with little imperfections, or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> carelessnesses, could achieve the kind of effects which Raphael wouldn't dream of for all of his precision," [...] Tolstoy wrote in 1859. In fact, Tolstoy, as I. Yampolsky pointed out, was a master of versification. Consciously imposed [...] "careless" [...] rhyming gave his poems an improvisational tone (with [...] "an impression of thoughts being put to paper exactly in the form they were born") but behind it there was hard work and much editing. [...] "Tolstoy's verse is so simple it hardly rises above prose, yet the poetic impression it carries is perfectly full," [...] critic Nikolay Strakhov wrote in 1867. Another unusual feature of Tolstoy's poems was the fact that, while rather salon-like and graceful both in nature and form, they were full of 'simplistic' bits borrowed freely from common talk and traditional Russian folklore. Kept in perfect balance, these tinged his verse with a peculiar, musical quality. More than half of Tolstoy's poems have been put to music by leading Russian composers like Tchaykovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Musorgsky, Mily Balakirev, Cesar Cui, Anton Rubinstein, Sergey Rakhmaninov and others. [...] "Tolstoy is the unfathomable well of poems crying for music. For me {{he is one of the}} most attractive poets," [...] wrote Tchaykovsky.|$|E

"Well," [...] he declared, a resentment {{beneath his}} words seeming ready to spring {{out at a}} moment's notice, [...] "God forbid that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am a good man--and you know <b>I</b> don't <b>say</b> any such thing.
