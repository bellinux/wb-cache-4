40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel measurement method to accurately measure the rotating <b>shaft</b> tilt <b>angle</b> of rotating machine for alignment or compensation using a dual-axis inclinometer. A {{model of the}} rotating <b>shaft</b> tilt <b>angle</b> measurement is established using a dual-axis inclinometer based on the designed mechanical structure, and the calculation equation between the rotating <b>shaft</b> tilt <b>angle</b> and the inclinometer axes outputs is derived {{under the condition that}} the inclinometer axes are perpendicular to the rotating shaft. The reversal measurement method is applied to decrease the effect of inclinometer drifts caused by temperature, to eliminate inclinometer and rotating shaft mechanical error and inclinometer systematic error to attain high measurement accuracy. The uncertainty estimation shows that the accuracy of rotating <b>shaft</b> tilt <b>angle</b> measurement depends mainly on the inclinometer uncertainty and its uncertainty is almost the same as the inclinometer uncertainty in the simulation. The experimental results indicate that measurement time is 4 seconds; the range of rotating <b>shaft</b> tilt <b>angle</b> is 0. 002 ° and its standard deviation is 0. 0006 ° using NS- 5 /P 2 inclinometer, whose precision and resolution are ± 0. 01 ° and 0. 0005 °, respectively...|$|R

It had a twin cylinder 10-degree cylinder angle with a 360-degree crank <b>shaft</b> <b>angle</b> engine which meant the pistons moved together and reached top dead centre (TDC) and bottom dead centre (BDC) at the same time. It was a detuned version of the Honda CD185 twin. The engine had the same bore as the CD185 but low compression pistons (8.8:1) with a bore and stroke of 53.0 x 44.0 mm, compared to 9.0:1 Compression and 53.0 x 41.0 mm for the CD185. The result was less power, a higher fuel economy and a lower top speed. The alternator system was also different from the CD185.

The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.|$|E
50|$|Coxa vara is a {{deformity}} of the hip, {{whereby the}} angle between {{the head and}} the shaft of the femur is reduced to less than 120 degrees. This results in the leg being shortened, {{and the development of}} a limp. It is commonly caused by injury, such as a fracture. It can also occur when the bone tissue in the neck of the femur is softer than normal, causing it to bend under the weight of the body. This may either be congenital or the result of a bone disorder. The most common cause of coxa vara is either congenital or developmental. Other common causes include metabolic bone diseases (e.g. Paget's disease of bone), post-Perthes deformity, osteomyelitis, and post traumatic (due to improper healing of a fracture between the greater and lesser trochanter). Shepherd's Crook deformity is a severe form of coxa vara where the proximal femur is severely deformed with a reduction in the neck <b>shaft</b> <b>angle</b> beyond 90 degrees. It is most commonly a sequela of osteogenesis imperfecta, Pagets disease, osteomyelitis, tumour and tumour-like conditions (e.g. fibrous dysplasia).|$|E

40|$|In the dual-axis {{rotation}} {{inertial navigation}} system (INS), besides the gyro error, accelerometer error, rolling misalignment angle error, and the gimbal <b>angle</b> error, the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and the axis non-orthogonal angle also affect the attitude accuracy. Through {{the analysis of the}} structure, we can see that the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and axis non-orthogonal angle will produce coning errors which cause the fluctuation of the attitude. According to the analysis of the rotation vector, {{it can be seen that}} the coning error will generate additional drift velocity along the rotating shaft, which can reduce the navigation precision of the system. In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the static condition, the <b>shaft</b> swing <b>angle</b> and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF). This kind of KF method has been widely recognized as the standard optimal estimation tool for estimating the parameters such as coning angles (α 1, α 2), initial phase angles (ϕ 1,ϕ 2), and the non-perpendicular angle (η). In order to carry out the system level verification, a dual axis rotation INS is designed. Through simulation and experiments, the results show that the amplitudes of the attitude angles’ variation are reduced by about 20 %– 30 % when the shaft rotates. The attitude error equation is reasonably simplified and the calibration method is accurate enough. The attitude accuracy is further improved...|$|R
