When the arm of the pendulum is set up to miss the flooring completely, the arm swings up to parallel from where it started, and the pointer (brought along by the arm holding the rubber slider) reads zero.

5000|$|See [...] "external links" [...] at {{the bottom}} of this page for more {{information}} on the inadequacies of the C1028 test. Suffering from stiction and the fact that the measurement taken is a measure of how slippery a surface is when someone is standing still on it (which is irrelevant to the measuring of the slip resistance to a person walking over the surface - where almost every accident occurs), methods such as C1028-07, the James Machine, and the ASM 725/825A have very limited use in assessing wet floor friction and should not be solely relied upon. These static test methods can be used to monitor changes in slip potential over time, but are not reliable tests for determining slip resistance of flooring. For example, static tests can be conducted before and after a fresh coat of wax is applied to a floor to make sure the SCOF has not changed dramatically with the new wax, or readings can be taken at various times during a business day to make sure that dirt and dust is not making the flooring slip situation worse throughout the day. Monitoring changes in dry SCOF can be a useful practice. However, SCOF tests should never be used to determine if a floor is slippery when wet. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has recommended an SCOF of 0.50 for workplace environments, but often flooring having a rating of 0.60 or greater (supposedly even more <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> than 0.50 flooring) is proven by reliable test devices (and multiple slip and fall accident victims) to be very, very slippery when wet using this test method. This ASTM test standard has expired, and there are no plans to renew it as it has caused more confusion than anything else.|$|E

According the formula of squeeze film, when the floor is contaminated with liquid, the higher the liquid viscosity the longer time to connect shoes with floor, the higher the risk of falling. The appropriate roughness of floor surface could be effective to improve the squeeze film effect caused by liquid while the floor is contaminated by liquid or oil. In kitchens, oil, sauces and liquid with higher viscosity are easily spread on floor. Therefore, this study discussed the influences of liquid viscosity and floor roughness upon slip-resistance effect adopting two shoe materials, six liquid with different viscosity and six floors with different roughness. The results demonstrate that the higher the liquid viscosity the lower the coefficient of friction. No matter how rough the floor is, the coefficient of friction approaches zero while the viscosity larger than 38 mPa. s. With the liquid (water or soda) viscosities were lower than 2 mPa. s, the <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> effect only shown as the floor roughness (Ra) was larger than 28 μm and Rtm was greater than 145 μm.

The aim is to characterise a method of connection that could be fatigue and <b>slip</b> <b>resistant.</b> For comparison, tests are also carried out on standard bolted connections without resin and with 2 mm clearance holes. Slip in joints is a major issue in bridge engineering, which has to be controlled if the structural scheme is to perform satisfactorily over its service life. The transfer of connection force in FRP joints, by way of frictional force, say by using High Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolts, cannot be relied upon [1], because steel bolting is known to lose its pre-tension with time due to the viscoelastic properties of the FRP. The aim of our preliminary study is to offer a potential solution to developing a suitable <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> connection.

The main objective of this study was the comparison of slip resistance variations caused by traffic wear and accelerative wear. The second objective was to ascertain the effect of wear, and to find out the causes of slip resistance change. Although statistical differences were observed between results of traffic wear and accelerative wear, the trend of the variations of slip resistance caused by traffic wear and accelerative wear was very similar. The measured slip resistance of tested floor changed up to 29 %(and 26. 5 %) after 100, 000 steps(and 750 cycles). As the traffic wear and accelerative wear were progressed, the surface roughness of the tested floor became smoother, and so the floor became more slippery under the wet condition. The abraded(worn out) floor surface tended to become hydrophilic surface, while the new floor surface tended to show hydrophobic nature. This phenomenon woul...|$|E

40|$|Slip {{and fall}} {{accidents}} and associated injuries on {{ice and snow}} are prevalent among outdoor workers {{and the general public}} in winter in many regions of the world. To understand and tackle this multi-factorial problem, a multidisciplinary approach was used to identify and evaluate slip and fall risks, and to propose recommendations for prevention of slips and falls on icy and snowy surfaces. Objectives were to present a systems perspective of slip and fall accidents and related risk factors; to evaluate the integration of slip resistance, thermal insulation, and usability of footwear by subjective trials. Further, to study the interaction mechanisms between footwear soling material and ice; to investigate and describe the relationship of ice and snow living experience and participation in winter sports with slips and falls; and to explain the role and mechanisms of lower extremity muscles in maintaining gait dynamic balance on inclined icy surface. The following methods were applied: 1) a systematic analysis of multiple risk factors through literature review; 2) direct observation; 3) videotaping; 4) subjective evaluations of slipperiness, thermal comfort and usability using rating scales; 5) a tribological study of the Coefficient of Friction (COF); 6) a questionnaire survey to identify and evaluate risk factors related to slips and falls; 7) a biomechanical study of human locomotion on ice. A systematic analysis of slips and falls on icy and snowy surfaces made it possible to use a multi-faceted approach to evaluation and prevention. The slip resistance, thermal insulation and usability of footwear tested were not suitably integrated, indicating the need of improving anti-slip properties and usability of footwear for use in cold environments. The artificially abrasive wear of soling materials improved slip resistance on hard ice, but not on melting ice. When comparing hard ice, melting ice and lubricated steel surfaces, the highest slip resistance was observed on hard ice, then on lubricated steel plate. Melting ice was most slippery. Curling footwear with crepe rubber soling showed significantly higher COF than other types. The footwear tested included winter footwear, professional footwear, safety footwear, and footwear considered to be <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> by manufacturers did not provide adequate protection against slips and falls on melting ice. Thus, additional measures should be taken to reduce slip and fall risk on melting ice. Slip and fall events declined with increased living experience in cold environments and winter sports participation. Biomechanical studies showed both increased and decreased magnitudes of gait muscle activities (EMG) at different gait phases and a generating of cautious gait strategies with an anticipated icy surface. These findings provided insights into how the proactive kinetic and kinematic adjustments of gait are achieved and the control mechanisms of stabilizing gait and posture through certain muscle activities when ascending on an icy slope. The mechanisms identified may be applied to develop intervention, rehabilitation and training techniques, which prevent slip and fall risks and associated injuries on icy surfaces and to improve performance in human locomotion, e. g., for winter sports. Measurement methods of slipperiness on ice and snow, related standards, task-related factors, <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> footwear, and intervention programs should be further studied and developed.

The purpose of the study is to analyze the effects of alternative footwear [crocs (CC), flip-flops (FF) ] and industry standard <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> shoes (LT) on ground reaction forces (GRFs) during slip events. Eighteen healthy male participants following a repeated measures design for each footwear condition, were tested for heel kinematics during normal dry surface gait (NG); unexpected slip (US), alert slip (AS) and expected slip (ES). A 3 x 4 repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the dependent vertical GRFs parameters (Mean Z-GRF and Peak Z-GRF) at p = 0. 05. Significant interactions between footwear and gait trials were found for Mean Z-GRF and significant main effect in gait trials for Peak Z-GRF were evident. On average significantly lower GRFs were seen in slip trials compared to normal gait. FF exhibited significantly lower GRFs during slip trials while LT demonstrated lower GRFs in normal gait. The reduced ground reaction forces during all slip events compared to normal gait {{can be attributed to the}} incomplete weight transfer on the slipping foot during the unexpected and alert slips and to the anticipation of the slippery environment in expected slips. Flip flops which had greater incidence of slips also demonstrated reduced GRFs compared to CC and LT during slip events, further suggesting incomplete weight transfer, while during normal gait, LT demonstrated reduced GRFs compared to alternative footwear owing to its cushioning midsole properties. The LT with lowest incidence of slips demonstrates to be the choice of footwear for maneuvering slippery flooring conditions and for reducing impact reaction forces during non-slippery flooring conditions.

40|$|Footwear sole wear {{by natural}} use or {{artificial}} abrasion either increases or decreases slip resistance on floors {{with and without}} lubricant. The objectives of this paper were to study the effect of footwear sole abrasive wear on slip resistance on ice with respect to temperature, and to compare the slip resistance of abraded soles on melting and hard ice with that on lubricated steel plate. The kinetic coefficient of friction (COF) of nine pairs of footwear were measured with the stationary step simulator developed at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, {{before and after the}} new footwear soles were artificially abraded. Two-way factorial ANOVA showed that the abrasion of nine pairs of footwear had no significant effect on COF on melting ice (Mean COF with abrasion= 0. 056, std= 0. 0158, COF without abrasion= 0. 055, std= 0. 0205, P= 0. 805). On hard ice, however, the COF of abraded soles measured (mean COF= 0. 244) was significantly higher than without abrasion (mean COF= 0. 180, p< 0. 001), and than abraded soles on lubricated steel (mean= 0. 137, p< 0. 001). There is statistical significance between the three types of surfaces (p< 0. 001). On hard ice, regardless of abrasion, curling footwear with crepe rubber soling showed significantly higher COF (mean= 0. 343 after abrasion, 0. 261 before abrasion) than other types (p< 0. 001). The results indicate that artificially abraded footwear is more <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> than new one for use on hard ice. The abrasion requirement could be specified if developing a new standard to measure COF on ice in the future. Of the footwear measured, the curling footwear with crepe rubber soling performed best in terms of slip resistance property. Therefore, Crepe rubber soling is highly recommended for use on hard ice.

40|$|Roads and {{pavements}} {{covered with}} {{ice and snow}} during winter in the Nordic and other cold regions are slippery, which result in the prevalence of slip and fall accidents among not only the public, but also outdoor workers. Literature and injury statistics revealed that the most frequently specified contributory factor for occupational slip, trip and fall accidents in Sweden is snow and ice. Road accident research showed that the largest numbers of traffic casualties occurred during walking, followed by cycling and vehicle transporting. The cost to the community of providing medical treatment to victims of pedestrian injuries resulting from slipping is far {{greater than that of}} keeping walking surfaces free from ice and snow. However, in comparison with the size of the problem, little research has been carried out to identify and evaluate slip and fall risk on icy surfaces. Objectives are to present a systems perspective of slip and fall accident, to measure, evaluate and compare the coefficient of friction (COF) of footwear on ice and lubricated floor, to identify advantages of walking experience on icy surface and participating in winter sport in preventing slip and fall accidents, to develop subjective evaluation method for slipperiness measurement and usability assessment of footwear product, to systematically assess the integration of slip resistance, thermal insulation, and usability of footwear, to ascertain the anti-slip effect of materials spread on ice by user trials, and to explore the incorporated approach towards the design of footwear for use on icy surfaces. The following methods of collecting data were used in studies of this thesis: 1) direct observation, 2) videotaping, 3) human perception rating scale, 4) objective COF measurements, 5) retrospective cross-sectional epidemiological study by questionnaire. a systems model involving potential factors was proposed based on a comprehensive literature review (study I). Comparison of objective evaluation of footwear slipperiness on ice and oily floor was used to examine the frictional performance on different underfoot surfaces (study II). Epidemiological survey of slip and fall accidents was carried out focusing on individual experience, winter participation, severity of injuries, footwear, and underfoot surface conditions (study III). Subjective rating scale was developed and used to assess the perception of slip and fall risk and the usability of footwear used on various icy surfaces including anti slip materials spread on ice (study IV). The integration of multiple protection function and usability into winter footwear was also assessed (study IV). A systematic analysis of the slips and falls on icy and snowy surfaces showed that the etiology of slips and falls is multi-faceted. The COF on ice by objective measurements at 0 ºC is much lower than that at - 12 ºC and that on stainless steel. Polyurethane soling material did not provide sufficient friction on wet ice at least when new (without abrasion), although superior on lubricated floors. The footwear tested including winter footwear, professional footwear, safety footwear, and footwear deemed to be <b>slip</b> <b>resistant</b> by users and manufacturers did not provide sufficient protection against slips and falls on wet ice at around 0 ºC. Accordingly, slip and fall risk is higher on wet ice than on dry ice and lubricated floor. Slip and fall events reduced with increased living experience in cold environments and winter sport participation. Newcomers with no or less experience were prone to falling, and therefore they should be well informed of potential slip and fall hazards upon arrival in cold region. Slip resistance, thermal insulation and usability of footwear tested were not properly integrated. In addition to thermal insulation, prevention of slip and fall hazard by improving anti-slip property and usability must also be priorities for development of footwear for use in cold environments. Based on the findings, anti-slip footwear, measurement methods for slipperiness on ice and snow, related standards, the role of gait biomechanics and task-related factors should be further developed and studied.

40|$|Falls {{represent}} a serious hazard to workers in many industries. Workers who perform tasks at elevation - {{workers in the}} construction, structural metal working, and tree trimming industries, for example - {{are at risk of}} falls from heights, with frequently grave or even fatal consequences. Many more workers, in nearly every industry, are subject to falls to floors, walkways or ground surfaces. These falls, characterized as fall on the same level, are responsible for well over half of nonfatal injuries that result in days away from work. The etiology of falls as injury-producing events is multi-factorial, and encompasses multiple mechanisms of exposure. Working at heights involves completely different fall risks than those found on workplace surfaces and floors. The different exposures represent serious safety risks in both cases, resulting in fatal and serious nonfatal injury. To address the various causes of multi-factorial events such as these, there needs to be wide-ranging and multidisciplinary injury-mitigation approaches provided to practitioners based {{on a wide variety of}} research methods. To advance our knowledge of occupational fall injuries, the International Conference on Fall Prevention and Protection (ICFPP), held in May of 2010, was convened to provide a forum for researchers from NIOSH, its stakeholders, and the community of fall-prevention specialists and experts to present research findings, recommendations and expert advice on the latest tools and methods to reduce the incidence of injury from falls. At the conference, a wide variety of research approaches and methods were presented, and these approaches reflected the multidisciplinary orientation of the different stakeholders in attendance, as well as the individual interests and expertise of participating researchers.
