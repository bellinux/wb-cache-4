5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that <b>signs</b> are iconically self-explanatory, {{that they}} are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even {{that they are}} pantomime. In fact, many <b>signs</b> bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of <b>signs</b> resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some <b>signs</b> are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of <b>signs,</b> while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some <b>signs</b> are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E

5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical <b>signs</b> associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant <b>signs</b> include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such <b>signs</b> entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such <b>signs</b> or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E

5|$|The <b>signs</b> s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of <b>signs</b> gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (r's, x's, y's) is a solution, with <b>signs</b> s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite <b>signs</b> −s'i, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E

5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: <b>signs,</b> meanings, and a code connecting <b>signs</b> with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how <b>signs</b> and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. <b>Signs</b> can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex <b>signs,</b> such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of <b>signs</b> governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular <b>signs</b> to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
