40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{numerical}} implementations {{of a new}} biaxial {{fabric of}} interlaced yarns model for ballistic impact into flexible body armor are presented. First the model is applied to a <b>single-layer</b> <b>panel</b> of polyethylene Dyneema ® fibers in a matrix and impacted by various projectile geometries. We obtain the model results from a mass-spring, finite-difference model by modifying the code first developed at DSM. The results of the model are compared with experimental results and our previous biaxial model from firing 9 mm and FSP projectiles into Dyneema ® panels. For both models, parametric studies are presented using 2 -D and 3 -D graphics. The new biaxial interlaced yarns model extends our previous biaxial and axisymmetric membrane model by addressing biaxial influences on material inflow to the impact cone. The new model is much more complete and produces velocity, strain and deformation histories for the full system up to perforation or projectile halting. It can also treat cases of mixing different fabric types, which can result in interference effects depending on the layer stacking order, and can treat multiple layers with air gaps in between, where we will show that such gaps can seriously degrade performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} design {{concept for}} aerogel vacuum thermal-insulation panels calls {{for multiple layers}} of aerogel sandwiched between layers of aluminized Mylar (or equivalent) poly(ethylene terephthalate), as depicted in the figure. This concept is applicable to both the rigid (brick) form and the flexible (blanket) form of aerogel vacuum thermal-insulation panels. Heretofore, the fabrication of a typical aerogel vacuum insulating panel has involved encapsulation of a single layer of aerogel in poly(ethylene terephthalate) and pumping of gases out of the aerogel-filled volume. A multilayer panel according to the improved design concept is fabricated in basically the same way: Multiple alternating layers of aerogel and aluminized poly(ethylene terephthalate) are assembled, then encapsulated in an outer layer of poly(ethylene terephthalate), and then the volume containing the multilayer structure is evacuated as in the single-layer case. The multilayer concept {{makes it possible to}} reduce effective thermal conductivity of a panel below that of a comparable <b>single-layer</b> <b>panel,</b> without adding weight or incurring other performance penalties. Implementation of the multilayer concept is simple and relatively inexpensive, involving only a few additional fabrication steps to assemble the multiple layers prior to evacuation. For a panel of the blanket type, the multilayer concept, affords the additional advantage of reduced stiffness...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} made {{of the effect of}} {{lamination}} and material parameters of thermally stressed multilayer composite panels on the strain energy and its sensitivity coefficients obtained by the three-dimensional thermoelasticity model. The sensitivity coefficients measure the sensitivity of the strain energy to variations in the different lamination and material parameters of the panel. The strain energy and sensitivity coefficients obtained by the three-dimensional model are used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the corresponding quantities obtained by two-dimensional first-order shear deformation theory. Numerical results are presented for antisymmetrically laminated angle-ply panels subjected to linear temperature variation through the thickness. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the strain energy and its sensitivity coefficients obtained by the first-order shear deformation theory, for the range of parameters considered, and the importance of the particular terms in the strain energy, which vanish for <b>single-layer</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Novel Carbon Resource SciencesWe {{have devised}} {{a method that}} employs surface- and self-capacitive sensing {{principles}} for touch detection with a <b>single-layered</b> capacitive touch <b>panel.</b> In this method, a single electrode layer consisting of a stripe-shaped one-dimensional electrode array was used to enable multi-touch detection, and a capacitive sensing circuit that uses a trans-impedance amplifier was selected to simplify the circuit structure of the touch panel. The {{results indicate that the}} number of the panel fabrication processes and the amount of the touch electrode material required can be reduced by half by using the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectromagnetic {{scattering}} of a <b>single-layer</b> periodic composite <b>panel</b> is investigated. The panel {{is reinforced by}} a periodic array of infinite circular cylindrical fibers. A planar wave illuminates the panel with its wave vector orientated obliquely versus the fiber's axes. In this 2. 5 -D scattering case, full-wave field representation from multipole and plane-wave expansions yield reflection and transmission coefficients of the longitudinal field components, {{which is achieved by}} mode matching at the boundaries. Power reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained from time-averaged Poynting vectors. The work is a prerequisite for modeling electromagnetic nondestructive testing of composite panels, approaching a multilayered structure made by stacking periodic slabs one over the other being the next step...|$|R
30|$|The {{total length}} of the Ahmedabad-Rajkot {{national}} highway is 205 km, out of which the total effective length available is 185.4 km (based on the computation given in Table[*] 2; 185.4 km/ 1.78 km), and 104 MW is possible for the entire {{length of the}} highway. This way, for 104 -MW systems, the energy generation is 163 GWh. This is for a <b>single-layer</b> solar <b>panel</b> system. If the solar panels lay one above the other with 1 -m separation, the energy generation (Table[*] 3) increases to 190 GWh; for 2 -m separation, it is 216 GWh; and for 3 -m separation, it is 229 GWh. One should note here that these computations are based on 50 -kW systems as one unit and the direction of the national highway is oriented exactly in the east-west direction. Similar computations are shown in Table[*] 4 for the Ahmedabad-Vadodara national expressway. Here again, the computations are based on 50 -kW systems as one unit, and the solar panels are distributed in the south-north direction. Accordingly, 61 -MW electricity generation is possible for the Ahmedabad-Vadodara expressway, and 96 GWh of cumulative annual generation is possible for single layer, 115 GWh for two layers of 1 -m separation, 132 GWh for 2 -m panel separation, and 140 GWh for 3 -m separation, as presented in Table[*] 4.|$|R
30|$|Energy {{generation}} using {{solar photovoltaic}} requires large area. As {{cost of the}} land is growing day by day, there is a strong requirement to use the available land as efficiently as possible. Here, we explored the potential of energy generation using the land above national road highways by constructing a roof structure. This space can contribute to the energy generation without extra cost for the land. It also results in energy efficiency, for example, improved vehicle movement and minimum energy for air conditioning of vehicles. Additionally, it also helps in minimum road repairs and longer vehicle tire life due to the effect of sun shade. Thus, the expenditure for wear and tear for road repairs is reduced considerably. From our modelling study, it is observed that the Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway can generate 104 MW of electricity (163 GWh of annual energy generation) and the Ahmedabad-Vadodara highway space can generate 61 MW of electricity (96 GWh of annual energy generation) for <b>single-layer</b> solar <b>panels.</b> If there are two layers of solar panels one over the other, the annual energy generation of the same highways, Ahmedabad-Rajkot and Ahmedabad-Vadodara, can be increased to 229 GWh and 140 GWh, respectively. If our concept is implemented throughout India, it not only increases the power generation to more than a few gigawatts of electricity but also has other various fringe benefits including longer road life, employment generation, reduced CO 2 emission in environment, etc.|$|R
40|$|Oriented strandboard (OSB) is a wood-based {{composite}} manufactured from elongated wood-strands {{coated in}} a resin binder that are oriented and arranged in layers, cross-laminated and hot pressed to form large panels. OSB {{is a highly}} complex material that requires {{a large number of}} parameters to fully define its internal structure and mechanical behaviour. The variability of the defining parameters further adds to the complexity. Current design and production practices rely on highly-simplified, deterministic methods where many of the defining parameters and their variability are omitted and replaced with high safety factors. Reliability methods offer significant potential for improved efficiency in the OSB industry. However, such methods require knowledge of the stochastic properties, mechanical behaviour and relationships between parameters as well as appropriate modelling and analysis tools. In this thesis, a new approach to predicting the mechanical behaviour and associated variability of OSB/ 3 panels using a stochastic finite element model is developed. As part of the work, a large-scale experimental programme was undertaken that included over 2, 780 tests to evaluate 45 different physical and mechanical properties for commercial OSB/ 3 and <b>single-layer</b> OSB <b>panels.</b> This provided the necessary information to evaluate the stochastic properties, mechanical behaviour and correlations between parameters. The Anderson-Darling method was used to establish suitable probabilistic models to describe the variability of each parameter. The Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient was used to describe relationships between the parameters. Using regression analysis, suitable mathematical models to accurately represent the orthotropic, non-linear mechanical behaviour of OSB subjected to tension, compression, bending and panel-shear loading were developed. New normalised non-linear constitutive relationships for OSB were implemented in 3 -D finite element models. A stochastic analysis based on the Monte Carlo method accurately reproduced the variability of the defining parameters found in the experiments. This approach is suitable for implementation in reliability-based structural design...|$|R
40|$|<b>Single-layer</b> {{oriented}} strand <b>panels</b> were fabricated under {{a combination}} of three alignment levels, four densities, and two resin contents. Flake orientation, density gradient across panel thickness, linear expansion (LE), and bending properties were measured. Flake orientation was characterized with the von Mises distribution using mean flake angle and concentration parameter. It was shown that {{the shape of the}} LE-moisture content change curve varied with alignment level and test direction. The variation was attributed to whether the LE of a panel was controlled by transverse or longitudinal wood swelling along a particular test direction. Total LE from oven-dry to water-soak condition, modulus of elasticity (MOE), and modulus of rupture (MOR) varied significantly with flake orientation distribution and density. Effects of resin content at the levels used on LE, MOE, and MOR was relatively small and was niore diversified. The LE, MOE, and MOR were correlated with the concentration parameter, density. resin content, and moisture content using a power form equation. The experimental data form a database of layer properties for modeling three-layer, cross-laminated oriented strandboards (OSBs) manufactured under hot pressing.
