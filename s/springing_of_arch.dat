25|$|In Romanesque architecture, piers {{were often}} {{employed}} to support arches. They were built of masonry and square or rectangular in section, generally having a horizontal moulding representing a capital at the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> Sometimes piers have vertical shafts attached to them, {{and may also}} have horizontal mouldings {{at the level of}} the base.|$|R
25|$|Arches are {{semi-circular}} or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches {{are often}} used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> Alberti {{was one of the}} first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the St. Andrea in Mantua.|$|R
50|$|The fort is {{now part}} of the village green of Rochester, but there are still remains to see. The west wall is the best {{preserved}} and consists of a nine-feet-high bank with stone facing. The west gate is complete to the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> However much <b>of</b> the stonework has been plundered over the years for local buildings.|$|R
50|$|It has 23 nearly semicircular arches, with 14 spans of 39 ft, {{seven of}} 38 ft, one of 44 ft {{and one of}} 43 ft. The piers are 8 ft thick at the foundations, {{tapering}} to 6 ft at the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arches.</b> The arches are lined with three layers of bricks, reinforced with iron strapping. The long pier which sits in the river has a large cutwater.|$|R
60|$|It is only {{farther to}} be noted, that these {{mouldings}} {{are used in}} various proportions, {{for all kinds of}} purposes: sometimes for true cornices; sometimes for window-sills; sometimes, 3 and 4 (in the Gothic time) especially, for dripstones of gables: 11 and such others form little plinths or abaci at the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> <b>arches,</b> such as those shown at a, Fig. XXIII. Vol. II. Finally, a large number of superb Byzantine cornices occur, of the form shown at the top <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> in Plate V. Vol. II., having a profile like 16 or 19 here; with nodding leaves of acanthus thrown out from it, being, in fact, merely one range of the leaves of a Byzantine capital unwrapped, and formed into a continuous line. I had prepared a large mass of materials for the illustration of these cornices, and the Gothic ones connected with them; but found the subject would take up another volume, and was forced, for the present, to abandon it. The lower series of profiles, 7 to 12 in Plate XV. Vol. I, shows how the leaf-ornament is laid on the simple early cornices.|$|R
60|$|If its {{apertures}} {{have not}} shafts and capitals, look {{if they are}} plain openings in the walls, studiously simple, and unmoulded at the sides; as, for instance, the arch in Plate XIX. Vol. I. If so, the building may still be of the finest Gothic, adapted to some domestic or military service. But if {{the sides of the}} window be moulded, and yet there are no capitals at the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch,</b> it is assuredly of an inferior school.|$|R
5000|$|In the interior, {{a barrel}} vault of stone covers the nave, which {{is flanked by}} two side-aisles. Along the nave, three {{transverse}} arches, which are evenly spaced, add support. Their arches continue down the piers as pilasters, complete with capitals at the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> Rounded arches, supported by piers, open into the side aisles, which are covered with stone groin vaults. Above the nave arcade, small rounded lancet-shaped windows pierce the stone walls. The windows are evenly spaced over the arch openings.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} single <b>arch</b> is <b>of</b> travertine, 8.80 metres high, 7.30 wide, and 3.50 deep. The piers {{that support}} it are 1.40 metres wide and 3.50 deep, {{and outside of}} them are two pilasters of the same depth, with Corinthian capitals. The entablature is 2 metres high with the dedicatory inscription on the architrave. Beneath the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> on each side is a simple cornice. A drawing (HJ 343) of the 15th century shows small side arches, but all traces of them have since disappeared (PAS ii.76; Sangallo, Barb. 25v.).|$|R
50|$|The parts still {{standing}} above ground consist {{of the two}} piers which originally supported {{the north side of}} the crossing tower of the church. They survive to some height above the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the crossing <b>arches,</b> although the voussoirs <b>of</b> the <b>arches</b> themselves have been removed.There are fragmentary walls projecting from the eastern pier to the north and east, while the other incorporates a small trefoil-headed recess or aumbry. These remains probably date from the late 13th century.|$|R
5|$|Four stone courses <b>of</b> {{the eastern}} <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch,</b> {{consisting}} <b>of</b> {{a row of}} impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a complex}} form <b>of</b> {{memorial}} <b>arch,</b> comprising interlocking <b>arches</b> <b>of</b> four sizes. Each side <b>of</b> the main <b>arch</b> is pierced by a smaller arch, orientated at a right angle to the main <b>arch.</b> Each side <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> these smaller <b>arches</b> is then pierced by a still smaller arch and so on. The keystone <b>of</b> each smaller <b>arch</b> is at the level <b>of</b> the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the larger <b>arch</b> that it pierces; each of these levels {{is marked by a}} stone cornice. This design results in 16 piers, having 64 stone-panelled sides. Only 48 of these are inscribed, as the panels around the outside of the memorial are blank.|$|R
60|$|The upper arcade {{is managed}} {{on the same}} principle; it looks at first {{as if there were}} three arches to each under pair; but there are, in reality, only thirty-eight (or thirty-seven, I am not quite certain of this number) to the twenty-seven below; and the columns get into all manner of {{relative}} positions. Even then, the builder was not satisfied, but must needs carry the irregularity into the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arches,</b> and actually, while the general effect is of a symmetrical arcade, there is not one <b>of</b> the <b>arches</b> the same in height as another; their tops undulate all along the wall like waves along a harbor quay, some nearly touching the string course above, and others falling from it as much as five or six inches.|$|R
50|$|Four stone courses <b>of</b> {{the eastern}} <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch,</b> {{consisting}} <b>of</b> {{a row of}} impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times.

He subsequently dug a series of seven shafts to the west at regular intervals, yet found no evidence of additional piers.|$|R
5000|$|Recordings of [...] "Tornerai [...] " [...] / J'attendrai {{have been}} popular for film and TV soundtracks {{since the early}} 1950s, being heard in more than 15 films and TV series, among them Lilacs in the <b>Spring</b> (1954), <b>Arch</b> <b>of</b> Triumph (1984), Das Boot (1981), A Good Year (2006) [...] and Allied (2016).|$|R
2500|$|In Romanesque {{domestic}} architecture, arcades {{were most}} often supported on piers. They were built of masonry and are of square or rectangular section, generally having a horizontal moulding representing a capital at the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> Columns {{were also used}} to support arcades and vaults, but are a feature of palace, civic and monastic architecture, rather than smaller houses. Colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. The capital {{on top of a}} column is usually cut so that it is round at the bottom, where it sits on the column, and square at the top where it support the arch. A capital might be undecorated, or else have foliate or figurative carving.|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> 1989, Dr. <b>Arch</b> Gould {{approached}} the Art Center with an idea: He would donate $100,000 worth of Navajo rugs to the ACF permanent collection and $100,000 {{to expand the}} Art Center facility if the community could raise $100,000 for the long-term maintenance of the collection. [...] A collector from the eastern United States promised six additional rugs worth an estimated $75,000. [...] The new space, dubbed the Gould Gallery, was dedicated in January 1991.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} walls {{to the ground}} storey are rendered. The French doors and windows {{on each of these}} facades have basket arch-shaped heads. A simply moulded impost marks the <b>springing</b> point <b>of</b> these <b>arches.</b> The ground floor walls are approximately 40 centimetres thick. On the north facade a triangular, rendered support has been put in place. An early in-ground, brick-lined water tank is situated under the edge of the verandah on the southern facade.|$|R
50|$|The three {{windows on}} the south side of the chancel are lancets with widely splayed jambs on the interior, {{contracted}} bv shoulders at the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch,</b> which give to the latter a trefoil form. In the eastern wall of the south aisle, there is a beautiful example of the work of the period. A five-light window features geometrical tracery with an eight petalled flower patterned central circle, remarkably cut from a single stone. This window was probably inserted in 1331, at the instance of Roger Mauduit who was granted a licence to endow a chantry in the church. The small Early English Period east light, or triplet, was removed during a renovation to make room for a gaping round-headed sash window of small square panes.|$|R
60|$|Winter {{had fled}} back beyond the barrens to the lonely North at last, and though {{here and there}} a little slushy snow still lay soaking the black loam in a hollow, a warm wind swept the vast levels when one morning Colonel Barrington rode with his niece and sister across the prairie. Spring comes {{suddenly}} in that region, and the frost-bleached sod was steaming under an effulgent sun, while in places a hardy flower peeped through. It was six hundred miles to the forests of the Rockies' eastern slope, and as far to the Athabascan pines, but it seemed to Maud Barrington that their resinous sweetness was in the glorious western wind, which awoke a musical sighing from the sea of rippling grass. It rolled away before her in billows of lustrous silver-grey, and had for sole boundary the first upward <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> cloudless blue, across which the vanguard of the feathered host pressed on, company by company towards the Pole.|$|R
50|$|The façade is architecturally simple, {{the shape}} of the {{building}} informing the new structure so that its low-pitched central roof and sloping side aisles mark the roofline, which is enlivened with an open parapet of simple Gothic tracery, uniting the building with the sky. The façade is divided into three sections by shallow buttresses or pilasters. That part above the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the door <b>arch</b> is faced with marble in bold contrasting stripes, while the lower part is pale-coloured but much stained in some areas, possibly from the absorption of pollutants.|$|R
5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|R
25|$|The pointed chancel arch is 13th century. It is moulded {{of three}} {{chamfers}} leading to respondshalf-piers {{against a wall}} supporting an archof three part round columns with continuous annulet between, and with polygonal capitals and base reflecting those of the arcade piers. At the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> are open cusped devices similar to those on the tower arch. The chancel roof is 19th century and of barrel vault construction. In the north wall of the chancel is a rectangular aumbry. In the south wall is an <b>arched</b> door, <b>of</b> planking over cross bracing and heavy surrounds, recessed within a plain right angle opening with pointed and chamfered double-arch head. From the 19th-century restoration are chancel altar rails, choir stalls, a brass eagle lectern, and a wood pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal with one side open and receiving steps. The upper level is moulded top and bottom, with each side paneled with inset tracery and quatrefoils, and is supported by scrolled brackets set on an inset base.|$|R
50|$|David Miller, in his History of the Abbey at Arbroath {{written in}} 1860, {{describes}} Hospitalfield House as follows: The older or {{central part of}} the present mansion-house of Hospitalfield is evidently a part of the ancient Abbey hospital. This is proved by the remains of several old doors and other indications about the walls of the house; and especially by one side of an ancient door which was lately discovered during some alterations in the front wall, a few yards west from the modern door, and which the proprietor, with good taste, has caused to be repaired and left open for inspection. This door appears, from the depth and character of its mouldings to {{have been one of the}} principal entrances to the hospital, and to have been erected after the early English style of architecture had ceased to be followed. The <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the upper stones shews that its head was either a pointed or semicircular arch, having the side mouldings carried round without alteration, and without capitals at the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch.</b> If our view be correct, these marks denote the erection of the hospital to have been from fifty to a hundred years subsequent to the foundation of the Abbey.|$|R
40|$|Regulations (23 CFR 650, Subpart C), {{defines a}} bridge as: A {{structure}} including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, {{and having a}} track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads, and having an opening measured along {{the center of the}} roadway of more than 20 feet between undercopings <b>of</b> abutments or <b>spring</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>arches,</b> or extreme ends of openings for multiple boxes; it may also include multiple pipes, where the clear distance between openings is {{less than half of the}} smaller contiguous opening. Bridge design is the responsibility of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office, which develops a preliminary bridge plan for a new or modified structure in collaboration with the region. This chapter provides basic design considerations for the development of this plan. Unique staging requirements, constructability issues, and other considerations are addressed during plan development. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office early in the planning stage regarding issues that might affect the planned project (see Chapter 700).

50|$|The mosque has 77 squat domes with 7 four-sided pitched Bengali domes in {{the middle}} row.The vast prayer hall, {{although}} provided with 11 arched doorways on east and 7 each on north and south for ventilation and light, presents a dark and somber appearance inside. It is divided into 7 longitudinal aisles and 11 deep bays by a forest of 60 slender stone columns, from which <b>springs</b> rows <b>of</b> endless <b>arches,</b> supporting the domes. Six feet thick, slightly tapering walls and hollow and round, almost detached corner towers, resembling the bastions of fortress, each capped by small rounded cupolas, recall the Tughlaq architecture of Delhi.The mosque represents wonderful archeological beauty which was the signature in the 15th century.|$|R
25|$|The {{ceiling of}} the chapel is a {{flattened}} barrel vault springing from a course that encircles the walls at the level <b>of</b> the <b>springing</b> <b>of</b> the window <b>arches.</b> This barrel vault is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the barrel vault at its lowest level {{into a series of}} large pendentives rising from shallow pilasters between each window. The barrel vault was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia. The pavement is in opus alexandrinum, a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as Palm Sunday.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may have}} done so, or it may have sunk at sea. I am {{inclined}} {{to think that it}} was lost, because the traditions concerning these hidden treasures seem to be extremely accurate; and yet, as Dias says, none tell of any Inca treasure being concealed here. However, {{it is quite possible that}} the treasure did come here and was landed, and that the ship was then broken up, so that it might be supposed she was lost at sea, and that this was kept so profound a secret by the men here, that the news was never generally known even among the natives. So far our search to-day has been successful, but I see that a hunt for the treasure will be a very difficult one. Certainly in the upper chambers there doesn't appear any possibility of such a hiding-place existing. The whole space is accounted for. The walls are all of solid stone, and have no special thickness. If the roofs had been arched there might be empty spaces on each side <b>of</b> the <b>spring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch,</b> but they are supported by pillars or walls, with only just space between the floors for the beams of solid stone. Of course it is in the lowest room that one would expect to find hiding-places like those we saw at Pachacamac." [...] He paused.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} work aims {{to analyse}} {{and work out}} the issues relating to the widening of the hydraulic section <b>of</b> a two <b>arched</b> bridge in Sardinia. Its small hydraulic section proved to be insufficient and unable to drain an adequate quantity of water with the possible risk of dangerous flooding. In {{order to avoid the}} occurrence of such phenomena it is necessary to build a third reinforced concrete arch. Thus, we pulled down the right abutment of the original bridge and consequently we took the necessary safety measures through an innovative confinement system carried out as follows: • Driving in a line of micro-piles by each bridge pier wall and placing two 42 commercial sections at the level <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> <b>springing</b> line tightly secured to the micro-pile line tied by means of Dywidag threaded bars. Through such device we needn’t use ribs so avoiding all the problems related to building underwater. Besides, building micropiles enabled the conversion of the original abutment of the pier bridge. • Pulling tensile the Dywidag bars by the <b>springing</b> levels <b>of</b> both <b>arches.</b> The main subject of this writing is the determination of the tie beam pre-tension force, having calculated the horizontal reaction to the arch springing...|$|R
50|$|Creating visual {{continuity}} {{between the new}} and the old was critical in this instance due to {{the significance of the}} long stretch of the nave; here an obvious alteration in material or color would detract from the pattern <b>of</b> <b>springing</b> <b>arches</b> that continues through the length of the structure. Page & Turnbull invited faux-finishing specialistJacquelyn Giuffre to disguise the new sections and recreate the continuity of pattern and color. Guiffre’s job was made more difficult {{by the fact that the}} structure had not been completely sealed against the elements during the restoration and the salts of the bay air triggered a staining process that created green marks in the yellow and buff brick. In order to match the texture and patina of the old brick, Guiffre used six different pigments applied by hand, and then applied green shading to mimic the new staining process. Once the pieces were installed, a final stage of blending was completed on site to ensure the greatest possible accuracy.|$|R

The Buland Darwaza is symmetrical and is topped by large free standing kiosks, which are the chhatris. It also has at the top center, terrace edge gallery-kiosks on the roof, stylized buckler-battlements, small minar-spires, and inlay work with white and black marble. On the outside a long flight of steps sweeps down the hill giving the gateway additional height. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from the ground level. It is a 15-storied high gateway acting as the southern entrance of the city of Fatehpur Sikri. The approach to the gate consists of 42 steps.It is semi octagonal in plan and two smaller triple-storeyed wings on either side. It has three kiosks on its top surrounded by thirteen smaller domed kiosks. There are smaller turrets surrounding the gateway.The expanse is broken by arched niches, small chhatries and marble highlights. It highlights the courtyard of the Jama Masjid. The principal arch stands in the centre of three projecting sides and topped by a dome. The central arch is broken into three tiers with rows <b>of</b> smaller <b>arches</b> and flat brackets. The great gate itself is plain. The three horizontal panels of buff stone noticeable in Badshahi Darwaza are also present here.
