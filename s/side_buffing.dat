50|$|The main {{building}} is a three-story structure on a limestone foundation <b>sided</b> in <b>buff</b> brick. It is configured as two connecting perpdendicular blocks, with semicircular wings on the south corners. Asphalt has covered the original metal roof, except for the copper trim on the cornice and dormer windows.|$|R
50|$|Male upperside dull black. Forewing with an irroration (sprinkling) of {{brilliant}} green scales that form cellular and internervular streaks. Hindwing: anterior half to nearly the median vein and above vein 5 irrorated with brilliant blue scales that become gradually sparse towards and cease entirely along the costal margin; posterior half irrorated with brilliant green scales; tornus {{with a small}} claret-red patch touched above with a few violet scales and also with an admarginal dusky black spot. Cilia brown alternated with white. Underside black. Forewing with very broad and prominent cellular and internervular pale streaks, the costal margin and the basal half of interspaces 1a and 1 distinctly black. Hindwing: a series of claret-red subterminal lunules, two {{side by side in}} each interspace, all more or less irrorated inwardly with violet scales; at the tornal angle these lunules form a conspicuous oblong patch that stretches a short way along the dorsum and bears a subbasal and a subapical black spot. Antennae, the thorax and abdomen narrowly along the middle black; head pinkish red; abdomen on the <b>sides</b> <b>buff</b> coloured.|$|R
50|$|The Double Fairlie was {{the first}} {{articulated}} locomotive to enter service in South Africa and also the first to have Walschaerts valve gear, which had been invented in 1844 by Belgian locomotive foreman Egide Walschaerts. The locomotive which was acquired by the CGR was of the separate boiler type. It had two boiler barrels, with a central firebox common to both barrels and fired from the <b>side.</b> The <b>buffing</b> and drawgear were fitted on the two engine units. The pivots were located under the two boiler saddles and were carried on centre bearings which formed part of the engine unit frames.|$|R
50|$|It {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from its relatives by its small size and distinctive bill. The wedge-billed woodcreeper is typically 14-15 cm long, and weighs 14-16.5 g. It has brown upperparts, with fine streaking {{on the head}} <b>sides,</b> a <b>buff</b> supercilium, and a chestnut rump, wings and tail. The throat is buff, {{and the rest of}} the underparts are brown spotted with buff chevrons, most heavily on the breast. A buff wing bar is obvious from below in flight. The short wedge-shaped bill is quite different in shape from that of other woodcreepers. Young birds are duller with less distinct breast streaking.|$|R
50|$|They have {{brownish}} fur with <b>buff</b> <b>sides,</b> a white belly, and an indistinct white stripe on the fur {{along the}} spine. Adults {{grow up to}} eleven to seventeen centimeters in length with a tail length of five to ten centimeters. Their height (from the ground to the highest point of their back) is between 1.5 and 2.0 centimeters. A mature mouse weighs anywhere from nine to twenty-two grams.|$|R
50|$|Burns {{joined the}} all-conquering <b>Buffs</b> <b>side</b> in July 2003, {{becoming}} a key {{member of the}} side that {{went on to win}} the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division in season 2003-04. The departure of the Management team led by Mark Shanks sparked a remarkable change of fortunes which saw the Abbey Park side relegated the following season to the West of Scotland Super League First Division under new manager Paul Wright.|$|R
50|$|Its upperparts are {{iridescent}} dull greenish, {{while the}} underparts are whitish, densely streaked with dusky. The neck-side has a relatively faint blue patch. The {{tips of the}} rectrices (tail feathers) are white, {{and there is a}} naked stripe on top of the head (but this is usually concealed). The most conspicuous features, however, are those the common name refers to: the bill is strongly decurved, and the outer three rectrices on each <b>side</b> are deep <b>buff,</b> best visible from below.|$|R
5000|$|The female (hen) is {{much less}} showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage {{similar to that of}} the female common pheasant. She is darker and more slender than the hen of that species, with a proportionately longer tail (half her [...] length). The female's breast and <b>sides</b> are barred <b>buff</b> and blackish brown, and the abdomen is plain buff. She has a buff face and throat. Some {{abnormal}} females may later in their lifetime get some male plumage. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow.|$|R
50|$|The Aztec mouse is a typically-sized {{member of}} its genus, {{with a total}} length of 20 to 26 cm, about half of which is made up by the tail. The fur is ochre mixed with black over the upper surface of the body, a {{brighter}} reddish color at the <b>sides,</b> and pale <b>buff</b> beneath. The tail is also paler on the underside, and often ends with a white tip. The feet are white, with hairs on the soles of the hindfeet, one of the features that allows it to be distinguished from the otherwise similar looking, and more widespread, brush mouse.|$|R
500|$|The Moupin pika (Ochotona thibetana), {{also known}} as Ribetischer Pika, Moupin-Pika, Pika del Tibet, [...] and Manipuri pika, is a species of mammal in the pika family, Ochotonidae. It has many subspecies, {{some of which may}} be {{distinct}} species. Its summer pelage is dark russet-brown with some light spots on the dorsal <b>side,</b> and ochraceous <b>buff</b> tinged on the belly. In winter it is lighter, with buff to dull brown dorsal pelage. A generalist herbivore, it is found in the mountains of the eastern Tibetan Plateau in China (Gansu, southern Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan), Bhutan, India (Sikkim), and northern Myanmar. Both the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listof Endangered Species and the Red List of China's Vertebrates classify it as a species of least concern; although one subspecies may be endangered.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{flagpole}} on {{the southwest}} corner of the block. Narrow hedges on all but the east side set off the building. The building itself is a two-story steel frame structure faced on all <b>sides</b> by smooth <b>buff</b> limestone topped by a flat roof. Those facades form a roughly square building {{with the exception of the}} irregular east. They are 15 bays wide on the south (Main Street) side, 13 on Market Street, 11 on Nepperhan and nine on Buena Vista. Atop is a flat roof.With the exception of the east, which serves as a loading dock, all facades have a similar decorative treatment: flat engaged Corinthian pilasters dividing all bays save those on the corners, which are set off on the non-corner side by paired pilasters. All support an entablature with a frieze decorated with curved rosettes. At the roofline is a denticulated cornice with a balustraded parapet. On the first story, windows are four-over-four double-hung sash with a four-light transom. The second story has similar windows but without the transoms.|$|R
60|$|My {{practice}} was, therefore, to walk cautiously {{along the}} narrow pathways with which the country abounded, and on detecting any sign of a Pitta's vicinity to stand motionless and give a gentle whistle occasionally, imitating the notes as near as possible. After half an hour's waiting I was often rewarded by seeing the pretty bird hopping along in the thicket. Then I would perhaps lose sight of it again, until having my gun raised and ready for a shot, a second glimpse would enable me to secure my prize, and admire its soft puffy plumage and lovely colours. The upper part is rich soft green, the head jet black with a stripe of blue and brown over each eye; {{at the base of}} the tail and on the shoulders are bands of bright silvery blue; the under <b>side</b> is delicate <b>buff</b> with a stripe of rich crimson, bordered with black on the belly. Beautiful grass-green doves, little crimson and black flower-peckers, large black cuckoos, metallic king-crows, golden orioles, and the fine jungle-cocks--the origin of all our domestic breeds of poultry--were among the birds that chiefly attracted my attention during our stay at Labuan Tring.|$|R
5000|$|By this time, in France at least, {{the general}} {{character}} of the clothes and accoutrements to be worn on various occasions was strictly regulated by orders. But uniformity of clothing {{was not to be}} expected so long as the [...] "enlistment" [...] system prevailed and soldiers were taken in and dismissed {{at the beginning and end}} of every campaign. The beginnings of uniform are therefore to be found in truly national armies, in the Indelta of Gustavus Adolphus, and the English armies of the English Civil War. In the earlier years of the latter, though the richer colonels uniformed their men (as, for instance, the Marquess of Newcastle's [...] "Whitecoats" [...] and King Charles's own red-coated Lifeguard of foot), the rustics and the citizens turned out for war in their ordinary rough clothes, donning armour and sword-belt. But in 1645 the Long Parliament raised an army [...] "all its own" [...] for permanent service, and the colonels became officials rather than proprietors. The New Model Army was clothed in the civilian costume of the date - ample coat, waistcoat, breeches, stockings and shoes (in the case of cavalry, boots) - but with the distinctive colour throughout the army of red and with regimental facings of various colours and breeches of grey. Soon afterwards the helmet disappeared, and its place was taken by a grey broad-brimmed hat. From the coat was eventually evolved the tunic of the mid-19th century, and the hat became the cocked hat of a later generation, which generally disappeared during the decade of 1800-1810 to reappear in the late 19th and early 20th century, by which time it had its original form of a [...] "slouch-hat." [...] For service in Ireland the New Model Army's red coat was exchanged for one of russet colour, just as scarlet gave way to khaki for Indian service in the 19th century. The cavalry (Iron <b>Sides),</b> however, wore <b>buff</b> leather coats and armour long after the infantry had abandoned them.|$|R
