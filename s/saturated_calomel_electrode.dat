All paste amalgam electrodes have potentials close to their analogues with metallic mercury. They can therefore replace each other without any recalculation.

2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of organic compounds, ferrocene undergoes a one-electron oxidation at a low potential, around 0.5V versus a <b>saturated</b> <b>calomel</b> <b>electrode</b> (SCE). This reversible oxidation has itself been used as standard in electrochemistry as Fc+/Fc= 0.40V versus the standard hydrogen electrode. Some electron-rich organic compounds (e.g., aniline) also are oxidized at low potentials, but only irreversibly. Oxidation of ferrocene gives the stable blue-colored iron(III) cation [...] originally called ferricinium, but now more commonly ferrocenium (these terms denote the same ion, contrary to what one would expect {{from the fact that}} ferric and ferrous denote different ions of a single iron atom). [...] On a preparative scale, the oxidation is conveniently effected with FeCl3, to give the ion, which is often isolated as its [...] salt.

50|$|The chief {{advantage}} over {{other types of}} titration is the selectivity offered by the electrode potential, {{as well as by}} the choice of titrant. For instance, lead ion is reduced at a potential of -0.60 V (relative to the <b>saturated</b> <b>calomel</b> <b>electrode),</b> while zinc ions are not; this allows the determination of lead in the presence of zinc.

50|$|In the {{following}} table, redox potentials are quoted as reduction potentials measured {{in comparison to}} the <b>saturated</b> <b>calomel</b> <b>electrode</b> (SCE). Thus, the oxidation potential of a chemical species is listed as the reduction potential of its oxidized form. More positive numbers indicate that the catalyst is reduced more readily, i.e. that it is a more strongly oxidizing species. Negative numbers indicate that the electrochemical reaction does not occur spontaneously in the direction written. In such a case, a voltage of the written magnitude must be applied to the catalyst in order to induce reduction. Thus, more negative reduction potentials indicate that the chemical species is more easily oxidized, and is a more strongly reducing species.|$|E
50|$|In most three {{electrode}} experiments {{there are}} two isolated cells. One contains the auxiliary and working electrode, while the other contains the reference electrode.

A Quasi-Reference Electrode such as a silver/silver chloride wire electrode can be exposed directly to the analyte solution. In such situations there is concern that the analyte and trace redox products may interact with the reference electrode and either render it useless or increase drift. As a result, even these simple references are commonly sequestered in their own cells. The more complex references such as standard hydrogen electrode, <b>saturated</b> <b>calomel</b> <b>electrode,</b> or silver chloride electrode(specific concentration) can not directly mix the analyte solution for fear the electrode will fall apart or interact/react with the analyte.|$|E
50|$|The {{corrosion}} protection {{afforded by the}} electrodeposited zinc layer is primarily due to the anodic potential dissolution of zinc versus iron (the substrate in most cases). Zinc acts as a sacrificial anode for protecting the iron (steel). While steel is close to ESCE= -400 mV (the potential refers to the standard <b>Saturated</b> <b>calomel</b> <b>electrode</b> (SCE), depending on the alloy composition, electroplated zinc is much more anodic with ESCE= -980 mV. Steel is preserved from corrosion by cathodic protection. Conversion coatings (hexavalent chromium (CrVI) or trivalent chromium (CrIII) depending upon OEM requirements) are applied to drastically enhance the {{corrosion protection}} by building an additional inhibiting layer of Chromium and Zinc hydroxides. These oxide films range in thickness from 10 nm for the thinnest blue/clear passivates to 4 µm for the thickest black chromates.|$|E

In order to establish a steady state from open circuit potential (OCP), the working electrodes were first immersed into the test solution for 30  min. The potentiodynamic polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 1  mV/s in the potential range from − 150 to + 150  mV relative to the OCP.

The EIS measurements were performed at corrosion potentials over a frequency range of 100 KHz to 0.1  Hz with AC signal amplitude perturbation of ± 10  mV. The electrochemical measurements in the hydrodynamic conditions were measured using an electrode controller (model: AFMSRCE, PINE Instruments Co., Durham, NC, USA) to control the rotation speed in the range (500 to 2, 000  rpm) in the absence and presence of the inhibitor of various concentrations. EIS Analyzer Software was used to fit the experimental results of EIS measurements using appropriate equivalent circuit. Each measurement data point as shown in the figures and tables was performed at least three times, and reproducibility was satisfactory.|$|R

5000|$|The {{quality of}} an {{electrochemically}} prepared PT film {{is affected by}} a number of factors. These include the electrode material, current density, temperature, solvent, electrolyte, presence of water, and monomer concentration. Two other important but interrelated factors are the structure of the monomer and the applied potential. The potential required to oxidize the monomer depends upon the electron density in the thiophene ring π-system. Electron-donating groups lower the oxidation potential, while electron-withdrawing groups increase the oxidation potential. Thus, 3-methylthiophene polymerizes in acetonitrile and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate at a potential of about 1.5 V vs. SCE (<b>saturated</b> <b>calomel</b> <b>electrode),</b> while unsubstituted thiophene polymerizes at about 1.7 V vs. SCE. Steric hindrance resulting from branching at the α-carbon of a 3-substituted thiophene inhibits polymerization. This observation leads to the so-called [...] "polythiophene paradox": the oxidation potential of many thiophene monomers is higher than the oxidation potential of the resulting polymer. In other words, the polymer can be irreversibly oxidized and decompose at a rate comparable to the polymerization of the corresponding monomer. This remains one of the major disadvantages of electrochemical polymerization, and limits its application for many thiophene monomers with complex side groups.|$|E
