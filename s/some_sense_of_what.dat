2500|$|Gale Edwards' 1995 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Josie Lawrence and Michael Siberry. Edwards {{was the first woman}} to direct the play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, and for this reason alone, it received a great deal of attention. The play opens on a stormy night, with a woman (played by Lawrence) dressed in rags trying to get her drunk husband (played by Siberry) to come home. He refuses, and falls asleep outside the tavern. As with the Bogdanov production, the taming story was then presented as Sly's dream. However, in Edwards, it was set in a surreal landscape, with the characters sporting a bizarre mixture of costumes; Elizabethan, commedia dell'arte, pantomime, Victorian, Edwardian, and modern dress. At the end of Katherina's speech (which was delivered lovingly until she realised she was part of a wager, at which point she began to speak angrily, and by the end, Petruchio had become bowed with shame), the text was cut and at this point, the play returned to the Induction setting. Sly, having been deeply moved by his dream, condemns the subjugation of women and embraces his wife, whose love he now appreciates {{for the first time in}} his life. The production notes say of Katherina's speech; [...] "Petruchio slowly realises what he has been attempting to do to Katherina in the name of love. By the end of the speech, his dream has become his nightmare." [...] Speaking of the correlation between Sly and Petruchio, Siberry stated that Petruchio becomes [...] "sobered and then shamed" [...] during the speech, whilst Sly releases [...] "that his behavior has become unacceptable." [...] As the play ends with a kneeling Sly embracing his standing wife, Siberry argues that Sly [...] "is trying to make <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened, understanding that he has made an awful mistake and trying to come to terms with it." [...] The production ended ambiguously, however, with no indication as to whether Sly's wife would forgive him.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{relation}} between the cohomology of a Kähler manifold X and curvilinear obstructions to higher-order deformations is explored. It is shown that curvilinear obstructions to higher-order deformations of X annihilate the cohomology of X. Applying an analogous principle to curvilinear obstructions to higher-order deformations of pairs (Z,X) where Z is a submanifold of X, a variational version of the Hodge conjecture for K-trivial threefolds and fourfolds is proved under some special assumptions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore a few consequences of the ideas about the role of ambient cohomology in obstruction theory introduced by S. Bloch in [B], employed by Z.

" Strictly speaking, total lack of order (or disorder) is impossible, as it would bring about the complete collapse of any society. Thus, perhaps it is better to couch the current situation this way, namely, that there is a gap, as yet undetermined, between the existing and expected levels of public order in our society. Some forms of social order are considered less opportune, such as "consanguineous ties" (>i>xuetonglun>/i>), a former basis of social order that many would consider inappropriate in a market economy, but, nevertheless, it was a basis for a previous public order.

40|$|The city {{space is}} a place of endless possibilities, a vast web of {{intersecting}} paths, peoples and times, that is at once an unknown, foreign country to be discovered, as well as an intimately familiar dwelling. It provides its inhabitants with the potential for feeling both at ease and unsettled, rooted but lost, hidden yet exposed, as somebody or nobody. Both Paul Auster in his novel City of Glass and Wim Wenders in his film Lisbon Story explore this indeterminate urban space through characters whose identities draw upon and are affected by the city and what exists therein. In the chaotic urban landscape, Auster’s and Wenders’ protagonists take to roaming the labyrinth of streets, in an effort to immerse themselves completely in the city and experience its ‘true’ nature. In order to achieve this, they believe they must first efface themselves, lose their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self, which results in an aimless journey to become nobody. Nevertheless, in both City of Glass and Lisbon Story, the protagonists find themselves eventually attempting to make <b>some</b> semblance <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they are perceiving around them. Either by taking notes on the city, through the filming of it or by recording its sounds, Quinn, Monroe, Winter (the characters in Auster’s and Wenders’ works), and even the invisible character of the Portuguese modernist poet Fernando Pessoa, attempt to decipher space as they navigate it, while simultaneously relying on it as a source of inspiration for finding, creating and asserting their own existence and some form of identity...|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt <b>some</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency about <b>what</b> he had to say. This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|R

The face looked down upon me with a painful and deadly contraction; but the rays of a glory encircled it, and reminded me that the sacrifice was voluntary. It stood there, crowning the rock, as it still stands on so many highway sides, vainly preaching to passers-by, an emblem of sad and noble truths; that pleasure is not an end, but an accident; that pain is the choice of the magnanimous; that it is best to suffer all things and do well.

It was cold even for me, who had eaten a large breakfast and purposed to eat a perfectly Gargantuan lunch; it was colder for the men under the trees. And to eastward through the opalescent haze, the warmer whites and yellows of the houses in Park-lane shone as unsubstantially as if the clouds themselves had taken on the shape of mansions to mock the men who sat there in the cold.

60|$|It {{was thus}} {{clear to the}} two {{veterans}} of the Encyclopædia that the change for which they had worked was at hand. The press literally teemed with pamphlets, treatises, poems, histories, all shouting from the house-tops open destruction to beliefs which fifty years before were actively protected against {{so much as a}} whisper in the closet. Every form of literary art was seized and turned into an instrument in the remorseless attack on L'Infâme. The conservative or religious opposition showed a weakness that is hardly paralleled in the long history of the mighty controversy. Ability, adroitness, vigour, and character were for once all on one side. Palissot was perhaps, after all, the best of the writers on the conservative side.[192] With all his faults, he had the literary <b>sense.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he said was true, and some of the third-rate people whom he assailed deserved the assault. His criticism on Diderot's drama, The Natural Son, was not a whit more severe than that bad play demanded.[193] Not seldom {{in the course of this}} work we have wished with Palissot that the excellent Diderot were less addicted to prophetic and apocalyptical turns of speech, that there were less of chaos round his points of burning and shining light, and that he had less title to the hostile name of the Lycophron of philosophy.[194] But the comedy of The Philosophers was a scandalous misrepresentation, introducing Diderot personally on the stage, and putting into his mouth a mixture of folly and knavery that was as foreign to Diderot as to any one else in the world. In 1782 the satirist again attacked his enemy, now grown old and weary. In Le Satyrique, Valère, a spiteful and hypocritical poetaster, is intended partially at least for Diderot. A colporteur, not ill-named as M. Pamphlet, comes to urge payment of his bill.|$|R
