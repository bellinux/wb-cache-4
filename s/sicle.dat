40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new inverse consistent image registration (ICIR) method called boundary-constrained inverse consistent image registration (BICIR). ICIR algorithms jointly estimate the forward and reverse transformations between two images while minimizing the inverse consistency error (ICE). The ICE {{at a point}} {{is defined as the}} distance between the starting and ending location of a point mapped through the forward transformation and then the reverse transformation. The novelty of the BICIR method is that a region of interest (ROI) in one image is registered with its corresponding ROI. This is accomplished by first registering the boundaries of the ROIs and then matching the interiors of the ROIs using intensity registration. The advantages of this approach include providing better registration at the boundary of the ROI, eliminating registration errors caused by registering regions outside the ROI, and theoretically minimizing computation time since only the ROIs are registered. The first step of the BICIR algorithm is to inverse consistently register the boundaries of the ROIs. The resulting forward and reverse boundary transformations are extended to the entire ROI domains using the Element Free Galerkin Method (EFGM). The transformations produced by the EFGM are then made inverse consistent by iteratively minimizing the ICE. These transformations are used as initial conditions for inverse-consistent intensity-based registration of the ROI interiors. Weighted extended B-splines (WEB-splines) are used to parameterize the transformations. WEB-splines are used instead of B-splines since WEB-splines can be defined over an arbitrarily shaped ROI. Results are presented showing that the BICIR method provides better registration of 2 D and 3 D anatomical images than the small-deformation, inverse-consistent, linear-elastic (<b>SICLE)</b> image registration algorithm which registers entire images. Specifically, the BICIR method produced registration results with lower similarity cost, reduced boundary matching error, increased ROI relative overlap, and lower inverse consistency error than the <b>SICLE</b> algorithm...|$|E

Removed from this spatio-temporal horizon, however, claims of fin de <b>si?cle</b> appear partial, provincial, and extraneous.

This paper explores the assumed ?Otherness? of Islam in its encounter with nihilism, especially in reference to the question of political violence. Distinction between life-affirming and life-negating impulses of political violence helps situate religiously coded violence and the nihilistic violence of modernity.

Linking little-studied authors like M. R.

Ghost stories are split between an ironic, often parodic reference to Gothic style and an evocation of ?life itself,? an implicit repudiation of all literary style.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis The Contexts of the 'Aesthetic Mentality' of the Early Avant-garde takes {{a close look}} at the philosophical and aesthetic concepts that formed a paradigmatic change in the art and literature discourse at the beginning of the 20 th Century, identified with the birth of the avant-garde aesthetic. With an analysis of the unclear term of Expressionism, traditionally used to describe the character of Czech early avant-garde literature, the thesis refers to contemporary research about the relationship between the avant-gardists and philosophical reflections on the search for an essence of reality. This critique on the fin de <b>sicle</b> spirit at the turn of the century formed a new kind of art and literature discourse where aesthetic strategies were often identified with a philosophical method. In this context an affinity can be seen between Josef Čapek's concept of modernity and the theory of artistic creativity by Wilhelm Worringer, and Karel Čapek's critique on Bergson's concept of life and his liking for Georg Simmels' philosophy of "perspective relativism". The subsequent step to an acceptance of the avant-garde concept is represented by the motif of the "intelligent eye" in J. Čapek's short prose works for the Almanach na rok 1914 (Almanac for 1914).

In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories {{around the world are}} evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45, 000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, <b>SICLE,</b> SyN, and four different SPM 5 algorithms ("SPM 2 -type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings {{of this study is that}} the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves). The Victorian ideology of separate spheres made an evident separation according to gender. The principle not only affected the interaction between men and women but also the spaces that they occupied. While men had access to universities and a range of professions, social advancement for women was through a favorable marriage and the accomplishments of her husband and children. Indeed, wives were venerated as "angels of the home," and their familial duties were thought to be sacred. However, during the fin de <b>sic?le,</b> a resistance to this traditional separation of gender emerged in British society and literature. In March 1894, the term "New Woman" was first used in Sarah Grand's essay, "The New Aspect of the Woman Question. " The concept of the New Woman was that she rejected traditional gender roles and demanded the emancipation of women. Scores of women began writing novels and short stories, knows as New Woman fiction, in addition to articles and essays demanding emancipation for women in the suffrage movement, the enfranchisement of marriage, and the double standard of sexuality between men and women. Most scholarly research regards the New Woman as a transitional figure that transcends the boundary between what is private and whit is public. Critics focus on the move of emancipated women from the domestic realm into the public sphere of education or the professions. I, however, am examining the depiction of the private life of the New Woman figure in turn-of-the-century literature. I wish to find out what impact, if any, the New Woman ideals had on domesticity and the portrayal of domestic life in literature. I plan to argue that the New Woman novels try to put what is locked in and what is locked out together and that the New Woman figure attempts to alter space in order to take apart and transcend the system of separate spheres to find a room of her own...|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} {{positions of}} a population of Daphnia magna Straus in a plastic chamber were recorded by infrared photography. The distribution of tho Daphnia in the chamber was first observed during a 12 -hr light: 12 -hr dark regime and then during the photoperiod portion of the regime when spiral currents were introduced into the chamber. Observa-tions during the 12 L: 12 D regime revealed a vertical migration tendency in the chamber while the horizontal position of the population oscillated from left to right. The currents introduced into the chamber were analogous to natural Langmuir spirals: horizontal components {{at the top and}} bottom, a downwelling at the left, and an upwelling at the right of the chamber. A slow current system, of velocity range O& 2. 4 cm/set, and a fast current system of velocity range 2. 0 - 8. 8 cm/set were s,tudied. During the photoperiod (light intensity above 70 ergs cmma se&), the Daphnia shifted to the left <b>sicle</b> of the chamber in the slow current system and to the right in the fast current system. The population shifts were caused by Daphnia’s steady swimming position heading into the current and counterbalancing a current velocity of l- 2 cm/set by its swimming efforts. When the light intensity was below 78 ergs cm- ’ set-l, {{at the beginning and end}} of the photoperiods, the Daphnia populations drifted with the currents, unable to oppose them. The dorsal light reaction functions above a threshold light intensity of 70 ergs cmw 2 set-I, so the current orientation must be made possible by visual detection of currents. Vertical displacements decreased in both experiments. From these experimental relations a model of active aggregation of Daphnia in Langmuir spirals has been constructed. The current velocity range within Langmuir spiral circula-tions will determine whcthcr the Daphnia are aggregated in upwellings, downwellings, or in-between portions of a spiral during a photoperiod. In darkness, passive aggregation tendencies described by earlier models will prevail. The presence of the dorsal light reaction in planktonic crustacca allows the generalization of the new model to account for at least the aggregation tendencies of planktonic crustacca...|$|E

40|$|In Kenya, The Pokot Community {{is made of}} {{approximately}} 190, 000 persons (1989 Census). They are Kushitic Nilots and belong to the Kalenjin group. Native of the Sekerr Mountain and the Cherangani Hills, they are an agropastoral and sedentary people organized byeight age-class with current names but without handing over ceremonies. Duribng {{the first decades of}} the 19 th century, a third of them left the mountains and migrated to the East plains. Some of them settled on the Masol Plains, while others went Eastwards and reached Nginyang where they settled near Turkana Community. They are the East plains pastoral Pokot. Then some of them left, raided the Maasai on the West side and chased the Karimojong out of their lands up to Amudat in Uganda, and settled there. They are the West plains Pokot. Their migrations lead them to adopt a new way of life. They became semi-nomads and pastoralists on the East and West plains. Adopting a way of life similar to the Turkana and the Karimojong, they borrowed their generation classes which determined the syncretic socio-political systems still in effect today. This thesis is focused on the question: What do such syncretic constructions observed in the three settlement zones impose upon the Pokot community as a whole and on each of its members. Such syncretic systems can exist if, and only if, the Pokot discover the most judicious solution to their paradoxes generated by the simultaneous exigence of contradictory age classes and generation classes systemes. Les Pokot du Kenya sont une communaute de 190, 000 persons (recensement 1989). Nilote couchitiques, il appartiennent a l'aire culturelle Kalenjin. Originaires de montagnes, les Sekerr et les Cherangani, ils sont agropasteurs sedentaires, et ont developpe traditionnellement une organisation socio-politique fondee sur huit classes d'age aux noms recurrents, mais sans ceremonies de transmission de pouvoir pou le changement de status de chaque classe, hormis le rite d'entree par la circoncision. Au debut du XIXeme <b>sicle,</b> un tiers d'entre eux environ quitte les hautes terres vers l'est et s'installent dans les plaines de Masol. D'auttres poursuivent a l;est jusqu'a Nginyang, pres des Turkana, ou ils s'installent. La certains poursuivent encore, chassant les Maasai a l'ouest jusqu'a Kitale. Penetrant en territire Karimojong, ils repoussent le Karimojon jusqu'a la frontiere ougandaise actuelle. Leurs migrations, leur nouveau mode de vie: Ils sont pasteurs semi-nomaded dans les plaines, le contact avec le Turkana a l'est, les Karimojong a l'ouets et lieurs systemes de classes generationnelles determinent la formation de systemes syncretique tres diversifies chez les Pokot. L'objet de la these est centre sur la question des exigences de telles constructions syncretiques observees dans les trois zones de peuplement, et pour la communaute des Pokot dans son ensemble, et pour chacun de ses membres. De tels systemes syncretiques ne peuvent aboutir que si et seulement si les Pokot inventent les solutions les plus judicieuses aux paradoxes nes de la simultaneite des deux systemes contradictoires...|$|E
40|$|As one grows older, birthdays {{gradually}} {{shift from}} being celebratory events to more reflective occasions. One 2 ̆ 7 s 40 th birthday is commemorated rather differently from one 2 ̆ 7 s 2 lst, which is, in turn, celebrated quite differently from one 2 ̆ 7 s first. After a certain point, the individual birthdays become less important {{and it is}} the milestone years to whch we pay particular attention. Sadly for entities like the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is only the milestone years (the ones ending in five or zero, for some reason), that draw any attention at all. No one held a conference to celebrate the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s 67 th anniversary. Clearly the SEC is not getting its fair share of chocolate cake. Eventually the birthdays come to be recognitions {{of the fact that you}} are still around. Survival, not moving ahead in life, becomes the notable fact. And so it is with the SEC. It has now been 70 years since Congress created the SEC in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are still short of the gold standard for human survival [...] 100 years - but 70 is not bad. The SEC today looks poised to outlast even the longest human life span. It has largely moved beyond the tasks that dominated much of its early agenda - the taming of the New York Stock Exchange, the reform of corporate bankruptcies and public utilities - and ensconced itself firmly as the arbiter of corporate disclosure and the primary enforcer of anti-fraud rules relating to the purchase and sale of securities. And the perceived importance of those latter-day functions, and thus, the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s prospects for survival, have only increased of late, reinforced by the fin de <b>sicle</b> accounting scandals and corporate abuses. The list is by now familiar - Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Global Crossing, etc., etc. - and that drumbeat of scandal has made the SEC once again the fair-haired boy of the Congress and the White House. The SEC was given a raft of new enforcement tools by Congress in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as politicians fell over themselves to get tough on corporate crime in the wake of the collapse of the tech bubble. The SEC - most anxious not to disappoint - has responded to this groundswell of support with a flurry of rulemaking aimed at accountants, analysts and audit committees, just to covcr the 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 7 s. I have not run across any rules directed toward the 2 ̆ 2 Z 2 ̆ 7 s, but I am sure that is only because the agency has not gotten that far yet. So the SEC clearly shows no interest in slowing down and taking it easy as it reaches its advanced years. A more telling sign of continued vitality at thc SEC is that the customary complaints about how the agency docs not have nearly enough resources to adequately do its job of protecting the integrity of our financial markets have given way to an extraordinary situation in which the agency finds itself unable to spend all of the money allocated to it by Congress (which vas in turn, more than the White House asked for). This is a most unusual problem for a bureaucracy to have. In sum, business is booming at the SEC...|$|E

Trabalhamos nesse cotidiano as vivencias, as resist?ncias, as pr?ticas culturais da cidade em detrimento da presen?a dos ind?genas que por aqui viviam. Partimos da aceita??o dos ?ndios como sujeitos atuantes e com propriedade {{cultural}} de quem exerce um ethos mesmo que impelido. Muito j? se falou sobre a Belle ?poque Manauara, e sobre a quest?o do ?ndio, sempre em separado. Esta Disserta??o uniu essas duas tem?ticas visando evidenciar o aspecto ind?gena presente no mundo ?luxuoso e moderno? trazido pela Belle ?poque, e cristalizado pela historiografia celebrativa. Manaus cresceu, enfeitou-se para atender a um grupo especifico da cidade: a sociedade, a elite enriquecida pela extra??o da goma el?stica. Essa pesquisa tem como tema central, ?ndios na Belle ?poque Manauara, e visa fazer uma an?lise investigativa e descritiva do que aconteceu com os mesmos no fim do s?culo XIX, e inicio do XX, analisar o discurso que se construiu acerca da cidade e de seus habitantes. Trabalhamos com alguns te?ricos da modernidade, visando estabelecer um paralelo entre a cidade de Manaus e as demais capitais do mundo que se reconfiguraram, se reurbanizaram nos par?metros do que havia de mais moderno na ?poca. Vemos que entre a cidade mostrada nos postais e fotografias, e a cidade das viv?ncias, havia um limite de beleza em detrimento de que a tentativa de unicidade enfrentava uma resist?ncia pela presen?a de uma ampla diversidade ?tnica e cultural. A perspectiva de an?lise documental foi ? Nova Hist?ria e Nova Hist?ria Cultural, que seguindo a tradi??o da Escola dos Annales, faz uma an?lise cr?tica tentando visualizar a ?posi??o dos de baixo?, que pouco aparecem nos discursos oficias como protagonistas, por isso fazer nova hist?ria ? ouvir e dar vozes a novas partes. Com a leitura das fontes, percebemos como o ?ndio fez a seu modo, t?ticas de defesa, para prosseguir residindo na cidade da qual estava sendo impelido. Grandes pr?dios v?o aparecer na ent?o Man?os, trazendo consigo uma arquitetura e decora??o estrangeira, passando pelo barroco, rococ?, art nouveau, por?m sempre fazendo uma alus?o, mesmo que romantizada a cultura nativa. Veremos como deu-se o hibridismo cultural entre ?ndios e brancos nas suas pr?ticas sociais nesta fase da hist?ria da cidade. Falar dos ?ndios, ainda hoje desperta sentimentos de repulsa ou fasc?nio. Isso acontece, pelo fato de existirem pessoas que acreditam e personificam a cultura dos povos ind?genas como ?n?o desenvolvidas?, estagnada no tempo. Agora, se na contemporaneidade, no s?culo XXI, pensa-se assim, como seria esse imagin?rio no final do s?culo XIX, no advento do XX, no per?odo do ?fin de <b>si?cle?,</b> da Belle ?poque, h? 150 anos? Essa pesquisa, ao analisar o cotidiano da cidade, procurar? mostrar o imagin?rio das elites, dos transeuntes, dos viajantes acerca dos nativos, seus h?bitos e costumes. Iremos investigar e analisar o que aconteceu com ?ndios de Manaus durante esse per?odo. The Dissertation shows {{aspects of}} everyday life, indigenous knowledge {{and practices in}} Manaus {{during the period of}} the Belle ?poque. We work on that every day the livings, the resistance, the city's cultural practices {{to the detriment of the}} presence of indigenous people who lived here. We start from the acceptance of the Indians as acting subjects and cultural property of whoever has an ethos even if driven. Much has been said about the Belle ?poque Manauara, and the question of the Indian, always separately. This Dissertation has united these two themes in order to highlight the indigenous aspect present in the world "modern luxury" brought by the Belle ?poque, and crystallized by celebratory historiography. Manaus grew, adorned-to cater to a specific group of the city: society, the elite enriched by the extraction of chewing gum. This research is focused on, Indians in Belle ?poque Manauara, and aims to make an investigative analysis and descriptive of what happened to them in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth, analyse the speech that was built on the city and its population. We work with some theorists of modernity, to establish a parallel between the city of Manaus and the other capitals of the world that reconfigured if redevelopment for the parameters of what had of the art at the time. We see that between the city shown in postcards and photographs, and the town of experiences, there was a beauty limit the detriment that the attempt of unity faced resistance by the presence of a wide ethnic and cultural diversity. The prospect of document analysis was the New History and New Cultural History, which in the tradition of the Annales school, a critical analysis trying to view the "position of the low," which just appear in official speeches as protagonists so do new story is to listen and give voice to new parts. With the reading of the sources, we realize how the Indians made their way, defence tactics, to continue residing in the city, which was being driven. Large buildings will appear in Man?os then, bringing an architecture and decoration foreign, through the Baroque, Rococo, Art Nouveau, but always alluding, even romanticized native culture. We will see how gave up the cultural hybridity between Indians and whites in their social practices in this phase of the history of the city. Speaking of the Indians still arouses feelings of disgust and fascination. This happens because there are people who believe and embody the culture of indigenous peoples as "undeveloped", stagnant time. Now, if in contemporary times, in the XXI century, it is thought so, how would this imaginary in the late nineteenth century, the advent of the twentieth century, and the period of "fin de si?cle", the Belle ?poque, 150 years ago? This research, to analyse the life of the city, try to show the imagination of elites, bystanders, Travelers on the natives, their habits and customs. We will investigate and analyse what happened to Manaus Indians during this period...|$|E
