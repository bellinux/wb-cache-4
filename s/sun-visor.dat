50|$|Manufacturers of SUVs often post {{warnings}} on the driver's <b>sun-visor.</b> Among {{the vehicles}} which have received publicity for tendencies {{to roll over}} are the Ford Bronco II, Suzuki Samurai, Jeep CJ, Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, and Isuzu Trooper.|$|E
5000|$|Options {{available}} at extra cost included velour carpeting, grab handles for the passengers in the back, whitewall tires, a two tone paint finish {{and even a}} [...] "make-up mirror" [...] cleverly incorporated into the <b>sun-visor</b> on the passenger's side.|$|E

50|$|Gold is {{the most}} {{malleable}} of all metals; a single gram can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter, and an avoirdupois ounce into 300 square feet. Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become semi-transparent. The transmitted light appears greenish blue, because gold strongly reflects yellow and red. Such semi-transparent sheets also strongly reflect infrared light, making them useful as infrared (radiant heat) shields in visors of heat-resistant suits, and in <b>sun-visors</b> for spacesuits. Gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity.|$|R
50|$|The M-1 {{represented}} a huge advance over its predecessor in many respects. Most obviously, {{it came with}} a body that used the “all-steel” approach of the more modern western designs (despite retaining timber structural elements in the roof frame) and, unlike its predecessor, a permanent fixed roof. The chassis featured an “X” shaped cross member making it far stronger. The suspension was more modern and the road holding more sure-footed. Under the bonnet/hood the car came with automatic ignition, while the cabin featured front seats that could be adjusted, <b>sun-visors,</b> along with an electric fuel gauge, and windows which could be swiveled into an open position.|$|R
5000|$|... 152 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} from 1968 to 1979 in three batches and numbered EF81 1 to EF81 152.14 EF81-0 locomotives were later modified to become Class EF81-400. The prototype locomotive, EF81 1, {{was built by}} Hitachi, and delivered in 1968. Locomotives EF81 137 onward were built with <b>sun-visor</b> plates above the cab windows. These were also subsequently retro-fitted to locomotives EF81 133 to 136.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY We {{investigate}} {{strategies to}} improve the utterance verification performance using a 2 -class pattern classification approach, including: utilizing N-best candidate scores, modifying segmentation boundaries, applying background and out-of-vocabulary filler models, incorporating contexts, and minimizing verification errors via discriminative training. A connected-digit database recorded in a noisy, moving car with a hands-free microphone mounted on the <b>sun-visor</b> is {{used to evaluate the}} verification performance. The equal error rate (EER) of word verification is employed as the sole performance measure. All factors and their effects on the verification performance are presented in detail. The EER is reduced from 29 %, using the standard likelihood ratio test, down to 21. 4 %, when all features are properly integrated. key words: 2 -class classifier, discriminative training, N-best hypothesis, word verification 1...|$|E
50|$|The Scammell Townsman {{replaced}} the 3-ton Scarab. There was {{no provision for}} a 6-ton model; more conventional vehicles were used {{to take on the}} heavier role. The Townsman closely followed the Scarab in its basic design. The frame was of a welded construction and had integral coupling ramps fitted with Scammell Mechanical Horse automatic coupling. The engine, gearbox and driving axle formed a rigid assembly pivoted at the front end in a large rubber bush. A vacuum operated release mechanism {{replaced the}} hand lever mechanism used in the Scarab. The futuristic lines of the fibreglass cab were a novelty. Use of GRP for the cab had allowed for a more complex shape to be employed. Scammell had experience with GRP cabs in heavy lorries such as the Routeman, Trunker and Handyman with cabs designed by Michelotti. The new cab had many new developments, such as vacuum-assisted hydraulic brakes, a heater-demister, two rear view mirrors, interior <b>sun-visors,</b> totally enclosed oil-immersed coil spring front suspension and dual rate mounting of semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Later a larger engine was fitted; the Leyland OE160, being an in-house product due to Scammell being part of the Leyland Group. The Townsman had better driver controls and faster road speed (50 mph) but still lacked brakes on all wheels; only the rear axle had brakes. Legislation in the late 1960s regarding braking of goods vehicles meant that the working days of the innovative Scammells was nearing an end.|$|R
