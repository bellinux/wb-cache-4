40|$|Decayed-wood {{samples were}} {{collected}} from a naturally-infected bridge made of Quercus robur. Fruiting bodies of the white-rot basidiomycetes Hymenochaete rubiginosa and Stereum hirsutum were sampled. The white-rot fungus Fuscoporia ferrea and the secondary <b>saprobiont</b> Mycena galericulata were identified from the rotten wood by means of rDNA-ITS sequencing. The topochemistry of lignin degradation within individual cell-wall layers was determined by cellular UV-microspectrophotometry (UMSP) at 278 nm wavelength. Increased delignification occurred in compound middle lamella regions (CML), secondary wall layers of fibres (S 2), longitudinal and ray parenchyma cells as well in vessels. The highest lignin content at initial and medium decay was recorded in the CML, whereas in advanced decay secondary wall layers of the vessels exhibited the highest content of residual lignin. In all stages of degradation, the S 2 layers of fibres had the lowest lignin amount...|$|E

50|$|Extracellular {{digestion}} is {{a process}} in which <b>saprobionts</b> feed by secreting enzymes through the cell membrane onto the food. The enzymes catalyze the digestion of the food into molecules small enough to be taken up by passive diffusion, transport or phagocytosis. Since digestion occurs outside the cell, it is said to be extracellular. It takes place either in the lumen of the digestive system, in a gastric cavity or other digestive organ, or completely outside the body.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the second part}} of the results of the first short-term inventory of fungi species occurring in the Biebrza National Park and is focused on a survey of macrofungi. The total number of macrofungi found during the survey in late August 2012 was 289 taxa: 17 ascomycetes and 272 basidiomycetes, inhabiting diverse ecological niches. The identified fungi belonged to ectomycorrhizal symbionts and <b>saprobionts</b> decomposing wood, plant litter and animal remnants. The identity of 25 mycorrhizal fungi species has been confirmed using molecular techniques. Five species are newly reported for Poland (Amanita olivaceogrisea, Lepiota lepida, Stropharia alcis, Xerocomus fennicus, X. cisalpinus) and 225 taxa (79 %) were not known in the Biebrza National Park. Fifty species are endangered in Poland, of which nine species are protected by law. Data on species richness and the taxonomic diversity of the identified fungi are briefly commented in terms of their significance for nature conservation and future research...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{for the first}} time a list of the benthic microalgae of the Lebyazhy'i Ostrova Reserve, including the Karkinitsky Gulf and Sary-Bulatsky liman. During 2015 and 2016, 78 taxa were found: Bacillariophyta – 69, Cyanoprokaryota – 6, Haptophyta – 3. In the Karkinitsky Gulf 45 taxa were found, in the Sary-Bulatsky liman – 56 taxa. The Czekanovski-Sorensen similarity coefficient between these locality is 46 %. The basis of the flora is diatoms: Cocconeis scutellum, Entomoneis alata, Halamphora coffeiformis, Nitzschia scalpelliformis, Pleurosigma angulatum, Pl. elongatum, Psammodictyon panduriforme, including Coronia daemeliana, Surirella striatula, Tryblionella circumsuta, which are rare for the microphytobenthos of the Crimean coast of the Black Sea. According to different classifications, dominant algae are benthic (86 %), marine (49 %) and cosmopolite (30 %) species. Two potentially toxic species of diatoms, H. coffeiformis and Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha, were found once, 20 species of <b>saprobionts</b> – indicators of water quality were found. A comparison of the floras in the protected regions of the Black Sea between the Lebyazhy'i Ostrova Reserve and the Kazachya Bay Sanctuary showed 38 common species of benthic diatoms, in the Karadag Nature Reserve – 43 and in the Kazantip Nature Reserve (Azov Sea) – 21. The total microalgae abundance of the epilithon of the stones of the Sary-Bulatsky liman varied from 81, 000 to 331, 000 cellscm- 2, biomass – 0. 012 – 0. 018 mgcm- 2, number of species – 11 – 13. A significant contribution was made by cyanobacteria, their average abundance reached 256, 000 cellscm- 2 and biomass – 0. 007 mgcm- 2. The abundance of diatoms varied from 48, 000 to 75, 000 cellscm- 2, the biomass reached 0. 011 mgcm- 2 with the dominance of Seminavis ventricosa. The obtained data have shown the necessity of regular monitoring of the microphytobenthos of the Lebyazhy'i Ostrova Reserve in order to identify the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of mass, rare, toxic species and aquatic environment quality estimating using indicator species of microalgae...|$|R
