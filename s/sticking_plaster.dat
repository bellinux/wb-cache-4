2500|$|In 1981 the Royal College of Psychiatrists {{published}} {{the results of}} an extensive survey into the use of ECT in Great Britain. It revealed many psychiatrists ignoring the guidelines. “ECT in Britain: a shameful state of affairs” read the title of a Lancet editorial on the results of the survey. Less than half of the clinics visited by the researchers met the minimum standards in the guidelines. In many clinics, ECT was being given by [...] "bored and uninterested staff with obsolete machines operated by ignorant and uncaring psychiatrists". One clinic, where the staff used the phrase [...] "old is gold" [...] was using a 30-year-old machine mended with <b>sticking</b> <b>plaster.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Spira's first {{campaign}} was {{in opposition to}} the American Museum of Natural History in 1976, where cats were being experimented on, research that he persuaded them to stop. His most notable achievement was in 1980, when he convinced the cosmetics company Revlon to stop using the Draize test, which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals. He took out a full-page ad in several newspapers, featuring a rabbit with <b>sticking</b> <b>plaster</b> over the eyes, and the caption, [...] "How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?" [...] Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing, donated money to help set up the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing, and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies. Revlon has since renewed testing on animals as it is unwilling to give up revenue from sales in China, where animal testing is required for cosmetics and other items.|$|E

The tag is proposed for use as a wireless platform for long-term patient monitoring in hospital environments. A motion capture system is used to test the directions in which the tag can be read to inform a diversity study establishing the number of tags required on-body to ensure reliable reading for applications such as medical monitoring. Tag diversity performance with various body movements is also studied. It is established that four tags give all round body coverage with only 4 % loss in coverage for vertically polarised tags should one of them fail...|$|R

I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some <b>sticking</b> <b>plaster.</b> When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.|$|E
5000|$|Castle {{falconer}} at Lancre, Hodgesaargh is not {{his actual}} name, but some misunderstanding has been caused due to his birds' habit of attacking him when people speak to him (i.e. [...] "Hello, my name is Hodges...ARRRRRGH"). He survives a direct elvish invasion of the Lancre castle, mainly due {{to one of his}} birds attacking the elf. His ceremonial outfit of red and gold with a big floppy hat is usually supplemented with about three <b>sticking</b> <b>plasters.</b> One of the birds he breeds is the wowhawk, or Lappet-faced Worrier, which is like a goshawk only more so - it prefers to walk everywhere and faints at the sight of blood. In the book Carpe Jugulum he is responsible for discovering the phoenix. In the same book, he assists Granny Weatherwax in recovering from a vampire attack, though he clearly understood his life was in danger at that point.|$|R

40|$|Wearable sensor devices play a {{key role}} for the wide {{adoption}} of pervasive and continuous healthcare monitoring systems. A first generation of wearable devices was represented by e-textile. A new generation of devices is instead represented by the so called Biomedical Wireless Sensor Networks (BWSN), that is ad-hoc networks of wireless devices deployed on (or in proximity of) the patients, e. g. in the form of <b>sticking</b> <b>plasters,</b> sensing various biomedical parameters and routing such values toward a datawarehousing system. While BWSNs result in a non-intrusive and flexible solution for continuous patient monitoring, they also introduce new challenges in preserving privacy and security of the collected sensitive data. In this paper we present an overview of BWSN related security issues and discuss the main approaches used to cope with them. In particular we analyze how Intrusion Detection Systems designed to protect generic Wireless Sensor Networks must be customized to be useful in the healthcare field. We also propose some modification to the applied IDS to better fit BWSN specific requirements and identify limits of the proposed approach paving the way for future work...|$|R

The sky was now a curious leaden color, and the wild barley shone a livid white against the dark riband of the trail; the air was very hot {{and there was not}} a breath of wind. Festing noted that the horses were nervous and trotted fast, although they had made a long journey. Now and then they threw up their heads and snorted, and swerved violently when a gopher ran across the trail or a prairie-hen got up. The flies seemed to have gone, but the mosquitoes were out in clouds, and the hand with which he slapped his face and neck was soon smeared with small red stains. He could not hold the whip; but it was not needed, because the team rather required to be checked than urged.|$|E

Soon a more lasting and sightly material was found and employed to take the place of mud or slime, and that perfection in the compounding of plastering materials was approached at a very remote period is made evident by the fact that some of the earliest plastering which has remained undisturbed excels in its scientific composition that which we use at the present day.|$|R

5000|$|Veria {{fell to the}} Ottoman Empire in 1430, and the {{metropolitan}} cathedral was converted into a mosque named after the Ottoman Sultan (Hünkar means [...] "sovereign, emperor"). The Ottomans made a few alterations to the building, replacing the semi-circular arches of the upper windows to pointed ones, and demolished the northern portion of the transept to add a plain minaret. The external decoration of ancient Greek motifs remained unaltered but survive only in fragments today, but in the interior they covered up the 13th-century frescoes with plaster, damaging them in the process as they drilled holes to make the <b>plaster</b> <b>stick.</b>|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{severely}} deforming {{rheumatoid arthritis}} and impaired {{function of the}} upper extremity are often unable to use conventional walking aids. This report describes 42 such patients who were equipped with altogether 75 individually manufactured, lightweight walking aids (12 crutches, 12 forearm-crutches, 39 crutch-sticks and 12 <b>sticks).</b> A <b>plaster</b> cast of the patient's grip as well as analysis of the integrated function of the shoulder-elbow-wrist was used when preparing the walking aid. It was thereby possible to produce suitable walking aids for all but one patient. At follow-up after 12 - 18 months, of use, most patients belonging to functional classes II and III were satisfied with their walking aid(s) and 22 considered it/them indispensable. However, in 4 patients, progressive disease with increased disease activity/deteriorating hand function and in 3 patients increasing shoulder pain reduced their usability. Lack of motivation was one reason for low use intensity. Follow-up demonstrated that most patients {{were able to use}} these walking aids without detectable negative effects on the upper extremity. The durability of the walking aid was satisfactory. Thus an individually moulded handle on an adapted lightweight walking aid is important helping patients with severely deforming arthritis to maintain independent ambulation, and should be made more widely obtainable...|$|R
50|$|Mural {{painting}} {{is an art}} that is painted and applied to the wall, ceiling or other permanent surfaces that are sufficient in size. The technique used is called fresco, where the paint is applied on plaster on walls and/or ceilings. The pigment is mixed with water on a small layer of wet lime mortar or plaster, where it is later absorbed. After several hours, the plaster dries while reacting with the air. This creates a chemical reaction making the pigment <b>stick</b> to the <b>plaster.</b> Over {{a long period of}} time, the painting will end up with brilliant colors. One of the main mural paintings is four meters in diameter located on the central apse. There are several holes, due to excess moisture, on the original mural painting on the central apse that have not been restored. A polychrome wood carving and other objects are also located inside the church, some of which were successfully restored.|$|R

60|$|I am not {{mechanically}} {{acquainted with}} the art of painting, and have no other means of judging of a picture than as I see it resembling and refining upon nature, and presenting graceful combinations of forms and colours. I am, therefore, no authority whatever, {{in reference to the}} 'touch' of this or that master; though I know very well (as anybody may, who chooses to think about the matter) that few very great masters can possibly have painted, in the compass of their lives, one-half of the pictures that bear their names, and that are recognised by many aspirants to a reputation for taste, as undoubted originals. But this, by the way. Of the Last Supper, I would simply observe, that in its beautiful composition and arrangement, there it is, at Milan, a wonderful picture; and that, in its original colouring, or in its original expression of any single face or feature, there it is not. Apart from the damage it has sustained from damp, decay, or neglect, it has been (as Barry shows) so retouched upon, and repainted, and that so clumsily, that many of the heads are, now, positive deformities, with patches of paint and <b>plaster</b> <b>sticking</b> upon them like wens, and utterly distorting the expression. Where the original artist set that impress of his genius on a face, which, almost in a line or touch, separated him from meaner painters and made him what he was, succeeding bunglers, filling up, or painting across seams and cracks, have been quite unable to imitate his hand; and putting in some scowls, or frowns, or wrinkles, of their own, have blotched and spoiled the work. This is so well established as an historical fact, that I should not repeat it, at the risk of being tedious, but for having observed an English gentleman before the picture, who was at great pains to fall into what I may describe as mild convulsions, at certain minute details of expression which are not left in it. Whereas, it would be comfortable and rational for travellers and critics to arrive at a general understanding that it cannot fail to have been a work of extraordinary merit, once: when, with so few of its original beauties remaining, the grandeur of the general design is yet sufficient to sustain it, as a piece replete with interest and dignity.|$|R
