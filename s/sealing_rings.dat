40|$|The {{system of}} upper high nickel {{alloying}} steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> and lower high nickel alloying steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> {{installed in the}} grooves of turbine, can extend out and fit with the wall of valve cage, resulting in forming a good seal under the pressure. In the project, the failure steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is considered. This situation had threatened {{the safety of the}} whole steam turbine system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the failure cause of the steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> used in nuclear steam turbines. New high nickel steel alloy <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> was compared with the failed <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The dimensions of macroscopic ring with clearly plastic deformation were measured using calipers. Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> along with smaller grain size than the new <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation. Complex work environment caused recrystallization and recovery, resulting in grain refinement and secondary phase precipitation. Further embodiment, recrystallization and recovery caused the elastic modulus and hardness of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> decrease. Moreover, a lot of secondary phase precipitates appeared at grain boundaries during use. The appearance of secondary phase precipitates become the weakest part of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The applied load lead to <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure from the formation of microvoids to microvoids aggregated becoming microcracks until to the appearance of cracks at macroscopic scale. These changes of microscopic structure ultimately reflected in critical plastic deformation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main seal}} is the IX <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> force is {{provided}} by the elastic stored energy in the stressed <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> inside intensifying the sealing action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.|$|R
40|$|Pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> may be preferred. The bottom part of Figure 2 shows one example of an alternative gland configuration with an all-metal <b>seal</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since {{electrons}} flow in {{the opposite}} direction (from [...] "-" [...] to [...] "+" [...] electrode) than electrical current itself (from [...] "+" [...] to [...] "-" [...] electrode), it is actually more often {{from the surface of the}} side electrode, that is grounded to [...] "-" [...] electrode of the car battery and alternator, where electrons are ejected from towards central electrode. That's why it is important to have edge shaped area or even more areas there (just like some Bosch spark plugs with two edges in spear-like head), that are least exposed to the erosion forces from combustion process thus keeping ignition system in good working condition as long as possible (10000 - 25000 km for common spark plugs). Edge or pike is the area from where the spark jumps off most easily (if there are different options for current with similar gap between [...] "+" [...] and [...] "-" [...] electrode) and with less voltage drop (since the gap creates resistance in the circuit). Therefore, some spark plugs can be easily and sometimes even repeatedly renewed by just mild re-sharping these edges (as long as other vital parts and characteristics of spark plugs are not compromised) to the original working state or even re-modelating the original side electrode design (which is very tricky if you are not qualified electrician or physicist). But one has to be careful with a welded joint side electrode as repeatedly re-adjusting the gap between the electrodes may cause metal fatigue and losing part of the side electrode in the cylinder chamber will result in immediate ignition malfunction and almost certainly result in serious damage to the specially surface-treated cylinder walls or piston <b>sealing</b> <b>rings.</b> The very same problem can occur as a result of protruding flakes due to poor quality welding, since they are prone to become loose during prolonged service life of common spark plug. Therefore, any flaking should be treated by rubbing off if spark plug is reused beyond its recommended service life.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the exact mechanism(s) by which cytoskeletal structures are modulated during bone resorption. In this study, we have shown the possible role of different actin-binding and signaling proteins in the regulation of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation. Our analyses have demonstrated a significant increase in cortactin and a corresponding decrease in L-plastin protein levels in osteoclasts subjected to bone resorption for 18 h in the presence of RANKL, M-CSF, and native bone particles. Time-dependent changes in the localization of L-plastin (in actin aggregates) and cortactin (in the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring)</b> suggest that these proteins may be involved in the initial and maturation phases of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation, respectively. siRNA to cortactin inhibits this maturation process but not the formation of actin aggregates. Osteoclasts treated as above but with TNF-α demonstrated very similar effects as observed with RANKL. Osteoclasts treated with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-α displayed podosome-like structures in the entire subsurface and at the periphery of osteoclast. It is possible that TNF-α and RANKL-mediated signaling may play a role in the early phase of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> configuration (i. e. either in the disassembly of podosomes or formation of actin aggregates).
