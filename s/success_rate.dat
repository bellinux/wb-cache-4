5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{understand}} the relationship between, the traditional 16 -week versus an 8 -week, and college-level mathematics <b>success</b> <b>rates.</b> This study applied chi-square (χ 2) and analysis of variance to compare and contrast which course length of time, 8 -weeks or 16 -weeks, for college algebra resulted in a higher proportion of students successfully completing the course. In addition, <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> among ethnicities, gender, and age groups were also examined. The population sample for this study was 231 students enrolled in college algebra from fall 2004 through fall 2007. Data was analyzed on four sections of the traditional 16 -week courses and four sections of 8 -week courses. Success was defined as earning a grade of A, B, or C in the course. The study found that overall {{there was no significant difference}} in <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for the 8 -week and 16 -week college algebra courses. However, significant differences were found in <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> among Asian, Pacific Islander students enrolled in the 8 -week and 16 -week courses. No significant differences in <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> were found for White, Non-Hispanic; African-American, and Hispanic, Mexican American students.

When considering <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> among genders, no difference was found in <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for males or females who were enrolled in the 8 -week and 16 -week college algebra courses. There were a significant greater number of students in the age group (23 - 30) who were successful in the 16 -week college algebra course than in the 8 -week college algebra course.

40|$|Choosing the {{equivalence}} {{margin for}} a non-inferiority trial of an anti-infective medication involves both clinical and statistical considerations. This paper argues {{that for some}} trials the equivalence margin should depend on the underlying <b>success</b> <b>rates,</b> rather than being set in advance at a fixed level d. A valid statistical test that adapts d to the underlying <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> is described. When the <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for comparator drugs are well-established, a test of non-inferiority with a fixed d is appropriate. However, a fixed d may not be justifiable in {{a situation in which}} the expected <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> are difficult to estimate, such as for a new indication or for an unusual study design.

40|$|Background: Airway {{management}} {{is a key}} component of prehospital care for seriously ill and injured patients. Oral endotracheal intubation (OETI) is the definitive airway of choice in most emergency medical services (EMS) systems. However, OETI may not be an approved skill for some clinicians or may prove problematic in certain patients because of anatomic abnormalities, trauma, or inadequate relaxation. In these situations alternative airways are frequently employed. However, the reported <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for these devices vary widely, and established benchmarks are lacking. Objective: We sought to determine pooled estimates of the <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of alternative airway devices (AADs) and needle cricothyrotomy (NCRIC) and surgical cricothyrotomy (SCRIC) placement through a meta-analysis of the literature. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search for all English-language articles reporting <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for AADs, SCRIC, and NCRIC. Studies of field procedures performed by prehospital personnel from any nation were included. All titles were reviewed independently by two authors using prespecified inclusion criteria. Pooled estimates of <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for each airway technique were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Results: Of 2, 005 prehospital airway titles identified, 35 unique studies were retained for analysis of AAD <b>success</b> <b>rates,</b> encompassing a total of 10, 172 prehospital patients. The <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for SCRIC and NCRIC were analyzed across an additional 21 studies totaling 512 patients. The pooled estimates (and 95...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} multi-center study, non-submerged ITI {{implants}} were prospectively followed {{to evaluate their}} long-term prognosis in fully and partially edentulous patients. In a total of 1003 patients, 2359 implants were consecutively inserted. Following a healing period of 3 - 6 months, the successfully integrated implants were restored with 393 removable and 758 fixed restorations. Subsequently, all consecutive implants were documented annually up to 8 years. At each examination, the clinical status of all implants was evaluated according to predefined criteria of success. Therefore, the data base allowed the evaluation of 8 -year cumulative survival and <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for 2359 implants. In addition, cumulative <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated for implant subgroups divided per implant type, implant length, and implant location. Furthermore, the actual 5 -year survival and <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> could be determined for 488 implants. During the healing period, 13 implants did not successfully integrate, whereas 2346 implants fulfilled the predefined criteria of success. This corresponds with an early failure rate of 0. 55 %. During follow-up, 19 implants were classified as failures due to several reasons. In addition, 17 implants (≈ 0. 8 %) demonstrated at the last annual examination a suppurative periimplant infection. Including 127 drop out implants (≈ 5. 4 % drop out rate) into the calculation, the 8 -year cumulative survival and <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> resulted in 96. 7 % and 93. 3 %, respectively. The analysis of implant subgroups showed slightly more favorable cumulative <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for screw type implants (> 95 %) compared to hollow-cylinder implants (91. 3 %), and clearly better <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for mandibular implants (≈ 95 %) when compared to maxillary implants (≈ 87 %). The actual 5 -year survival and <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of 488 implants with 98. 2 % and 97. 3 %, respectively, were slightly better than the estimated 5 -year cumulative survival and <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of 2359 implants indicating that the applied life table analysis is a reliable statistical method to evaluate the long-term prognosis of dental implants. It can be concluded that non-submerged ITI implants maintain <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> well above 90 % in different clinical centers for observation periods up to 8 years. © Munksgaard 1997. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
