25|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> {{was first}} used in 1885, but not {{introduced}} into clinical practice until 1899, when August Bier subjected himself to a clinical experiment in which he observed the anesthetic effect, but also the typical side effect of postpunctural headache. Within a few years, <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> became widely used for surgical anesthesia and was accepted as a safe and effective technique. Although atraumatic (noncutting-tip) cannulae and modern drugs are used today, the technique has otherwise changed very little over many decades.|$|E

25|$|The first {{comprehensive}} medical textbook on the subject, Anesthesia, was authored in 1914 by anesthesiologist Dr. James Tayloe Gwathmey and the chemist Dr. Charles Baskerville. This book {{served as}} the standard reference for the specialty for decades and included details {{on the history of}} anesthesia as well as the physiology and techniques of inhalation, rectal, intravenous, and <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Paraplegia {{following}} <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> {{is extremely}} rare. Various lesions for neurologic complications {{have been documented}} in the literature. We report a 66 -year-old female who developed paraplegia after left knee surgery for osteoarthritis under <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> In the recovery room, paraplegia and numbness below T 4 vertebra was checked. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan showed a spinal thoracic intradural extramedullary (IDEM) tumor. After extirpation of the tumor, the motor weakness improved to the grade of 3 / 5. If a neurologic deficit following <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> does not resolve, a MRI should be performed without delay to accurately diagnose {{the cause of the}} deficit and optimal treatment should be rendered for the causative lesion.

30|$|Combined <b>spinal</b> {{epidural}} <b>anesthesia</b> {{is preferable}} in the anesthetic management of cesarean section with symptomatic anterior mediastinal mass. A well-designed preoperative strategy {{can lead to}} favorable outcomes even in this complicated situation.|$|R
25|$|Local anesthetics {{can block}} almost every nerve between the {{peripheral}} nerve endings {{and the central}} nervous system. The most peripheral technique is topical anesthesia to the skin or other body surface. Small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually (peripheral nerve block) or in anatomic nerve bundles (plexus anesthesia). <b>Spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and epidural anesthesia merge into the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on local}} tissue {{concentrations}} of local anesthetics, excitatory or depressant {{effects on the}} central nervous system may occur. Initial symptoms suggest some form of central nervous system excitation such as a ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a metallic taste in the mouth, or tingling or numbness of the mouth. As the concentration rises, a relatively selective depression of inhibitory neurons results in cerebral excitation, which may lead to more advanced symptoms include motor twitching in the periphery followed by grand mal seizures. A profound depression of brain functions occurs at higher concentrations which may lead to coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose. Another possibility is direct exposure of {{the central nervous system}} through the cerebrospinal fluid, i.e., overdose in <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia.|$|E
50|$|The article {{explained}} how Pagés, who had frequently performed <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesias,</b> developed {{the idea of}} injecting the anesthetics through the lumbar space between the 4th and 5th vertebrae, described 43 operations using this technique, provided details on each step and advised on the right dose of anesthesics (twice as much as was previously recommended in similar techniques). It also explained the effects of gradual insensibility and motor paralysis, the indications and contraindications and concluded recommending {{the use of this}} technique for surgical interventions. The technique was widely put into practice in the following months during the Spanish campaign in the Rif.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A prospective, {{randomized}} {{study was}} designed to compare the maternal and neonatal effects of conventional epidural <b>anesthesia</b> and combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> (CSE) for Cesarean section in severe preeclamptic patients. Additionally, two strategies in the prophylactic management of hypotension in severe preeclamptic patients were evaluated: fluid preloading or prophylactic ephedrine. METHODS: Thirty nonlaboring women with severe preeclampsia (PET), scheduled for an elective Cesarean section, were randomised into three groups: epidural anesthesia with prophylactic fluid loading (EA-F), combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> with prophylactic fluid loading (CSE-F), or combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> with prophylactic ephedrine (CSE-V). Hemodynamic data were recorded prior and after induction of regional anesthesia at five-minute intervals. The total amount of intravenous administered fluid and the total dose of vasopressors were recorded. RESULTS: Hemodynamic data were similar between the three groups. The incidence and duration of hypotension was similar in all three groups. Significantly more ephedrine was used in the CSE-V group as compared to the CSE-F group. More lactated Ringer's solution was used in the CSE-F group as compared to the CSE-V group. There were no hypertensive episodes and none of the patients developed pulmonary edema. The time period from induction until the start of surgery and the duration of surgery were significantly shorter in both CSE-groups. Neonatal outcome was comparable between the three groups. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that combined <b>spinal</b> and epidural <b>anesthesia</b> (CSE) is a safe alternative to conventional epidural anesthesia in severe preeclamptic women and that the prophylactic use of ephedrine is effective and safe to prevent and treat spinal hypotension after combined <b>spinal</b> and epidural <b>anesthesia</b> for Cesarean section in severe preeclamptic women. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Anesthesia is {{administered}} to prevent pain from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing. [...] Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia. [...] <b>Spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> {{may be used}} when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. [...] With local and <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated. [...] In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. [...] The patient is intubated and is placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced {{by a combination of}} injected and inhaled agents.|$|E

30|$|A 30 -year-old {{woman at}} 40  weeks’ {{gestation}} complained of breathlessness and cough, {{and she was}} not able to lie supine because of respiratory distress. Computed tomography scan revealed a large anterior-superior mediastinal mass severely compressing the trachea, bilateral main bronchus, and superior vena cava. Because clinical symptoms and computed tomographic findings suggested imminent respiratory catastrophe, urgent cesarean section was planned. The patient was able to lie in the semi-recumbent position with minimal symptoms; therefore, we considered it safe to perform cesarean section with combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> In the event of cardiopulmonary collapse, emergent intubation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were also planned. The operation was performed successfully with combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> The infant was healthy, and the postoperative hospital course was uneventful.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> is a [...] "one-shot" [...] {{injection}} {{that provides}} rapid onset and profound sensory anesthesia with lower doses of anesethetic, {{and is usually}} associated with neuromuscular blockade (loss of muscle control). [...] Epidural anesthesia uses larger doses of anesthetic infused through an indwelling catheter which allows the anesthetic to be augmented should the effects begin to dissipate. Epidural anesthesia does not typically affect muscle control.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. George Emory Goodfellow (December23,1855 – December7,1910) was a {{physician}} and naturalist in the American Old West who developed a reputation as the United States' foremost expert in treating bullet wounds. As {{a physician}} in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, he treated many gunshot wounds to both lawmen and outlaws. [...] He performed the first recorded laparotomy for treating an abdominal gunshot wound {{and was the first}} surgeon to perform a perineal prostatectomy to remove an enlarged prostate. He pioneered the use of <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds and is regarded as the first civilian trauma surgeon.|$|E
2500|$|The field {{hospital}} hadn't the facilities to heal such a complex injury; however, it sufficed {{to keep him}} alive. It was {{three weeks before the}} wounded ace was stable enough to be transferred. On 31 October, he shipped out, slated for Saint Vincenzstift Hospital in Hannover. However, his squadronmates alerted his 33-year-old elder sister Franziska. She was a nursing supervisor in Viktoria-Lazarett (Victoria Hospital), Berlin. She arranged for her brother to be diverted to the Berlin clinic of one of Germany's pre-eminent surgeons, Doctor August Bier, who pioneered use of cocaine in <b>spinal</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> Berthold entered the clinic on 2 November 1917. Berthold was there for four months as Doctor Bier labored to save his arm from amputation. Meantime, counter to Berthold's wishes, Oberleutnant Ernst Wilhelm Turck assumed Berthold's dual commands of Jagdstaffel 18 and Jagdgruppe 7. Berthold spent his convalescent leave learning to write with his left hand. He believed, [...] "If I can write, I can fly." [...] Meantime, his right arm remained paralyzed as it slowly healed. He remained dependent on narcotics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc), {{a progressive}} disease characterized by excessive accumulation of connective tissue components. Although most patients have long survival, {{some of them}} progress rapidly to death. Pulmonary system involvement and pulmonary hypertension are the most frequent cause of death. When the patient with SSc is to be operated, the anesthetic procedure could be a serious problem. In this article, we report a combined spinal – epidural technique in a patient with progressive SSc and the anesthetic considerations that could be recommended for these patients. Case presentation A 68 -year-old woman who {{had a history of}} progressive systemic sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kyphoscoliosis and decreased oral apertura underwent total hip arthroplasty. This operation was performed successfully under combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> Conclusion Systemic sclerosis is a complex disease that involves multiple organ systems. Every aspects of anesthetic care may be altered or hindered by the pathogenesis of disease.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether intrathecal sufentanil alone provides an adequate analgesia for patients undergoing transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) and to compare it to standard <b>spinal</b> bupivacaine <b>anesthesia</b> in terms of motor and sensory blockade, discharge time and side effects. Sixty-two patients were blindly and randomly assigned to receive either intrathecal bupivacaine (10 mg of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine) or intrathecal sufentanil (15 microg). Motor and sensory blockade was evaluated using a modified Bromage scale as well as cold and pinprick tests. Severity of pain was assessed by means of a 10 -point verbal analog scale. We found that the mean duration of sensory blockade was similar for both sufentanil and bupivacaine patients but the quality of analgesia induced by sufentanil alone was poor as compared with <b>spinal</b> bupivacaine <b>anesthesia.</b> The subarachnoid administration of sufentanil 15 mg seems to be inadequate for TURB surgery. In addition, the advantage of a faster recovery we observed in sufentanil patients is minimized by the occurrence of a troublesome symptom such as pruritus. On the other hand, spinal bupivacaine produces an undesirable motor blockade exceeding, in our opinion, the requirement for TURB procedure...|$|R
