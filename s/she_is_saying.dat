25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books even if she was not in a trance.|$|E
500|$|Within the series, set {{during the}} Prohibition-era of the United States, Isaac and Miria [...] "are {{a pair of}} idiotic lovers and thieves" [...] who are portrayed as [...] "always {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic". They are often mistaken for performers because {{of the variety of}} disguises they employ during their heists, such as dressing up as mummies or as the Tramp. The duo commit a variety of eccentric robberies, including attempting to steal time by stealing watches, trying to stop anyone from entering a museum by stealing the entrance and stealing the Genoard family fortune to prevent the family from fighting over it. Miria exhibits a complete trust in Isaac and supports anything he says no matter how ridiculous it is and often goes as far to mimic his body language and his speech, although she often does not really know what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Although the pair are very idiotic, Isaac is not completely stupid and there are occasions that shows that he displays his inner intelligence. He is able to recognize a pair of plainclothes officers because he claims that he is familiar with their speech style. Isaac and Miria may have been born into wealthy families because they state that their parents' homes and the Genoard mansion have similar exteriors.|$|E
500|$|... "You Must Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who had reunited for Evita after a ten-year {{creative}} separation due to their individual projects. It was written specifically for the film, {{so that it would}} contain new material and be eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Madonna noted it as her favorite song from the film, recalling that the idea for [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] grew when Parker re-arranged the ending of the film from the original play, with the hopes of reuniting Rice and Webber to create new music. According to Webber, the purpose of the song was to showcase Perón's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Perón; [...] " [...] is dying and she knows she's dying. One reason <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> 'You must love me', is out of desperation. She's also saying, 'You must love me because you must have always loved me', so it's a little word play, I guess, which Tim Rice has written", he explained. It was released as the soundtrack's first official single on October 27, 1996. Since its release, the song has been included in several productions of the play, including the 2006 London production and the 2012 Broadway revival.|$|E

2500|$|Hart in 1857 stated:-"The {{quality of}} mind {{which is most}} {{apparent}} in Miss Sedgwick's writings is that of strength. The reader feels at every step {{that he has to}} do with a vigorous and active intellect. Another quality, resulting from this possession of power, is the entire absence of affectation of every kind. There is no straining for effect, no mere verbal prettinesses. The discourse proceeds with the utmost simplicity and directness, as though the author were more intent upon what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> than how she says it. As a novelist, Sedgwick has for the most part wisely chosen American subjects. The local traditions, scenery, manners, and costume, being thus entirely familiar, she has had greater freedom in the exercise of the creative faculty, on which, after all, real eminence in the art mainly depends. Her characters are conceived with distinctness, and are minutely individual and consistent, while her plot always shows a mind fertile in resources and a happy adaptation of means to ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to talk about something else. Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{interpretation}} {{in the modern era}} is that the speech is ironic; Katherina has not been tamed at all, she has merely duped Petruchio into thinking she has. Two especially well known examples of this interpretation are seen in the two major feature film adaptations of the play; Sam Taylor's 1929 version and Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 version. In Taylor's film, Katherina, played by Mary Pickford, winks at Bianca during the speech, indicating she does not mean a word of what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> In Zeffirelli's film, Katherina, played by Elizabeth Taylor, delivers the speech as though it were her own idea, and the submission aspect is reversed by her ending the speech and leaving the room, causing Petruchio to have to run after her. Phyllis Rackin {{is an example of a}} scholar who reads the speech ironically, especially in how it deals with gender. She points out that several lines in the speech focus on the woman's body, but in the Elizabethan theatre, the role would have been played by a young boy, thus rendering any evocation of the female form as ironic. Reading the play as a satire of gender roles, she sees the speech as the culmination of this process. Along similar lines, Philippa Kelly says [...] "the body of the boy actor in Shakespeare's time would have created a sexual indeterminacy that would have undermined the patriarchal narrative, so that the taming is only apparently so. And in declaring women's passivity so extensively and performing it centre-stage, Kate might be seen to take on a kind of agency that rebukes the feminine codes of silence and obedience which she so expressly advocates." [...] Similarly, Coppélia Kahn argues the speech is really about how little Katherina has been tamed; [...] "she steals the scene from her husband, who has held the stage throughout the play, and reveals that he has failed to tame her in the sense he set out to. He has gained her outward compliance in the form of a public display, while her spirit remains mischievously free." ...|$|E

6000|$|Confusion of mind.--Most persons, whilst {{blushing}} intensely, {{have their}} mental powers confused. This is recognized in such common expressions as [...] "she {{was covered with}} confusion." [...] Persons in this condition lose their presence of mind, and utter singularly inappropriate remarks. They are often much distressed, stammer, and make awkward movements or strange grimaces. In certain cases involuntary twitchings {{of some of the}} facial muscles may be observed. I have been informed by a young lady, who blushes excessively, that at such times she does not even know what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> When it was suggested to her that this might be due to her distress from the consciousness that her blushing was noticed, she answered that this could not be the case, [...] "as she had sometimes felt quite as stupid when blushing at a thought in her own room." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. MALAPROP Observe me, Sir Anthony. I would by {{no means}} wish a {{daughter}} of mine to be a progeny of learning; I don't think so much learning becomes a young woman; for instance, I would never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or algebra, or simony, or fluxions, or paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches of learning--neither would it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathematical, astronomical, diabolical instruments.--But, Sir Anthony, I would send her, at nine years old, to a boarding-school, {{in order to learn}} a little ingenuity and artifice. Then, sir, she should have a supercilious knowledge in accounts;--and as she grew up, I would have her instructed in geometry, that she might know something of the contagious countries;--but above all, Sir Anthony, she should be mistress of orthodoxy, that she might not mis-spell, and mis-pronounce words so shamefully as girls usually do; and likewise that she might reprehend the true meaning of what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> This, Sir Anthony, is what I would have a woman know;--and I don't think there is a superstitious article in it.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the first}} faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be {{stalking}} around in great flocks, {{and ready to}} be sociable and answer invitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind. The hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkey-call by sucking the air through the leg-bone of a turkey which had previously answered a call like that and lived only {{just long enough to}} regret it. There is nothing that furnishes a perfect turkey-call except that bone. Another of Nature's treacheries, you see. She is full of them; half the time she doesn't know which she likes best--to betray her child or protect it. In the case of the turkey she is badly mixed: she gives it a bone to be used in getting it into trouble, and she also furnishes it with a trick for getting itself out of the trouble again. When a mamma-turkey answers an invitation and finds she has made a mistake in accepting it, she does as the mamma-partridge does--remembers a previous engagement--and goes limping and scrambling away, pretending to be very lame; {{and at the same time}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> to her not-visible children, [...] "Lie low, keep still, don't expose yourselves; I shall be back as soon as I have beguiled this shabby swindler out of the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|That is clumsy. Battles do not wage, battles are waged. Mrs. Eddy has {{one very}} curious and {{interesting}} peculiarity: whenever she notices {{that she is}} chortling along without saying anything, she pulls up with a sudden [...] "God is over us all," [...] or some other sounding irrelevancy, and for the moment it seems to light up the whole district; then, before you can recover from the shock, she goes flitting pleasantly and meaninglessly along again, and you hurry hopefully after her, thinking {{you are going to}} get something this time; but as soon as she has led you far enough away from her turkey lot she takes to a tree. Whenever she discovers that she is getting pretty disconnected, she couples-up with an ostentatious [...] "But" [...] which has nothing to do with anything that went before or is to come after, then she hitches some empties to the train-unrelated verses from the Bible, usually--and steams out of sight and leaves you wondering how she did that clever thing. For striking instances, see bottom paragraph on page 34 and the paragraph on page 35 of her Autobiography. She has a purpose--a deep and dark and artful purpose--in what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> in the first paragraph, and you guess what it is, but that is due to your own talent, not hers; she has made it as obscure as language could do it. The other paragraph has no meaning and no discoverable intention. It is merely one of her God-over-alls. I cannot spare room for it in this place.|$|E
6000|$|The MARCH'S dining-room opens through French {{windows on}} one of those [...] gardens which seem infinite, till they are seen to be coterminous [...] with the side walls of the house, and finite at the far end, because [...] only the thick screen of acacias and sumachs {{prevents}} another house [...] from being seen. The French and other windows form practically all [...] the outer wall of that dining-room, and between them and the screen [...] of trees lies the difference between the characters of Mr and Mrs [...] March, with dots and dashes of Mary and Johnny thrown in. For [...] instance, it has been formalised by MRS MARCH but the grass has not [...] been cut by MR MARCH, and daffodils have sprung up there, which MRS [...] MARCH desires for the dining-room, but of which MR MARCH says: [...] "For [...] God's sake, Joan, let them grow." [...] About half therefore are now in a [...] bowl on the breakfast table, and the other half still in the grass, [...] in the compromise essential to lasting domesticity. A hammock under [...] the acacias shows that MARY lies there sometimes with her eyes on [...] the gleam of sunlight that comes through: and a trail in the longish [...] grass, bordered with cigarette ends, proves that JOHNNY tramps there [...] with his eyes on the ground or the stars, according. But all this [...] is by the way, because except for a yard or two of gravel terrace [...] outside the windows, it is all painted on the backcloth. The [...] MARCHES have been at breakfast, and the round table, covered with [...] blue linen, is thick with remains, seven baskets full. The room is [...] gifted with old oak furniture: there is a door, stage Left, Forward; [...] a hearth, where a fire is burning, and a high fender on which one [...] can sit, stage Right, Middle; and in the wall below the fireplace, [...] a service hatch covered with a sliding shutter, for the passage of [...] dishes into the adjoining pantry. Against the wall, stage Left, is [...] an old oak dresser, and a small writing table across the Left Back [...] corner. MRS MARCH still sits behind the coffee pot, making up her [...] daily list on tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her [...] wrist. She is personable, forty-eight, trim, well-dressed, and more [...] matter-of-fact than seems plausible. MR MARCH is sitting in an [...] armchair, sideways to the windows, smoking his pipe and reading his [...] newspaper, with little explosions to which no one pays any [...] attention, because it is his daily habit. He is a fine-looking man [...] of fifty odd, with red-grey moustaches and hair, both of which [...] stiver partly by nature and partly because his hands often push them [...] up. MARY and JOHNNY are close to the fireplace, stage Right. [...] JOHNNY sits on the fender, smoking a cigarette and warming his back. [...] He is a commonplace looking young man, with a decided jaw, tall, [...] neat, soulful, who has been in the war and writes poetry. MARY is [...] less ordinary; you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her. [...] She too is tall, a little absent, fair, and well-looking. She has a [...] small china dog in her hand, taken from the mantelpiece, and faces [...] the audience. As the curtain rises <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> in her soft and [...] pleasant voice: [...] "Well, what is the matter with us all, Johnny?" ...|$|E
