This {{report shows}} {{the results of}} an {{experimental}} work carried out with the aim to improve defect analysis and sizing of both volumetric and planar defects, detected and imaged with the phased array probe technique. The phased array technique produces S-scan type images of defects which put easily in evidence the structure of the relevant echo indications. Depending of defect morphology, we can see diffracted echoes from planar defects, and also secondary echoes (improperly considered as diffracted echoes), generated by a complex conversion mode process, from volumetric ones. We can see also <b>single</b> <b>indications,</b> when defect height is comparable with ultrasonic wavelength or its complex geometry destroy diffracted or secondary indications, and, finally, we can see clustered indications. Thus we have to recognize such different image structures in order to apply the most suitable sizing procedure. The obtained results are very satisfactory and allow us to be more confident in apply phased array technique. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Single Technology Appraisal (STA) {{process was}} {{introduced}} by NICE in 2005 {{as a means of}} undertaking “fast track ” appraisals of single technologies, for <b>single</b> <b>indications.</b> Unlike the standard multiple technology appraisal (MTA) process, STA relies on a manufacturer evidence submission and an independent critique of that submission, rather than an independent analysis. This project is concerned with how the STA process operates. Using the overarching themes of methodological robustness, transparency and inclusiveness, ten STAs were tracked as cases in the review. A range of data is drawn on to gain an insight into the STA process: documents and correspondence surrounding each case, attendance at Appraisal Committee (AC) meetings, interviews and surveys of stakeholders and AC members. Low response rates to the surveys meant that the study is limited in its ability to report on the issues of transparency and inclusiveness, despite having increased the number and range of interviews conducted as a consequence. A number of key findings are identified in relation to methodological robustness an...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous transluminal {{coronary}} angioplasty (PTCA) and {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) are major coronary revascularization procedures to relieve angina, prevent myocardial infarction and improve long-term survival. The quality of their indication is widely discussed at present. The Swiss Societies of Cardiology, of Internal Medicine and of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery decided {{to set up a}} consensus conference to evaluate the indications for coronary revascularization. For this a modified RAND approach (Delphi method) was used. An expert panel rated 992 indications for coronary revascularization twice for appropriateness (more benefits than risks for the patient), and once for necessity (procedure has to be offered or discussed with the patient). In the panel an agreement percentage of 65 % was noted. In 35 % we observed neither agreement nor disagreement, and there was almost no disagreement among the panelists. The results of the necessity ratings were 48 % agreement, 49 % indetermination and 3 % disagreement.

Such devices {{are used for}} the subcutaneous delivery of biopharmaceuticals, primarily for self-administration by the patient. Previous usability work on autoinjectors {{reported in the literature}} has been specific to <b>single</b> <b>indications.</b> This study was instead conducted with a broad user population, defined to represent user characteristics across a range of indications. The goals of the study were to evaluate whether users could use the devices safely and effectively, and could understand the instructions for use (IFU) as well as the accompanying training. Further objectives were to capture any usability issues and to obtain participants&# 39; subjective ratings on the IFU and training as well as the confidence and comfort in using the device. A total of 43 participants in 5 groups received training and performed simulated injections either into an injection pad or a mannequin. All participants were able to successfully use the device. The device was well appreciated by all users, with a reported degree of confidence in using the device of 98 %, of user comfort of 93 %, and of comprehensibility of IFU and training of 98 %. These values are higher than other comparable results reported in the literature. The presence of both audible and visible feedback during injection was seen to be a significant factor contributing to injection success. The observation that the device can be safely and efficiently used by all tested user groups provides confidence that the device and IFU in their current form will pass future summative testing in specific applications.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the cone beam {{computer}} tomography (CBCT) has received increasing importance for clinical diagnostic {{in the field of}} implantology, oral surgery, periodontology and orthodontics. In the past, the justified indications in orthodontics have mostly been related to <b>single</b> <b>indications</b> rather than on a comprehensive diagnosis for orthodontic treatment planning. CBCT studies on the prevalence of therapeutically relevant incidental findings in the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus are rare. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the maxillary sinuses in CBCT of different patient groups to answer two questions: a) What is the prevalence of pathological findings in the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus? b) Which diagnosis method is clinically suitable to evaluate the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus in a specific and reliable way? A total of 960 maxillary sinuses were diagnosed in CBCT of 480 patients. All CBCT were created by MESANTIS (3 D Dental Imaging Center) for orthodontic, implantological or ENT reasons. To determine the prevalence of findings or incidental findings in the maxillary sinus the degree of opacity acc. to Nair (2009), the mucosal thickening of appearance acc. to Carmeli et al. (2010), thickening of the mucosa acc. to Carmeli et al. (2010), the obstructed ostium and the presence of a concha bullosa media was evaluated in the subgroups of "orthodontics", "implant" and “ENT". The results were also analyzed according to gender. In addition, the orthodontic patients were also divided into two age groups (adolescents/adults) and 91 adolescents of the orthodontics were further divided in mouth or nose breathers. In the orthodontic group the prevalence of maxillary sinus with opacities was 60. 8 %, 60. 2 % mu-cosal findings, 36. 7 % mucosal thickening > 5 mm, 12. 6 % obstructed ostium and 30. 4 % of concha bullosa media. The ENT patients and implant patients showed similar prevalence, except for mucosal thickening (> 5 mm), the implant patients presented a prevalence of 51. 4 %. The male patients showed always significantly higher prevalence when compared with the female group. Only the concha bullosa media was diagnosed more often in female patients. In the orthodontic group the adolescents (17. 5 %) showed a higher prevalence of an obstructed ostium when compared with the adult group (7. 5 %). For all other parameters no significant differences were detectable between the two age groups. The comparison between mouth and nasal breather showed that mouth breather had with 29. 6 % (p= 0. 041) a significantly higher prevalence for an obstructed ostium than nasal breather (15. 6 %). In this study the comparison of the degree of sinus opacity acc. to Nair (2009) and the stages of mucosal thickening acc. to Carmeli et al. (2010) presented no significant differences. Compared with the data from the literature the classification of Nair (2009) has been emerged as a practical and reliable method. In conclusion, all patients groups showed a high prevalence of findings or incidental findings in the nasal cavity and/or maxillary sinus. The classification by Nair (2009) is recommended for routine clinical application. The exclusion of therapeutically relevant incidental findings in the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus is due to the high prevalence a justified indication for a CBCT in a comprehensive orthodontic treatment planning protocol. CBCT in orthodontic requires a medium or large field of view (FOV). Thus, in the future there might be an interesting synergy for dentistry and ENT. Corresponding CBCT images could be used effectively by both disciplines. This in turn could then significantly reduce the number of medical CT which is usually ordered by ENT doctors. Further studies should investigate to what extent the average medical radiation dose of the population can be reduced because of such a synergy...|$|E

50|$|The most {{immediate}} impact of de Damhouder's works {{was on the}} witch trials of the time, in which the Praxis rerum criminalium and its translations were cited regularly as fundamental works.

According to the Praxis, witchcraft was a heinous crime that went unpunished too often because of the ignorance of magistrates, and which also covered love charms, fortune-telling, astrology and other superstitious practices. De Damhouder expanded on this by providing detailed practical advice (backed up by examples from his own court practice) on how to conduct interrogations of suspected witches under torture. These included, for example, the recommendation to shave off all hair and to inspect all orifices of the suspect, in order to uncover hidden magical amulets {{that would make the}} wearer withstand torture.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{review their}} experience, {{evaluating}} the incidence and examining the various modalities {{employed in the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} patients with Crohn's disease complicated by fistulae. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although common, internal and external fistulae in Crohn's disease may pose challenging problems to the surgeon. METHODS: Of 639 patients who underwent surgical treatment at the University of Chicago between 1970 and 1988 for complications of Crohn's disease, 222 patients (34. 7 %) were found to have 290 intra-abdominal fistulae. RESULTS: A fistula was diagnosed preoperatively in 154 patients (69. 4 %), intraoperatively in 60 (27 %), and only after examination of the specimen in 8 (3. 6 %). The fistula represented the primary or <b>single</b> <b>indication</b> for surgical treatment in 14 patients (6. 3 %) and one of several indications in the remaining patients. Of 165 patients with an abdominal mass or abscess, 69 (41. 8 %) had a fistula. All patients underwent resection of the diseased intestinal segment; 160 (73. 1 %) with primary anastomosis and the remaining 62 with a temporary or permanent stoma. The fistula was directly responsible for a stoma in only 16 patients (7. 2 %) and was never responsible for a permanent stoma. Resection of the diseased bowel achieved en bloc removal of the fistula in 145 cases. Removal of 93 additional fistulae required resection of the diseased bowel segment along with closure of a fistulous opening on the stomach or duodenum (n = 14), bladder (n = 35), or rectosigmoid (n = 44). When the fistula drained through a vaginal cuff (n = 4), the opening was left to close by secondary intention; when the fistula opened through the abdominal wall (n = 46), the fistulous tract was debrided. In the remaining two entero-salpingeal fistulae, en bloc resection of the involved salpinx accomplished complete removal of the fistula. There was a dehiscence of one duodenal and one bladder repair; 14 patients (6 %) experienced postoperative septic complications and one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulae are diagnosed preoperatively in 69 % of cases and can be suspected in as many as 42 % of patients with an abdominal mass. Fistulae are the primary or <b>single</b> <b>indication</b> for surgical treatment and are directly responsible for a stoma only in a few patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Whereas {{most areas}} of {{dentistry}} aim for a vindicatory <b>single</b> <b>indication,</b> Cone Beam CT (CBCT), prepared for treatment planning in orthodontia, helps {{to cover a}} range of several indications simultaneously. Those are for example: evaluation of the peridental bone, diagnosis of asymmetries, cephalometric 3 D analysis, evaluation of the temporomandibular joints and evidence of laryngorhinologic findings. The objective {{of the present study}} was to collect the prevalence of laryngorhinologic findings of patients in orthodontic treatment. The results of this study shall help to eveluate whether CBCT is a reasonable tool to provide a range of indications within treatment planning in orthodontia. METHODS: 500 orthodontic patients within an age of 6 till 74 years were chosen randomised from a patient pool of a dental radiologic institute. For all those patients a CBCT had been prepared due to a vindicatory <b>single</b> <b>indication</b> in orthodontia. All CBCT were examined systemetically for secondary findings regarding the paranasal sinuses, the nasal cavity and the posterior upper airways. RESULTS: Within the maxillary sinus alterations of the mucous membrane were detected for 57, 3 % till 62, 8 % of the patients. In the ethmodial cells partial shadows as well as bone destructions were visible in 6 %, respectively 3 % of the CBCT. 13, 4 % destroyed grounds and 20 % alterations of the mucous membrane were observed in the sphenoidal sinus. The frontal sinus also showed alterations of the mucous membrane (11, 2 %) and modified pneumatisations in 11, 4 % of the cases. The examination ot the nasal cavity revealed destructions of the lateral bone and ambilateral lesion expansions in 10, 8 % of the cases respectively. 45, 2 % of the CBCT showed asymmetries, 31 % showed septal deviations. On each side 14 % of the patients had hyperplastic inferior nasal conchae. Constrictions in the nasopharynx were observed for a range of 5, 8 % till 7, 2 % of the patients. 6, 4 % showed extended nasopharyngeal areas. The mesopharynx showed fewer extensions of only 3, 6 %, however more constrictions (11 %). CONCLUSION: Within a pool of orthodontic patients numerous laryngorhinologic secondary findings with partly high prevalence can be observed. This indicates that CBCT can not only help to approach numerous issues within the treatment planning in orthodontia but also visualize those laryngorhinologic findings.
