500|$|From the 20th floor upwards, {{the square}} {{edges of the}} tower's cubic base are {{chamfered}} back, shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles, or an elongated square antiprism. Near its middle, the tower forms a perfect octagon, and then culminates in a glass parapet, whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base. A 408-foot (124 m) sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna– designed in a collaboration between Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), artist Kenneth Snelson (who invented the tensegrity structure), lighting designers, and engineers– is secured by a system of cables, and rises from a circular <b>support</b> <b>ring,</b> which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment.

500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.|$|E

The specimen then was supported only by the bottom half of the ring (half ring). It was observed that the natural frequency of the specimen (first mode) increased of a value of 552. 5 Hz due to the influence of the reduced mass of the <b>supporting</b> <b>ring.</b> But the damping ratio value obtained was the same as that obtained with full <b>supporting</b> <b>ring,</b> namely 0. 13 %...|$|R

50|$|For {{the basic}} process only a {{thin-walled}} cylinder and <b>supporting</b> elements (<b>supporting</b> <b>rings)</b> which are positioned {{on the inside}} surface of the cylinder are needed. When the cylinder is put under an exterior pressure, the material between the <b>supporting</b> <b>rings</b> is pushed inwards. After reaching a critical but still considerably small exterior pressure (instability point), rectangular vault structures are formed spontaneously. This effect is called in the jargon as „buckling“. The circumferential, straight folds arise by the underlying supporting elements, while the axial folds develop all by themselves (self-organization) in a staggered way without an underlying tool.|$|R

50|$|The soft PAX {{sidewall}} {{allows for}} a more comfortable ride compared to run flat tires which work by having stiff sidewalls. When flat, the PAX tire sidewalls collapse until {{the weight of the}} car is riding on an internal polymer <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> mounted to an asymmetric wheel. That is the outside diameter of the wheel is smaller than the inside diameter of the wheel. This asymmetric wheel and tire design allows the tire to lock onto the wheel, rather than coming off at speed and/or while turning. So a PAX wheel that appears to be about 18 inches from the outside of the car (the side facing out), will look more like 19 inches {{on the inside of the}} wheel (the side facing the suspension).

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the axisymmetric buckling of radially loaded circular Mindlin plates with internal concentric <b>ring</b> <b>supports.</b> The {{edge of the}} plate is either simply supported or clamped. Based on the Rayleigh-Ritz energy approach, buckling factors are determined and tabulated for plates of various thickness to radius ratios and with either one or two internal concentric rigid <b>ring</b> <b>supports</b> at various radii. The {{results show that the}} buckling factors for circular plates with one concentric <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> decrease with increasing thickness-radius ratios due to the increasing shear deformation effect. The effect of shear deformation on the buckling factors for plates with two <b>ring</b> <b>supports</b> is more pronounced than for plates with one <b>ring</b> <b>support.</b> The buckling factors for simply supported circular plates approach those for clamped circular plates when one of the <b>ring</b> <b>supports</b> is located sufficiently close to the edge. The tabulated buckling results should be valuable to designers for some industrial applications. Moreover, accurate and simple buckling formulas are presented for plates without any internal <b>ring</b> <b>support...</b>|$|R

50|$|The three {{rotor blades}} were {{mounted on a}} ring {{assembly}} supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At {{the end of each}} was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre <b>support</b> <b>ring</b> and along the rotors to the jets.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of circular plates with an internal elastic <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> and elastically restrained edge against translation. The classical plate theory is used to derive the governing differential equation for circular plate with internal elastic <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> and flexible edge support system. This work presents the existence of buckling mode switching with respect to the radius of internal elastic <b>ring</b> <b>support.</b> The buckling mode may not be axisymmetric as previously assumed. The plate may buckle in an axisymmetric mode in general, but when the radius of the <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> becomes small, the plate may buckle in an asymmetric mode. The cross-over <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> radius varies from 0. 1255 to 0. 09371 times the plate radius, depending on the translational stiffness of the elastic restraint at the edges and elastic restraint of the <b>ring</b> <b>support.</b> The optimum radius of the internal elastic <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> is also determined. Extensive data is tabulated so that pertinent conclusions can be arrived at on the influence of translational restraints, Poisson’s ratio, and other boundary conditions on the buckling of uniform isotropic circular plates. The numerical results obtained are in good agreement with the previously published data...|$|R
