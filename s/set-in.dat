We consider these sets as analogues (in a certain sense) of convex sets, and we use the so-called min-type functions as analogues of linear functions. We show that many results on best approximation by convex and reverse convex sets and corresponding separation theory (but not all of them) have analogues in the case under consideration.

40|$|We {{establish}} a close parallel between classicalization of gravitons and derivatively-coupled Nambu-Goldstone-type scalars. We show, that black hole formation in high energy scattering process represents classicalization with the classicalization radius given by Schwarzschild radius of {{center of mass}} energy, and with the precursor of black hole entropy being given by number of soft quanta composing this classical configuration. Such an entropy-equivalent is defined for scalar classicalons also and is responsible for exponential suppression of their decay into small number of final particles. This parallel works in both ways. For optimists {{that are willing to}} hypothesize that gravity may indeed selfunitarize at high energies via black hole formation, it illustrates that the Goldstones may not be much different in this respect, and they classicalize essentially by similar dynamics as gravitons. In the other direction, it may serve as an useful de-mystifier of via-blackhole- unitarization process and of the role of entropy in it, as it illustrates, that much more prosaic scalar theories essentially do the same. Finally, it illustrates that in both cases classicalization is the defining property for unitarization, and that it <b>sets-in</b> before one can talk about accompanying properties, such as entropy and thermality of static classicalons (black holes). These properties are by-products of classicalization, and their equivalents can be defined for non-gravitational cases of classicalization...|$|R
40|$|The {{elasticity}} of substitution between capital and labor (σ) is a second-order parameter {{of the production}} function but has a first-order effect on economic growth. Although {{the importance of this}} elasticity has long been recognized in several branches of economics, it has received too little attention in the growth literature. Grandville (1989) showed theoretically that at any stages of an economyâs development, the growth rate of income per capita is increasing with σ. The higher is σ, the greater the similarity between capital and labor in the production function, and thus diminishing returns <b>sets-in</b> very slowly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that tests the Grandville hypothesis at the cross-country level. We estimate σ for 90 countries from direct estimation of the normalized CES production function and then include these estimators as an explanatory variable in cross-country growth regression. We investigate the sign and significance of the coefficient of σ conditioning on country characteristics, initial conditions, institutions and a set of policy variables. Since the unobservable σ is âgeneratedâ from the first-step estimation of the CES production function, in the second-step cross-country growth regression it is measured with sampling errors (Pagan, 1984; Murphy and Topel, 1985). After accounting for measurement errors and other sources of endogeneity, we find strong support for the de La Grandville hypothesis. We find that σ can explains about 30 % of the growth rate differential between East Asia and Sub-Sahara Africa. We check the robustness of our results by Leamerâs (1983) extreme value analysis, and the coefficient of σ remains positive and the t-statistics remain large for all combinations of the conditioning variables. ...|$|R

Popular opinion holds that longer scale length contributes to greater amplitude. Reports of playing feel are greatly complicated by the many factors involved in this perception. String gauge and design, neck construction and relief, guitar setup, playing style and other factors contribute to the subjective impression of playability or feel.Necks are described as bolt-on, <b>set-in,</b> or neck-through, depending on how they attach to the body. <b>Set-in</b> necks are glued to {{the body in the}} factory. They are said to have a warmer tone and greater sustain. This is the traditional type of joint. Leo Fender pioneered bolt-on necks on electric guitars to facilitate easy adjustment and replacement. Neck-through instruments extend the neck the length of the instrument, so that it forms the center of the body, and are known for long sustain and for being particularly sturdy. While a <b>set-in</b> neck can be carefully unglued by a skilled luthier, and a bolt-on neck can simply be unscrewed, a neck-through design is difficult or even impossible to repair, depending on the damage. Historically, the bolt-on style has been more popular for ease of installation and adjustment. Since bolt-on necks can be easily removed, there is an after-market in replacement bolt-on necks from companies such as Warmoth and Mighty Mite. Some instruments—notably most Gibson models—continue to use <b>set-in</b> glued necks. Neck-through bodies are somewhat more common in bass guitars.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor (σ) has long been recognized in several branches of economics, it has received too little attention in the growth literature. This paper aims to partly rectify this omission by exploring the growth potentials with σ as a yardstick and studying how different values of σ impact upon the balanced growth paths in theoretical model. When σ is high, the incremental capital is easily substituted for labor, resulting in a nearly equiproportionate increase in both factors. Under constant returns to scale, diminishing returns <b>sets-in</b> very slowly, and the marginal and average products of capital can remain sufficiently large so that output can grow indefinitely. The theoretical model is built upon the work of de La Grandville and Solow (2004) who show that perpetual growth is possible in the Solow (1956) model even without technological progress, if value of σ exceeds a critical value that is greater than unity (cH σ). I extend the model to show that output level, capital stock and consumption follow perpetual decline if σ is less than another critical value (cL σ) that lies between zero and unity. The critical values depend on saving, population growth and depreciation rates, and the initial share of capital in total output; hence each country has at most one critical value. I show that the above results also carry into in a model of endogenous saving, and analytically prove that the balanced growth path exists only if σ lies between two critical values- cL σ and cH σ. I calibrate the critical value of σ from the data for each country. These values are then compared to σË âs estimated from country time series data. A number of countries, mainly from Africa, have Ë cL σ σ). ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to build an}} aggregative, structural, macroeconometric model for India. Investment and output in the model are disaggregated into four sectors, viz., (a) agriculture including forestry & fishing, (b) manufacturing, (c) infrastructure, which includes power, transport, communication and construction and (d) services sector, covering all other activities. The model emphasizes the interrelationships between internal and external balances and also the relation between money, output, prices and balance of payments. A unique feature of the model is that it incorporates the savings-investment identity. The model also tries to link economic growth with poverty reduction. Annual time series data for the period 1978 - 79 to 2002 - 03 are used for this purpose. Three-stage least squares method is used to estimate the model. The model is validated for its in-sample forecasting ability. A few counter factual policy simulations relating to public investment in infrastructure are undertaken to illustrate {{the usefulness of the}} model for analyzing the policy options in a simultaneous equations framework. A preliminary trend analysis has shown slowing down of the economy during ` 90 s and thereafter. There are also significant structural shifts in production from agriculture to infrastructure and services in the Indian economy. The estimated model indicated significant crowding-in effect between private and public sector investment in all the sectors. Counter factual policy simulations of sustained increase in public sector investment in infrastructure, financed through borrowing from commercial banks, shows substantial increase in private investment and thereby output in this sector. Further, due to increase in absorption, real output in the manufacturing and services sectors also seem to increase, which <b>sets-in</b> motion all other macro economic changes. Due to rise in sectoral (and aggregate) output, price level and money supply seem to decline in the short-run. Due to sustained nature of the policy change, the impacts get strengthened over time and benefit the economy. A 10 sustained increase in public sector investment in infrastructure, which is less than 0. 4 of GDP, can accelerate the macro economic growth by nearly 2. 5 without causing any inflation. Further, this increase in income will lead to nearly 1 reduction in poverty in India. This re-assures the potential for achieving the much debated 10 aggregate real GDP growth in the Indian economy. ...|$|R
