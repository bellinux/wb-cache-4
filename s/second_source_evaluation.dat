40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, to select between a sole and a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism for a non-commodity component. In a sole sourcing mechanism, the buyer commits to source from the current supplier. In a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier in the future. For a buyer that sources complex non-commodity inputs, this decision has {{to take into consideration}} supplier capacity investment, uncertain demand, supplier learning, and information asymmetry on the supply cost. Considering these factors, we compare sole and <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanisms, and identify when a mechanism is preferred over the other. We find that (1) both a high and low capacity cost may benefit <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> (under the condition that the entrant’s cost is relatively low), (2) <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is favored more when the buyer faces a higher level or more uncertainty of the future demand, and (3) <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may result in over investment of the initial capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} research was to analyze the Technical Data Package as a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> methodology to create production competition. Two <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> models and two major weapon system programs were presented for this analysis. Issues analyzed include technology transfer, Technical Data Package validation, technical data rights, initial investment costs, and maintenance considerations. As a result of this analysis it is concluded that there is no significant guidance for the application of the Technical Data Package <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> methodology, there are circumstances that are particularly inappropriate for the use of this methodology, and that the two programs that used this methodology appeared to have met their acquisition goals. This study recommends that one <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> model be employed under actual program conditions and that the program manager perform a comprehensive data package validation prior to using this <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> methodology.

40|$|Evaluating {{sources on}} the Internet has been {{identified}} by researchers and education policymakers as a crucial, but particularly challenging, competency for today’s 21 st century learners (National Governor’s Association, 2010; Wiley, Goldman, Graesser, Sanchez, Ash, & Hemmerich, 2009). The Internet context has been implicated in making <b>source</b> <b>evaluation</b> particularly difficult for students, as source information presented on a search results page often looks uniform (Gerjets, Kammerer, & Werner, 2011), and certain source markers, such as publisher and author, may be obscured in favor of relevancy indicators, such as key words (Goldman, 2011). Further, any website {{can be made to}} look professional and reliable with great ease, obfuscating the difference between reliable and unreliable sources (Alexander & Tate, 1999). Given the volume of information available on the Internet and the open nature of the online publishing culture, <b>source</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{has been found to be}} an essential skill for today’s students (Brand-Gruwel & Stadtler, 2011). Thus, in this confounding and confusing digital landscape, it becomes vital to understand how students evaluate sources, and to understand how <b>source</b> <b>evaluations</b> differ across the different types of sources that students may frequently encounter...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate the Thompson- Rubenstein Leader/Follower <b>Second</b> <b>Sourcing</b> (t-R L/F) Model. The Model is applied to four acquisitions managed by the Joint Cruise Missile Project Office (JCMPO). The study reviews current DOD <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> acquisition policy and directives, and discusses alternate <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> techniques with emphasis on the Leader/Follower technique. The results of this research indicate that the T-R L/F Model does not adequately address: (1) the competitive nature of the Aerospace Industry, (2) the timing of the <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> planning in relation to the Major Weapon System Acquisition Process, (3) the acquisition of technical data rights, and (4) L/F implementation variables. The researcher proposes an alternate Model based on the experiences of the JCMPO acquisitions. This Model will, most likely, be more valuable to a Program Manager dealing with the Aerospace Industry since it is based on aerospace acquisitions. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (the buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, in selecting between sole- and second-sourcing strategies for a noncommodity component. In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer {{to take advantage of}} alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer {{is referred to as the}} option value of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The overall benefit of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high (under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity. sourcing, auction, supplier relationship, supply chain management...|$|R
