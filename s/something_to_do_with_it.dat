Ruaidhri, ri Alban, a suis occisus est, that is, that Findláech was killed by his own people. No {{reason for this is}} given, but the logical thing is to conclude that his successor, his nephew Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti, had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Indeed, the Annals of Tigernach tell us that the sons of Máel Brigte were responsible; the only sons we know of are Máel Coluim and Gille Coemgáin, both of whom evidently benefited from the killing, as both succeeded to the throne.|$|E

500|$|In {{his year}} of success, Wallace became {{involved}} in a rivalry between the East and West Coast hip hop scenes with Shakur, now his former friend. In an interview with Vibe in April 1995, while serving time in Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur accused Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, Sean Combs, and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery that resulted in him being shot five times and losing thousands {{of dollars worth of}} jewelry on the night of November 30, 1994. Though Wallace and his entourage were in the same Manhattan-based recording studio {{at the time of the}} shooting, they denied the accusation. Wallace said: [...] "It just happened to be a coincidence that he [...] was in the studio. He just, he couldn't really say who really had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> at the time. So he just kinda' leaned the blame on me." [...] In 2012, a man named Dexter Isaac, serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was orchestrated by James Rosemond aka Jimmy Henchman.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the match, many people in Belgrade speculated that the order of the USSR players seemed as if it were {{arranged}} so that they would play against opponents with whom they had a history of beating. For instance, ex-world champion Mikhail Botvinnik was below Efim Geller and Mark Taimanov. [...] The lineup matched Taimanov against Wolfgang Uhlmann, whom [...] he [...] "used to beat as he liked" [...] and Botvinnik against Milan Matulović, who admitted to having a [...] "Botvinnik complex", not playing well against him. [...] People also questioned Paul Keres being on board 10, and wondered if his opponent being Borislav Ivkov had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> [...] These suspicions were printed in Belgrade newspapers and the Russians replied with their reason for their team's selection: [...] Current World Champion Boris Spassky must be first and his predecessor Tigran Petrosian must be second. [...] Next comes Viktor Korchnoi, who played in the candidate's final match. [...] Next came four players (Lev Polugaevsky, Geller, Vasily Smyslov, and Taimanov) who earned the right to play in the next Interzonal because of their place in the USSR Championship. [...] The last three places were given to players of special merit - Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, and Keres. [...] The first reserve was Leonid Stein, who placed sixth in the USSR Championship, just behind those going to the Interzonal. The second reserve was David Bronstein, who once played in a world championship match [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the Letran Knights now {{coached by}} Eddie Reyes {{went back to}} the {{championship}} to face the defending champions San Sebastian Stags. The Knights had a good mix of veterans and rookies led by Dong Libed, Tano Salazar, Justino Pinat, Art Ayson, Jing Ruiz and Robert [...] "Lakay" [...] Ruiz to name a few. San Sebastian had Paul Alvarez, Eugene Quilban, Chris Bade, Melchor Teves and their coach is Francis Rodriguez. The championship was decided on a best-of-3 series and after both teams split the first two games, Game 3 will prove to be a cardiac game as Dong Libed scored the game winning shot as time expires to give the Knights their 4th championship of the decade and breaking the hearts of the defending champs. One highlight of the 1987 season was the awarding of the MVP trophy. The award was given to Alvin Patrimonio of Mapua but many NCAA fans including the Letran faithfuls felt Patrimonio didn't deserve it as they felt Dong Libed was the more deserving as he not only played his best season but he was the force behind Letran's rise to the top. The fans also that time felt Nap Gutierrez (Mapua's team manager, future agent of Patrimonio and showbiz agent as well) had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> A rematch was inevitable in 1987 the Knights relied on the lucky hands of Dong Libed as he scored another game winning fadeaway shot over two defenders to win their 5th championship of the decade. Art Ayson was named MVP.|$|E
2500|$|Lindisfarne {{was a very}} {{important}} centre of book production, along with Ripon and Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. The Lindisfarne Gospels might be the single most beautiful book produced in the Middle Ages, and the Echternach Gospels and (probably) the Book of Durrow are other products of Lindisfarne. A Latin gospel book, the Lindisfarne Gospels are richly illuminated and decorated in an Insular style that blends not only Irish and Western Mediterranean elements but, incorporates imagery from the Eastern Mediterranean, including Coptic Christianity as well. Produced in the north of England at the same time was the Codex Amiatinus, which has been called [...] "the finest book in the world." [...] It is certainly one of the largest, weighing 34 kilograms. It is a pandect, which was rare in the Middle Ages: all the books of the Bible in one volume. The Codex Amiatinus was produced at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in 692 under the direction of Abbot Ceolfrith. Bede probably had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The production of the Codex shows the riches of the north of England at this time. We have records of the monastery needing a new grant of land to raise two thousand more cattle to get the calf skins to make the vellum to make the manuscript. The Codex Amiatinus {{was meant to be a}} gift to the Pope, and Ceolfrith was taking it to Rome when he died on the way. The copy ended up in Florence, where it still is today – a ninth-century copy of this book is even today the personal Bible of the Pope.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
