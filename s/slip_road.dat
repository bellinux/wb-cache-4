5|$|Strensham {{services}} are located {{slightly to the}} north of M5 junction 8, the exit <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the southbound area merges into the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the M5 to junction 8, so traffic must negotiate junction 8 to rejoin the M5. Northbound the service area is about a mile north of the junction.|$|E
5|$|The canal is {{connected}} to the Manchester Ship Canal via a lock at Cornbrook; to the Rochdale Canal in Manchester; to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook, southeast of Runcorn; and to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh. It once connected with the River Mersey at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> to the Silver Jubilee Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The suburb's {{main road}} is South Road, which at its eastern (Glen) end winds around the flanks of hills before joining with Princes Street and Dunedin's central {{business}} district. A <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> connects South Road with State Highway 1 {{at the foot}} of these hills, just above Carisbrook.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project has brought fresh {{knowledge of the}} efficiency and traffic quality of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> at multilevel junctions. The results were obtained from observations of the traffic flow at <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to urban expressways (Class B). Various types were studied: single-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane and three-lane main roads (type E 1 /E 2) and two-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane main roads (type E 4 /E 5). Speeds were always restricted to 80 km/h or 100 km/h at the measuring points observed.

50|$|No {{traffic lights}} (except {{occasionally}} on <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> {{before reaching the}} main carriageway).|$|R
50|$|At the {{northern}} end, had the road {{been built in}} full, the entry and exit ramps {{to and from the}} elevated roundabout with the Westway would have been <b>slip</b> <b>roads.</b> The main route would have continued north beneath the roundabout into North Kensington and on to the junction with the North Cross Route at Harlesden. The alignment of the <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> leaves a wide space between for the unbuilt carriageway. On {{the north side of the}} roundabout, two short stubs indicate the starting point of the <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> that would have been provided for traffic joining or leaving {{the northern}} section of the WCR.|$|R
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound <b>slip</b> <b>road,</b> at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E
5|$|The depot {{stored and}} {{dispatched}} every item that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines. The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|The road {{continues}} north, still paralleling the Nine Mile Creek, {{into the}} town of Camillus. In Bennetts Corners, NY174 intersects with Forward Road (unsigned NY931F), a connector road to NY321, then changes direction to head northeast. The road passes by Nose Hill before entering the village of Camillus. In the village center, NY174 makes a sharp turn to the west onto West Genesee Street, where it {{comes to an end}} just west of the village line at a junction with NY5 (where its freeway begins) that includes a jughandle, a <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> onto the freeway. NY174 is located along a geological feature known as a mapped sedimentary bedrock unit, known as the Marcellus Formation. The formation is named for an outcrop found near the town of Marcellus, New York, during a geological survey in 1839.|$|E
40|$|The Purpose of this Bachelor thesis was to {{find out}} the traffic {{accidents}} occurrence on the road R 10. This road was renamed as Highway D 10 since the 1 st January 2016. Highway R 10 begins in Prague and its finish is in Turnov. I focused the traffic accidents, which are related to <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits in year 2013. For the research I used the geographic information system ArcGIS, where I exactly drew the accidents on the highway. Information about the accidents I received from the sources from Police of the Czech Republic. I selected only the accidents, which are related to the highway´s <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits. Based on the analyses I found out, how the length of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exists is to the number of the traffic accidents in these highway sections. Discovered facts could be helpful for projecting of the new <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits or for adjustments of the existing sections as well...|$|R
5000|$|Sometime in the 1998, Ayer Rajah Expressway {{was further}} {{expended}} into Tuas. The extension followed the alignment of Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. The road was widen, all roundabouts were replaced with flyovers and interchanges and <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> were built along {{some parts of}} the expressway to serve the existing establishments along the <b>road.</b> Eventually the <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> took on the name [...] "Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim".|$|R

25|$|The {{northbound}} entry <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> at Lancaster (junction 34) {{was unusually}} short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune {{at this point}} and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b> This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design. The construction of the Heysham to M6 Link Road (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning slip roads with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the semicircular access road to the {{southbound}} carriageway are still visible at Draffan Road, with the Blackwood <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> now used as an access road to new housing.|$|E
25|$|Hoffman Drive is {{a remnant}} of the wide Hoffman Boulevard. Hoffman Boulevard was {{straightened}} and renamed Queens Boulevard, but a short <b>slip</b> <b>road,</b> Hoffman Drive, leads from 57th Avenue to Woodhaven Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|Between Thursley and Milford in Surrey, cycle {{crossings}} of the <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> exist for cyclists travelling along the cycle lanes.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of the elevated roundabout junction with the West Cross Route was built with the capability to be extended once the planned northern continuation of the West Cross Route was constructed to Harlesden. Two stubs on the roundabout's north side were built for the connection of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and the alignment of the <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> between the West Cross Route and the roundabout avoided the planned line {{of the road to}} the north.|$|R
25|$|The {{section of}} the M4 in South Wales has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and {{built-up}} areas, {{so there are some}} unusual junction layouts. Junction 27 (High Cross) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> onto the motorway. Junctions 30–31 (East Cardiff) were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges at the time of construction. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct Junction 31 (A469 road). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at Junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 work {{started on}} J9, {{upgrading}} the southbound exit <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> to three lanes, and similar widening on the connecting A34 and A41 junctions. This {{was the first}} part of the work at this busy junction. If there is funding, a second part will begin, upgrading the northbound entrance and the A41 southbound entrance.|$|E
25|$|Anti-clockwise {{direction}} from the M25, the main carriageway continues directly on to the M26 at junction 5. To remain on the M25, traffic must turn on to the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> which connects to the M25 spur coming north from Sevenoaks, which is multiplexed with the A21. The awkwardness of junction 5 {{is a result of}} the history of the two motorways' planning and construction.|$|E
5000|$|Blue cat's {{eyes are}} used almost {{exclusively}} for emergency vehicle lay-bys and <b>slip</b> <b>roads,</b> {{such as the}} roadside ramps police cars use on Motorways to monitor traffic.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} calls {{to close the}} <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> at Junction 40 and 41 (at Port Talbot) to improve traffic flow. The {{motorway}} has only two lanes on this stretch and is a major traffic congestion blackspot. Junctions 40 and 41 (at Port Talbot) have very short <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> which have not been modernised. A small-scale trial of closing the westbound on-slip of Junction 41 between 7am and 9am and from 4pm to 6pm on weekdays started on 4August 2014 but following heavy criticism from local businesses and residents, was stopped on 29 May 2015.|$|R
50|$|Junction 0 (and 8 of the M5) was {{originally}} a free-flowing trumpet-style junction, then {{converted to a}} roundabout with M5 flyover when the M5 was widened in the 1990s. Junction 1, where the M50 meets the A38, is a partial cloverleaf. Junction 2 has full <b>slips</b> <b>roads</b> from the deceleration lane into the <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> save the kinked eastbound exit to local roads. Junction 3 consists of dual-carriageway-style 90° exits due to cost, low traffic volume and the style of road; however {{this has been the}} scene of various accidents.|$|R
25|$|When the M74 {{was to be}} {{extended}} south of Draffan in the 1980s, it was renumbered, in 1984 {{in preparation for the}} opening of the southern extension, north-to-south. The Raith or Raith remained as J5, while Maryville became J4, allowing for later extension Northwards, towards Glasgow. The original junction 1 at Draffan was closed, with the first new junction 9 (Blackwood) replacing it, using the southbound carriageway of the old A74 as a <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> {{exiting the}} A3 {{leading to the}} Royal Surrey County Hospital and the Surrey Research Park {{regularly}} creates congestion on the main A3 during peak times, when the traffic queue reaches onto the main carriageway. In May 2011, {{it was announced that}} this is to be resolved with new improvements to the traffic system directly adjacent to the A3, with work funded jointly by the University of Surrey and Surrey County Council.|$|E
25|$|Between 2006 and 2007 {{junction}} 10 near Ashford was remodelled {{to increase}} capacity when the bridges across the motorway were modified to provide three lanes of traffic at the roundabout, and local approach roads were widened, with new traffic lights to control traffic flows at the junction between the A292 Hythe Road and the London-bound M20 entry <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b> A new footbridge was also constructed across the motorway. The cost was £4.9 million.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, the {{government}} announced plans for a £45m flyover link directly {{to and from the}} A1 and M1 eastbound. Construction was initially estimated to take place between 2010 and 2015. As of June 2016, the scheme has no projected completion ydate. In 2011 {{the government}} announced plans for two service areas in each direction between junction 3 and junction 6 near Ballyskeagh. These service stations are the first motorway service stations in Northern Ireland. They include petrol stations and restaurant facilities. Construction on the westbound service area began in November 2013 and was opened on 10 March 2016. Work on the eastbound service area began in April 2016 and was opened on 2 February 2017. The government also have plans to add west facing <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> at junction 3. Junction 3 opened in 1988 with only east facing <b>slip</b> <b>roads.</b> Construction on the west facing <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> is subject to future budget settlements.|$|R
50|$|There are {{no traffic}} {{lights on the}} expressways. Traffic {{interchange}} with other roads is entirely via <b>slip</b> <b>roads,</b> maximising vehicular flow and land space usage. There are some stack interchanges.|$|R
50|$|At Switch Island, the {{junction}} {{has been built}} to allow {{an extension of the}} M57 and the end of M58 has provision for <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to the extension to be constructed.|$|R
25|$|The {{motorway}} {{joins the}} M42 in both directions, with northbound traffic taking the left lane to exit eastbound, eventually forming the outer lanes of the M42 via a tight-bending two lane connecting road, {{and the right}} lanes being taken eastbound. Similarly, southbound, eastbound traffic from the M42 splits off from the outer two lanes, whereas westbound traffic of the M42 has a single lane, widening to a two lane <b>slip</b> <b>road,</b> which merges with the middle lane and forms the outer lane of the southbound M40.|$|E
25|$|Where the new A21 begins, {{and also}} where the A224 joins from the north, {{the road is}} called the Sevenoaks Road; at Knockholt (Hewitts Roundabout), the road enters Kent near its {{junction}} with a spur from the M25 motorway. The A21 actually multiplexes with the M25 and descends the North Downs Scarp here. The M25 then has to use a <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> in the left lane and the A21 takes priority although is still technically a motorway until the junction with the A25 to Sevenoaks and the M26. The oddness of Junction 5 {{is due to the}} M26 once being part of the M25.|$|E
25|$|The {{ring road}} plan {{also called for}} a {{motorway}} out from {{the centre of the}} city to the north-west (as the ring road plan would have involved four motorways running off of the central ring - a northeast one, which is the M8 from Glasgow city centre to Edinburgh; a southwest one, which is the M8 from Glasgow city centre to Greenock; a southeast one, the projected M74 extension; and a northwest one, which would have left the Inner Ring Road at Woodside (<b>slip</b> <b>road</b> stubs are visible) and followed the path of the Forth & Clyde Canal up through the Maryhill area of Glasgow to Milngavie and beyond).|$|E
