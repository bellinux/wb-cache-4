25|$|Pakistan {{and their}} {{supporters}} were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions to ask of themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes {{was by no means}} the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E

It {{was based on}} three shells collected by Sir Joseph Banks, supposedly on Pulau Panaitan. The only Amphidromus found there, Amphidromus banksi Butot, is quite different and the actual locahty of aureus is still unknown. The shells have a wide, white zone below the suture as in the Amphidromus atricallosus complex and the lower parts of the whorls are yellow, with or without narrow, wavy, reddish-brown flammulations. The original specimens in the Natural History Museum {{appear to be a}} form of Amphidromus perversus, but the locality remains a mystery. Note: Martyn's work was invalidated by action of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, varietal names are not accorded legal status and the use of aureus is as a convenient term of reference.|$|E

500|$|Terminator 2 made {{extensive}} use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to vivify the main two Terminators. The use of such technology was the most ambitious since the 1982 and 1984 science fiction films Tron and The Last Starfighter respectively, and would be integral to the critical success of the film. CGI was required particularly for the T-1000, a [...] "mimetic poly-alloy" [...] (liquid metal) structure, since the shapeshifting character can transform into almost anything it touches. Most of the key Terminator effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for computer graphics and Stan Winston for practical effects. Creation of the visual effects cost $5 million and took 35 people, including animators, computer scientists, technicians and artists, ten months to produce, {{for a total of}} 25 man-years. Despite the large amount of time spent, the CGI sequences only total five minutes of running time. Enlisted to produce articulated puppets and prosthetic effects was Stan Winston's studio, who was also responsible for the metal skeleton effects of the T-800. ILM's Visual Effects Supervisor, Dennis Muren, [...] remarked, [...] "We <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> lost the spirit of amazement when we see ... coming up." [...] Such was the role and creation of CGI that the visual-effects team was awarded the 1992 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.|$|E

2500|$|After Bender's {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt at}} godhood, he encounters a god-like entity in space.

Bender eventually theorizes that the entity may have, in fact, been {{the remains of a}} satellite that collided with God, to which the entity replies [...] "Probable". The conversation between them touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation, in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need [...] "to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class". By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him.

2500|$|One {{must first}} learn to know himself before knowing {{anything}} else (γνῶθι σεαυτόν). Not until {{a man has}} inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of that irksome, sinister traveling companion — that irony of life, which manifests itself {{in the sphere of}} knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates) just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, [...] "After all, things cannot be otherwise," [...] only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation's power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As {{in the case of a}} man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito.) Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here.|$|E
