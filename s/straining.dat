Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{tied for}} the league lead in {{complete}} games each year from 1956 to 1958, and was again selected for the All-Star team each year from 1957 to 1959 and again in 1961, although he only appeared in the 1957 game in which he retired his first five batters before allowing three runs. On June 11, 1959 he pitched his fourth and final one-hitter, a 3–1 victory at Washington in which he allowed only a third-inning double by Ron Samford, who scored after three two-out walks, the last to Harmon Killebrew; the White Sox won on a two-run double {{in the ninth inning}} by Jim Landis off Senators starter Camilo Pascual. Pierce had the longest outing of his career on August 6 in a road game against the Orioles, pitching 16 innings in a contest that ended in a 1–1 tie after 18 frames; it proved to be the last time in his career that he pitched into extra innings. After losing his next two starts, pulling a back muscle and <b>straining</b> the ligaments in his right hip against the Kansas City Athletics in the third inning on August 15, he was out of action until a 2–1 win over Kansas City on September 7.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe jerky flow of Al-Mg alloys is {{investigated}} during tensile {{tests at}} imposed <b>strain</b> rate and room temperature. The <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate dependences {{of the magnitude}} of the stress drops, the range of plastic instability and the critical <b>strain</b> for the onset of serrations are studied in connection with the Mg content. In the low <b>strain</b> rate part of the <b>strain</b> rate range of instability, the critical <b>strain</b> decreases with the Mg content. The critical <b>strain</b> rate corresponding to the minimum of the critical <b>strain</b> vs. applied <b>strain</b> rate curve shifts to larger values when the Mg content increases. This behavior leads to an enlargement of the <b>strain</b> rate domain of inverse behavior of the critical <b>strain,</b> {{at the expense of the}} domain of normal behavior. In the high <b>strain</b> rate part of the range of instability, the critical <b>strain</b> does not depend on the Mg content. These results are discussed in accordance with dynamic <b>strain</b> aging mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{attempted}} to treat and utilize cane molasses distillery wastes microbiologically by using yeast. In this report, {{two hundred and}} thirteen <b>strains</b> of yeast stocked in our laboratory were employed. These <b>strains</b> included a hundred and sixteen <b>strains</b> of identified yeast,i. e., thirty-four <b>strains</b> of Pichia, forty-two <b>strains</b> of Hansenula, three <b>strains</b> of Mycotorula, seven <b>strains</b> of Candida, ten <b>strains</b> of Saccharomyces, six <b>strains</b> of Debaryomyces and four <b>strains</b> of Rhodotorula, and eighty-seven <b>strains</b> of unidentified yeast isolated in our laboratory. The results obtained were as follows: 1) Cane molasses distillery wastes were assimilated {{by most of the}} yeast <b>strains</b> tested. 2) The yeast <b>strains</b> which grew especially well on the wastes, belonged to Hansenula, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, and unidentified yeast <b>strains.</b> 3) The dry weight of these grown yeast cells reached 0. 9 g or more per 100 ml of the wastes. 4) These yeast <b>strains</b> which grew well on the wastes medium could remove 30 % or more of the COD in the wastes...|$|R
