5000|$|Some car washes {{have their}} {{customers}} pay through a computerized POS, or point of <b>sale</b> <b>unit,</b> {{also known as}} an [...] "automatic cashier", which may {{take the place of}} a human cashier. The mechanism inputs the wash PLU into a master computer or a tunnel controller automatically. When the sale is automated, after paying the car is put into a line-up called the stack or queue. The stack moves sequentially, so the wash knows what each car purchased. After pulling up to the tunnel entrance, an attendant usually guides the customer onto the conveyor. At some washes, the system will send the correct number of rollers automatically, based on tire sensors. The tire sensor lets the wash know where the wheels are and how far apart they are. On other systems the employee may guide the customer on and press a 'Send Car' button on the tunnel controller, to manually send the rollers which push the car through.|$|E

However, knowledge regarding the organizational factors that can induce salespeople to engage in those behaviors is strikingly limited. Against this background, we develop a comprehensive model that delineates the influences of formal and informal sales controls on AS and COS and, through them, on <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness. Based on a sample of sales managers in a major European Union country, we present new evidence that (a) formal and informal sales controls exert differential impact on salespeople's AS and COS behaviors; (b) AS directly and positively influences <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness; (c) COS affects <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness only indirectly, i. e. by fostering AS; and (d) outcome and cultural controls directly improve <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{focuses on}} corporate entrepreneurship within the <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> of a multinational corporation. The multinational corporation sets the frame for the research where the realization of CE as a management concept is analyzed in the <b>sales</b> <b>unit.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to gain an in depth understanding of entrepreneurship, and corporate entrepreneurship as a management concept. Additionally {{it is supposed to}} increase the literature on the topic of corporate entrepreneurship within a <b>sales</b> <b>unit.</b> It aims to bring the research areas of selling and sales behavior as well as corporate entrepreneurship closer together. In order to gain the in depth knowledge required for this thesis an extensive literature review on the topic of entrepreneurship has been conducted. Corporate entrepreneurship builds on the research of entrepreneurship and is referred to as a management concept. The management concept of change management is introduced and its’ link to corporate entrepreneurship is established. The literature review also covers general research on the multinational corporation as well as the <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> and the entrepreneurial actions already existing in the <b>sales</b> <b>unit.</b> Furthermore a case study approach has been realized to increase the understanding of corporate entrepreneurship in real life. Therefore eight employees of a multinational corporation, who work in the <b>sales</b> <b>unit,</b> have been interviewed with semi structured interviews. The semi structured interviews were approximately one hour long, resulting in taped material of 9 hours. This material has been transcribed {{and with the help of}} the analyzing software NVivo clustered. The clusters of NVivo formed the base to answer the research questions. Elements such as sales innovativeness and creative selling, knowledge sharing, an entrepreneurial mission statement, an employee suggestion scheme, freedom resulting in innovation and an active change management are elements realizing corporate entrepreneurship within the <b>sales</b> <b>unit.</b> <b>Sales</b> innovativeness and creative selling is realized in the <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> through new selling approaches such as cross selling and value based selling. Knowledge sharing holds a great advantage for the employees where successful ideas and tactics for example form country regions are applied to other regions or even the headquarter. Knowledge share also sparks innovation. The entrepreneurial mission statement is necessary to provide guidelines and describe the desired behavior. The entrepreneurial orientation mission statement refers to the overall entrepreneurial orientation of the company. Freedom according to the data of the case study results in innovation and motivation. Therefore general freedom in the work routine characterizes corporate entrepreneurship in the <b>sales</b> <b>unit.</b> Furthermore an active change management which is also present in the <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> of the case company supports the process of including corporate entrepreneurship as an overall management concept. These results lead to the conclusion that corporate entrepreneurship is realized to a certain degree within the <b>sales</b> <b>unit,</b> but still holds room for improvement. In the end the generalizability of the thesis as well as advices for future research are given...|$|R

Our results show that the greater the <b>Sales</b> <b>unit</b> power, the greater the conflict between these managers, and the lower the relationship effectiveness. In addition, where a Sales Manager has high influence, this is associated with greater effectiveness in Marketing/Sales relationships, but not with lower conflict.

40|$|There are two {{perspectives}} on controlling {{the performance of}} salespeople - an outcome based perspective and behavior based perspective. The former process focuses on the objective measures of results while the latter perspective on performance control of salespeople incorporates complex and often subjective assessments of the attributes of sales people.

40|$|Large scale {{companies}} have massive information flows in their administrative departments. This often creates problems {{when there is}} a lack of communication both internally and with internal partners such as <b>sales</b> <b>units.</b> Sandvik SMT Market Service (SBMS) is no exception in this case. They got big problems with their communication with the <b>sales</b> <b>units</b> especially when it concerns the mail traffic and routing of information. Today SBMS have three regional mailboxes where the SU’s (<b>Sales</b> <b>Unit)</b> send their mails depending on which region they belong to. This structure does not function as intended and creates an overload which leads to long response times. Therefore the market service manager Jonas Hofvenstam wanted us to investigate this problem area with the possibility of segmenting the mailboxes including a tagging system and to perform a review of the sales tools portal in order to shorten the response times and decrease the mail traffic. The outcome of this paper was suggestions/proposals regarding how to structure the common mailboxes, illustration of a tagging system for the mails and suggestions of how to improve the sales tools portal. We also made recommendations on how to take these suggestions into action including step by step instructions to make it easier when performing an implementation...|$|R

The factors affecting performance of sales force through balanced supervisory control, cognitive measures and coordination pattern of task performance in the team have been examined and managerial implications derived for optimising {{the performance of the}} sales force in this paper. The findings of the study show that the balance between the territory designing and incentive pays affect the overall performance of sales tasks performed by the field sales teams. Sales territory design also largely influences the level of performance both directly and indirectly through its relationship with the salespeople's behavioural performance. Discussions in this paper also argue that the behaviour control is a consistent predictor of the salespeople's performance and effectiveness of the <b>sales</b> <b>units.</b> This indicates the importance of proactive monitoring, directing and evaluating salespeople by the managers. compensation; organisational efficiency; outcome performance; sales force organisation; sales performance measurement; evaluation; <b>sales</b> territories; <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness; selling behaviour; task administration; territory management; administrative parameters; behavioural parameters; Mexico; supervisory control; cognitive measures; coordination; supervision; optimisation; incentives; pay; wages; salaries; sales territory design; performance levels; salespeople; behaviour control; proactive monitoring; managers; business research. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that as demand becomes {{irregular}} and complex (i. e., lumpy), a possible approach for managing such uncertainty is to collect information directly from customers. This implies that the <b>sales</b> <b>units</b> have to move closer to customers, analyse their likely requirements, and collect quantitative and structured data as well as qualitative and subjective insights. However, as integration with individual customers increases and data collection capabilities improve the organisational configuration of most companies becomes ever more complex and the aggregation of forecasts more difficult. This paper discusses two approaches to managing demand uncertainty in complex environments. In the first (termed decentralised order overplanning), <b>sales</b> <b>units</b> are responsible for forecasting the demand of each customer and defining requirements. In the second (termed centralised order overplanning), forecasts provided by <b>sales</b> <b>units</b> are aggregated and further elaborated by manufacturing to define item requirements. By means of an analytical model (which describes the forecasting and planning process as a Bayesian-Markovian process), we show that the centralised method out-performs the decentralised approach by virtue of the ability to exploit the additional information provided by commonalities between customers requests. However, this advantage has to be balanced against organisational costs. Since the centralised method splits responsibilities for forecasting and slack control between <b>sales</b> and manufacturing <b>units,</b> major conflicts are likely to arise, the focus and commitment on forecasting accuracy may be compromised, and information may be lost when individual forecasts are sent to the manufacturing unit...|$|R

40|$|Management control {{consists}} of managers' initiatives to direct and influence employees {{for the purpose}} of achieving an organization's objectives. Sales management control is identified as an important antecedent of several salesperson and organizational consequences in prior developed country studies. We examine the impact of management control in combination with incentive pay and territory design on salesperson performance and <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness for <b>sales</b> organizations in three developing countries (Greece, India, and Malaysia). The results point to territory design as a strong predictor of performance and effectiveness. Management control is also a relevant predictor of performance and effectiveness. Surprisingly, incentive pay has no effect on salesperson performance, although it has a positive impact on <b>sales</b> <b>unit</b> effectiveness in Greece and India. Several important managerial implications are highlighted by the study findings. ...|$|R
