25|$|That same {{afternoon}} many prelates {{and others}} from the French faction met at the Convent of the Carmelites, and discussed {{the question of how}} a new pope would be elected. Representatives of the University of Paris were eager that the entire Council should participate in the election, pointing out that many people were already saying that the College of Cardinals was full of Frenchmen, and that a French pope was sure to be elected; only if everyone participated could a convincing election be achieved. Others wanted to <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> decree issued by Simon de Cramand on 10 May, assigning the task to the cardinals, in accordance with Canon Law.

500|$|Midnight Madness is {{an annual}} event celebrating the {{upcoming}} college basketball season in which a team opens its first official practice to the public, often combining it with a pep rally and other fan friendly activities.

500|$|Before {{production}} began, however, Spielberg grew {{reluctant to}} continue with Jaws, in fear of becoming typecast as the [...] "truck and shark director". He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox's Lucky Lady instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg to <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project, saying that [...] "after , you {{can make all the}} films you want". The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5million and a shooting schedule of 55days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.|$|E

500|$|UT {{fans were}} unhappy with ABC's {{television}} {{coverage of the}} event.

ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A game through the final down and then ran threefull minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14–0. The ABC announcers started their coverage saying [...] "And now, we'll join the game you've been waiting for all week, which has pretty much already been decided." [...] ABC then broke away from their coverage at halftime to broadcast other events. This left thousands of UT fans who assembled to watch the game in Darrell K.

Leeds again found success in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup though, beating Sarpsborg FK (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), AC Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final against Juventus.

I spent a few days figuring out how to make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided to <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices.

A promotional poster for the event was released prior by TNA featuring Jeff Hardy. TNA created a section covering the event on their website.
