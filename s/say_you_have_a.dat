6000|$|The new cook's first {{compliment}} to Charlotte was, 'Upon my word, {{you are a}} genteel young woman, I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of sweethearts.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother {{will be able}} to help us by afternoon. He {{manages a}} canoe well, when himself; so go, Bourdon, while you can. I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mother at home; or a sister perhaps a wife--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me in, my friends," [...] he said, [...] "for the {{remembrance of}} your boys in Paris. There is no danger {{to you in}} doing so as, if the Germans come, you have only to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wounded officer. I can pay you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Him no pirate at all. You know dat bery well, massa captain. Dat English yacht; anyone see dat {{with half}} an eye. De gentleman there <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lady on board dat {{has been carried}} off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maladetta! You {{follow me}} {{speaking}} of the treasure. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> sworn my ruin. You were the last man who looked upon me before I went out with it. And Sidoni the engine-driver <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> evil eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bopp, what is it? Dick <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> trouble; tell me, {{and let us}} {{help you}} if we can. Are you ill, in want, or has any one wronged or injured you in any way? Oh, let me help you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] she said; [...] "everybody has business, and I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great deal. But Vauxe {{is exactly}} the place for persons who have business. You go up to town by an early train, and then you return exactly in time for dinner, and bring us all the news from the clubs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You had my wire? You've {{caught on}} here. People like your work immensely. I don't know why, but they do. They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fresh touch {{and a new}} way of drawing things. And, because they're chiefly home-bred English, they say you have insight. You're wanted by half a dozen papers; you're wanted to {{illustrate}} books.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Don't be crabbed, my boy,” {{said the}} other, {{who was very}} coolly fixing his flint. “They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hole in your left {{shoulder}} yourself, so I think Brom may give you a fire for half-price. It will take a keen one to hit that bird, I can tell you, my lad, even if I give you a chance, which is what I have no mind to do.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Trembling, {{and in a}} great flutter, Morgiana put on her bonnet and gloves, {{and went}} towards the door. [...] "It's a fine morning," [...] said Mr. Walker, looking out: [...] "a walk will do you good; and--Morgiana--didn't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> couple of guineas in your pocket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes: but {{he used to}} <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{real sense}} of beauty." [...] Old Jolyon thought: 'The devil he did!' but {{answered}} with a twinkle: [...] "Well, I have, or I shouldn't be sitting here with you." [...] She was fascinating when she smiled with her eyes, like that! ...|$|R
60|$|POTHINUS. I <b>have</b> to <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> traitress in your camp. Cleopatra.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only that I quite {{agree with}} you," [...] {{answered}} Fisher. [...] "I don't exactly <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to poach, but I never {{could see that}} it was as wrong as being a thief. It seems to me against the whole normal notion of property that a man should own something because it flies across his garden. He might as well own the wind, or think he could write his name on a morning cloud. Besides, if we want poor people to respect property we must give them some property to respect. You ought to have land of your own; and I'm going to give you some if I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean it must--it ought to. As I say, we've {{done our}} best to be generous; I defy any one to deny it. As it is, Mr. Wayne, I don't want {{to say a word}} that's uncivil. I hope it's not uncivil to say that you can be, and ought to be, in gaol. It is {{criminal}} to stop public works for a whim. A man might as well burn ten thousand onions in his front garden or bring up his children to run naked in the street, as do what you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to do. People have been compelled to sell before now. The King could compel you, and I hope he will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for you, Suzanne, you are pert and deceitful, for {{you have}} kept secret from me that which I {{had a right}} to learn; also you have too good an opinion of your own looks, which as I tell you now for the last time, are nothing {{compared}} to mine at your age, or even to those of my daughter Suzanne, your grandmother. But this I will <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good heart and some of the spirit of your forbears, therefore"--and she laid one of her heavy hands on the head of each of us--"I, old Suzanne Botmar, bless you both. You shall be married next week, and may you be happy in your marriage, and have children that would be a credit to me and your great-grandfather, could we have lived to see them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was a fool}} {{business}} pickin' her up in {{the first}} place, 'cause if you never'd done it, them lawyers couldn't <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> kid with <b>you.</b> That's the very best way they have to let folks know who you are. Anyhow, you've got to give her the dead shake now, {{if you want me to}} keep hold of this case." ...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} a complex would be as follows: if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> leg amputated {{when you were a}} child, this would {{influence}} your life in profound ways, even if you overcame the physical handicap. <b>You</b> may <b>have</b> many thoughts, emotions, memories, feelings of inferiority, triumphs, bitterness and determinations centering on that one aspect of your life. If these thoughts were troubling and pervasive, Jung might <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> complex about the leg.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{deep and}} sincere regard for Adriana," [...] said his sister. [...] "Why, what better basis for {{enduring}} happiness can there be? You {{are not a}} man to marry for romantic sentiment, and pass your life in writing sonnets to your wife till you find her charms and your inspiration alike exhausted; you are already wedded to the State, you have been nurtured in the thoughts of great affairs from your very childhood, {{and even in the}} darkest hour of our horrible adversity. You are a man born for power and high condition, whose name in time ought to rank with those of the great statesmen of the continent, the true lords of Europe. Power, and power alone, should be your absorbing object, and all the accidents and incidents of life should only be considered with reference to that main result." ...|$|E
60|$|My time in America {{is growing}} mighty short. Perhaps we can manage in this way: Imprimis, if the N. Y. Weekly {{people know that}} you are my brother, they will turn that fact into an advertisement--a thing of value to them, but not to you and me. This must be prevented. I will write them a note to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> friend near Keokuk, Charles S. Miller, who has a MS for sale which you think is a pretty clever travesty on Verne; and if they want it they might write to him in your care. Then if any {{correspondence}} ensues between you and them, let Mollie write for you and sign your name--your own hand writing representing Miller's. Keep yourself out of sight till you make a strike on your own merits {{there is no other way}} to get a fair verdict upon your merits.|$|E
6000|$|This day, and not before, {{the right}} honorable gentleman {{thinks that the}} general {{establishment}} of all claims is the surest way of laying open the fraud of some of them. In India this is a reach of deep policy. But what would be thought of this mode of acting on a demand upon the Treasury in England? Instead of all this cunning, is there not one plain way open,--that is, to put {{the burden of the}} proof on those who make the demand? Ought not ministry to have said to the creditors, [...] "The person who admits your debt stands excepted to as evidence; he stands charged as a collusive party, to hand over the public revenues to you for sinister purposes. You <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> demand of some millions on the Indian Treasury; prove that you have acted by lawful authority; prove, at least, that your money has been bonâ fide advanced; entitle yourself to my protection by the fairness and fulness of the communications you make"? Did an honest creditor ever refuse that reasonable and honest test? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, Lizzie,' said Anne, {{recovering}} her breath, 'I hope, as Helen <b>says,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pleasant evening; I {{hope you}} were very much edified.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo! Your {{language}} {{reminds me}} of the time when you were a barmaid. You don't mean to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fortune left you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, true," [...] he said, wincing a little. [...] "I did {{not come}} to reproach you for my deeds. I came Tess, to say that I don't like you to be working like this, and I have come on purpose for you. You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> husband who is not I. Well, perhaps you have; but I've never seen him, and you've not told me his name; and {{altogether}} he seems rather a mythological personage. However, even if you have one, I think I am nearer to you than he is. I, at any rate, try to help you out of trouble, but he does not, bless his invisible face! The words of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me. Don't you know them, Tess?--'And she shall follow after her lover, but she shall not overtake him; and she shall seek him, but shall not find him; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now!' ... Tess, my trap is waiting just under the hill, and--darling mine, not his!--you know the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is a sophistry I did {{not think}} you would be guilty of, Dorothy; though it had already {{occurred}} to me. At the time I made the promise I thought his request was not fair to you and was unwise, but the reason he gave was that, having failed here, he did not wish that another failure should be known; and, moreover, he {{did not wish to}} raise false hopes when in all probability nothing might come of it. I have been grievously tempted several times to break my promise; I know that Singleton, who also knew, has been on the edge of doing so more than once, especially that day the letter came saying that he was wounded. I will think it over, child. No, I don't see that any good can come of thinking about it. I feel that, as you <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to know, and as Ned Hampton says it is possible he will go back to India without returning to England, {{it will be a long}} time before he can reproach me with a breach of faith. There is the letter, child. You will find me in one of the greenhouses if you want me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no limit," [...] he said, [...] "to {{the arrogance}} of these knaves, and in truth it cannot be denied that they are masters here, and that even the duke cannot {{altogether}} withstand them; and you know, moreover, how essential is their goodwill to him. But even should he ever so obstinately refuse their demands they might well take their way without his leave. What can he, {{with a handful of}} knights and a few hundred armed men, do against the mob of Paris? I earnestly pray you, gentlemen, to treat the matter as serious. Warn your eight friends without delay; bid your retainers mount and ride to the gate. If it is open, all the better, it is but a party of pleasure bound for Sèvres, and if you learn to-morrow morning that all is quiet here you can return. If it seems better to you, and this may save you much argument, merely ask your friends to mount and ride with you to dine there; if any refuse, <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> motive that they will learn when they get there, and almost compel them to go with you. I pledge you my honour that you will have no reason to regret having taken my advice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Attribute Groups are {{explicitly}} defined collections of particular attributes. <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> entity [...] "customer" [...] that has 50 attributes [...] - [...] {{too much information}} for many of your users. Attribute groups enable the creation of custom sets of hand-picked attributes that are relevant for specific audiences. (e.g. [...] "customer - delivery details" [...] that would include just their name and last known delivery address). This {{is very similar to}} a database view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo!" [...] {{said that}} young man, {{lounging}} greyly into view, [...] "a bad penny, Miss M. I {{happened to be}} passing Buszard's just now, {{and there was the}} very thing! Miss Bowater <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sweet tooth, and they really are rather neat." [...] He had brought me the daintiest little box of French doll bonbons. I glared at it; I glared at him--hardly in the mood for any more of his little jokes--not even one tied up with pale-blue ribbon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> thief before,' {{continued}} Casimir. 'Now how am I to {{know that}} you are not one still? I suppose you could climb the green gate?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Ras el Caffilah ({{chief of the}} caravan) was one Ibrahim ibn Boorantoo, who {{it appears}} had been chief of the embassy caravan, {{although}} Essakh (Ishak) gave out that he was. It is certain that this man always gave orders for pitching the camp and for loading; but we being unaware {{of the fact that}} he was Ras el Caffilah, he had not received presents on the arrival of the Embassy at Shoa. Whilst unloading the camels, the following conversation took place. 'Ya Kabtan!' (0 Captain) said he addressing me with a sneer, 'where are you going to?--do you think the Bedoos will let you pass through their country? We shall see! Now I will tell you!--you Feringis have treated me very ill!--you loaded Essakh and others with presents, but never gave me anything. I have, as it were, a knife in my stomach which is continually cutting me--this knife you have placed there! But, inshallah! it is now my turn! I will be equal with you!--you think of going to Hurrur--we shall see!' I replied, 'You know me not! It is true I was ignorant that you were Ras el Caffilah on our way to Shoa. You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> knife cutting your inside--I can remove that knife! Those who treat me well, now that I am returning to my country, shall be rewarded; for, the Lord be praised! there I have the means of repaying my friends, but in Shoa I am a beggar. Those that treat me ill shall also receive their reward.' ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{interviewees}} is Claudia Keyworth, {{an advocate of}} 'Bio-Energetic medicine' who believes that healing is best accomplished using the [...] "energy field of the human body". On the topic of mental illness, she asserts: [...] "they <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chemical imbalance of serotonin and dopamine, but there's never been a study to prove that, ever." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Even Metcalfe's law understates {{the value}} {{created by a}} group-forming network GFN as it grows. Let's <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> GFN with n members. If you add up all the {{potential}} two-person groups, three-person groups, and so on that those members could form, the number of possible groups equals 2n.
