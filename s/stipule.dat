5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> can be {{fused to}} the stem, {{or to the}} other <b>stipule</b> from the same node.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "interpetiolar" [...] if it {{is located}} in between the petioles, {{as opposed to being}} {{attached}} to the petioles, and generally one <b>stipule</b> from each leaf is fused together, so it appears that there's just one <b>stipule</b> between each leaf.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "ochreate" [...] if {{a single}} <b>stipule</b> {{appears to be}} a solid tube that goes {{all the way around the}} stem.|$|E
50|$|The {{three types}} of <b>stipules</b> {{according}} to duration are caducous, deciduous and persistent. Caducous <b>stipules</b> fall off before the leaf unfolds, while deciduous <b>stipules</b> fall off immediately after the leaf unfolds. Persistent <b>stipules</b> remain attached to the plant.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} that foliaceous <b>stipules</b> are used like leaves to make energy for the plants. Sometimes <b>stipules</b> protect the next leaf or bud as it grows in, then falls off after the leaf unfolds, as with Tulip Poplars. <b>Stipules</b> {{can be used as}} {{climbing}} tendrils by climbing plants. Spiny <b>stipules</b> can be used to help protect the plant from animals.|$|R
50|$|Both the leaf-stems (3-5 mm long) {{and their}} <b>stipules</b> (2.5-5 mm long, lanceolate) are hairy, but the <b>stipules</b> {{are much less}} so.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between Stuckenia and Potamogeton {{is that the}} <b>stipule</b> joins the leaf base; when it is pulled the sheath and <b>stipule</b> comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule. Stuckenia vaginata is 1-4 metres long and has longer <b>stipule</b> sheaths than e.g. Stuckenia pecinata and Stuckenia filiformis. Similar to them, it has long narrow linear leaves.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} from other narrow-leaved pondweeds {{is that the}} <b>stipule</b> joins the leaf base, when it is pulled the sheath and <b>stipule</b> comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "intrapetiolar" [...] if it {{is located}} in the angle that's between a stem and a petiole. In this case, the two {{stipules}} generally form together and appear to be one <b>stipule.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Stipules</b> {{can be used}} by {{the plants}} in various ways, and some uses of <b>stipules</b> are not well {{understood}} or may be vestigial.|$|R
25|$|The two similar {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} by their <b>stipules.</b> In G. stipulata, the <b>stipules</b> {{at the base of}} the leaves, which are round and deeply toothed, persist throughout the life of the plant. In G. trifoliata the long slender <b>stipules</b> are quickly deciduous, this species also tends to have longer leaves and petals.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant can}} show heterophylly: upper leaves can be {{different}} from lower leaves. The blade can {{be more or less}} elongated, from rounded to lanceolate, with crenate margin. At the base of the petiole there are <b>stipules</b> (5-15 mm long) of various form, from linear and entire <b>stipules</b> to <b>stipules</b> divided in many linear segments, pennate or palmate.|$|R
50|$|II) Leaves- Simple {{with free}} lateral <b>stipule.</b>|$|E
50|$|These herbs present {{rhizomes}} but not turions; the tubers can {{be absent}} or present. The main difference between Stuckenia and Potamogeton {{is that the}} <b>stipule</b> joins the leaf base, when it is pulled the sheath and <b>stipule</b> comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "foliaceous" [...] {{if it is}} leaf-like. These are {{generally}} used to photosynthesize.|$|E
5000|$|... var. spinescens from southeastern Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Chihuahua and Coahuila {{is early}} deciduous, the leaves either lacking <b>stipules</b> or with <b>stipules</b> less than 0.1 mm long ...|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, seldom opposite, with <b>stipules.</b> They are mainly simple, but where compound, are always palmate, never pinnate. <b>Stipules</b> {{may be reduced}} to hairs, glands, or spines, or in {{succulent}} species are sometimes absent.|$|R
50|$|Species within Hedysarum genus may be {{herbaceous}} {{plants or}} deciduous shrubs. They have odd-pinnate leaves, with entire leaflets (no notches or indentations). These leaves resemble {{the leaves of}} sweet peas. The <b>stipules</b> may be free or connate, and stipels (secondary <b>stipules)</b> are absent.|$|R
50|$|If {{a single}} <b>stipule</b> {{goes all the}} way around the stem, it is known as an ochrea.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule,</b> {{present on}} the leaves of many dicotyledons, is an {{appendage}} on each side {{at the base of}} the petiole, resembling a small leaf. Stipules may be lasting and not be shed (a stipulate leaf, such as in roses and beans), or be shed as the leaf expands, leaving a <b>stipule</b> scar on the twig (an exstipulate leaf).The situation, arrangement, and structure of the stipules is called the [...] "stipulation".|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is {{considered}} [...] "spiny" [...] {{if they are}} long and pointy. These are generally used to deter animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of <b>stipules</b> on a plant varies widely from species to species, {{though they are}} often located near {{the base of a}} leaf. <b>Stipules</b> are most common on dicotyledons, where they appear in pairs alongside each leaf. Some monocotyledon plants display stipule-like structures, but only display one per leaf. A relationship exists between the anatomy of the stem node and {{the presence or absence of}} stipules: most plants with trilacunar nodes have stipules; species with unilacunar nodes lack <b>stipules.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trifolium wormskioldii, a legume. is a {{perennial}} herb sometimes taking a matlike form, with decumbent or upright stems. The leaves {{are made up}} of leaflets measuring 1 to 3 centimeters long. The lower <b>stipules</b> are tipped with bristles and the upper <b>stipules</b> may be toothed.|$|R
50|$|Petiole c. 1.2-2.5 mm long; <b>stipules</b> almost absent.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is {{considered}} [...] "tendrillar" [...] {{if they are}} long thin tendrils, and are generally used by climbing plants.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "adnate" [...] if it's fused {{together}} {{on part of}} the petiole length, but the anterior is still free.|$|E
50|$|There is no <b>stipule</b> (a small leaf-like {{structure}} at {{the base}} of the leaf stem), or stipules are small and sometimes fingerlike.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stipules</b> are 4 to 17 cm long.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{comparisons}} of the anatomy and morphology of the leaves, bracts and bracteoles within representatives of the order Brassicales indicate similarity of bracts and leaves, {{as well as the}} similarity between bracteoles and <b>stipules.</b> This is evidence in favor of homologous leaf and bracts, and <b>stipules</b> and bracteoles...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{seedlings}} and young twigs of South AfricanÂ  Acacia species was sectioned and the vascularization of the nodes and internodes studied. The nodes of all the species examined are trilacunate and the vascular tissue of the <b>stipules</b> originates from the lateral leaf traces. The Gummiferae species all have spinescent <b>stipules,</b> while <b>stipules</b> of the Vulgares species are membranous. Prickles containing no vascular tissue are found on the nodes and in some species also on the internodes of the Vulgares species. These prickles always occur on the ridges formed on the stem by leaf traces. </p...|$|R
5000|$|There are small, fleshy {{green leaves}} with linear or {{lance-shaped}} blades oppositely arranged along the stem. Each {{is accompanied by}} a small, pointed <b>stipule.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ficus triradiata, {{commonly}} known as the red <b>stipule</b> fig is a hemiepiphytic fig that is endemic to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.|$|E
5000|$|All Potamogeton have a {{delicate}} membranous sheathing scale, the <b>stipule,</b> at the leaf axil. This may be wholly attached, partly attached, or {{free of the}} leaf, {{and it may have}} inrolled margins or appear as a tube. The morphology of the <b>stipule</b> is an important character for species identification. The flowers, which are often overlooked, are greenish-brown and are composed of four rounded segments borne in a spike. The fruits are spheroidal and green to brown, usually 1-3 mm in diameter, with a noticeable 'beak'.|$|E
50|$|Ochreate: Provided with ochrea, or sheath-formed <b>stipules,</b> as in Polygonaceae; e.g., rhubarb.|$|R
50|$|Leaves are simple, {{alternate}} or opposite, and paler beneath, with inconspicuous <b>stipules.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leaves {{are often}} alternate, more rarely opposite. They are also simple and without <b>stipules.</b>|$|R
