5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental <b>server</b> intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot <b>server,</b> an intentionally vulnerable <b>server</b> designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure <b>server,</b> these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E

A public beta version of Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 was {{released}} {{along with the}} Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012.

5|$|Freelancer {{features}} a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128players to play {{together in a}} game. Multiplayer games are hosted on game servers; personal computers that meet the requirements for the game {{can act as a}} <b>server.</b> Gameplay is similar to the single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The <b>server</b> keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can resume their game on their next log on to this <b>server.</b> A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new <b>Server</b> Manager, a graphical application used for <b>server</b> management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|<b>Server</b> Manager {{has been}} {{redesigned}} {{with an emphasis}} on easing management of multiple servers. The operating system, like Windows 8, uses the Metro-based user interface unless installed in <b>Server</b> Core mode. Windows Store is available in this version of Windows but is not installed by default. Windows PowerShell in this version has over 2300 commandlets, compared to around 200 in Windows <b>Server</b> 2008 R2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Server</b> Sundaram was {{released}} on 11 December 1964. The film became commercial success and completed a theatrical run of 100 days.

5|$|Some NTFS {{features}} are not supported in ReFS, including object IDs, short names, file compression, file level encryption (EFS), user data transactions, hard links, extended attributes, and disk quotas. Sparse files are supported. Support for named streams is not implemented in Windows 8 and Windows <b>Server</b> 2012, {{though it was}} later added in Windows 8.1 and Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 R2. ReFS does not itself offer data deduplication. Dynamic disks with mirrored or striped volumes are replaced with mirrored or striped storage pools provided by Storage Spaces. In Windows <b>Server</b> 2012, automated error-correction with integrity streams is only supported on mirrored spaces; automatic recovery on parity spaces was added in Windows 8.1 and Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 R2. Booting from ReFS is not supported either.|$|E

5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 has {{no support}} for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various {{features}} were added or improved over Windows <b>Server</b> 2008 R2 (with many placing {{an emphasis on}} cloud computing), such as {{an updated version of}} Hyper-V, an IP address management role, a new version of Windows Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows <b>Server</b> 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.|$|E
50|$|The SMTP {{protocol}} {{establishes a}} store-and-forward network, {{and if a}} domain's mail <b>servers</b> are all offline, sending <b>servers</b> are required to queue messages destined for that domain to retry later. However, these sending <b>servers</b> {{have no way of}} being notified that a previously offline domain's <b>servers</b> are now available. The sending <b>servers</b> will only discover that the domain is available whenever delivery of the delayed messages is next attempted. The delay between when a domain's <b>servers</b> come online and when delayed messages are finally delivered can be anywhere from minutes to days, depending on the retry schedule of the sending <b>servers.</b> This is the problem that backup MX records are uniquely qualified to solve. The idea is that the <b>servers</b> listed as secondary MX <b>servers</b> have some out-of-band way of knowing when the primary <b>servers</b> are back online. Thus, they are a more useful place to queue messages when the primary <b>servers</b> are offline than the original sender's queue.|$|R

In particular there exists critical level of input rate that in case of higher rate most probable that all <b>servers</b> are overloaded. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

5|$|While it is {{possible}} to access Xgrid from the command line, the Xgrid graphical user interface, a program bundled with Mac OS X <b>Server</b> and, as of March 2009, available online, is a much more efficient way of administering an Xgrid system. Originally, the Xgrid agent was included in all Mac OS X version 10.4 installations but the GUI was reserved for users of Mac OS X <b>Server.</b> This decision limited the efforts of the computer community to embrace the platform. Eventually, Apple released the Mac OS X <b>Server</b> Administration Tools to the public, which included the Xgrid administration application bundled with Mac OS X <b>Server.</b>|$|E
