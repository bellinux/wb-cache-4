5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love interest for Ellen Ripley. Director David Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E.

5|$|By the {{day after}} the regular session ended, Dayton had vetoed all of the budget bills passed by the legislature, and <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{statement}} that he anticipated a shutdown would occur. Dayton did not call a special session of the legislature to further address the budget during May or June, claiming that the lack of agreement between him and Zellers and Koch would make it unproductive to do so. He remained in contact with legislative leaders, sticking by the $35.8 billion budget he proposed late in the session, with minor changes. As the end of June approached, Koch urged the governor to call a session to pass a temporary 'lights-on' bill while a final deal was reached, but he refused to answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement. Since the budget impasse had not ended by the end of June 30, the shutdown began at midnight of June 30–July 1, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin was <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety.

She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E

She said this a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her.

It was <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{contemporary}} account that his entire material wealth at that time was composed of a “sizable library”. Piattoli ended his service with the Potocki family around 1784 due to personal disagreements with Pelagia Potocka and Maria Radziwiłł. In the meantime, he became associated with the Lubomirski family—Izabela Lubomirska in particular—and through them befriended Stanisław Kostka Potocki and Grzegorz Piramowicz. Through Potocki and Piramowicz he {{became a member of the}} Society for Elementary Books in 1784. In the Society he was tasked with writing a textbook on the history of science.

5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies.

Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Mix article that they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
