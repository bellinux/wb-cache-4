25|$|Handliners – are {{normally}} undecked vessels used for handlining (fishing {{with a line}} and hook). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres o/a, {{and do not have}} special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of <b>special</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment.</b> Non traditional handliners can set and haul using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels {{are normally}} fastened to the gunwale or set on stanchions close to or overhanging the gunwale. They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners.|$|E

First introduced in the Hudson Bay area in January 2009, the service will eventually be expanded to cover all of northern Canada. The technique {{involves the use of}} ground based transmitter/receivers and <b>special</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> aboard aircraft flying through northern airspace. This special equipment automatically transmits information relating to the aircraft position (determined by a GPS on the airplane) every second, to the ground based receiving station, a number of which are located in the north.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{reducing}} rather than controlling hazards stems from British chemical engineer Trevor Kletz in a 1978 article entitled “What You Don’t Have, Can’t Leak” on {{lessons from the}} Flixborough disaster, and the name ‘inherent safety’ from a book which was an expanded version of the article. [...] A greatly revised and retitled 1991 version mentioned the techniques which are generally quoted. (Kletz originally used the term intrinsically safe in 1978, but as this had already been used for the <b>special</b> case of <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> in potentially flammable atmospheres, only the term inherent was adopted. Intrinsic safety may be considered a special subset of inherent safety.)In 2010 the American Institute of Chemical Engineers published its own definition of IST.|$|R
25|$|In , Detroit {{developer}} James Hoseyni {{signed a}} 20-year lease with an $2.7 million 3-year option to buy with building owner 6840 Hollywood Associates, {{an affiliate of}} Westmark Development. Westmark Development at that time had Nicholas Olaerts and Thomas Harnsberger as general partners and who were owners of El Capitan Theatre by 1992. Donald Bruce Randall, an architect of the Randall/Baylon Partnership of Los Angeles, and Tehran-born Kamal Kamooneh, the project's creative architect, with Hoseyni lead the renovation costing $1.5 million to house a 250-seat cabaret, 500-seat jazz theater and an 800-person dance club. The Blue and Red Halls were restored then modified for a disc jockey's podium, <b>special</b> <b>electronic</b> and lighting <b>equipment</b> and bars.

In September 1987, the building was renovated and reopened as the Hollywood Live Entertainment Pavilions with a cover charge for all venues. Hollywood Live lasted only a short time.|$|R

40|$|The author {{proposes a}} method to design <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> based on functional-node design method that {{involves}} the use of 2 D- and 3 D- models mechanical structures for <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> as a way to reduce development time and errors when creating design documentation for <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment.</b> At present, most areas of science and technology are computerized, more problems in designing <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> are dealt with using computer-aided design (CAD) and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) to reduce the time required for development and manufacturing of <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment.</b> Development of design documentation also requires a more effective approach, because the less the time for development of the design documentation is, the faster the developed device will go into production. The aim of the study is to develop a method of designing <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> using 2 D and 3 D models of standard mechanical structures for <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> using Internet resources. Based on the presented methods is an example of designing a device from standard bearing structures.

40|$|In {{the past}} years supply chain {{integration}} has become focus of interest, {{due to the}} discussion in the literature, that a positive direct relationship exists between higher supply chain integration and higher performance. Additionally, the environmental and social performance of supply chains gained much interest based on the new sustainability focus in the 21 st century. The production of electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is one of the}} fastest growing global manufacturing activities. However, due to technological advancements, the quick obsolescence of electronics result in increased generation of waste of electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment.</b> Germany is one of the leading electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> markets within Europe and is strongly affected by the EU directives and regulations, which aim not only to protect human health but also to improve the environmental performance of the electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> operators in particular. Therefore, the environmental and social performance of German electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers is increasingly gaining importance. Respectively, the purpose of this study is to investigate what effect the depth of upstream supply chain integration has on the environmental and social performance of German electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers. This study is based on the quantitative research method. The required empirical data is generated through an online questionnaire, which has been sent to German electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers. An initial operationalization of upstream supply chain integration depth and environmental and social performance is used as a foundation for the questionnaire. It can be concluded that German electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers seem to have a coordinative upstream supply chain integration and presumably have a Abstract 4 moderate environmental and social performance. Furthermore, it can be assumed that the upstream supply chain integration depth has an effect on the environmental and social performance of German electrical and <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|Background: Exposure to {{extremely}} low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF), especially among <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> repairers may induce oxidative stress and affect sleep quality. Aims: This study was carried out to (a) investigate the effect of exposure to ELF-EMF on the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels among <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> repairers {{as an indicator of}} oxidative stress; and melatonin hormone levels; and (b) to study the prevalence of sleep insufficiency among <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> repairers exposed to ELF-EMF. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 50 <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> repairers at high risk of exposure to ELF-EMF, and a matched control group at lower risk of exposure to ELF-EMF. All the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire about medical and occupational histories; and sleep sufficiency. The plasma melatonin and MDA levels of the study subjects were assessed. Results: The mean level of serum melatonin in the <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> repairers was lower than that of the controls (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> repairers, exposed to ELF-EMF, are at a risk of oxidative stress and sleep insufficiency, which could be explained by lower plasma melatonin levels and higher MDA levels. Health education about the hazards of ELF-EMF, shortening of exposure time per day, and taking antioxidant vitamins should be done to ameliorate the oxidative effect of EMF on those workers...|$|R
