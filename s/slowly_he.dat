5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|The Yongzheng Emperor succeeded the Kangxi Emperor after {{a crisis}} that pitted many of the Kangxi Emperor's sons against one another. Many Manchu nobles who had sided with the Yongzheng Emperor's rivals during the {{succession}} struggle were still members of the Deliberative Council. To avoid alienating these grandees, the Yongzheng Emperor still made new appointments to the Council and consulted it on various military matters, but he also worked to undermine its power. To bypass the Council, he created smaller parallel bodies which he found more reliable and less entrenched. <b>Slowly,</b> <b>he</b> transferred deliberative powers to these more trusted ministers. Around 1730, these informal institutions crystallized into the Grand Council. Unlike the Deliberative Council, whose membership was almost exclusively Manchu, the Grand Council counted many Chinese among its ranks. This more ethnically mixed privy council served as the empire's main policymaking body {{for the rest of}} the Qing dynasty.|$|E

25|$|The {{summer of}} 1989 gave Russell {{a run in}} the England side, but his batting never reached such scoring heights again, and the game was moving forward in a new era: a six-hour stand for 29 was not what was required. For reasons of balance and depth in batting, Alec Stewart often got the gloves ahead of Russell due to his {{superior}} batting and increasingly reliable keeping. Russell was sometimes called up when England needed a good man behind the stumps, but <b>slowly</b> <b>he</b> faded away until 1998, {{when he decided to}} retire after being left out of that year's Ashes tour squad.|$|E
25|$|The purely {{scientific}} side of Grimm's character developed <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> {{seems to}} have felt the want of definite principles of etymology {{without being able to}} discover them, and indeed even in the first edition of his grammar (1819) he often seemed to be groping in the dark. As early as 1815 we find August Wilhelm von Schlegel reviewing the Altdeutsche Wälder (a periodical published by the two brothers) very severely, condemning the lawless etymological combinations it contained, and insisting on the necessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation of the laws of language, especially in the correspondence of sounds. This criticism is said to have had a considerable influence on the direction of Grimm's studies.|$|E
25|$|Although the Admiralty had {{instructed}} Parker to frustrate the League, by force if necessary, {{he was a}} naturally cautious person and moved <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> wanted to blockade the Baltic despite {{the danger of the}} combination of fleets; Nelson wanted to ignore Denmark and Sweden, who were both reluctant partners in the alliance, and instead sail to the Baltic to fight the Russians. In the end Nelson was able to persuade Sir Hyde to attack the Danish fleet currently concentrated off Copenhagen. Promised naval support for the Danes from Karlskrona, in Sweden, did not arrive perhaps because of adverse winds. The Prussians had only minimal naval forces and also could not assist. On 30 March, the British force passed through the narrows between Denmark and Sweden, sailing close to the Swedish coast to put themselves as far from the Danish guns as possible; fortunately for the British, the Swedish batteries remained silent.|$|E

25|$|Pears's musical career started <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> was {{at first}} unsure whether to {{concentrate}} on playing or singing, and {{despite the efforts of}} some of his friends, it was not until he met Britten in 1937 that he threw himself wholeheartedly into singing. Once he and Britten were established as a partnership, the composer wrote many concert and operatic works with Pears's voice in mind, and the singer created roles in more than ten operas by his partner. In the concert hall, Pears and Britten were celebrated recitalists, known in particular for their performances of Lieder by Schubert and Schumann. Together they recorded most of the works written for Pears by Britten, as well as a wide range of music by other composers. Working with other musicians, Pears sang an extensive repertoire of music from four centuries, from the Tudor period to the most modern times.|$|E
500|$|Music writers Covach and Boone {{describe}} the riff as blues-derived, {{which uses a}} minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note (or common blues scale). [...] The song follows a blues chord progression (I–IV–I) during the first eight bars. [...] Brown {{had a difficult time}} writing lyrics that fit the riff. [...] After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a standup bass while lyricist Pete Brown was staring out the window. [...] <b>Slowly,</b> <b>he</b> started to write [...] "It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes", which is used in the first verse. [...] Later, to break up the rhythm, Clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded the song's title.

[...] On that turn, {{he took over the}} lead from Arch Traveler and To Honor and Serve in a field that {{stretched}} 14lengths back to Dialed In at the rear. [...] Shackleford led down the back stretch and around the final turn, setting a [...] fraction of 46.3 and a [...] in 1:10.6. [...] At the top of the lane, he was challenged by To Honor and Serve and repelled him. [...] Three strides from the wire, he was caught by eventual Kentucky Derby co-favorite Dialed In and just missed the win, finishing second by a head.|$|E

500|$|Tippett's talent {{developed}} <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> withdrew {{or destroyed}} his earliest compositions, and was 30 {{before any of}} his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of jazz and blues after {{his first visit to}} America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed [...] infrequently in the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|After his seven-triple season, {{his speed}} began to {{decrease}} {{and he could}} no longer regularly score triples due to pulling his quadriceps during the 1962 season. Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> hit under [...]200 in both April and June, and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not named an All-Star before 1972. On July 18 in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Killebrew and Bob Allison became the first teammates since 1890 to hit grand slams in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first. Over the course of the season, Killebrew hit 48 home runs, 126 RBIs, and had 107 walks, all career highs at the time. No one else in the AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs. Killebrew's 48 home runs also broke the franchise record {{for the second year in}} a row. Not all of his stats were positive; Killebrew's batting average dropped from [...]288 in 1961 to [...]243 and he struck out a career-worst 142 times, leading the AL.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent; their reunion was going well; and they were proceeding <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that there is hope even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor Elizabeth Smart has {{stressed the importance of}} focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: [...] "Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color." [...] He opined that she was brainwashed, would feel angry and now needs to move on with her life.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{criticized by the}} South China Morning Post for lacking documentation, making it more {{difficult}} to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time {{plays an important role in}} earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. The Age was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of The Towering Infernos plot could have been included. Game Informer referred to SimTower as a [...] "lesser-known" [...] simulation game, and described it as [...] "fun and addictive". Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to SimCity 2000 (1993), gameplay in SimTower moved <b>slowly.</b> <b>He</b> also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building. Dragon magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games. In 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association listed SimTower as the [...] "Best Simulation Program" [...] in the Consumer software category of their annual CODiE awards.|$|E
500|$|Chapter IX {{deals with}} the fact that the {{geologic}} record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work <b>slowly,</b> <b>he</b> cited the example of [...] The Weald as discussed in [...] Principles of Geology together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.|$|E
