At the Atlanta site (226 B) {{it was found}} that bulk color composites for October 15, 1972, and April 13, 1973, can be interpreted together to disclose the location of the perennial Kudzu vine (Pyeraria lobata). Land managers concerned with Kudzu eradication could use ERTS- 1 to inventory locations over 200 meters (660 feet) square. Microdensitometer data collected on ERTS- 1 Bulk photographic products for the Manitou test site (226 C) have shown that the 15 -step gray-scale tablets are not of systematic equal values corresponding to 1 / 14 the maximum radiant energy incident on the MSS sensor.

40|$|The {{large number}} of {{different}} types of examinations along with the notable broadness of scientific fields to be covered present a strong challenge for all academic institutions. So far, many eLearning environments offering electronic examination tools face a severe problem in their acceptance through the academic community since their evaluation methods are usually restricted to simple mechanisms such as multiple choice, short-answer, gap-filling exercises etc. Yet, at higher levels of education, examinations usually contain problems which require deep analytical understanding.

40|$|An {{intensity}} scale monochromatic sensitometer was constructed using a Bausch and Lomb single-pass diffraction-grating monochromator as the dispersing device. A ribbon-filament tungsten lamp {{was used to}} supply the radiant energy to the monochromator. The instrument was calibrated 2 radiometrically and was shown to have a maximum irradiance of 10 ergs/cm 2 2 at 425 nm, 43. 7 ergs/cm at 550 nm and 26. 1 ergs/cm at 700 nm. Exposure is accomplished by transporting the film and <b>step</b> <b>tablet</b> past a slit at a constant velocity. Several film velocities and slit widths are available to produce exposure times ranging from 0. 003 to 2. 0 seconds. Spectral sensitivity measurements were performed on KODAK Panatomic-X and KODAK High-Speed Infra Red materials. The results were compared to information supplied by the manufacturer. The differences between the Rochester Institute of Technology curves and the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s curves were within 6 percent.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effect of an infrared post-exposure on the latent image in blue sensitive 3 M Dry Silver film 7842 was performed. The film was first given a <b>step</b> <b>tablet</b> exposure using the unfiltered output of a tungsten source at 2856 K. A Wratten # 87 C filter was used with the same source to provide the second, infrared exposure over one half of the first exposure area. Absolute exposure and exposure reciprocity were tested. Processing was by immersion into a bath of 3 M fluorocarbon FC- 43 maintained at 127 C/ 260 F. The original objective, to cause Herschel effect bleaching of latent image, was not achieved. All IR exposures caused either a density increase, or, at low irradiance, no density change. A quanta ratio of 3 * 106 between the infrared and actinic exposures was obtained using an IR exposure time of 96 hours. The lack of any density decrease due to the Herschel effect apparently gives evidence to the theory that the Herschel effect is a rehalogenation process as reported by Farnell and Birch. The presence of halogen acceptors in the emulsion is believed to prevent the loss of latent image silver atoms due to rehalogenation. Further, the emulsion carrier and developing agents are IR absorbers and reduce the number of photons available for latent image destruction...|$|E

40|$|Near-infrared (NIR) {{spectroscopy}} {{was employed}} as a process analytical technique in three <b>steps</b> of <b>tabletting</b> process: to monitor the blend homogeneity, evaluate the content uniformity of tablets and determine the tablets coating thickness. A diode-array spectrometer mounted on a lab blender (SP 15 NIR lab blender) was used to monitor blend uniformity using a calibration-free model with drug concentration ranging from 2. 98 to 9. 25 % (w/w). The method developed accurately depicted the changes in concentration of the drug during blending and {{the positive effect of}} a delumping step in the production process. Blend homogeneity was reached within 2 min of the blending step post-delumping, with relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) values varying from 1. 0 to 2. 5 % depending on the drug concentration of the blend. A Fourier-transform spectrometer (Bruker MPA) was used to analyze content uniformity and coating thickness with calibration based models. Prediction of a validation set with tablets compacted at pressures not present in the calibration set yielded an root mean square error of cross validation (RMSEP) of 1. 94 %; prediction of tablets compacted at pressures present in the calibration set yielded a RMSEP of 1. 48 %. Performance of the model was influenced by several physical tablet properties, which could be reduced by spectral pre-processing. A model based on reflectance spectra predicted coating thickness and its variation more accurately than the model based on transmission spectra. Inter-tablet coating variation was predicted with NIR and compared to reference thickness measurements. Both methods gave comparable results. Initial inter-tablet variation of tablets sampled in-process during coating was high, but stabilized after 30 min into the process. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{diseases}} {{are the principal}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. An increased consumption of vegetables and fruit reduces the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer. An increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake may also prevent body weight gain, and therefore indirectly affect type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insufficient physical activity (PA) has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. Consequently, effective interventions that promote PA and FV intake in {{a large number of people}} are required. Objective: To describe the systematic development of an eHealth intervention, MyPlan 1. 0, for increasing FV intake and PA. Methods: The intervention was developed following the six steps of the intervention mapping (IM) protocol. Decisions during steps were based upon available literature, focus group interviews, and pilot studies. Results: Based on needs assessment (Step 1), it was decided to focus on fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity levels of adults. Based on self-regulation and the health action process approach model, motivational (eg, risk awareness) and volitional (eg, action planning) determinants were selected and crossed with performance objectives into a matrix with change objectives (Step 2). Behavioral change strategies (eg, goal setting, problem solving, and implementation intentions) were selected (<b>Step</b> 3). <b>Tablet</b> computers were chosen for delivery of the eHealth program in general practice (Step 4). To facilitate implementation of the intervention in general practice, GPs were involved in focus group interviews (Step 5). Finally, the planning of the evaluation of the intervention (Step 6) is briefly described. Conclusions: Using the IM protocol ensures that a theory-and evidence-based intervention protocol is developed. If the intervention is found to be effective, a dynamic eHealth program for the promotion of healthy lifestyles could be available for use in general practice...|$|R
40|$|Absolute abundances (concentrations) of dinoflagellate cysts {{are often}} {{determined}} through {{the addition of}} Lycopodium clavatum marker-grains as a spike to a sample before palynological processing. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise {{was set up in}} order to test the comparability of results obtained in different laboratories, each using its own preparation method. Each of the 23 laboratories received the same amount of homogenized splits of four Quaternary sediment samples. The samples originate from different localities and consisted of a variety of lithologies. Dinoflagellate cysts were extracted and counted, and relative and absolute abundances were calculated. The relative abundances proved to be fairly reproducible, notwithstanding a need for taxonomic calibration. By contrast, excessive loss of Lycopodium spores during sample preparation resulted in non-reproducibility of absolute abundances. Use of oxidation, KOH, warm acids, acetolysis, mesh sizes larger than 15 µm and long ultrasonication (> 1 min) must be avoided to determine reproducible absolute abundances. The results of this work therefore indicate that the dinoflagellate cyst worker should make a choice between using the proposed standard method which circumvents critical <b>steps,</b> adding Lycopodium <b>tablets</b> {{at the end of the}} preparation and using an alternative method. <br/...|$|R

The use of a tablet pc in archaeological excavation is {{a powerful tool for}} digital documentation. This work explains a method {{to take advantage of this}} new hardware using directly during the excavation. The advantages offered by this hardware are that one obtains precision, quick recording times and the possibility to manipulate big data during an excavation. During Grumentum experience the working area (12 m x 13 m) was divided in small rectangles (2 m x 1, 5 m) and every single rectangle was photographed using a digital camera and rectified on site.

40|$|The {{process of}} tablet {{manufacturing}} with granulation {{is described as}} a two-step process. The first step comprises wet granulation of the powder mixture, and in the second step the granules are compressed into tablets. For the modelling of the pharmaceutical process of wet granulation and tableting, two models are constructed and compared. The first model relates the crushing strength (CS), disintegration time (DT) and ejection force (EF) of the tablets with process variables from both the wet granulation and tableting steps and the composition variables of the powder mixture. In addition to these predictor variables, the second model also uses physical properties of the intermediate granules to improve the predictive properties of the first model. Model 1 has to be used {{at the start of the}} process to find settings for the process variables and the composition of the tablet mixture that produce tablets with specific properties. Model 2 is used, in everyday production, for each new granulation batch. The granule properties may differ from batch to batch due to uncontrolled sources such as air humidity, temperature or other unknown features. With Model 2 these differences are taken into account, and the CS and DT are predicted better than with Model 1. The advantage of incorporating the measured granule properties in the second model is not only an improvement of the predictive power, but the second model offers also the possibility to use a control scheme for the second step of the process. This control scheme adjusts the variables of the tableting <b>step</b> to produce <b>tablets</b> that better meet the specifications. Because the granule properties are highly collinear and also dependent on the process variables of the first step, a partial least squares regression method has been used for the modelling.

40|$|The USP/NF {{sets the}} {{standards}} and maintains monographs which outline the methods to assess the chemical purity of drugs and pharmaceutical excipients. These methods, however complete, do not address the physicochemical properties of excipients which are critical to their performance in wet granulated systems. Pharmaceutical binders are included into wet granulated systems to promote bond formation during the granulation and compaction <b>steps</b> of this <b>tablet</b> manufacturing process. This investigation outlines methods {{used to evaluate the}} functionality of pharmaceutical binders in wet granulated systems by evaluating their influence on the granulation, compaction of that granulation and the properties of the resultant end-products, tablets. Binders from natural (Starch NF), semisynthetic (Maltodextrins and Pregelatinized Starches), and synthetic (Povidone), sources were evaluated to characterize their functionality in model wet granulated systems. The Maltodexterin and the Povidone investigated were identified to produce systems with different responses to compaction force in terms of tablet hardness. Also, when the critical processing variable of tablet press speed was investigated, the granules 2 ̆ 7 ability to fragment was identified as critical to inter-particulate bond formation at low speeds and low compaction forces, however at high forces, the systems 2 ̆ 7 ability to deform plasticly was identified and this was dependent on press speed. Four different brands of pregelatinized starch, National 1551, Starch 1500, Lycatab TMPGS, and Pregeflo TMM, were investigated to identify limitations of the current USP/NF monograph. In evaluating the effect of these compounds on dissolution performance, a significant difference was observed between the starches which meet USP/NF standards for purity, and the brand that did not. Also, a difference was observed between the partial, and completely pregelatinized systems. In the case of the pregelatinized starches, chemical purity as outlined in the current monograph, as well as degree of pregelatinization (partial or full), would be complete in their characterization. The methods outlined in this investigation may {{serve as a model for}} the investigation into the functionality of other excipients used in the manufacture of tablets by the process of wet granulation. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} work is {{cultivation}} of probiotic bacteria L. acidophilus, B. breve and B. longum {{in such a}} way that the culture forms cells clusters or comprehensive biofilm on the variety of free carriers. Biofilm formation of L. acidophilus on the silica from point of view bile and acid tolerance in gastrointestinal tract was studied. While the number of living cells in planktonic form (planktonic form) at pH 1 fell by 30 %, the viability of the biofilm cells was maintained to 90 % under the same environmental conditions. The biofilm culture showed also the protection against environment contained bile. Furthermore, the possibilities of drying procedures of biofilm cultures used as commercial technologies in pharmaceutical industry were studied. The comparison of freeze-drying and fluidization bed drying showed, that freeze-drying is more suitable method, which is able to achieve higher amount of viable cells after drying than fluidization bed drying. The effectivity of freeze-drying method is dependent on the selection of suitable cryprotective medium. In this case, about 90 % higher viability after freeze drying was achieved in comparison with fluidization bed drying. Finally, the industrial processing of probiotic strains into the solid dosage form was studied. Tablets should be produced at hardness between 70 and 90 N and water activity of tablet mixture can be maintained below 0. 3. Consequently, the drying <b>step</b> of the <b>tablets</b> in a hermetically closed space with at least 10 % of silica gel must be ensured.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research task was to accomplish successfully development of the controlled release matrices of Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. These both are typical members of NSAID's and offer considerable therapeutic effects to relieve the symptoms and subsequent management of chronic inflammatory disorders such as osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and dysmenorrhea. Eudragit polymers were employed as rate controlling agents and consequently, their obvious impact on kinetic, mechanism and pattern of drug release was investigated. This highly skillful task did require primarily, initial preformulation studies to rule out drug identification, as well as solubility profiles. The drug and polymer as well as drug, polymer and co excipients compatibilities were also seriously addressed. Different codes were used to produce a set of formulations involving Eudragit L 100, L 55 and S 100 respectively by employing different drug to polymer ratios for both Flurbiprofen as well as Ibuprofen without any further addition of co-excipients. Moreover, same formulations were also developed in which primary filler (lactose) was partially replaced with co-excipients such as starch, CMC, HPMC, Gum Acacia and Gum tragacanth respectively. Ultimately {{the impact of these}} co-excipients upon drug release from fabricated matrices was also noted. Official procedures were employed to describe the Micromeritics studies of pure drugs a s well as respective physical mixtures of the formulation. The results provided puzzling statements about the flow of the pure drugs describing poor flow behavior. This problem was rectified by developing physical mixtures of different ingredients including magnesium stearate as a result, an enhanced and improved flow properties were exhibited. This was indispensable and prominent <b>step</b> in <b>tablet</b> preparation. Direct compression method was adopted as preferred procedure to get matrix tablets. Matrix tablets formed under such a tidy situation under go physico-chemical assessment according to official procedures. These test protocols included dimensional, friability, hardness, weight variation and content uniformity tests. All these searching checks were within official limits. In-vitro dissolution tests were performed for matrix tablets by selecting rotating basket method (USP method 1) with phosphate buffer of PH 7. 4 as recommended dissolution medium. Matrices having Eudragit L 100 enhanced the drug release more efficiently as compared to other grades. The leading factors affecting rates and kinetics of drug release from matrices included particle size, drug to polymer ratio and viscosity grades. Various co-excipients incorporated due to progressive replacement of lactose (Primary filler) such as CMC, HPMC, Starch, Gum Acacia and Gum Tragacanth caused enhanced drug release i. e within 3 - 5 hours. Different kinetic models were fitted to the data of drug release from the matrices. Korseymerpeppas equation best fitted the release profile from matrices by giving "n" value that described anomalous non fickian release mechanism for formulations without co-excipients. The similarity factor (f 2) was also determined by comparing dissolution profile of both matrices and conventional dosage forms. The optimized formulations of both drugs were selected by keeping in view description of kinetic models as well as in-vitro dissolution profiles. The optimized formulations were subjected to stability testing in accelerated condition for short term exposure and they offered good stability profiles in accelerated conditions. The optimized tablets were also selected for in-vivo studies to determine in-vivo bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters in rabbits. The result deduced, showed test formulation to display extended drug release as compared to reference formulations.
