In order to alleviate the traffic pressure and expand {{the capacity of}} the road network, constructing flyovers has become an effective way in most cities in China. During the period of the flyover construction, work zones occupy road space, impact traffic flow characteristics and driver behaviour; therefore, this causes a significant reduction of the capacity. Researching of the traffic flow characteristics during the period of flyover construction can improve traffic organization and traffic safety around work zones.

The evaluation was conducted using empirical methods (including aggregate data from microwave sensors and other sources, and disaggregate data from a mobile study), and microscopic traffic simulation. The empirical analysis is based on before and after VSL data, including evaluation of individual measures of performance, and multivariate analysis {{in the form of the}} fundamental diagram, and <b>speed-density</b> <b>relationships.</b> The results from the empirical study are mixed with an indication that driver behavior has a strong impact on the effectiveness of the system. The microscopic traffic simulation analysis included the development of a platform for testing VSL and more generally motorway control strategies. The simulation platform was calibrated and validated with the empirical data and includes in addition to VSL, and Automatic Incident Detection (AID) system, the ALINEA ramp metering algorithm. The test-platform allows the testing of different control strategies and various combinations of control strategies, under different scenarios and in a controlled environment. The results from the simulation study indicate that driver compliance is an important factor and VSL performance quickly deteriorates as compliance rate drops. Hence, VSL should be implemented as mandatory instead of advisory. In addition, mandatory VSL can be effective both, under incident and moderately congested conditions. A combined VSL and ramp metering strategy can be most effective in reducing travel time, improving traffic conditions on the motorway. Furthermore, the results indicate that such a strategy also has the least impact on the flows entering the motorway from the ramps. QC 2010063...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{of traffic}} on freeways and limited access {{highways}} {{can be represented}} {{as a series of}} kinemetic waves. Solutions to these systems of equations become problematic under congested traffic flow conditions, and under complicated (real-world) networks. A simplified theory of kinematics waves was previously proposed. Simplifying elements includes translation of the problem to moving coordinate system, adoption of bi-linear <b>speed-density</b> <b>relationships,</b> and adoption of restrictive constraints at the on- and off-ramps. However, these simplifying assumptions preclude application of this technique to most practical situations. This research explores the limitations of the simplified theory of kinematic waves. First this research documents a relaxation of several key constraints. In the original theory, priority was given to on-ramp merging vehicles so that they can bypass any queue at the merge. This research proposes to relax this constraint using a capacity-based weighted fair queuing (CBWFQ) merge model. In the original theory, downstream queue affects upstream traffic as a whole and exiting traffic can always be able to leave as long as it gets to the diverge. This research proposes that this diverge constraint be replaced with a contribution-based weighted splitting (CBWS) diverge model. This research proposes a revised notation system, permitting the solution techniques to be extended to freeway networks with multiple freeways and their ramps. This research proposes a generalization to permit application of the revised theory to general transportation networks. A generalized CBWFQ merge model and a generalized CBWS diverge model are formulated to deal with merging and diverging traffic. Finally, this research presents computational procedure for solving the new system of equations. Comparisons of model predictions with field observations are conducted on GA 400 in Atlanta. Investigations into the performance of the proposed CBWFQ and CBWS models are conducted. Results are quite encouraging, quantitative measures suggest satisfactory accuracy with narrow confidence interval. Ph. D.

30|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{establish}} a suitable <b>speed–density</b> functional <b>relationship</b> for heterogeneous traffic on urban arterials. The model must reproduce the traffic behaviour on traffic stream and satisfy all static and dynamic properties of speed–flow–density relationships. As a first attempt for Indian traffic condition, two behavioural parameters, namely the kinematic wave speed at jam (Cj) and a proposed saturation flow (λ), are estimated using empirical observations. The parameter Cj is estimated by developing a relationship between driver reaction time and vehicle position in the queue at the signalised intersection. Functional parameters are estimated using Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm implemented in the R statistical software. Numerical measures such as root mean squared error, average relative error and cumulative residual plots are used for assessing models fitness. We set out several static and dynamic properties of the flow–speed–density relationships to evaluate the models, and these properties equally hold good for both homogenous and heterogeneous traffic states. From the numerical analysis, it is found that very few models replicate empirical speed–density data traffic behaviour. However, none of the existing functional forms satisfy all the properties. To overcome the shortcomings, we proposed two new speed–density functional forms. The uniqueness of these models is that they satisfy both numerical accuracy and the properties of fundamental diagram. These new forms would certainly improve the modelling accuracy, especially in dynamic traffic studies when coupling with dynamic speed equations.|$|R

40|$|This report studies {{walking and}} travel choice {{behavior}} of pedestrians concerning stairways and escalators in public transport facilities. With respect to walking behavior of pedestrians, {{we focus on}} deriving traffic characteristics such as free speeds and fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flows. Bi-linear models are hypothesized for the <b>speed-density</b> <b>relationships</b> of pedestrian traffic on stairways and escalators. In regard to travel choice behavior of pedestrians, two types of choice behavior are discussed: the first one considers the selection between available stairways and escalators to facilitate level changes; the second one concerns the choice between walking and standing on escalators. To calibrate our hypothesized walking and choice models, observations were conducted in the NS intercity train station of Den Haag Holland Spoor on the 1 st of June, 2005 (Wednesday) with a combined technique of infrared detectors and video cameras. 6 infrared detectors were installed to observe trajectories of individual pedestrians while 2 video cameras were used to observe personal characteristics such as gender and age of passengers. Observation data from these two sources will be jointed to allow analysis of pedestrian behavior taking into account their personal characteristics. The observations lasted {{for a period of}} 3. 5 hours without interruption (15 : 40 19 : 10). However, no congestion had been observed. Prior to utilizing the infrared and video data for analysis, some preparatory works had been performed. These preparatory works include: 9 ̆ 5 Convert infrared trajectory data from “pixel” to “cm”, which involves correction for both lens and perspective distortion; 9 ̆ 5 Match split trajectories within one field of view (infrared detector); 9 ̆ 5 Combine infrared trajectory data and personal characteristics read from video films; 9 ̆ 5 Correct (infrared) flow data based on video reading. Our analysis of free speeds show that free speeds are influenced by directions of movement, types of infrastructure, and personal characteristics of pedestrians, namely, gender and age. The free speeds found on stairways are about 0. 77 m/s and 0. 68 m/s in the descending and the ascending direction respectively; those on escalators are about 0. 88 m/s and 0. 82 m/s in the descending and ascending direction respectively. Besides, in average, male passengers walk faster than female ones; Moreover, in general, free speeds decrease with age. Our findings concerning the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flows are quite limited due to the small variation of traffic conditions observed. During our observations, the highest flows observed on stairways are 0. 86 P/ms and 0. 18 P/ms in the descending and ascending direction respectively, while those on escalators are 0. 93 P/ms and 0. 67 P/ms in the descending and ascending direction respectively. With respect to the choice behavior between stairways and escalators, binary logit models are applied for the model formulation. Based on the choice situations at the observation site, factors influencing the choice behavior may include travel time, physical effort, safety and comfort, personal characteristics of pedestrians, and vicinity. However, due to the incomplete travel information observed, simplified route networks are proposed for the analysis. In addition, only factors of travel time, physical effort, safety and comfort, and personal characteristic are considered in the utility functions. Our estimated results indicate a weak explanatory power of our hypothesized choice models. Possible explanations include the exclusion of influencing factors such as time pressure and vicinity, incomplete travel time information, possible bias caused by the algorithms applied for the estimation of alternative travel time. In regard to the walk/stand choice behaviour on escalators, our study in this report is limited to the discussion about choice availability and influencing factors. The availability of the walk/stand choice may be determined by the distribution of standing passengers on escalators particularly those near to the entry. In addition, the main factors influencing this stand/walk choice on escalators may include physical effort, travel time and time pressure. Finally, our investigation on pedestrian observations with infrared detectors shows that large amount of trajectory data can be observed and extracted automatically with existing program. Besides, our algorithms applied to correct trajectory data and the method used to join infrared and video data provide satisfactory results. Thus we conclude that the application of infrared detectors on pedestrian observations is promising. However, further studies should be performed to evaluate the accuracy of the detection outcomes and to develop algorithms to match trajectories across different fields of view to expand its possible application on pedestrian study.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at demonstrating the {{feasibility}} of using recent software development techniques based on distributed agent technologies to develop a decentralised multi-agent traffic signal control system. The motivation for this work stemmed from {{a recognition of the}} limitations of existing traffic signal control methodologies and an acknowledgement that traffic control is a large-scale, complex, dynamic problem with highly nonlinear characteristics. A review of existing systems revealed a number of challenges and limitations and showed that the majority operated principally on pre-defined plans which were suitable only for pre-determined situations. As a result, they failed to control unexpected conditions when traffic flows changed rapidly. The performance of existing systems was also found to suffer during over-saturated conditions and the main challenge in this thesis was formulated as the need to shift from controlling near-saturated conditions to the requirement for traffic control during over-saturated conditions. This thesis adopted a traffic simulation approach for the evaluation of the proposed multi-agent traffic control system. It also introduced a number of contributions in the calibration and validation process using techniques for queue discharge headways collected from a field survey in addition to comparing the intersection performance measures obtained from the traffic simulator with those obtained from the well-known traffic signal optimisation tools such as the aaSIDRA software. The calibrated parameters were also evaluated and verified using macroscopic traffic flow theory which showed that the flow-density, <b>speed-density</b> and speed-flow <b>relationships</b> can be adequately reproduced using the calibrated and chosen parameters. The calibration and validation results showed overall model errors in the range of 10 to 14 percent, which was a very good result that provided a high level of confidence in the ability of the model to reproduce field conditions. In the multi-agent traffic signal control system, each traffic signal controller was modelled as an agent software and was equipped with two optimisation models: a signal timing optimisation model called Cycle Optimiser and a traffic signal coordination algorithm called Offset Optimiser. The agents were modelled as distributed systems with ability to collaborate and coordinate activities to achieve local and global goals. Each agent (intersection) was comprised of knowledge about intersection parameters, and had the abilities to generate the optimal control plans and collaborate with other agents through a traffic signal optimisation model. Each agent was also assigned a set of individual preferences or settings including objectives, a set of pre-determined plans and algorithms to generate plans. Each control agent received traffic flow data {{at the end of every}} cycle from vehicle loop detectors at the intersections stop line and also received vehicle occupancy data from the same loops at the beginning of the cycle. Traffic flow data was then used by the signal optimisation model to generate the control plans based on real-time traffic conditions. The multi-agent control strategy was comparatively evaluated with a fixed time control system under two traffic conditions: recurring and non-recurring congestion. It was shown to be superior to fixed time control systems for isolated intersections. It increased the intersection flows by 11. 64 percent and increased the travelling speed by 23. 23 percent. In addition, it also reduced the number of stops by 43. 36 percent and consequently reduced the intersection delay by 44. 15 percent. The agent control system was also superior to fixed time control systems for coordinated intersections. It resulted in increasing the network flows by 5. 05 percent and average travel speeds by 5. 57 percent compared with a coordinated fixed time system. During incident conditions, it was also superior to fixed time control systems. Its performance was further enhanced by providing mid-block detectors. For minor incident cases, these benefits included increases of 3. 64 and 4. 14 percent in traffic flows and average speeds, respectively. These were accompanied by decreases of 10. 50 and 11. 70 percent in average delays and queue lengths, respectively. A comparative evaluation between the agent control system and SCATS-generated signal timing plans for a case study in Bandung, Indonesia, showed that for the AM peak, an unsupervised agent-based controller increased the overall network flows by 2. 85 percent and the average travel speed by 3. 23 percent. It also reduced the number of stops by 2. 21 percent and the network delays by 4. 84 percent, compared with the SCATS plans. Overall, the multi-agent control system was shown to reduce the average delay on the network by at least 25. 74 percent when compared with the SCATS plans. The benefits were larger at 28. 33 percent when the SCATS plans were compared with a coordinated multi-agent traffic signal control system. These combined findings clearly demonstrate the potential of agent-based traffic signal control systems in enhancing performance, reducing congestion and improving environmental air quality. This thesis has successfully achieved its stated objectives by demonstrating the feasibility of applying distributed systems of multi-agent algorithms to traffic signal control and by evaluating its performance and comparing it to optimised fixed-time control systems under recurring and non-recurring (incident) traffic conditions using microscopic traffic simulation tools. The study also successfully achieved a number of secondary objectives including advancing the state of knowledge in the calibration and validation of traffic simulation models; enhancing the procedures for signal coordination; improving the methods for reliable demand prediction and forecasting; and formulating general methodologies and frameworks that can be used for evaluating the performance of Intelligent Transport Systems. Finally, the thesis identified a number of issues as potential research areas in this field. These included the potential to improve the accuracy of the algorithm using additional real-time data such as vehicle occupancy from loop detectors; the need to use artificial intelligence approaches based on neural networks for speed estimation and short-term traffic forecasting; interfacing the agent system to an automated incident detection algorithm so that non-recurring congestion is more easily identified, and broadening the coverage of the road networks, testing a much large number of intersections and testing the computational efficiency of the multi-agent traffic signal control systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} diagram, as the {{graphical representation}} of the relationships among traffic flow, speed, and density, has been the foundation of traffic flow theory and transportation engineering. 75 years after the seminal Greenshields model, a variety of models have been proposed to mathematically represent the <b>speed-density</b> <b>relationship</b> which underlies the fundamental diagram. Observed in these models was a clear path toward two competing goals: mathematical elegance and empirical accuracy. As the latest development of such a pursuit, this paper presents a family of speed-density models with varying numbers of parameters. All of these models perform satisfactorily and have physically meaningful parameters. In addition, speed variation with traffic density is accounted for; this enables statistical approaches to traffic flow analysis. The results of this paper not only improve our understanding of traffic flow but also provide a sound basis for transportation engineering studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{continuum}} {{model that}} describes a disordered, heterogeneous traffic stream is presented. Such systems are widely prevalent {{in developing countries}} where classical traffic models cannot be readily applied. The characteristics of such systems are unique since drivers of smaller vehicles exploit their maneuverability to move ahead through lateral gaps at lower speeds. At higher speeds, larger vehicles press their advantage of greater motive power. The traffic stream at the microscopic level is disordered and defines a porous medium. Each vehicle is considered to move {{through a series of}} pores defined by other vehicles. A <b>speed-density</b> <b>relationship</b> that explicitly considers the pore space distribution is presented. This captures the considerable dynamics between vehicle classes that are overlooked when all classes are converted to a reference class (usually Passenger Car Equivalents) as is traditionally done. Using a finite difference approximation scheme, traffic evolution for a two-class traffic stream is shown...|$|E
