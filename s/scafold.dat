40|$|Mucor pepsin, a {{protease}} used in milk coagulation, is purified by ion-exchange and by molecular exclusion on Sephadex G 100. The {{molecular weight}} (MW) {{is determined by}} polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by molecular exclusion chromatography. Approximate evaluation of molecular mass was conducted by elution of known MW proteins (BSA: 67 kDa, pepsin: 35 kDa and trypsin: 23. 8 kDa) on Sepha-dex G- 100 under the same conditions as the experimental sample. The electrophoretic profile shows that the active fraction studied appears as a single homogeneous band (monomeric form). According to the curve calibration, the molecular mass of the coagulant fraction is about 48 kDa. For Mucor, the observed MW value seems to be enigmatic. However, this result is confirmed by a proteomic analysis with close MW values obtained using conventional techniques. The protease studied by the <b>Scafold</b> ver.

40|$|Decellularization and cellularization {{of organs}} {{have emerged as}} {{disruptive}} methods in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Porous hydrogel scaffolds have widespread applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and drug discovery as viable tissue mimics. However, the existing hydrogel fabrication techniques suffer from limited control over pore interconnectivity, density and size, which leads to inefficient nutrient and oxygen transport to cells embedded in the scaffolds. Here, we demonstrated an innovative approach {{to develop a new}} platform for tissue engineered constructs using live bacteria as sacrificial porogens. E. coli were patterned and cultured in an interconnected three-dimensional (3 D) hydrogel network. The growing bacteria created interconnected micropores and microchannels. Then, the <b>scafold</b> was decellularized, and bacteria were eliminated from the scaffold through lysing and washing steps. This 3 D porous network method combined with bioprinting {{has the potential to be}} broadly applicable and compatible with tissue specific applications allowing seeding of stem cells and other cell types.

40|$|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear {{polysaccharide}} chains which, {{with the}} excepton of Hyaluronan, are covalently {{linked to a}} core protein to assemble a more complex molecule called Proteoglycan (PG). GAGs/PGs are involved in several physiological and pathological processes being among the major consttuents of the Extracellular Matrix. Regarding {{their role in the}} Peripheral Nervous System, GAGs/PGs-mediated interactons partcipate in proliferaton, synaptogenesis, neural plastcity and regeneraton. Generally PNS nerve fbers have a remarkable ability to regenerate, leading to an almost complete recovery of normal functon and this process is governed by glial cells known as Schwann cells, by their unusual capacity to metamorphose into cells driving the healing process. However, postraumatc nerve repair contnues to be a major challenge in restoratve medicine and micro-surgery.

40|$|Yersinia enterocolitica is {{a common}} cause of acute gastroenteritis. In order to clarify the {{mechanisms}} leading to diarrhea and barrier dysfunction the pathomechanisms of this infection were studied in detail. Exposure of human colonic HT- 29 /B 6 cells to Y. enterocolitica resulted in a decrease in transepithelial resistance (Rt, TER) with a parallel increase in mannitol (182 Da) and fluorescein (332 Da) permeability. Active ion transport measured as short circuit current was unchanged. The Y. enterocolitica induced changes were time-dependent, required the presence of living bacteria, could not be triggered by bacterial supernatants, and were not due to Yersinia invasin or expression from the virulence plasmid pYV. Concomitantly, Y. enterocolitica induced necrosis as indicated {{by an increase in}} LDH-release, while epithelial apoptosis was not upregulated. Local changes in conductivity were detected by conductance scanning, indicating leaky regions within the epithelium which were visualized by biotinylation and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In these regions, sealing claudin- 3, - 4 and - 8 were redistributed off the tight junction into the cytoplasm. In addition, the expression of claudin- 2, - 3, - 8, - 10 and ZO- 1 was diminished as quantified by immunoblotting. Moreover, claudin- 8 protein expression was found to be regulated via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, the inhibition of which partially prevented the Y. enterocolitica induced decrease in Rt and restored claudin- 8 protein level. In conclusion, barrier dysfunction in Y. enterocolitica infection is due to circumscribed epithelial tight junction protein changes and necrotic cell loss. As a consequence leak flux diarrhea and antigen-uptake may be triggered in human infection. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a probiotic bacterium used for the treatment of inflam-matory bowel disorders. To study its barrier strengthening mechanisms the in vitro effect of highly active EcN supernatant (EcNK) on tight junction mediated barrier function was assessed here using the HT- 29 /B 6 cell culture model. EcNK dissected from bacterial culture, improved barrier function measured by a two-fold increase in Rt and a reduction of permeability for mannitol and NaCl. This was not due to flagellin. Measurements by two-path-impedance spectroscopy revealed a strong effect on paracellular resistance. When changes of tight junction proteins as claudins, occludin, tricellulin as well as the <b>scafold</b> protein ZO- 1 were examined, claudin- 14 was the only one found to be affected by EcNK. Claudin- 14 was elevated on protein- and mRNA-level. Heat treatment of active EcNK abolished the increase in Rt and the upregulation of claudin- 14 protein level. By silencing claudin- 14 in a siRNA-transfection assay, the sealing function of this so far less well characterized tight junction protein was confirmed. In conclusion, EcNK improves barrier function in HT- 29 /B 6 by upregulating claudin- 14...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{establish}} and develop innovative instructional procedures, in which scaffolding can be expanded and applied, {{in order to enhance}} learning of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing skills in an effective hybrid learning community (a combination of face-to-face and online modes of learning) at the university where the researcher is working. Many educational experts still believe that technology has not been harnessed to its potential to meet the new online characteristics and trends. There is also an urgency to reconsider the pedagogical perspectives involved in the utilisation of online learning systems in general and the social interactions within online courses in particular that have been neglected to date. An action research design, conducted in two cycles within a duration of four months, was utilised throughout this study. It was intended not only to achieve a paradigm shift from transmission-absorption to socio-constructivist teaching/learning methodologies but also to inform practice in these technology-rich environments. Five major findings emerged from the study. First, the scaffolding theory has been extended. Two new scaffolding types (i. e., quasi-transcendental scaffolding and transcendental <b>scafolding),</b> two scaffolding aspects (i. e., receptive and productive) and some scaffolding actions (e. g., providing a stimulus, awareness, reminder, or remedy) for EFL writing skills in an effective hybrid learning community have been identified and elaborated on. Second, the EFL ‘Effective Writing’ students used the scaffolds implemented in a hybrid environment to enhance and enrich their learning of writing of English essays. The online activities, conducted after the F 2 F sessions most of the time, gave students greater opportunities to both reinforce and expand the knowledge they had acquired in the F 2 F mode. Third, a variety of teaching techniques, different online tasks and discussion topics utilised in the two modes bolstered the students’ interests and engagement in their knowledge construction of how to compose English-language essays. Fourth, through the scaffolded activities, the students learned how to scaffold themselves and thus became independent learners in their future endeavours of constructing knowledge. Fifth, the scaffolding-to-scaffold activities provided the students with knowledge on how to effectively engage in transcendental scaffolding actions and facilitate the learning of English writing skills by less able peers within the learning community. Thus, the findings of this current study extended earlier understandings of scaffolding in an EFL hybrid learning environment and will contribute to the advancement of future ICT-mediated courses in terms of their scaffolding pedagogical aspects...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho está inserido em uma linha investigava que, pautada em uma abordagem cognitivista da aprendizagem, procura compreender como a fala, nas situações de ensino, têm impacto sobre o processo de aprendizagem dos alunos. Tendo como recorte as questões propostas pelo {{professor}} em aulas expositivo-participativas e as suas reações às respostas dos alunos, esta investigação procurou responder a duas questões: a) Como a análise da interação professor-aluno em aula expositivo-participativa possibilita que se identifiquem as oportunidades de aprendizagem oferecidas? b) Quais as variáveis envolvidas no processo que vai das intenções de ensino às oportunidades de aprendizagem oferecidas? Para proceder a esta análise, buscamos referências em: autores da psicologia sócio histórica a respeito da caracterização do processo de pensamento e da estrutura dos conhecimentos científicos((Petrovsky, 1980; Vygotsky, 1993); autores que, tendo como ponto de partida a psicologia sócio-histórica, têm desenvolvido conceitos e interpretações sobre as funções da fala em atividades de aprendizagem (Scott, 1998; Mercer, 1996; Wegerif et al, 1999); autores que tratam das formas de relação com o conhecimento tais como se materializam em sala de aula (Edwards, 1997). Este trabalho caracteriza-se como um estudo analítico-descritivo, de natureza qualitativa, apresentado sob a forma de um estudo de caso de um professor de Biologia. Os dados foram coletados por meio de observação e registro das aulas ministradas e entrevista com o professor. Os resultados indicam que a identificação das oportunidades de aprendizagem oferecidas pelo professor por meio de suas intervenções só podem ser compreendidas se articuladas as lógicas do conteúdo (estrutura dos conceitos científicos) e da interação (estrutura da participação, ou seja, as regras implícitas que regem a participação de alunos e professor no discurso em sala de aula). Estas oportunidades, muitas vezes, não correspondem àquelas idealizadas/ verbalizadas pelo professor pois, em seu processo de materialização em sala de aula, sofrem a influência de muitas variáveis, dentre elas as relacionadas à base de conhecimentos do professor para o ensino, tanto em termos de conhecimentos do âmbito específico, quanto do âmbito pedagógico. Uma correta articulação entre estes dois tipos de conhecimento podem levar a uma adequada articulação entre as intervenções do professor e os processos mentais que são necessários à elaboração de determinados conhecimentos científicos pelos alunos. Além disso, os resultados também demonstram a proficuidade de construções teóricas oriundas de conceitos como <b>scafolding</b> (Bruner et al, 1976, apud Scott, 1998) para a análise de situações concretas de interação professor-alunos em aulas expositivo-participativas. This work {{is inserted}} in an investigative line, {{guided by a}} cognitive learning framework, seeking to understand how speech, in the teaching environment, has impact upon the learning process of students. Using as outline suggested questions from the teacher in participative lectures and the reactions to the students responses, this investigation aimed to answer two questions: a) How does {{the analysis of the}} interaction teacher-student in participative lectures enable the identification of possible learning opportunities? b) Which are the variables involved in the process that go from the intentions in teaching practice, to the opportunities of learning offered? To proceed in this analysis, we have sought reference in social-historical psychology authors regarding the caracterization of the thought process and the structure of scientific knowledge (Petrovsky, 1980; Vygostky, 1993); authors who, using as a starting point social-historical psychology, have developed concepts and interpretations on the functions of speech in learning activities (Scott, 1998; Mercer, 1996; Wegerif et al, 1999); authors who deal with forms of relationship in regard to knowledge, as they materialize in the teaching environment (Edwards, 1997). This work is characterized as a descriptive-analytic study of a biology teacher; of qualitative nature, presented in case study format. The data was collected thru means of observation and registry of given lectures as well as an interview with the teacher. Results indicate that the identification of learning opportunities offered by the teacher, by means of interventions, can only be comprehended if articulated to the logics of context (structure of scientific concepts) and interaction (structure of participation, that is, the implied rules that guide the students and teachers participation in their speech during class). These opportunities sometimes dont correspond to the ones idealized /verbalized by the teacher, as they suffer influence of many variables in the process of materialization in class. Among these are the ones related to the basis of knowledge of the teacher in teaching skills, in terms of knowledge of a specific area {{as well as in the}} pedagogic area. A correct articulation between the two types of knowledge can enable a more adequate one between the teachers interventions and the mental processes necessary to the elaboration of certain scientific knowledge by the students. Beyond that, results also show the utility of theoretical structures, deriving from concepts such as <b>scafolding</b> (Bruner et al, 1976, apud Scott, 1998) for the analysis of concrete situations in teacher-student interaction during participative lectures...|$|R
