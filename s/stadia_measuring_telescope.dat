40|$|One of {{the science}} goals of NASA's Navigator program is {{ground-based}} narrow-angle astrometry for extra-solar planet detection, which could be done {{as part of the}} proposed Outrigger Telescopes Project. The narrow-angle measurement process, which would use the outrigger telescopes, starts with the determination of the conventional interferometer astrometric baseline, determined from wide-angle astrometry of Hipparcos stars. A baseline monitor system would be employed at each outrigger telescope. This system monitors the pivot point of each telescope - the end point of the astrometric baseline - to <b>measure</b> <b>telescope</b> imperfections that would cause the baseline to vary with telescope rotation. The baseline monitor includes azimuth and elevation cameras that monitor runout along the azimuth and elevation axes of the telescopes. In conjunction with the baseline monitor system, a pivot monitor camera in the dual-star module is used to register the laser metrology corner-cube reflector to the telescope pivot, tying the narrow-angle baseline, which applies to the narrow-angle astrometric measurement, to the wide-angle baseline. In this paper we present the proposed designs for the baseline monitor and pivot-point camera...|$|R
