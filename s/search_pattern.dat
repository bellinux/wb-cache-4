Unlike the towfish, the AUVs were self-propelled and could manoeuvre themselves to maintain a constant altitude above the seafloor. When launched, the torpedo-shaped AUV dived to the proper altitude, then followed a pre-programmed <b>search</b> <b>pattern</b> for up to 24 hours, collecting sonar data for up to 24hours; when the mission was complete, the AUV surfaced and was recovered by the vessel, where the data was downloaded and the batteries were swapped for the next mission. The AUVs were used to scan areas {{which could not be}} effectively searched by the towfish on the other three vessels. Because of the difficultly in operating the AUV during the austral winter months due to sea conditions, the AUV operations were suspended during the austral winter months.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the area}} shift {{measurement}} {{is to find the}} coordinates (location) of the <b>searched</b> <b>pattern</b> of one two-dimensional sequence in the second two-dimensional sequence. It is supposed that <b>searched</b> <b>pattern</b> is included in the searched sequence in the unknown location. As it was published in [3], it is possible to determine the area shift using either the correlation or difference method. The calculations using the definition equations of the correlation or difference method are very severe. This contribution shows how it is possible to significantly decrease needed amount of the calculation operations when appropriate characteristics of the compared two-dimensional sequences are used. The method, which uses histogram comparison, allows eliminating up to 90 % of the <b>searched</b> <b>patterns</b> from the calculations that use the definition equations. The method that uses the comparison of the mean values of the <b>searched</b> <b>pattern</b> segments reaches even better results. It can eliminate up to 99. 9 % of the <b>searched</b> <b>patterns.</b> Both new eliminating methods significantly contribute to acceleration of the area shift calculation...|$|R

2500|$|As Autolycus {{detected}} fumes {{from the}} submarine, {{rather than the}} hull, it could detect {{the passage of a}} submarine for some time after it had passed. This aided searching, as it did not need to pass directly overhead. [...] A zig-zag <b>search</b> <b>pattern</b> was flown, passing at right-angles over the likely direction of submarine movements. When an exhaust plume was detected, the aircraft would begin to fly a tracking pattern of progressively shorter zig-zags. Each crossing of the plume trail would be plotted, giving a map plot of the submarine's likely track. As the track was narrowed down, the aircraft would switch sensors to a more precise method, such as centimetric radar or dropping sonobuoys before potentially closing for an attack.|$|E

40|$|Block-matching motion {{estimation}} {{plays an important}} role in real-time video compression and thus has significant impact on searching speed and quality of performance. In order to address these issues, we introduce a highly efficient block {{motion estimation}} algorithm, referred to as a predictive cross-hexagon search (PCHS) algorithm, that can considerably reduce the complexity of the Joint Video Team (JVT) encoder. In contrast to many classical fast motion estimation algorithms, PCHS has three desirable features: (1) prediction of a search center, (2) usage of <b>search</b> <b>patterns</b> with different sizes, and (3) early algorithm termination that makes it adaptive and effective. We set four predictor candidates for initial search point options and then increase the accuracy of the predictor. The different-size <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> including small cross <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> hexagon <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> and cross-hexagon <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> used in the searching process can better suit more motion types. Due to the high accuracy of the predictor, the proposed algorithm adapts early termination; as the predictor is good enough, the search stops early. Therefore, the PCHS algorithm is suitable for real-time video encoding, as it can speed up the encoder without sacrificing performance compared with other fast algorithms. (C) 2009 SPIE and IS&T.

40|$|International audienceComputing the {{semantic}} similarity between terms (or short text expressions) {{that have the}} same meaning but which are not lexicographically similar is an important challenge in the information integration field.

In this paper, we try {{to solve this problem}} by determining {{the semantic}} similarity for terms using the knowledge inherent in the search history logs from the Google search engine. To do this, we have designed and evaluated four algorithmic methods for measuring the semantic similarity between terms using their associated history <b>search</b> <b>patterns.</b> These algorithmic methods are: a) frequent co-occurrence of terms in <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> b) computation of the relationship between <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> c) outlier coincidence on <b>search</b> <b>patterns,</b> and d) forecasting comparisons.

The participants watched and judged three dressage tests lasting approximately five minutes each whilst wearing the ASL 501 eye tracking device which recorded their eye gaze onto a video camera.

Therefore, {{more research is needed to}} explore the similarities of varying levels of expertise within sport to help develop and recognise what novice and intermediate judges or coaches need to improve to reach an elite standard and also to see if there are similarities or differences between elite performers, coaches and judges...|$|R
