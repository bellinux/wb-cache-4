40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} topographic and geological surveys carried out {{at the site of}} Uşaklı Höyük (Turkey) in order to produce new detailed maps on a scale of 1 : 10, 000 for supporting archaeological investigations and providing good reference cartography during fieldwork. The topographic map was created from the <b>stereorestitution</b> of a GeoEye- 1 bundle satellite stereopair, 0. 5 m pan-sharpened imagery covering an area of about 100 km². This map was utilized for the geological survey, for the archaeological interpretation of the palaeo-environmental evolution of the site which bases on the present geomorphologic setting, and for the reconstruction of possible travelling paths within a central region of the Hittite empire. The aerial triangulation of satellite images, performed using ground control points measured specifically by means of differential GPS surveys, allowed the stereoscopic visualization of the area and the creation of the digital terrain model and orthophotos. These results were a useful aid during the geological survey when all the outcrops were inspected and documented through additional in-depth field checks. The geological map has been created and refined using the digital terrain model and photointerpretation of stereo and orthoimageries, making it possible to fully identify the geological boundaries between formations and recognize geomorphological features...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} aid the archaeological {{researches}} at Melka Kunture prehistoric area (Ethiopia), a geological survey was carried out {{with the goal of}} producing the new geological map at the scale of 1 : 10, 000. In addition, the topographic map at the same scale was created from the <b>stereorestitution</b> of two couples of Standard Stereo IKONOS II, 1 m pan-sharpened, satellite imageries. The scenes cover an area of about 100 km² around the site and the produced topographic map was used as reference cartography. Rational Polynomial Coefficients allowed the images orientation, those accuracy was improved by the use of Ground Control Points measured through Differential GPS surveys. The images aerial triangulation allowed to create the Digital Elevation Model of the whole archaeological area and consequently to produce the orthophotomap. Additionally, following to the CORINE Land Cover Nomenclature, this image was used to classify the area land use that was mapped into the topographic sheet. Concerning the geology, the area was object of detailed studies as testified by more than 170 geological stops that were executed in the most representative outcrops. Each of them was characterised by accurate description tables, panoramic and detailed pictures and by the measurement of 3 D coordinates. During fieldwork activities also more than 80 rock samples were collected for petrographic and micropalaeontological analyses. Geological mapping was supported by the study of the Digital Elevation Model and the photointerpretation of stereo- and ortho-images that allowed also to identify the most evident geomorphological and structural features. According to the reference system of the Ethiopian 1 : 50, 000 topographic maps, the produced data was projected into the national UTM coordinate system (Spheroid Clarke 1880 - Datum Adindan - Zone 37 N) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{architectural}} surveys, {{the purpose}} of measuring is to individuate {{a finite number of}} significant points that significantly approximates the continuity of the real object, and which can be used to reconstruct a simplified geometric model. The choice of which points to survey is a sensitive procedure, to be performed during the planning of the survey by individuals capable of interpreting the object for its qualitative complexity. The reason for the existence of a form may have roots that are, to cite a few, geometric, perceptual, structural,or functional. The surveyors must, therefore, develop a critical reading of the building that draws from all the sciences and disciplines concerning architecture. They must also hypothesize a plausible model for the object understudy, and use measurement as a means for verifying the hypothesis. The introduction of new computer technology has some what inverted this process. The <b>stereorestitution</b> of digital images and three-dimensional laser scans currently makesit possible to capture an intermediate model that lies between the real objectand the geometric model, without there being any need to fully understand the object before commencing its survey. The study of the geometry of an object can be conducted using this intermediate model to advantage by working with the analytical tools provided by computer processing. This course of study is still open to exploration. The application presented here was conducted by the photogrammetry laboratory ofthe RA. D. A. A. R (Rilievo Analisi eDisegno dell'Ambiente e dell'Architettura) department of the University of Rome La Sapienza, and directed by Professor Mario Docci. It is part of a more comprehensive research project, coordinated by Professor Riccardo Migliari, which aims to define a methodology for architectural surveying using 3 D laser scanning and software specific to the analysis of virtual models, in all senses of the word. The architectural object of this sample survey is the intrados of the Pantheon's cupola...|$|E
