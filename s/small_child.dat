5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a <b>small</b> <b>child</b> {{indicate}} {{that she had}} blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.|$|E
50|$|Professor of Paediatrics Trond Markestad {{argues that}} it is better for <b>small</b> <b>children</b> that their mothers have the primary {{responsibility}} for caring for them.

30|$|As to {{the effect}} of children, we find that having <b>small</b> <b>children</b> has a {{positive}} impact on the choice of self-employment versus wage-employment for Spanish women coming from non-employment, and negative for previously employed women. For Danish women we find the opposite although non-significant effect. In terms of the estimated probabilities, the probability of entering into self-employment from non-employment for a Spanish women with <b>small</b> <b>children</b> is about 12 p.p larger than for women without <b>small</b> <b>children.</b> These results are consistent with the fact that marginalized groups in the labor market, in this case non-employed mothers with <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> are more likely to enter self-employment in Spain, while in Denmark this {{does not seem to be}} the case. For women coming from wage-employment we find that the effect of <b>small</b> <b>children</b> is positive for Danish and negative, although non-significant, for Spanish women. In terms of the estimated probabilities we find that having <b>small</b> <b>children</b> increases the probability of switching from wage-employment by approximately 2.5 p.p. for Danish women and decreases about 1 p.p. for Spanish ones. Therefore, our results do not seem to support the hypothesis that self-employment is used as a work arrangement to better balance family and work for those women who already have a wage-employment.|$|R

5|$|Karl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), {{died as a}} <b>small</b> <b>child.</b> The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), {{married in}} 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of {{the third and fourth}} princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but {{died at the age of}} 15 years. The other {{children}} of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ramelton, Ireland, Gallaher {{migrated}} to New Zealand {{with his family}} as a <b>small</b> <b>child.</b> After moving to Auckland, in 1895 he joined Ponsonby RFC and was selected for his province in 1896. In 1901–02 he served with the New Zealand Contingent in the Anglo-Boer War. He first appeared on the New Zealand national team for their unbeaten tour of Australia in 1903, and played in New Zealand's first ever test match, against Australia in Sydney. The Originals Gallaher captained during 1905–06 helped to cement rugby as New Zealand's national sport, but he was relentlessly pilloried by the British press {{for his role as}} wing-forward. The use of a wing-forward, which critics felt was a tactic to deliberately obstruct opponents, contributed to decades of strain between the rugby authorities of New Zealand and the Home Nations; the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) effectively outlawed the position in 1931.|$|E

Additionally, the music video showcases scenes of Carey singing by a large church choir in a foyer, as well as several people, ranging from a <b>small</b> <b>child</b> to an elderly man, who are alone and depressed.

5|$|The {{stories of}} Cú Chulainn's {{childhood}} are told in a flashback sequence in Táin Bó Cúailnge. As a <b>small</b> <b>child,</b> {{living in his}} parents' house on Muirthemne Plain, he begs {{to be allowed to}} join the boy-troop at Emain Macha. However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, but he has a ríastrad and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a <b>small</b> <b>child</b> to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E

25|$|The first coins {{produced}} by the Geto-Dacians were imitations of silver coins of the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander III (the Great).
