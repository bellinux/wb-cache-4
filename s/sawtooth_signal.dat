40|$|In {{this report}} a new method for {{measuring}} velocities has been introduced. During {{the research in}} literature an overview {{has been made of}} the existing methods of measuring velocities. From this research, it can be concluded that a lot of existing approaches only work in specific settings. Besides this, it can be concluded that the proposed new method does not exist yet. The proposed method has been explained in theory and it has been theorized that this new method is not influenced by at least one dominant error source, namely the phase errors in the encoder. In addition, a calibration method has been introduced that makes it possible to use the proposed method accurately. This method works independent of measurement errors near the peaks of the encoder signals, like for example errors caused by saturation of the light sensors inside an encoder. In addition {{it has been shown that}} the proposed methods can be easily adapted to work with <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signals</b> instead of sinusoidal signals. This eliminates the errors caused by waveform distortion that used to be present when encoders are used that output <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signals.</b> And finally it has been theorized that misalignments of the encoder slits no longer influence the velocity measurement. Simulation and experiments using the proposed methods confirm that measuring the velocity by differentiation of the separate encoder channels is possible. It has also been shown that the sampling frequency limits the maximum velocity, because the differentiation of an encoder channel becomes inaccurate when insufficient samples are available per increment. In addition it has been shown that quick changes in the velocity do not influence the accuracy of the measurement. It has also been shown that for <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signals,</b> it is now possible to measure velocity without being disturbed by this waveform distortion. This made it possible to measure the velocity with a 100 slits analog encoder with about the same accuracy as with a high resolution TTL encoder (which measures 80000 counts per rotation) ...|$|R

In the HOLMES experiment this is based on inductively coupled rf-SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices) fed by TES (Transition Edge Sensors). Biasing of the whole rf-SQUID chain is provided with a single transmission line by means of the recently introduced flux-ramp modulation technique, a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signal</b> which allows signal reconstruction while operating the rf-SQUIDs in open loop condition. Due to the crucial role of the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signal,</b> {{it is very important that}} it does not suffer from ground loop disturbances and EMI. Introducing a transformer between the biasing source and the SQUIDs is very effective in suppressing disturbances. The <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signal</b> has slow and fast components, and the period can vary between a few kHz up to MHz depending on the TES signal and SQUID characteristics. A transformer able to face such a broad range of conditions must have very stringent characteristics and needs to be custom designed.

40|$|Ionic polymer metal {{composite}} (IPMC) is used {{in various}} bio-inspired systems, such as fish and tadpole-like robots swimming in water. The deflection of this smart material results from several internal and external factors, such as water distribution and surface conductivity. IPMC strips {{with a variety of}} water concentration on the surfaces and surface conductivity show various deflection patterns. Even without any external excitation, the strips can bend due to non-uniform water distribution. On the other hand, {{in order to understand the}} effects of surface conductivity in an aquatic environment, an IPMC strip with two wires connected to two distinct spots was used to demonstrate the power loss due to the surface resistance. Three types of input <b>signals,</b> <b>sawtooth,</b> sinusoidal, and square waves, were used to compare the difference between the input and output signals measured at the two spots. Thick (1 -mm) IPMC strips were fabricated and employed in this research to sustain and drive the robot with sufficient forces. Furthermore, in order to predict and control the deflection, researchers developed the appropriate mathematical models. The special working principle, related to internal mobile cations with water molecules, however, makes the system complicated to be modeled and simulated. An IPMC strip can be modeled as a cantilever beam with loading distribution on the surface. Nevertheless, the loading distribution is non-uniform due to the non-perfect surface metallic plating, and four different kinds of imaginary loading distribution are employed in this model. On the other hand, a reverse-predicted method is used to find out the transfer function of the IPMC system according to the measured deflection and the corresponding input voltage. Several system-identification structures, such as autoregressive moving average with exogenous (ARX/ARMAX), output-error (OE), Box-Jenkins (BJ), and prediction-error minimization (PEM) models, are used to model the system with their specific mathematic principles. Finally, a novel linear time-variant (LTV) concept and method is introduced and applied to simulate an IPMC system. This kind of model is different from the previous linear time-invariant (LTI) models because the IPMC internal environment may be unsteady, such as free cations with water molecules. This phenomenon causes the variation of each internal part. In addition, the relationship between the thickness of IPMC strips and the deflection can be obtained by this concept.

40|$|Flow control {{can lead}} to saving {{millions}} of dollars in fuel costs each year by making an aircraft more efficient. Synthetic jets, a device for active flow control, operate by introducing small amounts of energy locally to achieve non-local changes in the flow field with large performance gains. These devices consist of a cavity with an oscillating diaphragm that divides it, into active and passive sides. The active side has a small opening where a jet is formed, whereas and the passive side does not directly participate in the fluidic jet. Research has shown that the synthetic jet behavior is dependent on the diaphragm and the cavity design hence, the focus of this work. The performance of the synthetic jet is studied under various factors related to the diaphragm and the cavity geometry. Four diaphragms, manufactured from piezoelectric composites, were selected for this study, Bimorph, Thunder®, Lipca and RFD. The overall factors considered are the driving signals, voltage, frequency, cavity height, orifice size, and passive cavity pressure. Using the average maximum jet velocity as the response variable, these factors are individually studied for each actuator and statistical analysis tools were used to select the relevant factors in the response variable. For all diaphragms, the driving signal was found {{to be the most important}} factor, with the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signal</b> producing significantly higher velocities than the sine signal. Cavity dimensions also proved to be relevant factors when considering the designing of a synthetic jet actuator. The cavities with the smaller orifice produced lower velocities than those with larger orifices and the cavities with smaller volumes followed the same trend. Although there exist a relationship between cavity height and orifice size, the orifice size appears as the dominant factor. Driving frequency of the diaphragm was the only common factor to all diaphragms studied that was not statistically significant having a small effect on jet velocity. However along with waveform, it had a combined effect on jet velocity for all actuators. With the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>signal,</b> the velocity remained constant after a particular low frequency, thus indicating that the synthetic jet cavity could be saturated and the flow choked. No such saturation point was reached with the sine signal, for the frequencies tested. Passive cavity pressure seemed to have a positive effect on the jet velocity up to a particular pressure characteristic of the diaphragm, beyond which the pressure had an adverse effect. For Thunder® and Lipca, the passive cavity pressure that produced a peak was measured at approximately 20 and 18 kPa respectively independent of the waveform utilized. For a Bimorph and RFD, this effect was not observed. Linear models for all actuators with the factors found to be statistically significant were developed. These models should lead to further design improvements of synthetic jets...|$|E
