40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{explored}} {{the use of}} electronic monitoring (EM) in the shallow and deep set components of the Hawaiian pelagic longline fishery. EM systems, consisting of closed circuit television cameras, sensors (e. g., GPS, hydraulic pressure and winch rotation) and a <b>system</b> <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> were deployed on three vessels, simultaneously monitored with observers, for a collective total of about 320 sea days, 13 fishing trips and 182 fishing events. Overall, the equipment performed well, recording data for 99. 2 % of the time vessels were at sea. A key strength of EM is the continuous sensor data record providing very accurate temporal and spatial information on gear setting and retrieval activities. EM image reviewers were also able to reliably detect hooks deployed and retained catch. About 40 % of the discard catch was not detected by EM image reviewers, because discard releases occurred outside the camera view. Overall, EM species identifications were more general than by observers and most common species were identified from EM imagery. Detection of protected species by EM and observers was similar, with both detecting all sea turtles encountered and each missing one of three caught. The shortcomings of EM for discard detection could be addressed by improvements to camera placements and harmonizing crew activities with the technology...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of gaseous {{compounds}} and particulate matter {{are the product}} of the pollutant concentrations and air exhausted from the fans of mechanically ventilated animal confinement buildings. Direct methods of monitoring exhaust fan operation (i. e., mercury tilt, limit or whisker, and vibration switches) have been reported to have limitations due to mechanical failure and/or the effect of the environment (dust, wind, moisture). Another method involves monitoring the control relay status at the fan <b>system</b> <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> A problem could occur at the fan but not in the signal at the control box, thereby giving a false operational signal. The objective of this project was to find a more reliable method of monitoring fan operation status. This paper describes the development, lab testing, and use of a fan monitoring system based on induction operated current switches (ICS). ICSs are unaffected by the environment and can provide direct measurement of real-time fan operational status by sensing AC current. A laboratory test of the ICS was performed to simulate a fan off/on duty cycle in a two-year emissions study; no ICS failure was recorded. The Southeastern Broiler Gaseous and Particulate Matter Emission study led by Iowa State University has been using 28 ICSs for over 190 days without a failure. At a unit cost as low as $ 19. 50 this method offers a reliable, accurate, and economical way of measuring the real-time operational status of ventilation fans – a critical component of any air emissions monitoring in a mechanically ventilated confinement system...|$|E

40|$|LNG is the {{abbreviation}} for liquefied natural gas, which {{is recognized as}} one of the world’s clean energies. LNG is one product at natural gas that through purification and ultra-low temperature is liquefied. The liquefied natural gas is very suitable for LNG transportation by a truck. China is a big country rich in natural resources. The use of natural gas is in favor of Chinese energy structure adjustment. It has important strategic significance to improve the ecological environment and the quality of people’s lives. A LNG carrier vehicle is a cryogenic liquid tanker truck used to transport liquefied natural gas in an ultra-low temperature environment. Because LNG is flammable, explosive, and cryogenic and so on, it is very important the safety design of LNG carrier vehicle demanded in the road transport safety. LNG carrier vehicles usually consist of LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks, trailer running gears, piping <b>systems,</b> a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> and other components. Among them prone to accidents are mainly LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks and safety accessories. This paper dealt with the safety design research to these two systems.

40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} seed {{metering unit}} {{was designed and}} mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as seed metering shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and seed metering shaft and (c) a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> the designed <b>control</b> <b>box</b> regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of seed metering shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated seed metering unit (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the grain drill and equipped grain drill with common seed metering unit (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of grain drill (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the grain drill for DSW. Using the FSMU reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) by approximately 50 %. Consequently, applying the FSMU on the common grain drill led to a desirable seeding rate at different forward speeds of the grain drill and stubble existence...|$|R

50|$|Solid-state {{controls}} {{are used in}} gas and electric applications at the high range of the performance and cost spectrum. Composed of two parts, the sensor probe and the <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> solid state thermostats are the most precise control available for griddle operation. The probe consists of two thermocouple wires mounted in a protective capillary tube body that is mounted (typically threaded) into the griddle plate material at a location {{near the center of}} the heating element being controlled. When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner <b>system.</b> This <b>control</b> <b>system</b> can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and Snap Action thermostats.

This instrument {{consists of a}} monocular indirect ophthalmoscopic delivery <b>system,</b> a beam <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> a standard slit-lamp delivery system and a changeover switch. The characteristics of this photocoagulator are as follows: a easier application, better viewing of whole fundus during retinal photocoagulation, effective photocoagulation in supine position, posibility to change direct photocoagulator or indirect one by the changeover switch and photocoagulation viewed from all directions around the patient head. After confirming the condition and safety by experimenting on rabbits eyes, laser photo coagulation is to be performed on diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear, branch occlusion of retinal vein, retinal neovascularization, retinal macroaneurysm and retinopathy of prematurity. Especially this monocular indirect argon laser photocoagulation can be applied more effectively than xenon light coagulation on the retinopathy of prematurity thanks to overall view of the fundus in supine position. While {{on the other hand}} it has two unfavorable points, i. e. it is unstable to be fixed and that fine and delicate laser photocoagulation in the mascular area cannot be performed. So it is preferable to use it combinatively with a slit-lamp type by changeover switch, depending on the conditions of the fundus...|$|R
