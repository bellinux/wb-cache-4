5|$|By the 1951 season, Motley <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the {{physical}} effects of his hard-hitting, up-the-middle running style. He suffered {{a knee injury}} in training camp, and he was getting older; {{by the time the}} season was in full swing, he was 31. Motley only ran for 273 yards and one touchdown that year, an uncharacteristically low total. Despite Motley's troubles, the Browns made the championship game again after winning the American Conference with an 11–1 record. Cleveland, however, lost the title game to the Rams, 24–17. Motley had just five carries and 23 yards.|$|E
5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble {{he could not}} afford to take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

I was in my late 30s, and I was drinking pretty good, and I was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like I was missing the boat. The character in the book is an older guy who has been around and <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that he's pretty washed-up." ...|$|R

25|$|A {{few months}} before his death, Drew started feeling weak and short of breath. After visiting with Dr. Pila, Drew {{returned}} to the classroom for a few months, but <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> weak again and {{this time there was}} little that medical science could done for him. Drew fell victim of heart disease, dying on 14 April 1948.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the Boers desperate need of supplies, the British command changed tactics, adopting a counter-insurgency approach. They established heavily defended blockhouses along supply-lines, and used a scorched earth policy, burning houses and crops, and interning Boers in concentration camps. This caused {{the costs of the}} campaign to rise dramatically, and began to {{have a negative impact on}} the popularity of the campaign amongst ordinary Australians. Some even <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sympathy for the Boers.|$|E

25|$|One {{study has}} {{suggested}} that infrasound may cause feelings of awe or fear in humans. It has also been suggested that since it is not consciously perceived, it may make people feel vaguely that odd or supernatural events are taking place. Engineer Vic Tandy provided such an explanation in his investigations in the 1980s. Tandy, while working in his laboratory, <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> uneasy and as if a supernatural presence was with him. Later, he could attribute these feelings to a broken metal fan that was causing noises of a frequency that triggered them. The noise could not be perceived by the human ear, but Tandy's body reacted to the 19Hz sounds.|$|E
25|$|People <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{that the}} police were taking sides with the city council and Faderhuset. Tensions boiled over when a {{demonstration}} on 24 September was attacked by the police. The reason for the police attack apparently was a bottle being thrown at a police van. The police responded with a full frontal baton-charge on the demonstration. This led to several hours of street fighting between police and demonstrators. During the street fighting, three hundred people were arrested, many of which had not been involved with the fighting. A lot of these later claimed to have been brutally treated while in police custody. This sparked anger amongst the supporters of Ungdomshuset and many stated that violent resistance was now not only necessary and justified but the only right course of action that they could choose.|$|E
25|$|After {{media and}} {{industry}} pressure forced the FCC to act, MacDougall was charged after surrendering to the authorities. FCC investigators spoke to MacDougall in July (he {{lost his job}} at Central Florida Teleport beforehand due to the closure of People's Choice), asking him questions {{that led him to}} believe that the commission was aware of the incident. Two FCC agents visited MacDougall's house two weeks later along with U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a subpoena to appear in Jacksonville's U.S. District Court. In their meeting, MacDougall claimed not to have committed any crime. According to MacDougall, Gentile tried to make an agreement that if MacDougall discussed the incident, Gentile would be willing to recommend a small fine and probation to the judge. At that time, MacDougall stated that he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that there was not enough evidence to convict him, and despite continuing to protest his innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would attend court.|$|E

500|$|Sony's {{acquisition}} of SCE Cambridge (which occurred {{within six months}} of Sony agreeing to publish the game) helped ease financial strain on the project, but did not assist the studio's inexperience with making 3D games. The takeover was also [...] "quite intimidating" [...] to Sorrell and Wilson, who had not held conferences. Sorrell stated the concept of conferences was [...] "totally alien". He felt that the game <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like a major project after a few meetings.|$|E

[...] An IGN review said [...] "while there's some really funny moments in this episode, overall I really <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that hour running time.

On 29 December, the day they cleared the Ninnis Glacier, the last dog was killed. Mawson recorded: [...] "Had a great breakfast off Ginger's skull—thyroids and brain".

500|$|... "High and Dry" [...] {{became a}} modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was {{insufficient}} {{to repeat the}} worldwide success of [...] "Creep". The Bends peaked at No. 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there. Nonetheless, Radiohead {{were satisfied with the}} album's reception. Jonny Greenwood later said: [...] "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after The Bends was released and it started appearing in people's [...] polls {{for the end of the}} year. That's when it <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like we made the right choice about being a band." [...] In later years, The Bends appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2012 edition of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] at No. 111.|$|E

Nash only played in three preseason games before he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now.

500|$|A {{segment of}} [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was {{inspired}} by a controversy over the growing Islamic influence in the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which, according to Bill Gallagher of WJBK, has [...] "a significant Muslim community". The biggest mosque in the United States is also located there. During the segment in question, set in Milhouse and Lisa's future home, Milhouse tells Lisa that he has <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the symptoms of his seasonal allergies now that Christmas has arrived. He is apparently allergic to Christmas-related things such as holly, mistletoe, and the red part of candy cane. Lisa advises Milhouse to go and stay in Michigan over the holidays, where Christmas is not celebrated because it is [...] "still under sharia law." [...] Milhouse agrees to do this, but complains that they always make him wear a veil there, pointing to a photo on the wall in which he is standing outside of the University of Michigan–Dearborn dressed in a burqa.|$|E
500|$|The idea to {{construct}} a bridge in the area did not arise until the 20th Century. In 1900 and 1901, politicians <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it was appropriate to build a bridge in the area. A firm, run by Milton L. Skinner, first opened in 1901 to help sell stock, construct the bridge, and then follow it by operating it for the general public. The firm, named the Milanville Bridge Company, was located {{in the community of}} Milanville on the Pennsylvania side. At the time the name of the bridge was referred to as the Milanville Bridge, but eventually, locals referred it as the [...] "Skinners Falls Bridge". [...] The corporation received the charter from the state of Pennsylvania {{to construct}} the bridge in the later months of 1901. The firm hired the American Bridge Company to construct the bridge. Construction did not get far, before an ice flood raised the river to the second story level of Milanville homes. This, along with local opposition, caused a short delay in construction.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to [...] anyway.
