It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was <b>so</b> <b>cute!</b> I had to pretend it was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I really am a cat person".|$|E

Josh Langhoff from PopMatters, however, felt that the song followed similar suit to that of MIA. Jocelyn Vena, from MTV News, commented that [...] "Sleazy" [...] "fits right in with [...] party-anthem discography". Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote that the song contains [...] "tribal anti-bourgeois bounce". Bill Lamb from About.com noted that Bangladesh's production [...] "pumps up the hard edge and club readiness". [...] "The Sleazy Remix" [...] features rapper André 3000, who raps over the song's [...] "bouncy thump" [...] beat talking about a young child dealing with his deadbeat father, [...] "We start out <b>so</b> <b>cute</b> in our baby pictures/ That mama shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you/ He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember/ If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him." [...] André then transitions into a rap about his friendship with Kesha before she takes over the rest {{of the song}}.|$|E
500|$|The Dragon Quest Slime has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans, {{being called the}} [...] "most prolific" [...] of all the [...] "memorable" [...] monsters from the series {{and is one of}} the most recognizable characters in gaming. The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing Rocket Slime. GamesRadar listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the [...] "equivalent of training wheels" [...] due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them. They also listed it as a character they wished they knew less about. They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill and not feel guilty about, the playable role of a Slime in the [...] series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies. In the January 2010 issue of Nintendo Power, the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including Goombas and Octoroks. They wrote that [...] "The Slimes are just <b>so</b> <b>cute</b> and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But you know, a hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film only two stars, writing that the film [...] "gives us two movie kids in a story so {{unlikely}} I assume it {{was intended as a}} fantasy.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Dread Central, Zarantonello stated, [...] "Well, the idea the movie was to portray a mother {{and to make it}} as universal as possible. For example, there is a line in the movie that says, ‘It was so much better when you were younger; you were <b>so</b> much <b>cuter</b> when you were a kid.” And this is a line that Barbara says and that all the ladies in the movie say. So the idea was to portray, definitely, a killer as an unusual character but with some traits that may be common to mothers in general. And, as a matter of fact, at the end, when there’s the close-up with Heather and her daughter, yeah, of course she may have inherited something from her mother. She says the same line even when she touches the hair of her son, Matthew, ‘You were <b>so</b> much <b>cuter</b> when you were younger.’ So, once again, the same line… I was hoping that they would show us that motherhood sometimes cannot be that sweet and kind thing that we’re all used to, especially in the movies." [...] The cast of The Butterfly Room included veteran horror film actors such as Barbara Steele, Heather Langenkamp, Ray Wise and Erica Leerhsen. Actors such as P.J. Soles, Adrienne King and Camille Keaton had cameo roles.|$|R
500|$|In a May 2012 interview, Whedon {{said that}} it was his {{decision}} to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. [...] "He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's <b>so</b> <b>cute.</b> For me, the greatest Avengers [...] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were {{some of the most important}} texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'" [...] An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," [...] which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.|$|E

[...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "Better, or at least sweeter, than the first, with Wiig adding some much-needed romantic charm to the toddler-level humor." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you could do a lot worse than Despicable Me 2." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "A fleeter film than its predecessor, Despicable Me 2 delights more often than it disappoints." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The minions are still wacky scene-stealers– and once again, we don't get nearly enough of them– but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety." ...|$|E

In an interview published in The Comics Journal #205, Tomine addressed criticisms of his work and discussed his influences in detail, admitting he was strongly influenced by Dan Clowes and Jaime Hernandez.

Like another alien {{fuzzball}} envisioned by Gerrold, they reproduce very quickly, and possess many traits which induce adoration in other species. In the wild, mother animals of many species will actually abandon their young in order to take care of meeps — a potent adaptation indeed. Some scientists speculate that the bunnydogs essentially rely on the same tactic as the meeps in a sense: they are <b>so</b> disarmingly <b>cute,</b> literally resembling living teddy bears, that humans are reluctant to attack them.|$|R

Joe Leydon of Variety wrote that [...] "Swartzwelder wants to engage his target audience with a tale of moral redemption through chaste romance.

Malone wrote that she [...] "seemed to struggle in comedic roles but proved her mettle in films that called on her to take charge of situations or find courage in the face of adversity". One critic remarked that it took a director like John Ford to bring out a good performance from her. [...] The Irish critic Philip Moloy thought the opposite, saying [...] "It is not something that she would accept herself, but Maureen O'Hara's career probably suffered from its long-term association with John Ford. John Ford's view of Ireland, and things Irish, tended to be broad, sentimental and sociologically distorted, and his characters were often cliched representatives of their nationality". In the 1960s, O'Hara ventured into maturer roles as she aged.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} {{developing}} a efficient VLSI architecture for median filter to remove impulse noise. Median filter {{is one of}} the important non-linear filters, used in speech and image processing applications. In this paper, four new low complexity and high speed architectures are proposed for 5 x 5 median filters. The main idea {{of this paper is to}} employ various techniques Such as, fine grain pipelining, pipelining and unfolding to increase speed of the architecture. The proposed 5 x 5 architecture is developed using five cell, three cell and two cell sorters which gives median value with low complexity and high speed. First architecture is developed using fine grain pipelining technique in which registers are introduced in the comparator circuit itself, so that delay is reduced from 164 ns to 24 ns. Second architecture is developed using pipelining technique in which registers were inserted across the feed forward <b>cutest,</b> <b>so</b> that delay is reduced from 24 ns to 14 ns. Third architecture is developed using unfolding technique, it performs the same operation J number of times where J is the unfolding factor. It performs the operation two times (J= 2) with delay 23 ns. The proposed high speed and low complexity architecture will retain original image quality and sharpness...|$|R
