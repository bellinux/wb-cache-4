40|$|A set of {{isogenic}} mutants of Bacillus subtilis 168, insertionally inactivated in {{the genes}} encoding a number of lytic enzymes and a sigma factor (aD, which controls {{the expression of a}} number of autolysins) was constructed. Phenotypic analysis of the mutants determined the individual and combined roles of the autolysins in vegetative growth. The major vegetative autolysins of B. subtilis, LytC (50 kDa amidase) and LytD (90 kDa glucosaminidase), were shown to have roles in cell <b>separation,</b> cell <b>wall</b> turnover, antibiotic-induced lysis and motility. LytC was also shown to have a role in general cell lysis induced by sodium aside. Renaturing SDS-PAGE of cell-wall-binding protein extracts of the mutant strains revealed the presence of a novel autolysin that was previously masked by LytC. This 49 kDa enzyme was shown to be aDcontrolled and was identified as a candidate cell <b>separation</b> and cell <b>wall</b> turnover enzyme. A multiple mutant strain, lacking LytC, LytD and the 49 kDa enzyme, retained at least ten bands of autolytic activity. These may correspond to individual or proteolytically processed novel autolysins, the functions of which are unknown. The multiple mutant strains facilitate the study of these, and other lytic enzymes, to determine their cellular functions. 1 Keywords: Bacillus subtilis, autolysins, cell <b>separation,</b> cell <b>wall</b> turnover, motility...|$|R
40|$|We numerically examine run-and-tumble active matter {{particles}} in Casimir geometries {{composed of two}} finite parallel walls. We find {{that there is an}} attractive force between the two walls of a magnitude that increases with increasing run length. The attraction exhibits an unusual exponential dependence on the <b>wall</b> <b>separation,</b> and it arises due to a depletion of swimmers in the region between the walls by a combination of the motion of the particles along the walls and a geometric shadowing effect. This attraction is robust as long as the <b>wall</b> <b>separation</b> is comparable to or smaller than the swimmer run length, and is only slightly reduced by the inclusion of steric interactions between swimmers. We also examine other geometries and find regimes {{in which there is a}} crossover from attraction to repulsion between the walls as a function of <b>wall</b> <b>separation</b> and run length.
