5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine <b>soaks</b> into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E

After drying and acid digestion, 70 samples in 4 groups of raw, 8, 12 and 24 h <b>soaked</b> and also <b>soaking</b> waters of all <b>soaking</b> hours, minerals were measured and compared. The result of present study showed that after 12 and 24 <b>soaking</b> hours, calcium content of peas and after 8, 12 and 24 h <b>soaking</b> time, magnesium and phosphorus content of samples were decreased and also in <b>soaking</b> water samples, comparing the tap water used for <b>soaking,</b> after 24 h of <b>soaking</b> calcium content was increased and after 8 and 12 h, phosphorus content was decreased. Also, magnesium content of <b>soaking</b> water samples was increased and Na content was decreased. It appears that the <b>soaking</b> as an effective method of reducing flatulent materials and anti-nutrients, causing the reduction of minerals by leaching into the water does not have a significant effect on bioavailability of minerals...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first step}} is to sprout the rice, which can be done using the <b>soaking</b> method or the {{humidity}} method. The <b>soaking</b> method involves <b>soaking</b> rice in water until the desired moisture level is attained (for example 10 kilograms of rice is <b>soaked</b> for 6-12 hours).

40|$|The {{conventional}} parboiling {{of rough}} rice is a lengthy process that takes 24 - 28 h to complete. It {{would be beneficial}} to the industry if the processing time could be reduced. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop an ultrasound based one-step protocol for <b>soaking</b> and gelatinization during rice parboiling. The gelatinization temperature was measured by alkali (KOH) degradation and found to be 72 ◦C. The combined <b>soaking</b> and gelatinization was conducted at 75 ◦C with or without sonication (control). The moisture content during <b>soaking</b> was measured following the AOAC oven method. Starch gelatinization was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moisture content after 3 h of ultrasonic <b>soaking</b> (48. 6 % w. b.) was equivalent to 10 h conventional <b>soaking</b> (44. 0 % w. b.), indicating that ultrasound reduced some 70 % of <b>soaking</b> time. DSC showed that the retrogradation peaks (Tr) values for 80 ◦C <b>soaking</b> and ultrasonic horn (US. horn) <b>soaking,</b> which were accomplished during 4 h, was 53. 8 ◦C and 53. 5 ◦C, respectively.

Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not soak up the condensate will be more comfortable. Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} Willow's {{reconciliation with}} Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), {{one of the}} Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara {{right in front of}} Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow <b>soaks</b> up all the dark magic she can, which turns her hair and eyes black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits her in the back with an axe. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically flaying him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to feel all the pain of everyone in the world. She tries to ease the pain by destroying the world, finally to be stopped by Xander.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} gastric-brooding frog {{lived in}} areas of rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest. They were a predominately aquatic species closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and <b>soaks.</b> Streams that the southern gastric-brooding frog were found in were mostly permanent and only ceased to flow during years of very low rainfall. Sites where southern gastric-brooding frogs were found usually consisted of closed forests with emergent eucalypts, however there was sites where open forest and grassy ground cover were the predominate vegetation. There is no record for this species occurring in cleared riparian habitat. Searches during spring and summer showed that the favored diurnal habitat was {{at the edge of}} rock pools, either amongst leaf litter, under or between stones or in rock crevices. They were also found under rocks in shallow water. Winter surveys of sites where southern gastric-brooding frogs were common only recovered two specimens, and it is assumed that they hibernated during the colder months. Adult males preferred deeper pools than the juveniles and females which tended to inhabit shallower, newly created (after rain) pools that contained stones and/or leaf litter. Individuals only left themselves fully exposed while sitting on rocks during light rain.|$|E
25|$|After viewing Kohler's tape, Langdon, Vittoria and the {{cardinals}} confront the camerlengo. Shortly before the novel begins, the Pope met with Leonardo Vetra {{who believed that}} antimatter was capable of establishing a link between science and God. Vetra's beliefs caused great discomfort to the camerlengo. While discussing Vetra, the pope reveals that his support is due to science having given him a son. Without waiting to hear the explanation (that the child {{was the result of}} artificial insemination) and horrified that the Pope appeared to have broken his vow of chastity, the camerlengo plots to rectify the situation. He poisoned the pope and, under the guise of an Illuminati master (Janus), he recruited the assassin to kill Vetra, steal the antimatter and kidnap and murder the preferiti. The camerlengo planted the antimatter in St. Peter's basilica, feigned his last minute vision from God and retrieved the canister just in time to save the Vatican from the ensuing explosion. This was in hope to unite the struggling Catholic Church. The Illuminati involvement was merely a plot engineered by the camerlengo to cover his own involvement. Upon the discovery and the camerlengo's attempts to justify his murder of the Pope, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals, reveals that the camerlengo is in fact the late pope's biological son, conceived with a nun through artificial insemination. Overcome with guilt, Ventresca <b>soaks</b> himself in oil and sets himself on fire before a crowd of onlookers in St. Peter's Square. His ashes are recovered by Mortati, who places them in an urn which is placed inside his father's sarcophagus. It is revealed that {{the cardinals}}' endorsing of him would have made him Pope by acclamation. Mortati is unanimously elected pope by the cardinals and Langdon and Vittoria reunite at Hotel Berniniwhere they share an extensive meal before making love. The last brand, the Illuminati Diamond, is given to Langdon on indefinite loan, provided he return it to the Vatican in his will.|$|E

Changes in the properties of <b>soaking</b> water (pH, absorbance and colorimetric values) were also investigated during the <b>soaking</b> process. All the properties of SBM and <b>soaking</b> water were influenced by <b>soaking</b> time and temperature. The rate of increase in moisture content was higher for higher temperature.
