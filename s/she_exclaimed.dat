According to Lupfer, [...] "it was a concept he [...] was going for to get some studio banter." [...] As Deal was leaving the studio to smoke a cigarette, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed</b> [...] "If anybody touches my stuff, I'll kill ya." [...] Francis replied with [...] "I'll kill you, you fucking die, if anybody touches my stuff".

Lupfer later admitted that Albini knew [...] "perfectly well what was going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had never}} {{performed}} [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{on any of}} her concert tours until February 4, 2016, when she performed the song during the Taipei stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. After the performance, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed</b> [...] "That was fun! First time ever. Hit a few bad notes, but {{it felt good to}} sing it."

500|$|Winehouse's {{greatest}} {{love was}} 1960s girl groups. Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then I found out, no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{immediate}} predecessor of Dungeons & Dragons {{was a set}} {{of medieval}} miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by Gary Gygax, whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as Chainmail. When Dave Wesely entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer Dave Arneson began a medieval variation of Wesely's Braunstein games, where players control individuals instead of armies. Arneson used Chainmail to resolve combat. As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others. Having partnered previously with Gygax on Don't Give Up the Ship!, Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing [...] "The Fantasy Game", the role-playing game (RPG) that became Dungeons & Dragons, with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax. The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy — upon being presented {{with a number of}} choices of possible names, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons and Dragons best!" ...|$|E
500|$|She {{performed}} {{in a number of}} variety shows including The Jack Benny Program (on which she played violin), The Steve Allen Show and The Jackie Gleason Show (during the mid-1960s, when the show was the second-highest-rated program in the U.S.). In November 1957, she was portrayed in one of her nightclub acts in a special episode of The Perry Como Show (Holiday in Las Vegas), which created [...] "a situation" [...] for the audience according to NBC, the television network that broadcast the show. She was a guest on three episodes of The Bob Hope Show touring [...] team. In 1957, she toured United States Pacific Command areas of Hawaii, Okinawa, Guam, Tokyo and Korea with Bob Hope for the United Service Organizations for 13 days appearing as a comedian; and in 1961, toured Newfoundland, Labrador and Baffin Island for a Christmas special.

500|$|By 1808 it {{was still}} {{considered}} unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children's early lives {{would be good for}} them: [...] "If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be." [...] In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander I invited the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; [...] "Nothing dazzles me anymore", <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed</b> on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, [...] "Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even more precious to us." [...] Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace– the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities. Returning to a much different Prussia than she left, a preacher observed that [...] "our dear queen is far from joyful, but her seriousness has a quiet serenity... her eyes have lost their former sparkle, and one sees that they have wept much, and still weep".|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed</b> at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Constructed in 1961 {{for use by}} the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera (CLO), [...] it was {{the brainchild}} of {{department}} store owner Edgar J. Kaufmann. It was the first retractable roof major-sports venue in the world, covering 170,000 sq. feet, constructed with nearly 3,000 tons of Pittsburgh steel and supported solely by a massive 260-foot-long cantilevered arm on the exterior. Even though it was designed and engineered as a retractable-roof dome, the operating cost and repairs to the hydraulic jacks halted all full retractions after 1995, and the roof stayed permanently closed after 2001. [...] The first roof opening was during a July 4, 1962 Carol Burnett show to which <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed</b> [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen...I present the sky!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lessing was out {{shopping}} for groceries when the Nobel Prize announcement came. [...] Arriving {{home to a}} gathering of reporters, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "Oh Christ!" [...] "I've won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one, so I'm delighted to win them all. It's a royal flush." [...] She titled her Nobel Lecture On Not Winning the Nobel Prize {{and used it to}} draw attention to global inequality of opportunity, and to explore changing attitudes to storytelling and literature. The lecture was later published in a limited edition to raise money for children made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. In a 2008 interview for the BBC's Front Row, she stated that increased media interest after the award had left her without time or energy for writing. Her final book, Alfred and Emily, appeared in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The {{love affair}} between the King and Gwyn {{allegedly}} began in April 1668. Gwyn was attending {{a performance of}} George Etherege's She Wou'd if She Cou'd at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. In the next box was the King, who from accounts {{was more interested in}} flirting with Nell than watching the play. Charles invited Nell and her escort (a Mr. Villiers, a cousin of Buckingham's) to supper, along with his brother the Duke of York. The anecdote turns charming if perhaps apocryphal at this point: the King, after supper, discovered that he had no money on him; nor did his brother, and Gwyn had to foot the bill. [...] "Od's fish!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> in an imitation of the King's manner of speaking, [...] "but this is the poorest company I ever was in!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Leibowitz used a 32-foot model {{train set}} up {{on a table in}} front of the witness stand to {{illustrate}} where each of the parties was during the alleged events, and other points of his defense. When asked if the model in front of her was like the train where she claimed she was raped, Price cracked, [...] "It was bigger. Lots bigger. That is a toy." [...] Leibowitz later conceded that Price was [...] "one of the toughest witnesses he ever cross examined." [...] Her answers were evasive and derisive. She often replied, [...] "I can't remember" [...] or [...] "I won't say." [...] Once when Leibowitz confronted her with a contradiction in her testimony, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> sticking a finger in the direction of defendant Patterson, [...] "One thing I will never forget is that one sitting right there raped me." [...] The attorney tried to question her about a conviction for fornication and adultery in Huntsville, but the court sustained a prosecution objection.|$|E
2500|$|A {{spirit of}} {{adventure}} seemed to abide in the Earhart children, with the pair setting off daily {{to explore their}} neighborhood. As a child, Earhart spent long hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle and [...] "belly-slamming" [...] her sled downhill. Although {{the love of the}} outdoors and [...] "rough-and-tumble" [...] play was common to many youngsters, some biographers have characterized the young Earhart as a tomboy. The girls kept [...] "worms, moths, katydids and a tree toad" [...] in a growing collection gathered in their outings. In 1904, {{with the help of her}} uncle, she cobbled together a home-made ramp fashioned after a roller coaster she had seen on a trip to St. Louis and secured the ramp to the roof of the family toolshed. Earhart's well-documented first flight ended dramatically. She emerged from the broken wooden box that had served as a sled with a bruised lip, torn dress and a [...] "sensation of exhilaration". <b>She</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "Oh, Pidge, it's just like flying!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Melba's father {{moved the}} family to Mackay, Queensland, where he built a new sugar mill. Melba soon became popular in Mackay society for her singing and piano-playing. On 22 December 1882 in Brisbane, she married Charles Nesbitt Frederick Armstrong (1858–1948), the {{youngest}} son of Sir Andrew Armstrong. They had one child, a son, George, born on 16 October 1883. The marriage was not a success; Charles reportedly beat his wife more than once. The couple separated after just over a year, and Melba returned to Melbourne determined to pursue a singing career, debuting professionally in concerts in 1884. She was often accompanied in concert, {{and some of her}} concerts were organised, at times throughout her career by the flautist John Lemmone, who became a [...] "lifelong friend and counsellor". On the strength of local success, she travelled to London in search of an opportunity. Her debut at the Princes' Hall in 1886 made little impression, and she sought work unsuccessfully from Sir Arthur Sullivan, Carl Rosa and Augustus Harris. She then went to Paris to study with the leading teacher Mathilde Marchesi, who instantly recognised the young singer's potential: <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "J'ai enfin une étoile!"– [...] "I have a star at last!". Melba made such rapid progress that she was allowed to sing the [...] "Mad Scene" [...] from Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet at a matinée musicale in Marchesi's house in December the same year, {{in the presence of the}} composer.|$|E
2500|$|After {{studying}} in Berlin with Mathilde Mallinger, {{she made her}} debut at the Hamburg Opera in 1910 as a page in Wagner's Lohengrin. In 1914, she gave her debut as Eva in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg at the Vienna Court Opera– the later Vienna State Opera–, which she joined in 1916. She quickly established herself {{as one of the}} company's brightest, most beloved stars in roles such as Elisabeth in Tannhäuser and Elsa in Lohengrin. She created roles in the world premieres of a number of operas by Richard Strauss, including the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos in 1916 (later she sang the title-role in this opera), the Dyer's Wife in Die Frau ohne Schatten in 1919 and Christine in Intermezzo in 1924. Her other Strauss roles were the title-roles in Arabella and in Der Rosenkavalier (earlier in her career, she had also sung the role of Sophie; when she finally added the Marschallin to her repertoire, she became the first soprano in history to have sung all three female lead roles in Der Rosenkavalier). Her Puccini roles at the Vienna State Opera included the title-roles in Tosca, Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, Suor Angelica, Turandot, Mimi in La bohème and Giorgetta in Il tabarro. In her 21 years with the company, Lehmann sang more than fifty different roles at the Vienna State Opera, including Marie/Marietta in Die tote Stadt, the title-roles in La Juive by Fromental Halévy, Mignon by Ambroise Thomas, and Manon by Jules Massenet, Charlotte in Werther, Marguerite in Faust, Tatiana in Eugene Onegin and Lisa in The Queen of Spades. In the meantime she had made her debut in London in 1914, and from 1924 to 1935 she performed regularly at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where aside from her famous Wagner roles and the Marschallin she also sang Desdemona in Otello and Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni. She appeared regularly at the Salzburg Festival from 1926 to 1937, performing with Arturo Toscanini, among other conductors. She also gave recitals there accompanied at the piano by the conductor Bruno Walter. In August 1936, while in Salzburg, she discovered the Trapp Family Singers, later made famous in the musical The Sound of Music. Lehmann had heard of a villa available for let and as she approached the villa she overheard the family singing in their garden. Insisting the children had a precious gift, <b>she</b> <b>exclaimed</b> that the family had [...] "gold in their throats" [...] and that they should enter the Salzburg Festival contest for group singing the following night. Having regard to the family's aristocratic background the Baron insisted performing in public was out of the question, however Lehmann's fame and genuine enthusiasm persuaded the Baron to relent, leading to their first public performance.|$|E
