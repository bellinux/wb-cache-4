While the case presented here is fairly clear-cut, it is sometimes difficult to evaluate properly all echoes in a large presentation. Anomalous propagation caused by <b>superrefraction</b> of the radar beam occurred during the early morning of June 6, 1969. <b>Superrefraction</b> means that the curvature of the radar beam is greater than normal, resulting in an extraordinary display of ground targets (Battan 1959). <b>Superrefraction</b> occurs {{when there is an}} increase of temperature and/or decrease of moisture with height. In this case, a stable dry air mass and radiation coolin...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gather {{information}} about the occurrence of ducting/superrefraction and signal-fading effects at frequencies around 300 MHz with antenna heights appropriate to intership communications, an experimental investigation has been undertaken with a transmitter and two receivers deployed in the British Channel Islands. Signal strength measurements made {{over a period of}} 17 months for a path from Jersey to Guernsey from April 2001 to September 2002 and 8 months of data for a path from Jersey to Alderney from November 2001 to September 2002 have been analyzed. Comparisons have been made between the received signal characteristics and several meteorological parameters such as sea state, weather conditions, and season, and the statistics of the occurrence of enhancements in signal strength due to <b>superrefraction</b> and ducting are presented...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedVariability of the MABL {{and its effect}} on the electromagnetic (EM) refractive structure around the Greenland Sea marginal ice zone were examined. Rawinsonde profiles and surface observations collected from 3 ships during MIZEX- 87 (20 March- 11 April) served as the data set. A program, developed to calculate the refractivity at each vertical level of the rawinsonde profiles, also identified the levels at which trapping, <b>superrefraction</b> and subrefraction occurred. Temporal studies showed that a higher incidence of anomalous refractive layers occurred during periods when the region was under the influence of high pressure. More than 50 % of the time, trapping and super-refractive layers were attributed to development of a capping inversion just above the MABL during these periods. Spatial studies showed that the refractive structure varied relative to distance from the ice edge as did the depth of the MABL. An upward slope in refractive layer heights was observed from the ice toward the open water. Significant spatial inhomogeneity was observed over horizontal ranges of less than 100 km. This was attributed to both the large-scale synoptic forcing affecting the region and to variations in the surface fluxes of heat and moisture over the ice and over the water. A range-dependent ray trace model developed at the Naval Ocean Systems Center was used to show how the ray paths of EM waves vary with a changing refractive structures.

40|$|Ground clutter {{caused by}} {{anomalous}} propagation (anaprop) can affect seriously radar rain rate estimates, particularly in fully automatic radar processing systems, and, if not filtered, can produce frequent false alarms. A statistical study of anomalous propagation detected from two operational C-band radars {{in the northern}} Italian region of Emilia Romagna is discussed, paying particular attention to its diurnal and seasonal variability. The analysis shows {{a high incidence of}} anaprop in summer, mainly in the morning and evening, due to the humid and hot summer climate of the Po Valley, particularly in the coastal zone. Thereafter, a comparison between different techniques and datasets to retrieve the vertical profile of the refractive index gradient in the boundary layer is also presented. In particular, their capability to detect anomalous propagation conditions is compared. Furthermore, beam path trajectories are simulated using a multilayer ray-tracing model and the influence of the propagation conditions on the beam trajectory and shape is examined. High resolution radiosounding data are identified as the best available dataset to reproduce accurately the local propagation conditions, while lower resolution standard TEMP data suffers from interpolation degradation and Numerical Weather Prediction model data (Lokal Model) are able to retrieve a tendency to <b>superrefraction</b> but not to detect ducting conditions. Observing the ray tracing of the centre, lower and upper limits of the radar antenna 3 -dB half-power main beam lobe it is concluded that ducting layers produce a change in the measured volume and in the power distribution that can lead to an additional error in the reflectivity estimate and, subsequently, in the estimated rainfall rate...|$|E
