30|$|The Animal Physiological Ecology Group of the Tübingen University reared several {{stocks of}} {{zebrafish}} {{based on the}} West Aquarium strain. Fish were kept at 26 °C[*]±[*] 1 °C in 100 - to 200 -L tanks in filtered (AE- 2 L water filter equipped with an ABL- 0240 - 29 activated carbon filter (0.3 μm), Reiser, Seligenstadt, Germany) tap water under semi-static conditions, with 30 % of water volume being exchanged every 14 days. The room was light-isolated, and an artificial dark-light cycle of 12 : 12 h was maintained. Animals were fed three times daily with dry flake food (TetraMin™, Tetra, Melle, Germany) and additionally with freshly hatched Artemia larvae (Sanders, Mt. Green, MT, USA) {{on the day before}} spawning. For egg production, a stainless steel grid box with a mesh size of 1.5 mm in a plastic basin was positioned {{at the bottom of the}} aquaria in the evening before spawning. The grid allowed the passage of eggs into the separate <b>spawning</b> <b>tray,</b> thus preventing predation by adult zebrafish, while green plastic wire material adjusted to the boxes served as spawning stimulus. Spawning took place in the early morning period after the onset of light. Eggs were collected 30 to 60 min after spawning.|$|E
