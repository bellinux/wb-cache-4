5|$|In {{a meeting}} near Bologna in October 43BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a junta called the Second Triumvirate.

5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus {{discovered that she}} was conspiring against him and had her placed under house arrest in Antioch. By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died in Antioch, possibly by starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> her plans to have Macrinus overthrown.

5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E

Villages, abbeys and convents and several towns, were plundered and burned, by both sides; Linz am Rhein and Ahrweiler avoided destruction by swearing loyalty to Salentin. In the summer of 1583, Gebhard and Agnes took refuge, first at Vest in Vest Recklinghausen, a fief of the Electorate, and then in the Duchy of Westphalia, at Arensberg castle. In both territories, Gebhard <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> as much of the Reformation as he could, although his soldiers indulged in a bout of iconoclasm and plundering.|$|E

5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to watch him perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige to <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> her plot.|$|E

5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel.

5|$|Around 66 BC, a {{movement}} to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based {{in the town of}} Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.|$|E

5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|The 'Land Question', as it {{pertains}} to the history of Prince Edward Island, Canada, related {{to the question of the}} system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island, favoured a system of renting to tenants, whilst the tenants preferred a system of freehold. In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into lots to be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor Walter Patterson, who <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.|$|E
