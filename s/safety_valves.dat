5|$|West Gates engines {{were shut}} down while American {{backed out of the}} tangle. West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued. The chief {{engineer}} and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent the explosion of the boilers. They finished the task just before the aft bulkhead gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest and the train to run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E

40|$|Congress {{passed the}} <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> to {{mitigate}} the disparate and often harsh sentences mandatory minimums impose on low-level drug defendants. But judicial interpretation continues to impose disparate sentences. In 2014, in United States v. Acevedo-Fitz, the Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its position in an ongoing circuit split regarding the <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> requires defendants to meet five criteria, the fifth—sometimes called {{the heart of the}} safety valve—requires defendants provide complete truthful disclosure to prosecutors prior to sentencing. Judges interpret this requirement as imposing a burden on defendants to prove they met all five criteria without requiring the government to prove a defendant failed to provide complete truthful disclosure. The circuit split regards whether a defendant may lie before telling the truth and still qualify for the <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> The Seventh Circuit holds one lie precludes <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> relief. It imposes an additional restriction, essentially adding a prerequisite that defendants substantially assist prosecutors. However, Congress passed the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> because the substantial assistance provision failed to assist low-level defendants, and the plain language of the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> imposes no requirements that the truthful disclosure assist the government. This reading frustrates Congressional intent, as many other circuits recognize. To comport with Congressional intent, the Seventh Circuit should utilize a plain-language reading of the statute, and not superimpose a substantial assistance prerequisite on the fifth element of the <b>safety</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> is a valve {{that acts}} as a {{fail-safe}} in a thermal-hydraulics plant. An example of <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> is a pressure relief valve (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a boiler, pressure vessel, or other system, when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. Pilot-operated relief valves are a specialized type of pressure <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a rupture disk.|$|R
50|$|In the {{petroleum}} refining, petrochemical, chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing, power generation, food, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, the term <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> {{is associated with}} the terms pressure relief <b>valve</b> (PRV), pressure <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV) and relief valve.The generic term is Pressure relief valve (PRV) or pressure <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV) It should be noted that PRVs and PSVs are not the same thing, despite what many people think; the difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to open the valve in case of emergency.|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} of an emergency, <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> can be used to prevent pipes from {{bursting}} or the reactor from exploding. The valves are designed so that they can derive all of the supplied flow rates with little increase in pressure. In the case of the BWR, the steam is directed into the suppression chamber and condenses there. The chambers on a heat exchanger are connected to the intermediate cooling circuit.|$|E
25|$|A {{fossil fuel}} steam {{generator}} includes an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air preheater (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse) and the flue gas stack.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-size}} replica {{steam locomotive}} GWR 3031 Class named The Queen was built at Steamtown, Carnforth, {{and this was}} combined with an ex-South Eastern and Chatham Railway tender and fittings from a GWR tender. The locomotive's bogie and rear wheels are also from another GWR tender, but the large driving wheels are only half complete (the lower half) {{and they do not}} sit directly on the rails. This allowed the locomotive to be rolled into position when the exhibition was built. The replica was completed in December 1982 and delivered by road in January 1983. Two mobile cranes hoisted it onto the viaduct, then it was rolled into position on temporary track. Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators so that steam was emitted from the cab, whistles and <b>safety</b> <b>valves,</b> and smoke from the chimney. A sound unit was also fitted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal design of an emissions trading program {{that includes a}} <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> tax that allows pollution sources to escape the emissions cap imposed by the aggregate supply of emissions permits. I demonstrate that an optimal hybrid emissions trading/emissions tax policy involves a permit supply that is strictly less than under a pure emissions trading scheme and a <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> tax that exceeds the optimal pure emissions tax as long as expected marginal damage is an increasing function. While the expected level of emissions under a hybrid policy may {{be more or less}} than under pure emissions trading or a pure emissions tax, under the assumption that uncertainty about aggregate marginal abatement costs is symmetric the most likely outcome is that emissions {{will turn out to be}} less under the hybrid. Finally, a steeper expected marginal damage function calls for higher permit supply and <b>safety</b> <b>valve,</b> which reduces expected aggregate emissions and the probability that the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> will be employed.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, {{with even more}} engines {{requiring}} urgent maintenance and repairs, orders were placed for an additional ten P class locomotives which would be improved through modifications to the boilers, bogies, headlights and valve gear. These new locomotives were constructed at the Midland Railway Workshops. The boilers featured an increase in pressure from 160 to 175psi, which provided more power, and the bogies were constructed in cast steel. These improved locomotives were delivered to the same operating specifications as the original P class, with the same weight distribution and boiler pressure limited to 160 psi, though improvements to the track and bridges on the Eastern Goldfields Railway in 1940 meant {{that they could be}} altered to use their designed power through the increasing of the axle load from 12.8 to 14.2 tons and the resetting of the boiler-top <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> to 175 psi. The result was a 9% increase in tractive effort with the same economical running of the P class.|$|E

The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater {{was replaced by a}} Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.|$|E

500|$|When Maunsell {{inherited}} the design as CME of the Southern Railway, he began trials using the weakest N15 (No.442) in 1924. The {{results indicated that}} better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements, although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee. Eight extra King Arthur-type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos.737742 by December 1925 {{in an effort to}} improve steaming. The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> to ease maintenance. Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie [...] "stovepipe" [...] chimney. The exhaust arrangements were modified on No.737 using the King Arthur chimney design and reduced-diameter blastpipes. This proved successful, and all [...] "Urie N15s" [...] were modified over the period 19251929. The oil-burning equipment was refitted to Nos.737 and 739 during the 1926 General Strike and removed in December of that year.|$|E
500|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell's team in 1914 {{as part of his}} proposed standardisation programme following the Nclass, but the designs were not shown to the railway directors until early 1915 to enable all six designs to be shown at once. The design incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running at high speeds, a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. The inclusion of these features is attributed to Holcroft, Maunsell's personal assistant, who had worked on the GWR 4300class and the Nclass. James Clayton, Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, brought simpler and more functional Midland Railway influences to the design, such as the shape of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. The latter was fitted with Ross pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> and pressed to [...]|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{conducted}} by the Franklin Institute, Boston, in the 1830s had initially {{cast doubt on the}} practice of adding water as soon as the escape of steam through the device was noted. A steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its normal operating temperature with the water level below the top of the firebox. When water was added {{it was found that the}} pressure rose suddenly and the observation glass shattered. The report concluded that the high temperature of the metal had vaporised the added water too quickly and that an explosion was the inevitable result. It was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged: Thomas Redmond, one of the Institute's own inspectors, [...] specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into the [...] boiler explosion on the steam ship Redstone on the Ohio River on 3 April that year. A 1907 investigation in Wales came to a similar conclusion: a steam locomotive belonging to the Rhymney Railway was inadvertently sent out with its <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> wrongly assembled. The pressure in the boiler built up to the extent that the injectors failed; the crown sheet became uncovered, was weakened by the heat of the fire and violently blew apart. The investigation, led by Colonel Druitt of the Railway Inspectorate, dismissed the theory that the enginemen had succeeded in starting the [...] injectors and that the sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that the boiler burst. He quoted the results of experiments by the Manchester Steam Users' Association, a national boiler certification and insurance body, that proved that the weight of copper present (considered with its specific heat) was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise the boiler pressure at all. Indeed, the addition of cold water had caused the pressure to fall. From then on it was accepted that the correct action in the event of the operation of the fusible plug was to add water.|$|E
