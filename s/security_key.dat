2500|$|On {{the night}} of 2 January 1942, Moulin parachuted into France from a British plane with orders from de Gaulle to unify the {{resistance}} and {{to have all of}} the resistance accept his authority. On 27 March 1942, the first French Jews were rounded up by the French authorities, sent to the camp at Drancy, from where they were sent to Auschwitz to be killed. In April 1942, the PCF created an armed wing of its Main d'Oeuvre Immigée representing immigrants called the FTP-MOI under the leadership of [...] On 1 May 1942, May Day, which Vichy France had tried to turn into a Catholic holiday celebrating St. Philip, Premier Pierre Laval was forced to break off his speech when the crowd began to chant [...] "Mort à Laval". As millions of Frenchmen serving in the French Army had been taken prisoner by the Germans in 1940, there was a shortage of men in France during the Occupation, which explains why Frenchwomen played so a prominent role in the Resistance, with the résistante Germaine Tillon later writing: [...] "It was women who kick-started the Resistance." [...] In May 1942, speaking before a military court in Lyon, the résistante Marguerite Gonnet, when asked about why she had taken up arms against the Reich, replied: [...] "Quite simply, colonel, because the men had dropped them." [...] In 1942, the Royal Air Force (RAF) attempted to bomb the Schneider-Creusot works at Lyon, which was one of France's largest arms factories. The RAF missed the factory and instead killed around 1,000 French civilians. Two Frenchmen serving in the SOE, Raymond Basset (codename Mary) and André Jarrot (codename Goujean), were parachuted in and were able to repeatedly sabotage the local power grid to sharply lower production at the Schneider-Creusot works. Freney, who had emerged as a leading résistant, recruited the engineer Henri Garnier living in Toulouse to teach French workers at factories producing weapons for the Wehrmacht how best to drastically shorten the lifespan of the Wehrmacht's weapons, usually by making deviations of a few millimetres; such acts of quiet sabotage were almost impossible to detect, which meant no French people would be shot in reprisal. To maintain contact with Britain, Resistance leaders would sometimes go directly to the United Kingdom by crossing the English Channel at night on a boat, making their way to Britain via Spain and Portugal, or taking a [...] "spy taxi", as the British Lysander aircraft were known in France, which landed on secret airfields at night. More commonly, contact with Britain was maintained via radio. The Germans had powerful radio detection stations based in Paris, Brittany, Augsburg, and Nürnberg that could and would trace an unauthorized radio broadcast to within ten miles of its location. Afterwards, the Germans would send a van with a radio detection equipment to find the radio operator. For this reason, radio operators in the Resistance were advised not to keep broadcasting from the same location for long. To maintain secrecy, radio operators encrypted their messages using polyalphabetic ciphers. Finally, radio operators had a <b>security</b> <b>key</b> which to begin their messages; if captured and forced to radio Britain under duress, the radio operator would not use the key, which tipped off London that they had been captured.|$|E
