It was a novel approach which emphasizes <b>summary</b> <b>findings</b> from biology and cosmology and astronomy and geology and anthropology to show what happened before homo sapiens became prevalent on the Earth; generally, humans are not mentioned much in the course until halfway through the 15-week semester. He wrote the book Maps of Time which mirrored the course content. The course was chosen by The Teaching Company's Great Courses and Christian recorded 48 half-hour lectures.|$|E

50|$|Along with {{personality}} and dispositional traits, the job-related characteristics {{and attitudes of}} organizational justice, job satisfaction, and leader supportiveness are all antecedents of contextual performance. Specifically, if an individual perceives that he/she is being treated fairly, if they are satisfied with their job, and if they feel that their supervisor or leader provides support, their contextual performance is expected to increase. These antecedents are important because they are potentially {{under the control of}} organizations. By improving upon certain job-related characteristics, organizations may be able {{to increase the amount of}} contextual performance done by employees. Procedural justice describes the fairness used in the allocation process and was found to be positively related to two facets of contextual performance, interpersonal facilitation and job dedication. Although the correlations are weak-to-moderate, <b>summary</b> <b>findings</b> imply that when individuals are satisfied with their job and that their supervisor or leader provides support to them; their contextual performance is expected to increase.|$|E

Given the fact that genetic constitutionality of individuals cannot be changed, at least at the present level of science and technology, our effort should be focused on reducing the risk of PMBC through life style modification.|$|E
