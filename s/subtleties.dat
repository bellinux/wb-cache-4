5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the <b>subtleties</b> and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E

40|$|<b>Subtlety</b> in persuasive {{technology}} {{is difficult to}} define, measure, and evaluate. It relates to a subtle implementation of persuasive principles in applications but also to a subtle balance, variation, combination, or adaptation of persuasive principles. Understanding <b>subtlety</b> in persuasion benefits the effectiveness of persuasive technology because more intrusive non-subtle persuasive cues can have a direct positive contribution, {{but at the same}} time might lead to higher resistance or hesitation to users which has a negative contribution to effectiveness. We explore the notion of <b>subtlety</b> and we propose an attempt to make <b>subtlety</b> measurable by relating it to the psychological notion of reactance. An experiment has been set up to research the proposed coupling. An existing persuasive software product is used as a research carrier. The most important result is that persuasive feedback indeed results in a significant increase in reactance arousal...|$|R

5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the <b>subtleties</b> of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued {{his study of}} Aesthetic Realism, and under the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the <b>subtleties</b> of light and shade in drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{first night}} of The Seagull, at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as the play was booed by the audience, {{stinging}} Chekhov into renouncing the theatre. But the play so impressed the theatre director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko that he convinced his colleague Konstantin Stanislavski to direct a new production for the innovative Moscow Art Theatre in 1898. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried <b>subtleties</b> from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting. The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged Uncle Vanya, which Chekhov had completed in 1896.|$|E

5|$|To the north, Stefan Crnojević did {{not keep}} {{relations}} with Alfonso. Instead, he allied himself with Venice which gave him the Flag of St. Marc to bear. Crnojević thus became a Venetian vassal, who promised to protect Albania Veneta from Serbian and Turkish attacks. Skanderbeg grew agitated from the Venetian <b>subtleties</b> and threatened a renewed war against Venice under the pretext that the Senate had not been annually paying the 1,400 ducats promised to the Albanian in 1448. He had already moved his men towards Durazzo and Scutari, leaving the Republic with {{no choice but to}} ease their secretive diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Valérie is repulsed by her ugly {{husband and}} has gone five years without kissing him. She {{explains}} bluntly that her {{position as a}} married woman provides <b>subtleties</b> and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness– not to mention her gruesome demise– has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such <b>subtleties</b> as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E
