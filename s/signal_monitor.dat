40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Industrie 4. 0 [2] propose {{substantial}} {{increases in}} the deployment of sensors into a diverse range of environments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{strategy for the}} response enhancement of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) -based biosensors by monitoring the enhancive responses of OSNs to odorants. An OSNs-based biosensor was developed {{on the basis of}} the light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), in which rat OSNs were cultured on the surface of LAPS chip and served as sensing elements. LY 294002, the specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), was used to enhance the responses of OSNs to odorants. The responses of OSNs to odorants with and without the treatment of LY 294002 were recorded by LAPS. The results show that the enhancive effect of LY 294002 was recorded efficiently by LAPS and the responses of this OSNs-LAPS hybrid biosensor were enhanced by LY 294002 by about 1. 5 -fold. We conclude that this method can enhance the responses of OSNs-LAPS hybrid biosensors, which may provide a novel strategy for the bioelectrical <b>signal</b> <b>monitor</b> of OSNs in biosensors.

30|$|The {{aforementioned}} researches of IBC channel {{characteristics were}} mainly {{focused on the}} design of channel circuit models, the experimental design, data analysis, and the electromagnetic characteristics of human tissues. However, they didn’t consider {{the pros and cons of}} various modulation methods and the ISI of IBC channel. The research of energy efficiency and low power consumption for a wireless body area network (WBAN) started at the end of the 20 th century. In 2008, Omeni et al. [19] firstly studied the problem of energy efficiency of WBAN from the viewpoint of protocol, and they proposed a new MAC protocol of energy efficiency. In 2012, Prabh [20] achieved time synchronization and combination with the existing TDMA protocol by its own electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, and proposed a BAN MAC, which was another breakthrough of MAC design for WBAN. In 2013, S. Hayat [21] proposed an energy-efficient MAC protocol for WBAN. At the same year, Ramona Rosini [22] researched channel measurement and MAC performance evaluation on the surface of the human body in a WBAN. The majority of MAC protocols were based on TDMA or CSMA/CA according to previous researches on MAC protocols. A multi-node physiological <b>signal</b> <b>monitor</b> and transmission system using the channel characteristics of IBC were assumed as the application scenario, and two common protocols were chosen to calculate and compare the bit energy consumption of IBC at the same application situation.|$|E
30|$|In this research, {{to obtain}} the {{attenuation}} properties of IBC, in vivo experiments with 7 volunteers were carried out in a frequency band range from 10  kHz to 500  kHz, and the results have indicated that human body channel attenuation can be equivalent to a band-pass filter characteristic. In addition, the equalizer which effectively reduced ISI was designed according to the frequency-selective fading characteristic {{of the human body}} channel. Then an IBC base band modulation simulation model was established based on human body channel characteristic, and the BER of different modulation methods were also evaluated and compared with each other. The results indicated that when higher band utilization was not required, FSK had lower BER and could better conform to the requirements of an IBC system. Moreover, FSK would not easily be affected by a change of channel parameters. To investigate the energy consumption of the MAC layer based on TDMA and CSMA/CA, a multi-node physiological <b>signal</b> <b>monitor</b> and transmission system was designed using the proposed band-pass filter characteristics of the human body to compare the power consumption of MAC layer based on TDMA and CSMA/CA. An FSK modulation-demodulation method was applied in the system. The outcome showed that TDMA had lower power consumption, but the number of nodes was easier to change under CSMA/CA because each node had the same priority. Considering the different priorities of human physiological signals and the lower power consumption, an FSK method with TDMA is more suitable for human communication in health care systems.|$|E

30|$|Intra-body {{communication}} (IBC), {{using the}} human body as the channel to transmit data, has lower power consumption, less radiation, and easier linking than common wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and ANT+. As a result, IBC is greatly suitable for body area network (BAN) applications, such as the medical and health care field. Furthermore, IBC can be implemented in wearable devices, including smart watches, sports bracelets, somatic game devices, and multimedia devices. However, due to the limited battery capacity of sensor nodes in a BAN, especially implanted sensor nodes, it is not convenient to charge or change the batteries. Thus, the energy effectiveness of the media access control (MAC) layer strongly affects {{the life span of}} the nodes and of the entire system. Certainly, analyzing MAC layer performance in a galvanic coupling IBC is of great importance for the overall system. To obtain the attenuation properties of IBC, in vivo experiments with seven volunteers were performed. Meanwhile, an equalizer was used to compensate the frequency distortion in consideration of frequency-selective fading characteristics of intra-body channels. In addition, a comparison of the bit error rates (BER) of different modulation methods was carried out to obtain the best modulation method. Then, the attenuation characteristics of intra-body channels were applied in a multi-node physiological <b>signal</b> <b>monitor</b> and transmission system. Finally, TDMA and CSMA/CA protocols were introduced to calculate the bit energy consumption of IBC in the practical scenario. With stable characteristics of the intra-body channels, QPSK with an equalizer had a better performance than the tests without an equalizer. As a result, the modulation method of FSK could achieve a lower BER in lower signal-to-noise ratio situations and an FSK method with TDMA for the IBC had the lowest energy consumption under different practical scenarios.|$|E
40|$|Electronically {{displayed}} {{images are}} becoming increasingly important as an interface between man and information systems. Lengthy periods of intense observation are no longer unusual. There is a growing awareness that specific demands should be made on displayed images {{in order to achieve}} an optimum match with the perceptual properties of the human visual system. These demands may vary greatly, depending on the task for which the displayed image is to be used and the ambient conditions. Optimal image specifications are clearly not the same for a home TV, a radar <b>signal</b> <b>monitor</b> or an infrared targeting image display. There is, therefore, a growing need for means of objective measurement of image quality, where "image quality" is used in a very broad sense and is defined in the thesis, but includes any impact of image properties on human performance in relation to specified visual tasks. The aim of this thesis is to consolidate and comment on the image measure literatures, and to find through experiment the salient properties of electronically displayed real world complex imagery that impacts on human performance. These experiments were carried out for well specified visual tasks (of real relevance), and the appropriate application of image measures to this imagery, to predict human performance, was considered. An introduction to certain aspects of image quality measures is given, and clutter metrics are integrated into this concept. A very brief and basic introduction to the human visual system (HVS) is given, with some basic models. The literature on image measures is analysed, with a resulting classification of image measures, according to which features they were attempting to quantify. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of image properties on human performance, using appropriate measures of performance. The concept of image similarity was explored, by objectively measuring the subjective perception of imagery of the same scene, as obtained through different sensors, and which underwent different luminance transformations. Controlled degradations were introduced, by using image compression. Both still and video compression were used to investigate both spatial and temporal aspects of HVS processing. The effects of various compression schemes on human target acquisition performance were quantified. A study was carried out to determine the "local" extent, to which the clutter around a target, affects its detectability. It was found in this case, that the excepted wisdom, of setting the local domain (support of the metric) to twice the expected target size, was incorrect. The local extent of clutter was found to be much greater, with this having implications for the application of clutter metrics. An image quality metric called the gradient energy measure (GEM), for quantifying the affect of filtering on Nuclear Medicine derived images, was developed and evaluated. This proved to be a reliable measure of image smoothing and noise level, which in preliminary studies agreed with human perception. The final study discussed in this thesis determined the performance of human image analysts, in terms of their receiver-operating characteristic, when using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) derived images in the surveillance context. In particular, the effects of target contrast and background clutter on human analyst target detection performance were quantified. In the final chapter, suggestions to extend the work of this thesis are made, and in this context a system to predict human visual performance, based on input imagery, is proposed. This system intelligently uses image metrics based on the particular visual task and human expectations and human visual system performance parameters. Thesis (Ph. D.)
