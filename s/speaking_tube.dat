5|$|The T-26 mod. 1931 did {{not have}} a radio set. The tank {{commander}} communicated with the driver by <b>speaking</b> <b>tube,</b> which was replaced with a signalling lamp in 1932. The T-26 was equipped with one fire extinguisher, a kit of spare parts tools and accessories (including a tank jack), a canvas stowage, and a tow chain fixed on the rear of the hull.|$|E
5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A <b>speaking</b> <b>tube</b> was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these problems, and the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{communication between}} diver and attendant was by pulls on the diver's lifeline. Later a <b>speaking</b> <b>tube</b> system was tried, {{but it was}} not very successful. A small number were made by Seibe-Gorman, but the telephone system was introduced soon after this and since it worked better and was safer, the <b>speaking</b> <b>tube</b> was soon obsolete, and most helmets which had them were returned to the factory and converted. In the early 20th century electrical telephone systems were developed which improved the quality of voice communication. These used wires incorporated into the lifeline or air line, and used either headsets worn inside the helmet or speakers mounted inside the helmet. The microphone could be mounted {{in the front of the}} helmet or a contact throat-microphone could be used. At first it was only possible for the diver to talk to the surface telephonist, but later double telephone systems were introduced which allowed two-divers to speak directly to each other, while being monitored by the attendant. Diver telephones were manufactured by Siebe-Gorman, Heinke, Rene Piel, Morse, Eriksson, Draeger and others. This system was well-established by the mid-20th century, and has been technologically improved, but is still in common use for surface-supplied divers using lightweight demand helmets and full-face masks.|$|E

The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} at about 6:00am Virginia, {{accompanied}} by , [...] and , got underway from Sewell's Point to finish off Minnesota {{and the rest of}} the blockaders, but were delayed sailing out into Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8:00am. In Monitor Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret. Samuel Howard, Acting Master of Minnesota, who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act). The <b>speaking</b> <b>tube</b> used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and captain's clerk Daniel Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene. As Virginia was approaching she began firing at Minnesota from more than a mile away, a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered, [...] "Tell Mr. Green not to fire till I give the word, to be cool and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elwood was {{powered by}} twin horizontally-mounted steam engines, {{each with a}} [...] bore and a 72-inch stroke. [...] The engines were {{manufactured}} by Iowa by the Dubuque Iron Works, and were of the Poppet-valve type. [...] The boiler had 186 [...] tubes, each [...] long. [...] The boiler was licensed to produce steam at 165 pounds pressure. [...] Engine room signals were given from the pilot house by <b>speaking</b> <b>tube,</b> and manual and electric bells.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a conventional tractor two bay biplane of all-wooden construction. The crew of two were accommodated in widely spaced cockpits, separated by the fuel tank. It was {{armed with a}} single forward-firing synchronised Vickers machine gun {{and one or two}} [...]303in (7.7mm) Lewis guns fitted on a Scarff ring fired by the observer. A bomb load of 460lb (210kg) could be fitted to external racks. While the crew arrangement gave good fields of view for the pilot and observer, it caused communication problems between the two crew members, particularly in combat, where the <b>speaking</b> <b>tube</b> linking the cockpits was of limited use.|$|E
2500|$|Buttrum's Mill is a six-storey tower mill with an ogee {{cap with}} a gallery. The tower is [...] {{diameter}} internally {{at the base}} and [...] diameter at curb level. It is [...] high to the curb. The brickwork is [...] thick at the base. The mill stands [...] to the finial, the tallest surviving mill in Suffolk. The cap is winded by a six-bladed fantail. The four Patent sails of [...] span are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, as is the cast-iron brake wheel with wooden cogs. This drives a cast-iron wallower carried on the cast-iron upright shaft. The wallower can be disengaged from the brake wheel to allow the mill {{to be driven by}} auxiliary power. Lower down the upright shaft a cast-iron crown wheel drives auxiliary machinery via layshafts. The cast-iron great spur wheel drives four pairs of [...] overdrift millstones. Two of the four pairs of millstones are controlled by a single governor. The mill is unusual in having a <b>speaking</b> <b>tube</b> connecting the floors. One of the pairs of sails is shorter than the other pair.|$|E

2500|$|By April 23, {{a strong}} wind had come up, and the high wheel house of Shoshone acted like a sail, blowing her {{from one side of}} the river to the other. At this time, Shoshone and her crew had reached the deepest part of the canyon, {{thousands}} of feet below the canyon rim. In preparation for running this section, they stopped to make further repairs to the sternwheel and gather more wood for fuel. While they were cutting trees, a log rolled over Captain Miller and he was knocked unconscious until the next day. Once he came to, the boat went on, although Captain Miller had been severely injured. They journeyed further downriver until they passed the mouth of the Salmon River on April 26. From then on the running was fairly easy, first to the mouth of the Grande Ronde River, where they halted alongshore. The next day, April 27, the easy running ended when at 7:00a.m. the boat reached the Wild Goose Rapids, which had a reputation as a fierce stretch of whitewater. Captain Miller took Shoshone through them without incident, and arrived at Lewiston, Idaho two hours later.

50|$|The first firm {{to begin}} {{commercial}} {{production of the}} ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800.

50|$|Voice pipes {{could be}} used over {{distances}} as long as 300 ft. However, very long <b>speaking</b> <b>tubes</b> might use an electrical signalling device to indicate a call, as the large volume of air in the pipe would {{make it difficult to}} blow with enough pressure to sound a whistle at the far end. Despite this, a pipe with a larger internal diameter was desirable for longer runs as the signal loss is inversely proportional to the pipe's cross-sectional area.|$|R
