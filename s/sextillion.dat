5|$|Gwendolyn: Marko's former fiancée, {{who joins}} The Will's {{pursuit of the}} family. Gwendolyn first appears {{at the end of}} issue #8, having been {{assigned}} by the Secretary General of Wreath High Command to check on The Will and helps him rescue Slave Girl from <b>Sextillion</b> in order to spur him to complete his mission. Marko and Alana's wedding rings, which also function as translator devices, were originally those of Gwendolyn's grandparents, who had the rings enchanted with a translator spell because they spoke two different dialects of Wreath's native language. She wears her grandparents' translation pendant around her neck, which was forged with the rings as part of the same set. She resists The Will's advances, though she reveals she loves him while attempting to get medical attention for him after he suffers a near-fatal injury.|$|E
25|$|Amplitude: Usually denoted h, this is {{the size}} of the wave— the {{fraction}} of stretching or squeezing in the animation. The amplitude shown here is roughly h = 0.5 (or 50%). Gravitational waves passing through the Earth are many <b>sextillion</b> times weaker than this— h≈ 10−20.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 and 1946, {{hyperinflation}} {{caused the}} issuance of notes up to 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 1020 pengő). During the hyperinflation, note designs were reused, changing the colour and replacing the word pengő with first milpengő, then b.-pengő, to generate higher denominations. The largest denomination produced was 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 1020 pengő). The note was initially worth about US$0.20. Notes of one milliard b.-pengő (one <b>sextillion</b> or 1021 pengő) were printed but never issued.|$|E

50|$|Superman's overall {{strength}} is increased to immeasurable levels, as seen when he sneezed away an entire Solar System {{in a distant}} galaxy by accident, forcing him to evacuate to another distant galaxy whose Solar System and all signs of life had vanished eons ago due to a horrendous plague. Superman was also capable of effortlessly pulling Jupiter-sized planets weighing at <b>sextillions</b> of tons with just a chain connecting them, pulling them from a dying galaxy to a new one {{in order to save}} the inhabitants of said planets. After this, he merged with the Sword of Superman, which tied him to the entire Universe he was in.|$|R
60|$|But if {{the mere}} {{surface of the}} Earth eludes the grasp of the imagination, {{what are we to}} think of its cubical contents? It embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to at least 2 <b>sextillions,</b> 200 quintillions of tons. Let us suppose it in a state of quiescence; and now let us {{endeavor}} to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion! Not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may conclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our system—not the combined physical strength of all these beings—even admitting all to be more powerful than man—would avail to stir the ponderous mass a single inch from its position.|$|R
25|$|The first {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is a {{function}} of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200–400 billion stars in the Milky Way (2–4 × 1011) and 70 <b>sextillion</b> (7×1022) in the observable universe. Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of extant civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the mediocrity principle, by which the Earth is a typical planet.|$|E

500|$|Sophie: A six-and-a-half-year-old former sex slave, {{initially}} {{known only}} as Slave Girl, that The Will discovers on the pleasure planet <b>Sextillion.</b> He and Gwendolyn rescue her, after which the girl reveals she possesses the power of psychometry, with which she helps The Will track Marko and Alana. The Will decides to name her Sophie in issue #13, {{which is the same}} name as his sister. Vaughan has stated that Sophie was created to illustrate the horrific effects of war and as a critique of the sexualized portrayal of Princess Leia as Jabba the Hutt's slave in the film , explaining [...] "That's that character at her least sexy. There are slave girls in the world and they don't look like Princess Leia in a bikini." ...|$|E
500|$|Matter, dark matter, {{and dark}} energy are {{distributed}} homogeneously throughout the Universe over length scales longer than 300 million light-years or so. However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable Universe contains approximately 300 <b>sextillion</b> (3) stars {{and more than}} 100 billion (1011) galaxies. Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million (107) stars up to giants with one trillion (1012) stars. [...] Between the structures are voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33 million–490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, {{which in turn is}} in the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light years. The Universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc) across.|$|E
500|$|The Will: One of the {{freelance}} bounty hunters {{hired by}} the Wreath High Command to kill Marko and Alana and bring Hazel back alive, not only for Marko's betrayal but also to prevent news of Alana and Marko's coupling from spreading and thus threatening troop morale. The Will {{is accompanied by a}} Lying Cat, a large talking feline that can detect lies. Vez, the woman who hires him, says she hired The Will because he shares Marko's moral relativism. When he travels to the sexually permissive planet <b>Sextillion</b> and is presented with a six-year-old sexual slave girl, The Will kills her pimp. The Will was once the lover of The Stalk, a female spider-like bounty hunter who is also assigned to Alana and Marko until she is killed by Prince Robot IV, for which The Will vows revenge. He develops an attraction to Gwendolyn even as he mourns The Stalk. His sister Sophie, who addresses him as [...] "Billy" [...] and who introduced him to The Stalk, is another Freelancer who works under the name The Brand. In the third story arc, he decides to abandon his Freelancer life but suffers a near-fatal injury. Although his life is saved at a hospital, it is said that he will likely never fully recover from the trauma.|$|E
