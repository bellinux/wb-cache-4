Several researches are being carried out to control the excess <b>sludge</b> production. <b>Sludge</b> <b>growth</b> process {{is a major factor}} to control the sludge production. Several observations are carried out to learn the information of <b>sludge</b> <b>growth</b> under several circumstances. One of the process was to observe the effect of light on sludge production performed by other researchers. Recently, the light emitting diode (LED) illumination is being used in different purposes including vegetable plantation. Here, we have observed <b>sludge</b> <b>growth</b> under LED illumination process with aerobic SBR plants. The white, blue and red LED illumination (each of 2 types) were used and the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>growth</b> and their waste water treatment abilities were investigated. We did not find any difference in pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in the activated sludge under LED illumination. But significant differences were found in <b>sludge</b> <b>growth</b> and sedimentation properties of activated sludge. Floc construction was disturbed by red / blue LED illumination. It degraded the SV 30 characteristics of the activated sludge. We have found that the <b>growth</b> of activated <b>sludge</b> was effected due to the different frequencies of LED illumination. <b>Index</b> Terms—Activated <b>sludge</b> <b>growth,</b> COD removal, LE...|$|R

40|$|We place tight {{constraints}} on the <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> γ by using the recent growth history results of 2 dFGRS, SDSS-LRG, VIMOS-VLT deep Survey (VVDS) and WiggleZ datasets. In particular, we investigate several parametrizations of the <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> γ(z), by comparing their cosmological evolution using observational growth rate data at different redshifts. Utilizing a standard likelihood analysis {{we find that the}} use of the combined growth data provided by the 2 dFGRS, SDSS-LRG, VVDS and WiggleZ galaxy surveys, puts the most stringent {{constraints on}} the value of the <b>growth</b> <b>index.</b> As an example, assuming a constant <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> we obtain that γ= 0. 602 ± 0. 055 for the concordance ΛCDM expansion model.

40|$|Objectives: To analyze factors {{associated}} with the clinical <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> of sporadic unilateral vestibular schwannoma and to evaluate {{the validity of the}} index as an indicator of tumor growth. Design: A retrospective case review study. Patients and methods: A series of 118 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannomas. Clinical <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> was calculated by dividing tumor size by the length of clinical history. Clinical <b>growth</b> <b>index,</b> tumor size, symptoms, and symptom duration were tested for a relationship with tumor location, patient sex, and age. All tests were performed for the total group and separately for three subgroups: intrameatal tumors (IT group, n[*]=[*] 46), intrameatal and extrameatal tumors (IET group, n[*]=[*] 60), and extrameatal tumors (ET group, n[*]=[*] 12). Results: Vestibular schwannoma diameter ranged from 3 to 40 mm (mean size, 14. 3 [*]±[*] 7. 6 mm). The maximum tumor diameter was significantly greater for the IET group (17. 9 [*]±[*] 6. 5 mm) and the ET group (19. 3 [*]±[*] 8. 5 mm) than for the IT group (8. 5 [*]±[*] 4. 3 mm) (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The mean clinical <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> was determined as being 31. 3 [*]±[*] 55. 7 mm/yr for the total group. A significantly lower clinical <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> was found for the IT group (14. 7 [*]±[*] 25. 3 mm/yr) compared with the IET group (41. 9 [*]±[*] 69. 2 mm/yr) and the ET group (43. 3 [*]±[*] 52. 4 mm/yr) (p[*]=[*] 0. 031). A significantly negative correlation between the clinical <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> and the age of the patients was noted for both the total group (p[*]=[*] 0. 010) and the IET group (p[*]=[*] 0. 017). A significantly negative correlation between the tumor size and the age of the patients was determined for the ET group (p[*]=[*] 0. 22).

40|$|AIMS: To {{develop a}} readily {{applicable}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) based technique which would permit the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from Bactec phials at an earlier stage than currently available methods. METHODS: Mycobacterial cells cultured in Bactec 12 B medium were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were lysed by heating in distilled water. Oligonucleotide primers based on the sequence of the gene coding for the immunogenic protein MPB 64 were then used to amplify a 240 base pair fragment of DNA directly from the crude cell lysate. The PCR product was visualised under ultraviolet light following electrophoresis of an aliquot in an agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The sensitivity of the PCR was adjusted so that about 600 cfu of M tuberculosis gave a positive result. The lowest <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> at which this method of identification might be applied to Bactec phials was determined {{and a number of}} routine cultures giving a positive <b>growth</b> <b>index</b> examined. RESULTS: M tuberculosis was positively identified at the lowest <b>growth</b> <b>index,</b> as determined by the Bactec system. Of 45 routine cultures examined, with <b>growth</b> <b>indexes</b> ranging from 6 to 999, the 15 confirmed by conventional means to contain M tuberculosis were correctly identified from 1 ml of culture medium. CONCLUSIONS: The method described can be used to identify M tuberculosis isolates cultured in the Bactec system at the earliest detectable rise in <b>growth</b> <b>index.</b> It may therefore allow cultured mycobacteria to be identified at an earlier stage than conventional methods or the commercially available DNA probes adapted for use with the Bactec system...|$|R
