40|$|A {{familiar}} task {{in industrial}} applications is grasping an object to constrain its motions. When the external forces and torques {{acting on the}} object are uncertain or varying, form-closure grasps are preferred; these are grasps that constrain all infinitesimal and finite motion of the object. Much of previous work on computing form-closures has involved achieving it with point-contacts; for a planar object, four point-contacts were proven to be necessary and sufficient. Inspired by the intuitive habit of supporting an object against something flat to immobilize it, {{in this paper we}} propose a new class of contacts called edge-contacts; these offer a <b>straight-line</b> <b>support</b> against which the object rests. Our first result is that almost any polygonal part can be constrained in form-closure with an edge-contact and two point-contacts. A related problem is that of immobilizing an object with modular fixtures. These typically comprise of a regular lattice of holes on which the object is placed [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} Michell cantilevers transmitting a given {{point load}} {{to a given}} segment of a <b>straight-line</b> <b>support,</b> the feasible domain {{being a part of}} the half-plane contained between two fixed half-lines. The axial stress σ in the optimal cantilevers is assumed to be bounded: − σ C ≤ σ ≤ σ T, where σ C and σ T represent the allowable tensile and compressive stresses, respectively. The work provides generalization {{of the results of the}} paper: T. Lewiński, M. Zhou, G. I. N. Rozvany, Extended exact solutions for least-weight truss layouts-Part I: Cantilever with a horizontal axis of symmetry. Int. J. Mech. Sci. 36, 1994, 375 - 398, to the case of σ T ≠ σ C. The present paper shows the analytical formation of the Hencky nets or the lines of fibres filling up the interior of the optimal cantilevers corresponding to an arbitrary position of the point of application of the given concentrated force. The analytical formulae for the virtual displacement fields are derived, thus enabling to find the minimal weights of the optimal structures. 2. Keywords: minimization of weight, Michell trusses, topology optimization A plane Michell structure is the lightest, fully stressed structure, contained within a certain feasible domain, transmitting a given load to a given line segment of a fixed support. The condition of the stresses being shifted to their extremes can be weakened without changing the optimal shape by assuming only that the stresses lie within the imposed limits: − σ C ≤ σ ≤ σ T since in the optimal structures considered the stresses achieve their extreme values: − σ C at compression and σ T at tension. We assume that the densit...|$|E
50|$|However, {{exploiting}} the computer-like {{capabilities of the}} TI-59 is a different matter. Although the TI-59 is Turing-complete, <b>supporting</b> <b>straight-line</b> programming, conditions, loops, and indirect access to memory registers, and although it supports limited alphanumeric output on the printer only, writing sophisticated routines is essentially a matter of planning machine language and using a coding pad.|$|R
40|$|It {{takes time}} for {{theoretical}} advances {{to get used}} in practical schemes. Anonymous cre-dential schemes are no exception. For instance, existing schemes suited for real-world use lack formal, composable definitions, partly {{because they do not}} <b>support</b> <b>straight-line</b> extrac-tion and rely on random oracles for their security arguments. To address this gap, we propose unlinkable redactable signatures (URS), a new building block for privacy-enhancing protocols, which we use to construct the first efficient UC-secure anonymous credential system that supports multiple issuers, selective disclosure of attributes, and pseudonyms. Our scheme {{is one of the first}} such systems for which both the size of a credential and its presentation proof are independent of the number of attributes issued in a credential. Moreover, our new credential scheme does not rely on random oracles. As an important intermediary step, we address the problem of building a functionality for a complex credential system that can cover many different features. Namely, we design a core building block for a single issuer that supports credential issuance and presentation with respect to pseudonyms and then show how to construct a full-fledged credential system with multiple issuers in a modular way. We expect this flexible definitional approach to be of independent interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} finding straight-line {{drawings}} for planar graphs with small area {{is an important}} aspect {{in the context of}} drawing planar graphs and it has been extensively studied. In this thesis we will study the problem of finding planar straight-line grid drawings with minimum area. Our contributions to this problem are as follows: First, we will show, that the problem of finding minimum area straight-line drawings is N P-complete. Then we will establish a non-trivial lower bound on the area of any grid <b>supporting</b> <b>straight-line</b> drawings of every tree with a given number of nodes. In order to come up with planar straight-line grid drawings with small area, we will study the possibilities of compactifying straight-line grid drawings which we obtained from Schnyder’s realizer method [38]. For this task, we will propose a new iterative compaction algorithm, which we will evaluate in an experimental study based on a sample of more than 5, 000 planar graphs, ranging from 50 up to 5, 000 nodes, which have been generated using a variety of different generators for planar graphs. We will show that a large class of planar graphs can be substantially compactified using the presented algorithm in acceptable time. Further, we will present an algorithm computing straight-line grid drawings with expected log-linear area for uniformly generated labeled trees. We will use this algorithm as an input to the compaction algorithm for trees...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} constants of the 1 : 1 complexes formed between Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, Zn 2 +, or Cd 2 + and AMPS 2 -, i. e., of the M(AMPS) complexes, {{were determined}} by potentiometric pH titrations (25 °C; I = 0. 1 M, NaNO 3). For the Mn 2 +/AMPS, Co 2 +/AMPS, Ni 2 +/AMPS, and Cd 2 +/AMPS systems also the protonated species M(H;AMPS) + were quantified, and for the Zn 2 +/AMPS system, {{the stability of the}} hydroxo species Zn(AMPS) (OH) -, which results from the Zn 2 +−thio coordination, could be determined. On the basis of previously established log versus p straight-line plots (R-MP 2 - = simple monophosphate ester ligands without further coordinating groups; Sigel, H.; et al. Helv. Chim. Acta 1992, 75, 2634), it is concluded that the alkaline earth ions in the M(AMPS) complexes are coordinated to the thiophosphate group with the same intensity as to a normal phosphate group. For the M(AMPS) complexes of Mn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, Zn 2 +, and Cd 2 +, it is shown by comparison with the corresponding M(AMP) complexes and by employing the mentioned straight-line plots that the stability increase is larger than may be expected due to macrochelate formation, which means that the metal ions also bind to the sulfur atom of the thiophosphate group. The stability increases amount for Mn(AMPS), Zn(AMPS), and Cd(AMPS) to about 0. 2, 0. 7, and 2. 4 log units, respectively, and the estimated approximate percentages of the sulfur-coordinated species are about 30, 80, and 100 %, respectively. Furthermore, comparisons between these stability increases and the solubility products for the corresponding metal ion sulfides, MIIS, {{as well as with the}} stability increases due to the M 2 +−thioether interaction observed for the complexes of tetrahydrothiophene- 2 -carboxylate, which also result in <b>straight-line</b> plots, further <b>support</b> the conclusions about metal ion−sulfur binding in the mentioned M(AMPS) complexes. The indicated correlations allow also an estimate for the extent of the M 2 +−sulfur interaction in Pb(AMPS) and Cu(AMPS). The various isomers of the M(H;AMPS) + species are analyzed in a microconstant scheme, and estimations about their formation degrees are presented; for example, for the Cd 2 + system, (H·AMPS·Cd) + is the dominating isomer, which has the proton at N 1 and Cd 2 + at the thiophosphate group. It is evident that for metal ions like (Mn 2 +), Zn 2 +, or Cd 2 + the metal ion binding properties of the parent compound AMP 2 - and its thio analogue AMPS 2 - differ considerably, and therefore, great care should be exercised in enzymatic studies where AMPS 2 - is employed as a probe for AMP 2 - in the presence of metal ions. Regarding studies of ribozymes, it is of interest that plots are presented (pseudo-first-order rate constants versus complex stabilities) which suggest that on top of a sulfur−metal ion interaction during the transition state of the rate-determining step of the hydrolytic cleavage of an oligonucleotide containing a bridged internucleotide 5 ‘-phosphorothioate RNA linkage also an oxygen−metal ion interaction occurs and that the two effects are “additive”...|$|R
