40|$|We examine {{episodes of}} large gross FDI inflows – surges – at the sectoral level between 1994 and 2009 for 95 emerging-market and {{industrial}} countries. We find that <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> {{the primary and}} manufacturing sectors are less cyclical and associated with lower macroeconomic volatility than <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the business and finance sectors. The likely explanation for this result {{seems to be the}} expansion of credit associated with these flows. Turning to the determinants of surges, we find that global and contagion factors have a stronger effect in the services than the manufacturing sector; <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> financial sector FDI are particularly contagious in emerging market countries. With regard to domestic factors, we find that (i) high public debt reduces the likelihood of experiencing FDI <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing and trade/transport sector, that (ii) high growth pulls in FDI in the manufacturing sector and that (iii) privatization is strongly associated with FDI <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing and financial sector. Finally, we document a role for capital controls: they tend to increase the likelihood of FDI <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing, other services, and financial sector. ...|$|R

Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates.

Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Being {{bordered by}} the South China Sea and with long coastline, the coastal zone of Guangdong Province is often under severe risk of storm surges, {{as one of}} a few re-gions in China which is seriously {{threatened}} by storm surges. This article systematically analyzes the vulnerability factors of storm <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the coastal area of Guangdong (from Yangjing to Shanwei). Five vulnerability assessment indi-cators of hazard-bearing bodies are proposed, which are so-cial economic index, land use index, eco-environmental in-dex, coastal construction index, and disaster-bearing capabil-ity index. Then storm surge vulnerability assessment index system in the coastal area of Guangdong is established. Ad-ditionally, the international general mode about coastal vul-nerability assessment is improved, and the vulnerability evo-lution model of storm <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the coastal area of Guang-dong is constructed. Using ArcGIS, the vulnerability zoning map of storm <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the study region is drawn.
