5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was nothing to be envied. <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> poverty, but <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E

25|$|Nadia {{left the}} House on Day 95, {{after she was}} given framed photos of her time in the House.

After a short while, she returned on screen and said that was a practical joke, and that she loved everybody really.|$|E

25|$|Garbo was a shy daydreamer as a child. <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> {{school and}} {{preferred}} to play alone. Yet {{she was an}} imaginative child and a natural leader who became interested in theatre at an early age. She directed her friends in make-believe games and performances and dreamed of becoming an actress. Later, she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre. At the age of 13, Garbo graduated from school, and, typical of a Swedish working class girl at that time, she did not attend high school. She would later confess she had an inferiority complex about this.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prussian victory at Königgrätz, Bismarck asked the Parliament {{for more money}} for the army, which raised a new {{controversy}} between the liberal parliamentarians. Frederick welcomed {{the creation of the}} North German Confederation, which joined Prussia and some Germanic principalities, because he saw that it was the first step toward German unification. However, the Confederation was far from adopting the liberal ideas of the Crown Prince. Despite being democratically elected, the Reichstag didn't have the same powers as a Parliament. In addition, local sovereigns were more interested in maintaining their prerogatives, and the new German constitution gave many powers to the now Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Less enthusiastic than her husband, Vicky saw the North German Confederation {{as an extension of the}} Prussian political system <b>she</b> <b>hated.</b> Nevertheless, she remained hopeful that this situation was temporary and that a united and liberal Germany could be created.|$|E

Crime rates in Gulfton decreased that year and Captain Charles Bullock, commander of the Southwest Patrol on Beechnut Street said that an increased police presence caused the crime rates to decrease.|$|E

500|$|The {{collaboration}} between Isola and Ratia was an [...] "unusual creative power game" [...] characterised by [...] "vitality and inventiveness" [...] {{rather than a}} harmonious understanding. The tone for this was set when, in 1964, Isola [...] "provocatively" [...] defied Ratia's statement that <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> floral patterns, setting {{the style of the}} company by painting the famous Unikko (Poppy) pattern in bold pink, red and black on white; the pattern has been in production ever since. It was one of some eight floral designs that Ratia chose from Isola's portfolio in that period.|$|E

Nevertheless, she [...] "wanted to live a life, and have purpose and things to write about" [...] due to her passion for writing music. Ryan described her musical style as a blend of neo soul, R and pop.|$|E
500|$|Olga was due {{to enter}} society {{in the summer of}} 1899, but after the death of her brother George at the age of 27, her first {{official}} public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900. <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, [...] "I felt as though I were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time." [...] From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown dolman.|$|E

She attended Beverly Hills High School (which she later admitted <b>she</b> <b>hated),</b> where she was [...] "something of a loner", and unsuccessfully tried out for several plays. John Ingle, formerly the chairman of the Beverly Hills High School art department, later commented that Kavner was [...] "excellent at improvisation, but she wasn't an ingenue and not that castable at that age".|$|E
500|$|You Can Dance is {{the first}} remix album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on November 17, 1987, by Sire Records. The album contains remixes of tracks from her first three studio albums—Madonna (1983), Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986)— and a new track, [...] "Spotlight". In the 1980s, remixing was still a new concept and technology, by which a particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed {{up and down in}} pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass. Madonna became interested in the concept, noting that <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> when others remixed her songs and wanted to do it by herself.|$|E
