40|$|Tomur National Nature Reserve (TNNR) {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{reserves}} in northwestern China containing the endangered <b>snow</b> <b>leopards.</b> But only a few <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> signs were found here by Schaller in 1988. And it was reported that more than 10 <b>snow</b> <b>leopards</b> were illegally killed by local herders the next year after Schaller's survey, so the <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> was assumed to have nearly disappeared in this nature reserve. From October to November 2004 and October to December 2005, we conducted <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> sign surveys in four major valleys in TNNR using the <b>Snow</b> <b>Leopard</b> Information Management System (SLIMS).

Sign transects, covering a total linear distance of 19. 4 km, revealed an average density of 5. 8 signs per kilometer, which compares with those from other <b>Snow</b> <b>Leopard</b> range countries.

40|$|The {{endangered}} <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> {{is a large}} felid that {{is distributed}} over 1. 83 million km 2 globally. Throughout its range it relies on {{a limited number of}} prey species {{in some of the most}} inhospitable landscapes on the planet where high rates of human persecution exist for both predator and prey. We reviewed 14 published and 11 unpublished studies pertaining to <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> diet throughout its range. We calculated prey consumption in terms of frequency of occurrence and biomass consumed based on 1696 analysed scats from throughout the <b>snow</b> <b>leopard’s</b> range. Prey biomass consumed was calculated based on the Ackerman’s linear correction factor. We identified four distinct physiographic and <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> prey type zones, using cluster analysis that had unique prey assemblages and had key prey characteristics which supported <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> occurrence there. Levin’s index showed the <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> had a specialized dietary niche breadth. The main prey of the <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> were Siberian ibex (Capra sibrica), blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), argali (Ovis ammon) and marmots (Marmota spp).

40|$|Kyle McCarthyFood {{availability}} {{is widely}} recognized as a primary threat to <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> (Panthera uncia) populations throughout their range. Effective conservation of <b>snow</b> <b>leopards</b> therefore depends upon reliable knowledge of their food habits. Unfortunately, past food habit studies may be inherently biased by the inclusion of non-target species in fecal analysis. Differentiation between <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> and sympatric carnivore scat is now cost-effective and reliable using genetic tools. In this study, we leverage fecal DNA analysis to both assess and remove bias in <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> food habit studies. We first analyzed presumed <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> scats collected from Central Asia, using standard microscopy methods to identify prey species based on medullar and cuticular characteristics of guard hairs found in the scats. We then estimated food habits for each study site {{under the assumption that}} all collected feces were of <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> origin. We then subset the data to include only <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> scats, as verified through fecal DNA, allowing us to compare results and estimate bias. Fecal samples from the four study locations ranged from 21 - 64 % <b>snow</b> <b>leopard.</b> Analyzing all collected scats overestimated the percent occurrence, biomass, and number of small mammals consumed and underestimated these measures for large ungulates in <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> diet. Our results show that, lacking genetic analysis of collected fecal samples, scientists likely include a large percentage of scats originating from other predators, thus altering the results of their studies. This could erroneously shift the target of conservation to more small mammals and fewer ungulates than truly required for a <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> population. Wildlife Conservatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{endangered}} <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> {{is found}} throughout major mountain ranges of Central Asia, including the remote Himalayas. However, {{because of their}} elusive behavior, sparse distribution, and poor access to their habitat, {{there is a lack}} of reliable information on their population status and demography, particularly in Nepal. Therefore, we utilized noninvasive genetic techniques to conduct a preliminary <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> survey in two protected areas of Nepal. Results A total of 71 putative <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> scats were collected and analyzed from two different areas; Shey Phoksundo National Park (SPNP) in the west and Kangchanjunga Conservation Area (KCA) in the east. Nineteen (27 %) scats were genetically identified as <b>snow</b> <b>leopards,</b> and 10 (53 %) of these were successfully genotyped at 6 microsatellite loci. Two samples showed identical genotype profiles indicating a total of 9 individual <b>snow</b> <b>leopards.</b> Four individual <b>snow</b> <b>leopards</b> were identified in SPNP (1 male and 3 females) and five (2 males and 3 females) in KCA. Conclusions We were able to confirm the occurrence of <b>snow</b> <b>leopards</b> in both study areas and determine the minimum number present. This information can be used to design more in-depth population surveys that will enable estimation of <b>snow</b> <b>leopard</b> population abundance at these sites. </p...|$|R
