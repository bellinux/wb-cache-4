40|$|A {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} so-called smectic Q mesophase was performed on nine different chiral compounds. Not less than four different structures were observed, and they all belong to the crystal of defects class. The defects of the liquid crystalline organization are stacked in three dimensional crystalline lattices of tetragonal or hexagonal symmetries, and the lattice constants {{are in the range}} of 65 – 130  Å. In all cases but one, the constitutive defects are twist grain boundaries in a smectic <b>structure</b> <b>with</b> <b>twist</b> angles of π/ 2 or π/ 3. The fourth phase organization has to be compared to that of blue phase and it can be considered as a stack of double twist clusters...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) {{and its effect}} on the evolution of texture during uniaxial compression of a creep-resistant cast Mg- 4 Al- 2 Ba- 2 Ca alloy in the temperature range of 260 – 500 °C and strain rate range of 0. 0003 – 10 s− 1 has been studied using transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction techniques with a view to understand its mechanism. For this purpose, a processing map has been developed for this alloy, which revealed two domains of DRX in the temperature and strain rate ranges of: (1) 300 – 390 °C/ 0. 0003 – 0. 001 s− 1 and (2) 400 – 500 °C/ 0. 0003 – 0. 5 s− 1. In Domain 1, DRX occurs by basal slip and recovery by dislocation climb, as indicated by the presence of planar slip bands and high dislocation density leading to tilt boundary formation and a low-intensity basal texture. On the other hand, DRX in Domain 2 occurs by second order pyramidal slip and recovery by cross-slip since the microstructure revealed tangled dislocation <b>structure</b> <b>with</b> <b>twist</b> boundaries and randomized texture. The high volume content of intermetallic phases Mg 21 Al 3 Ba 2 and (Al,Mg) 2 Ca eutectic phase is considered to be responsible for the observed hot deformation behavior...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} strong {{symplectic}} fillability and Stein fillability of some tight contact structures on negative parabolic and negative hyperbolic torus bundles over the circle. For the universally tight contact <b>structure</b> <b>with</b> <b>twisting</b> π in S^ 1 -direction on a negative parabolic torus bundle, we completely determine its strong symplectic fillability and Stein fillability. For the universally tight contact <b>structure</b> <b>with</b> <b>twisting</b> π in S^ 1 -direction on a negative hyperbolic torus bundle, we give {{a necessary condition}} for it being strongly symplectically fillable. For the virtually overtwisted tight contact structure on the negative parabolic torus bundle with monodromy -T^n (n< 0), we prove that it is Stein fillable. By the way, we give a partial answer to a conjecture of Golla and Lisca. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} studies of helical Bacillus subtilis macrofibers reveal that a {{spectrum}} of twisted states exists ranging from tight left-handed <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> <b>twist</b> equal to approximately equal to 40 left turns per mm to tight right-handed <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> <b>twist</b> equal to 57 right turns per mm. In the lytic-deficient strain FJ 7, twist varies {{as a function of}} growth temperature above or below 39 degrees C, where there is zero twist. The relationship between the temperature (below 39 degrees C) at which right-hand structures are produced to the time it takes for them to begin the inversion process in which they become left-handed following transfer to 48 degrees C reveals that <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> less <b>twist</b> are more rapidly converted to left-handedness than are those with higher values of twist. The initial response of live macrofibers to digestion by lysozyme consists of "relaxation" motions in which the twist of both left- and right-handed structures changes towards the right-hand end of the spectrum. The rate of relaxation is approximately equal to 5 -fold higher at the left-hand end than at the right-hand end. These findings suggest that cell wall polymers can assume a range of structural states during helical growth and that these determine the quantitative aspects of macrofiber shape as well as the sensitivity of walls to attack by lysozyme...|$|R

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{topic is}} that of metamaterials imparting chiral responses which invoke a disparity between opposite handednesses of circularly polarised (CP) light. Most chiral metamaterials are either 3 D-helical structures [1] or stacked metallic <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> <b>twisted</b> orientations [2]. These structures allow selective transmission of one CP whilst prohibiting or reflecting the other, termed Circular Dichroism. However, for 2 D chiral metamaterials, this is not so. Instead, the cross-polarisation conversion of one CP to another is different. The original work in [3] used an anisotropic lossy planar-chiral “fish-scale” structure to exhibit this effect, termed Asymmetric Transmission (AT). However, these responses are small with efficiencies less than 25...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a possibility to generate localized states in effectively one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates {{with a negative}} scattering length {{in the form of}} a dark soliton in the presence of an optical lattice (OL) and/or a parabolic magnetic trap. We connect such <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> <b>twisted</b> localized modes (TLMs) that were previously found in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Families of these structures are found as functions of the OL strength, tightness of the magnetic trap and chemical potential, and their stability regions are identified. Stable bound states of two TLMs are also found. In the case when the TLMs are unstable, their evolution is investigated by means of direct simulations, demonstrating that they transform into large-amplitude fundamental solitons. An analytical approach is also developed, showing that two or several fundamental solitons, with the phase shift π between adjacent ones, may form stable bound states, with parameters quite close to those of the TLMs revealed by simulations. TLM structures are also found numerically and explained analytically in the case when the OL is absent, the condensate being confined only by the magnetic trap...|$|R

40|$|We {{comment on}} the recent paper by Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard (arXiv: 1105. 0928, 2011), who suggest, as an {{alternative}} to the bulge + long bar hypothesis in the inner 4 kpc of our Galaxy, a single boxy-bulge <b>structure</b> <b>with</b> a <b>twisted</b> major axis. In principle, we find this proposal acceptable; indeed, from a purely morphological point of view, this is more a question of semantics than science, and possibly all of us are talking about the same thing. However, we think that the particular features of this new proposal of a "single twisted bulge/bar" scenario leaves certain observational facts unexplained, whereas the model of a misaligned bulge + long bar successfully explains them.

40|$|We report {{equilibrium}} dialysis {{and electric}} dichroism {{studies of the}} two strong complexes (I and II) of silver ion with DNA. Cooperative conversion of DNA to the stronger type I complex results in a 9 % length decrease, and a structure in which intercalated ethidium is perpendicular to the helix axis. Upon addition of more Ag+ to form the type II complex, the DNA length reverts to its original value and bound ethidium once again becomes tilted from the plane perpendicular to the helix axis. In both type I and type II Ag (I) - DNA complexes, ethidium binding is mildly cooperative.

40|$|Fixed wing micro air {{vehicles}} (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging {{due to the}} low Reynolds number regime (104 - 105) {{they operate}} in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to rolling instabilities. Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10 - 15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, {{and the range of}} stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> geometric <b>twist</b> (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and aerodynamic twist (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here. Recent investigations in static aeroelastic characterization, including flight loads, wing deformation, flow structures, aeroelastic-tailoring studies through laminate orientation, as well as unconventional techniques based on membrane pre-tension, are reviewed. Multi-objective optimization aimed at improving lift, drag, and pitching moment considerations is also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{preferred}} conformations of the methylsulphinyl group {{bonded to}} the heterocycles furan and thiophene {{have been studied}} with NMR techniques in solution. The presence of one halogen atom ortho to the methylsulphinyl group determines {{the orientation of the}} S-O bond in the opposite direction with respect to the halogen, and the degree of coplanarity of this bond with the ring depends on the substitution-pattern. The higher degree of coplanarity is found when the methylsulphinyl group and the halogen substituent are in position 3 and 4. Two ortho substituents determine <b>structures</b> <b>with</b> large <b>twists</b> of the methylsulphinyl group. The chemical shifts of H- 1, C- 13 and O- 17 nuclei of the methylsulphinyl group and referred to spectra in solution do not evidence trends of general validity for all the compounds examined {{as a function of the}} orientation of the methylsulphinyl group with respect to the ring. Such trends were present in the case of the corresponding phenyl derivatives. Nevertheless, by examining the behaviour of long-range (n) J(C,H) coupling constants, involving the carbon nucleus of the methyl group, together with chemical shifts, conclusions regarding the conformational behaviour of these molecules in solution can be derived.

40|$|High-level {{ab initio}} {{calculations}} {{show that the}} singlet photochemical cis-trans isomerization of organic molecules under isolated conditions can occur according to two distinct mechanisms. These mechanisms are characterized by the different structures of the conical intersection funnels controlling photoproduct formation. In nonpolar (e. g. hydrocarbon) polyenes the lowest-lying funnel corresponds to a (CH) 3 kink with both double and adjacent single bonds twisted, which may initiate hula-twist (HT) isomerization. On the other hand, in polar conjugated systems such as protonated. Schiff bases (PSB) the funnel shows a <b>structure</b> <b>with</b> just one <b>twisted</b> double bond. The ground-state relaxation paths departing from the funnels indicate that the HT motion may take place in nonpolar conjugated systems but also that the single-bond twist may be turned back, whereas in free conjugated polar molecules such as PSB a one-bond flip mechanism dominates from the beginning. The available experimental evidence either supports these predictions or is at least consistent with them...|$|R
