40|$|ABSTRACT: Fire {{formation}} and development {{can be defined}} as a specific num-ber of combustion reactions which take place in situ depending on several factors. It is important to notice two different processes: first, material reaction to fire and second, emission of fumes from the material subjected to overheating where optical density and toxicity are factors of concern. An improvement in fire behav-ior can be achieved by means of fire retardants and <b>smoke</b> <b>suppressants.</b> Fire re-tardants can act chemically by interfering with combustion radical chain reactions or physically by several methods, including developing a layer which protects the material from ignition {{on the surface of the}} substrate, giving off non-flammable gases (water vapor, hydrochloric acid, etc.) in order to dilute flamma-ble ones or displace the oxygen from the fire area in the gas phase and enhancing certain reactions (halides, phosphoric acid, etc.) such as endothermic reactions and surface dehydrations. On the other hand, <b>smoke</b> <b>suppressants</b> such as zinc compounds can also act physically and chemically (by formation of metal halides or oxyhalides in red-ox reactions) in the condensed and gas phases.

The results shown that, the flame retardancy and smoke suppression performance of PVC samples depend on the strength of the Lewis acid which generated in the first degradation stage and the stability of residue char in the second stage.

Both the limiting oxygen index and the vertical burning tests indicate that the CFA/APP system and LDHs have significant synergistic flame retardant effects. The morphology of combustion residues indicates that the many pores of residues can prevent the melt dripping. The thermal analysis shows that the flame retardants obviously enhanced the thermal degradation temperature of ethylene-based chains of the composites. The cone calorimeter test reveals that the CO 2 and combustion residues have an important influence on the reduction of heat release rate (HRR), the smoke production rate (SPR), the production rate and the mean release yield of CO.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nonhalogen {{compounds}} {{have been}} studied for improvements in the flame-proofing property and toxicity of flame retardants. Borate compounds have properties of multifunctional <b>smoke</b> <b>suppressants,</b> flame retardants, and afterglow suppressants. In this study, borate was coupled {{onto the surface of}} viscose rayon felt. Coupling and carbonization were confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red (ATR FTIR). The initial carbonization temperature was certified with ATR FTIR, elemental analysis of carbon, and thermogravimetric analysis. In the carbonization step, all chemical groups of the surface of the viscose rayon felt degraded to the various gases. Moreover, the weight percentage of the carbon element increased with increasing carbonization temperature. Initial rapid thermal degradation temperatures of viscose rayon prepared at various temperatures increased with the increasing reaction tem-perature. The activation energy was calculated with the Freeman and Carroll method. The activation energy of borate-coupled viscose rayon decreased much more than before coupling. However, the activation energy increased with the increasing carbonization temperature in the carbonization step. Viscose rayon borates showed higher limiting oxygen index (LOI) values and volumetric resistance rate values than viscose rayon phosphates. In this article, the relationship between the activation energy and LOI is studied. The synthesized viscose rayon borate is found to be highly effective as a flam...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{polyurethane}} (PU) foams {{are easily}} ignitable and show a high burning velocity, mainly {{due to their}} high surface area-to-mass ratio and high air permeability. Consequently, flame retardants such as halogenated compounds are applied. However, the use of halogenated flame retardants is not considered beneficial in transport applications, for example, aviation or automobile, {{in part due to}} the high smoke generation. Solid nonhalogenated flame retardants, for example, aluminum trihydroxide (ATH), are known as <b>smoke</b> <b>suppressants.</b> The application of ATH in flexible (PU) foam has not yet been reported in the literature. In this study, the application of different types and amounts of ATH and the resulting structure-property relationship in the foam are investigated. The increase in the viscosity of the filled raw materials during the foaming process and the negative effects of the filler on the mechanical properties of the final foam pose particular problems in the application of ATH. To pass the FMVSS 302 test, high amounts of ATH are necessary. To overcome the mentioned drawbacks, ATH particles are functionalized by 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane under different conditions. The synthesized products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis, and 29 Si and H- 1 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The silane-treated ATH particles show a significant decrease in viscosity of the ATH-polyol system of more than 20 % at ATH contents of up to 60 phpp. Values of the rising behavior during foaming and the burning velocity are not affected by this silane treatment. However, the compression test of PU foams with the silane-treated ATH particles show a decrease in compression strength of up to 20 % compared to untreated ATH particles in the flexible PU foam.

40|$|The fire {{retardant}} characteristics of additives based on mixtures of melamine hydrobromide-free radical initiator-basic bismuth carbonate (or antimony trioxide) are discussed {{on the basis}} of the dependence of oxygen index on composition in the case of polypropylene.

A 			number of organotin compounds {{have been shown}} to be toxic, and there 			is increasing concern regarding their widespread use in 			environmental and biological systems. Among organotin compounds, 			organotin carboxylates are highly important; these contain Sn 			bond formed through COO¯ group and have a number of interesting 			structural features and biological applications. 			Three groups of novel organotin(IV) carboxylates including mono-, di- 			and triderivatives of ligands: 3, 4 -methylenedioxy 			 6 -nitrophenylpropenoic acid (L 1), 3, 4 - methylenedioxyphenylpropenoic 			acid (L 2) and 2, 3 -methylenedioxybenzoic acid (L 3) were examined for 			their different biological activities. 			In vitro antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined 			against six pathogenic bacterial strains (antibacterial assay) and 			six pathogenic fungal strains (antifungal assay). Determined by the 			antimicrobial studies organotin(IV) carboxylates demonstrated a 			higher level of activity towards all tested bacterial and fungal 			strains than the respective free ligands. As a whole, antibacterial 			activities decreased in order of; diorganotin carboxylates tri-organotin 			carboxylates mono-organotin carboxylates ligand acids. However, 			tri-organotin compounds were the best towards antifungal activities. 			Since the organotin(IV) carboxylates inhibited the growth of 			micro-organisms, it has been assumed that the production of an 			enzyme has been affected, hence the micro-organisms were less able 			to metabolize nutrients and consequently, growth ceased. 			All the compounds were also investigated for their antitumor 			activities and cytotoxicity by crown gall tumor inhibition (potato 			disc) assay and brine-shrimp lethality bioassay, respectively. As 			determined by crown gall tumor inhibition assay and brineshrimp 			lethality assay; the antitumor or cytotoxic activities of these 			compounds fall in the order of; tri-organotin carboxylates 			di-organotin carboxylates mono-organotin carboxylates, a similar 			pattern is reported in literature. Such compounds may yield new 			leads for the development of antitumor drugs, which can display a 			different spectrum of antitumor activity. 			A panel of different mono-, di- and tri-organotin(IV) carboxylates 			that have higher biological activities in previous assays were 			selected to investigate their effect on MCF- 7 cells. Determined by 			the clonogenic assay, organotin(IV) compounds (0. 1 µg/ml, 1. 0 µg/ml 			or 10. 0 µg/ml) were markedly cytotoxic following treatment of MCF- 7 			cells with 1. 0 µg/ml particularly tri-organotin carboxylates. 			Further investigation was aimed to determine genotoxic effect and 			biochemicalcell fingerprint of MCF- 7 cells following treatment with 			selected panel of mono-, di- and tri-organotin(IV) carboxylates 			(0. 01 µg/ml, 0. 1 µg/ml or 1. 0 µg/ml) that were used in clonogenic 			assay. Induction of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) were measured by 			using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay and 			their relative micronucleus-forming activities using the cytokinesis-block 			micronucleus (CBMN) assay as well as alterations in biochemical-cell 			signatures was ascertained using attenuated total reflection fourier 			transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. 			In comet analysis, although there were marked fluctuations in the 			background levels of DNA SSBs measurable in control MCF- 7 cell 			populations, a remarkable consistency in the ability of all the 			organotin(IV) carboxylates to be comet-forming was noted. However, 			with the alkaline comet assay it was more difficult to distinguish 			between the relative abilities of tri-organotin carboxylates, 			di-organotin carboxylates or mono-organotin carboxylates to induce 			elevations in DNA SSBs. Probably as a consequence of their lower 			relative cytotoxicities, higher levels of micronucleus-forming 			activities were observed following treatment with either mono- or 			di-organotins as compared to tri-organotins. Following interrogation 			of treated-cell populations compared to control using ATR-FTIR 			spectroscopy, infrared spectra (900 1800 cm- 1) derived from 			organotin-treated MCF- 7 cells exhibited clear alterations in their 			biochemical-cell fingerprint following exposures as low as 0. 0001 			µg/ml; this was especially evident in the DNA/RNA spectral region (			 1490 1000 cm- 1).

Cu 2 O, CuO, and SnO 2 were the main active ingredients in waste PCBs-derived flame retardants. A conversion of Cu elements (Cu- 0 -> Cu+-> Cu 2 +) during SCWO process with the increase of reaction temperature was found to be the key influence factor for the flame retarding properties of SCWO-treated PCBs. The experiment results also showed that there was a synergistic effect of flame retardancy between Cu+ and Cu 2 +. After the optimized SCWO treatment, SCWO-treated PCBs significantly improved the flame retardancy and smoke suppression of PVC. Limiting oxygen index (LOI) and char yield (CY) increased with increasing SCWO-treated PCBs content in PVC, while smoke density rating (SDR) and maximum smoke density (MSD) decreased markedly.
