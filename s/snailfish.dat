5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal <b>snailfish</b> (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E

The fish were 30 centimetres long (12in), and were darting about, using vibration sensors on their nose to catch shrimps. [...] The team also reported that {{the appearance of the}} fish, unlike that of most deep sea fish, was surprisingly [...] "cute", and that they were surprised by how active the fish were at these depths.|$|E

5000|$|The fish is colored {{light brown}} to yellow and has dark brown to reddish spots on its body {{as well as}} its median fins. Its body is {{described}} as slender but not humpbacked. The festive <b>snailfish's</b> head is wide and has a depression. The head's width is nearly equal to its depth. The mouth is small, with its cleft mereley extending below the posterior nostril. Its teeth are trilobed, and each lobe is equally sized. Its upper jaw is slightly longer than its lower jaw. The snout is practically horizontal and blunt at the tip. The fish's chin pores are small and set closely to one another. The festive <b>snailfish's</b> gill opening is also small.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{information on}} diet {{and distribution of}} larval <b>snailfishes</b> from the genus Liparis on the Canadian Beaufort Sea Shelf. In this study, 153 larval <b>snailfishes</b> of three species, Liparis fabricii, L. gibbus and L. tunicatus, were collected during 4 summer cruises (2003 – 2005, 2007). The majority of the larvae were either in flexion or post-flexion stage, and some were in pre-flexion stage. Liparis larvae appeared to be generalists in terms of diet and fed {{on a wide range}} of planktonic organisms. Pre-flexion larvae fed on small copepods (mainly adult stages of Triconia borealis). As larvae grew their diet shifted towards larger copepods (copepodids III/IV of Calanus hyperboreus, copepodids II–IV of Calanus glacialis and females of Metridia longa) and amphipods (Themisto libellula). Remarkably, larvaceans Oikopleura spp. and pelagic snails Limacina helicina made up a substantial part of the larval diet.
