Neither the two nor any other witness who took the <b>stand</b> <b>that</b> day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Luna's death, {{confusion}} reigned on both sides. The Americans {{even thought}} Luna {{had taken over}} to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García {{said that it was}} he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his <b>stand</b> <b>that</b> {{he had nothing to do}} with the assassination of Luna.|$|E
5|$|In August 1987, at {{the annual}} B.C. Open hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for {{competition}} in both divisions.

The men's division, by contrast, had no similar dress code. Balukas took a <b>stand</b> <b>that</b> the women should not be treated differently from the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.|$|E

5|$|The West Stand, which {{initially}} had {{a capacity}} of 6,500, was built in 2001. A reception area, club offices, media centre, banqueting suites, hospitality area and changing rooms {{are located in the}} West Stand. The capacity of the West Stand was reduced slightly when the new East Stand was constructed in 2010, as the pitch was widened during this development. The East Stand, which is the newest part of the stadium, was built in 2010. It is the only <b>stand</b> <b>that</b> is not split into two tiers and has {{a capacity of}} 6,400. The decision to build the East Stand as a single tier was taken to maintain the character of the old terrace, which had been a simple viewing area without many facilities.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening <b>stand</b> <b>that</b> had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.|$|E
5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K <b>Stand</b> <b>that</b> is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{first-class}} season, Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1/91 for the Board President's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series, and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen. He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy. He played in four matches and performed strongly, taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20. He started the season with 6/85 and 1/34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh, and then took 4/42 and 1/46 against Railways. He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra. Pathan took 5/64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead. After taking 1/61 in the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand. In his final Ranji fixture for the season, he took 7/35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77, setting up an innings win. However, with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy, Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England. Pathan's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty. Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs, he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He took 0/57 from ten overs in the fifth match, as India recorded another victory, but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled. Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka, but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3–0 lead. He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches, but was again expensive, conceding 7.06 runs an over. However, he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket <b>stand</b> <b>that</b> saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry; Irfan ended on 33 not out. Pathan returned to India and took 3/50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season, which ended in a win, before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand.|$|E
