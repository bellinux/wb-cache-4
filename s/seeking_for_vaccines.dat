40|$|ObjectivesBecause of high {{purchase}} costs of newer vaccines, financial risk to private vaccination providers has increased. We assessed among pediatricians and family physicians satisfaction with insurance payment <b>for</b> <b>vaccine</b> purchase and administration by payer type, the proportion who have considered discontinuing provision of all childhood <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> financial reasons, and strategies used for handling uncertainty about insurance coverage when new vaccines first become available. MethodsA national survey among private pediatricians and family physicians April to September 2011. ResultsResponse rates were 69 % (190 / 277) for pediatricians and 70 % (181 / 260) for family physicians. Level of dissatisfaction varied significantly by payer type <b>for</b> payment <b>for</b> <b>vaccine</b> administration (Medicaid, 63 %; Children's Health Insurance Program, 56 %; managed care organizations, 48 %; preferred provider organizations, 38 %; fee for service, 37 %; P <. 001), but not <b>for</b> payment <b>for</b> <b>vaccine</b> purchase (health maintenance organization or managed care organization, 52 %; Child Health Insurance Program, 47 %; preferred provider organization, 45 %; fee for service, 41 %; P =. 11). Ten percent of physicians had seriously considered discontinuing providing all childhood vaccines to privately insured patients because of cost issues. The {{most commonly used}} strategy for handling uncertainty about insurance coverage <b>for</b> new <b>vaccines</b> was to inform parents {{that they may be}} billed for the vaccine; 67 % of physicians reported using 3 or more strategies to handle this uncertainty. ConclusionsMany primary care physicians are dissatisfied with payment <b>for</b> <b>vaccine</b> purchase and administration from third-party payers, particularly public insurance <b>for</b> <b>vaccine</b> administration. Physicians report a variety of strategies for dealing with the uncertainty of insurance coverage <b>for</b> new <b>vaccines.</b> 5 U 48 DP 001938 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesCC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24567011 PMC 473102...|$|R

40|$|Mechanisms to {{increase}} {{access to health}} products are varied and controversial.

We also discuss issues that the Global Alliance <b>for</b> <b>Vaccines</b> and Immunisation (GAVI) face now that these new vaccines are available.
