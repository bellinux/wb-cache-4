5|$|Boy Scouts {{learn to}} use the ideals <b>spelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto ("Be prepared"), and the Scout slogan ("Do a good turn daily"). They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but {{they are expected to}} plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} of {{constant}} warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories {{as well as for}} assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were <b>spelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|The SS was {{regarded}} as the NSDAP's elite unit. In keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, {{in the early days}} all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of Aryan ancestry back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800. Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as <b>spelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg Laws. Other requirements were complete obedience to the Führer and a commitment to the German people and nation. Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria. Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS, since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.|$|E

25|$|Over time, {{the real}} reason for the Hellgate treaty {{meetings}} became clear to the Salish and Pend d'Oreille people. Under the terms <b>spelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written document, the tribes ceded to the United States more than twenty million acres (81,000km²) of land and reserved from cession about 1.3 million acres (5300km²), thus forming the Jocko or Flathead Indian Reservation. Conditions had become intolerable for the Salish by the late 1880s, after the Missoula and Bitter Root Valley Railroad was constructed directly through the tribe's lands, with neither permission from the native owners nor payment to them. Charlot finally signed an agreement to leave the Bitterroot Valley in November 1889. Inaction by Congress, however, delayed the removal for another two years, and according to some observers, the tribe's desperation reached a level of outright starvation. In October 1891, a contingent of troops from Fort Missoula forced Charlot and the Salish out of the Bitterroot and roughly marched the small band sixty miles to the Flathead Reservation.|$|E

500|$|The {{battle for}} Brest was intense and very destructive. After {{two weeks of}} {{constant}} day and night attacks, Middleton's units forced the Germans into ever tighter positions. On 12 September, Middleton {{sent a letter to}} Ramcke offering him an opportunity to stop the bloodshed, and to surrender the city in a humane and reasonable way, with terms of surrender <b>spelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> letter. Ramcke's terse reply was simply, [...] "I must decline your proposal." [...] Unhappy with the response, Middleton directed his soldiers to [...] "enter the fray with renewed vigor...take them apart—and get the job finished." [...] One week later, on 19 September, the Germans surrendered to Middleton, who, with much of his staff, had 99 unbroken days of combat. In a formal ceremony, Middleton gave the city back to its mayor, and General Patton arrived to pin a Distinguished Service Medal oak leaf cluster on Middleton for outstanding conduct during the campaign in Brittany, resulting in the capture of Brest.|$|E
500|$|Clearly, Charles' interim {{solution}} could not continue. He ordered a general Diet in Augsburg {{at which the}} various states would discuss the religious problem and its solution. He himself did not attend, and delegated authority to his brother, Ferdinand, to [...] "act and settle" [...] disputes of territory, religion and local power. At the conference, Ferdinand cajoled, persuaded and threatened the various representatives into agreement on three important principles. The principle of cuius regio, eius religio provided for internal religious unity within a state: The religion of the prince became {{the religion of the}} state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince's religion were allowed to leave, an innovative idea in the 16th century; this principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution from every possible angle. The second principle covered the special status of the ecclesiastical states, called the ecclesiastical reservation, or reservatum ecclesiasticum. If the prelate of an ecclesiastic state changed his religion, the men and women living in that state did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post, although this was not <b>spelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agreement. The third principle, known as Ferdinand's Declaration, exempted knights and some of the cities from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practiced there since the mid-1520s, allowing for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. It also protected the authority of the princely families, the knights and some of the cities to determine what religious uniformity meant in their territories. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.|$|E
