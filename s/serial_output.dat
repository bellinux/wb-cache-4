50|$|During the 1950s, {{all three}} of these Flash Gordon serials were {{directly}} syndicated to television by Motion Pictures for Television, along with many of Universal's other <b>serial</b> <b>output.</b> To avoid confusion with the Flash Gordon TV series airing around the same time, they were retitled Space Soldiers, Space Soldiers' Trip to Mars, and Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe.|$|E
50|$|So the <b>serial</b> <b>output</b> of {{the entire}} {{register}} is 10110000. It {{can be seen that}} if data were to be continued to input, it would get exactly what was put in, but offset by four 'Data Advance' cycles. This arrangement is the hardware equivalent of a queue. Also, at any time, the whole register can be set to zero by bringing the reset (R) pins high.|$|E
50|$|The major {{difference}} between the YM2612 and the YM2608 is {{the removal of the}} original accumulator-equipped sound mixer, which mixed together the 14-bit floating point output of the FM channels, followed by <b>serial</b> <b>output</b> to a separate DAC chip. Instead, the YM2612 uses a simpler time-division sound multiplexer, which first truncates the 14-bit channel output to 9-bits, then loops through outputting each channel in sequence via a built-in DAC.|$|E

5000|$|An {{internal}} bidirectional 8-bit {{shift register}} enabled the CIA to handle serial I/O. The chip could accept serial input clocked from an external source, and could send <b>serial</b> <b>output</b> clocked {{with one of}} the built-in programmable timers. An interrupt was generated whenever an 8-bit serial transfer had completed. It was possible to implement a simple [...] "network" [...] by connecting the shift register and clock outputs of several computers together.The maximum bitrate is 500 kbit/s for the 2 MHz version.|$|E
50|$|The PISO (Parallel Input, <b>Serial</b> <b>Output)</b> block {{typically}} has {{a parallel}} clock input, {{a set of}} data input lines, and input data latches. It may use an internal or external phase-locked loop (PLL) to multiply the incoming parallel clock up to the serial frequency. The simplest form of the PISO has a single shift register that receives the parallel data once per parallel clock, and shifts it out at the higher serial clock rate. Implementations may also make use of a double-buffered register to avoid metastability when transferring data between clock domains.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the MITS Altair 8800, the EDUC-8 {{included}} two serial input and two <b>serial</b> <b>output</b> ports {{at the back}} of the computer. The EDUC-8 also had front panel lights and switches to program the computer. The later articles included a variety of peripherals, allowing the computer to interface to a keypad, octal display, paper tape loader, paper tape puncher, printer, keyboard, music player, teleprinter, magnetic tape recorder and alphanumeric display. The articles were collected into a book, where additional information was published detailing how to expand the number of I/O ports to 256, adding up to 32KB of additional memory, and using the computer to control various switches.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, digital {{calipers}} offer a <b>serial</b> data <b>output</b> {{to allow}} them to be interfaced with a dedicated recorder or a personal computer. The digital interface significantly decreases the time to make and record a series of measurements, and it also improves the reliability of the records. A suitable device to convert the <b>serial</b> data <b>output</b> to common computer interfaces such as RS-232, Universal Serial Bus, or wireless can be built or purchased. With such a converter, measurements can be directly entered into a spreadsheet, a statistical process control program, or similar software.|$|R

5000|$|The Fibre Channel 8b/10b {{coding scheme}} {{is also used}} in other {{telecommunications}} systems. Data is expanded using an algorithm that creates one of two possible 10-bit output values for each input 8-bit value. Each 8-bit input value can map either to a 10-bit output value with odd disparity, or to one with even disparity. This mapping is usually done {{at the time when}} parallel input data is converted into a <b>serial</b> <b>output</b> stream for transmission over a fibre channel link. The odd/even selection is done {{in such a way that}} a long-term zero disparity between ones and zeroes is maintained. This is often called [...] "DC balancing".|$|E
5000|$|As a {{simplified}} example a typical standard USB to serial adapter {{consists of a}} USB processor chip which processes the USB signals. The USB processor sends the processed USB signals to a serial driver chip which applies the correct voltages and sends the processed data signals to the <b>serial</b> <b>output.</b> [...] For the computer {{to be able to}} detect and process the data signals drivers must be installed on the computer. When the USB to serial adapter is connected to the computer via the USB port the drivers on the computer creates a virtual COM port which shows up in Device Manager. This virtual COM port can be accessed and used {{as if it was a}} built-in serial COM port. However, the characteristics of the virtual COM port are not exactly the same as a real internal COM port, mainly due to data latency; which means that if very sensitive and precise data transfer is required, the USB to serial adapter might be unreliable and not a desired solution. [...] Virtual COM drivers are usually available for Windows, Linux and MAC only.|$|E
50|$|Columbia {{made several}} serials using its own staff and {{facilities}} (1938-39, and 1943-45), but usually subcontracted its serial production to outside producers: the Weiss Brothers (1937-38), Larry Darmour (1939-42), and Sam Katzman (1945-56). Columbia built many serials around name-brand heroes. From newspaper comics, they got Terry and the Pirates, Mandrake the Magician, The Phantom. and Brenda Starr, Reporter; from the comic books, Blackhawk, Congo Bill, time traveler Brick Bradford, and Batman and Superman (although this last owed more to its radio incarnation, which the credits acknowledged); from radio, Jack Armstrong and Hop Harrigan; from the pulp novels the Spider and The Shadow (despite also {{being a very}} popular radio series); from the British novelist, Edgar Wallace, the first archer-superhero, The Green Archer; and even from television: Captain Video. Columbia's early serials were very well received by audiences—exhibitors voted The Spider's Web (1938) the number-one serial of the year. Former silent-serial director James W. Horne co-directed The Spider's Web, and his work secured him a permanent position in Columbia's serial unit. Horne had been a comedy specialist in the 1930s, often working with Laurel and Hardy, {{and most of his}} Columbia serials are played tongue-in-cheek, with exaggerated villainy and improbable heroics (the hero takes on six men in a fistfight and wins). After Horne's death in 1942, the studio's <b>serial</b> <b>output</b> was somewhat more sober, but still aimed primarily at the juvenile audience. Batman (1943) was quite popular, and Superman (1948) was phenomenally successful. Spencer Gordon Bennet, another silent-serial veteran, directed most of the later Columbia serials. His western-themed efforts were suitably accomplished, but Columbia cut corners in every respect until the quality of the serials suffered. Columbia also used cartoon animation instead of more expensive special effects with its science-fictional serials. By the 1950s Columbia serials were low-budget affairs, consisting mostly of action scenes and cliffhanger endings from older productions, and even employing the same actors for new scenes tying the old footage together. Columbia outlasted the other serial producers, its last being Blazing the Overland Trail (1956).|$|E
