5|$|Like every ant, {{the life}} of a jack jumper ant <b>starts</b> <b>from</b> an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant will be a female (diploid); if not, it will become a male (haploid). They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through a larva and pupa stage before emerging as an adult. Cocoons that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Newborns can also eclose (emerge from their pupa stage) without assistance from other ants. Once born, jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks, an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for.|$|E

5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player <b>starts</b> <b>from</b> the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
