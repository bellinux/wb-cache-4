However, in clinical practice mainly <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> remain used despite an unclear diagnostic value. We aimed to define the sensitivity and specificity of <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> compared to the PISA for the diagnostic of severe aortic regurgitation (AR). MethodsDegree of AR was prospectively evaluated using the PISA <b>method</b> and 4 <b>semi-quantitative</b> measurements (cardiac output (CO), pressure half time (PHT), vena contracta (VC) and diastolic flow reversal (DFR)) in 224 patients {{with a wide range of}} AR severity. Criteria for severe AR were an ERO 30 mm 2, a CO 10 l/min, a PHT < 200 ms, a VC 6 mm or a DFR 18 cm/ s. ResultsUsing the PISA method 76 patients (34 %) had severe AR. Sensitivity, specificity, VPP, VPN of the recommended thresholds of the 4 <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> for severe AR based on ERO are presented in the Table. Overall, <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> had a good specificity but a poor sensitivity except the VC which presented both a good sensitivity and specificity. ConclusionFor assessment of AR severity, current thresholds are specific but poorly sensitive except the VC which provides a correct discriminative value. Thus, <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> should be integrated in the comprehensive evaluation of AR severity but severe AR should not be excluded only based on semi-quantitative criteria. Our results emphasize the need for quantitative assessment of AR severity in clinical practice and may explain the better prognostic value of quantitative methods than traditional variables.

30|$|<b>Semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> gave a {{relatively}} {{narrow range of}} accuracy scores across all the methods tested, with {{a wider range of}} sensitivities and specificities. Deciding on the ‘best’ performing method depends on the intended application. In clinic for example, a higher specificity than sensitivity may be preferred such that the false positive rate is low. There is no method that stands out in terms of its performance. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that two of the methods which treat classification as a two class problem, generating cut-offs from both normal and abnormal putamenal SBRs (i.e. methods SQ 15 and SQ 17), produced some of the highest accuracy figures, with lower variance and well balanced sensitivity and specificity values. This is perhaps unsurprising as all other <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> (which are more reflective of commercially available tools) define cut-offs from the normal population only, with no knowledge of the distribution or likely crossover of abnormal data.|$|R

INA and RIA had similar accuracy, and provided comparable results. However, RIA has slightly greater sensitivity than INA, which is easier and faster. Good agreement was also found between RIA and the two ITA methods, although one of these overestimated RIA values in the low-medium range (5 - 30 mg/l) of urinary albumin. ITA seems suitable for initial screening of albuminuria in diabetic patients but more sensitive procedures (such as RIA and INA) seem preferable for measurement of UA concentrations in the normal range. The two <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> showed high sensitivity but poor specificity, {{because of the large}} number of false positive results.

The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze early experience in the use of CEUS for the measurement of activity and staging of CD. Material and Methods: Eleven patients previously diagnosed with CD were included in the study. They underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (SonoVue, Bracco), low-dose CT enterography (LDCTE), assessment of laboratory markers of inflammation and clinical CD activity index (CDAI). Contrast enhancement was evaluated using a <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>method</b> and a quantitative method that included measurement of peak enhancement (PE), enhancement curve rise time (RT) and wash-in-rate (WiR).

40|$|AbstractOccupational and {{environmental}} lung diseases are {{a group of}} pulmonary disorders caused by inhalation of harmful particles, mists, vapors or gases. Mineralogical analysis is not generally required in the diagnosis of most cases of these diseases. Apart from minerals that are encountered rarely or only in specific occupations, small quantities of mineral dusts {{are present in the}} healthy lung. As such when mineralogical analysis is required, quantitative or <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> must be employed. An electron probe microanalyzer with wavelength dispersive spectrometer (EPMA–WDS) enables analysis of human lung tissue for deposits of elements by both qualitative and <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods.</b> Since 1993, we have analyzed 162 cases of suspected occupational {{and environmental}} lung diseases using an EPMA–WDS. Our institute has been accepting online requests for elemental analysis of lung tissue samples by EPMA–WDS since January 2011. Hard metal lung disease is an occupational interstitial lung disease that primarily affects workers exposed to the dust of tungsten carbide. The characteristic pathological findings of the disease are giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP) with centrilobular fibrosis, surrounded by mild alveolitis with giant cells within the alveolar space. EPMA–WDS analysis of biopsied lung tissue from patients with GIP has demonstrated that tungsten and/or cobalt is distributed in the giant cells and centrilobular fibrosing lesion in GIP. Pneumoconiosis, caused by amorphous silica, and acute interstitial pneumonia, associated with the giant tsunami, were also elementally analyzed by EPMA–WDS.

These studies, however, besides being few in number, were conducted on adult populations. Our aim {{was to assess the}} regression of hepatic fibrosis, using morphometric assessment of fibrosis versus <b>semi-quantitative</b> <b>methods,</b> in children with AIH who achieved clinical and biochemical remission. Thirteen patients who achieved clinical and biochemical remission were included in the study, out of 62 children with AIH. Repeat biopsy was performed after 6 to 12 months of clinical and biochemical remission. Morphometric assessment of fibrosis was performed and correlated with METAVIR and Ishak semi-quantitative scores. Results The study group included eight male and five female patients. The median age at presentation was 4 years (range 2 to 12 years). The mean duration of treatment was 22 ± 7. 3 months, and the mean interval between biopsies was 26. 2 ± 6. 5 months. Following therapy, there was significant reduction in aspartate aminotransferase, ALT and IgG levels as well as improvement of necroinflammation. The mean fibrosis scores were significantly decreased from 4. 5 ± 1. 19 and 2. 9 ± 0. 7 before therapy to 2. 7 ± 1. 16 and 2 ± 0. 8 after treatment as assessed by Ishak and METAVIR scores, respectively (P = 0. 001 and 0. 004). The mean morphometric assessment of fibrosis before treatment was 20 % ± 9. 7 and following therapy it decreased to 5. 6 % ± 3. 9 (P = 0. 000).
