40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{bond and}} syndicated bank finance in the Euromarkets. It uses a comprehensive data bank on Euromarkets to evaluate alternative theories of financial intermediation. A model {{is estimated that}} provides a good description of firms' choice of finance. The paper concludes that Euromarkets are best described by control (`transactions banking') rather than commitment (`relationship banking'). Bank and bond markets are not perfect substitutes, however, even for large companies: the financing of high-risk projects requires the involvement of banks. Banks therefore retain a central function and the operation of bank syndicates {{is crucial to the}} financing of large corporations.

40|$|The {{volume of}} credit granted {{in the form of}} {{syndicated}} loans saw a marked downturn in 2008. This article seeks to understand how certain firms were nonetheless able to benefit from larger facilities or a lower interest rate than others. Using a sample of syndicated loans issued in 2008 in North America and Europe, and records of syndicated loans since 2003, we show that firms that had developed a relationship with an investment bank obtained a lower spread, but did not benefit from greater loan facilities or longer maturities. <b>syndicated</b> loans, <b>banking</b> relationship, <b>credit</b> rationing...|$|R
40|$|Since early 1984, note {{issuance}} facilities (NIFs) have {{in considerable}} degree replaced <b>syndicated</b> Eurocurrency <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> in international credit markets, especially for borrowers in industrial countries, because borrowers have found it cheaper to bypass bank syndications and obtain funds more directly by issuing Euronotes. Factors behind this include an increasing awareness of borrowing possibilities, more freedom for Japanese investors to buy foreign securities, {{a drop in the}} relative popularity of bank obligations with investors, and banks' desire to slow asset growth to improve capital ratios.; Measurement of the cost savings to borrowers on NIFs as compared with Eurocredits is difficult because of limited comparison possibilities. Most NIFs arranged so far have not been drawn on through issuance of notes, and few of the actual issuers have arranged LIBOR-priced Eurocredits recently. In the 12 cases, as of mid- 1985, where meaningful comparisons could be made, it appears that the cost savings to the borrowers ranged from about 10 to around 50 basis points. All of the savings were in the interest spread, where the NIFs appear to have been about 15 to 55 basis points cheaper. Fee costs were slightly higher on NIFs than on Eurocredits; although front-end fees are lower, the total fee costs for NIFs are higher because of the annual facility fee paid to banks that underwrite the NIF. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{banks are}} at the center of {{systemic}} risk, there are other institutions that contribute to it. With the publication of the leveraged lending guideline in March 2013, the U. S. regulators show that they are especially worried about the private equity firms with their high-risk deals. Given these risks and the interconnectedness of the banks through the LBO loan syndicates, I shed light on the impact of a bank’s LBO loan exposure on its systemic risk. By using 3, 538 observations between 2000 and 2013 from 165 global banks, I show that banks with higher LBO exposure also have a higher level of systemic risk. Other loan purposes do not show this positive relationship. The main drivers influencing this relationship positively are the bank’s interconnectedness to other LBO financing banks and its size. Lending experience with a specific PE sponsor, experience with leading LBO <b>syndicates</b> or a <b>bank’s</b> <b>credit</b> rating, however, lead to a lower impact of the LBO loan exposure on systemic risk...|$|R

40|$|Trade credits are an {{important}} financing tool for internationally active firms. This is surprising, as trade credits are generally more expensive than <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> and thus a costly substitute for bank financing. In this paper, we investigate the relation between trade <b>credits</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> for exporting firms. We develop a theoretical model and show that trade credits convey a quality signal which {{reduces the risk of}} the transaction and may thus facilitate obtaining additional <b>bank</b> <b>credits.</b> Thus, for exporters who are not able to obtain <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> in the first place, trade <b>credits</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> are complements. Using panel data on German manufacturing firms, we provide supportive evidence for our theoretical predictions. For financially unconstrained firms, trade <b>credits</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> are substitutes. For financially constrained exporters, instead, trade credits have a significantly positive effect on the availability of <b>bank</b> <b>credits...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impacts of {{commercial}} <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> on Nigeria industrial subsectors between 1972 and 2012. Econometric Error Correction Model (ECM) was employed to estimate the output response of the three subsectors namely: the manufacturing; mining and quarry; and real estate and construction subsectors to commercial <b>bank</b> <b>credits,</b> {{as well as the}} response of aggregate output of the entire industrial sector to subsector’s output and their commercial <b>bank</b> <b>credits.</b> The results of estimation indicate the following: commercial <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> impacted positively and significantly on the manufacturing sub-sector in Nigeria, commercial <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> to mining and quarry is a positive and significant determinant of the current year Mining and Quarry output in Nigeria, previous year <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> to real estate and construction is a positive determinant of the current year real estate and construction output, <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> to manufacturing, mining and quarry as well as <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> to real estate and construction correlated positively with aggregate industrial output with <b>bank</b> <b>credits</b> to real estate and construction having greater and a significant impact on industrial output. interest rate was not an important determinant of industrial sector and industrial sub-sectors outputs, exchange rate is a negative and significant determinant of industrial sector’s outputs in Nigeria.

40|$|Effect {{of credit}} on {{economic}} growth, unemployment and poverty provides evidence from Indonesia {{on the role}} of <b>banks</b> <b>credit</b> for promoting economic growth and reducing both unemployment and poverty. To document the link between <b>banks</b> <b>credit</b> and economic growth, we estimate a VAR model and variance decompositions of annual GDP per capita growth rates to examine what proxy measures of <b>banks</b> <b>credit</b> are most important in accounting for economic growth over time and how much they contribute to explaining economic growth.
