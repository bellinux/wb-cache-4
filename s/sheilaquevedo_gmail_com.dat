The dramatic {{changes in the}} line profiles are consistent with eccentric circumstellar gas rings undergoing general relativistic precession. As the argument of periapsis of the rings change relative to the line of sight, the transiting gas shifts from receding in 2016 to approaching in 2017.

Next, we apply these ideas to the AdS 5 × S 5 string and in later chapters discuss how to account for particu-lar integrable deformations. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence this gives an exact description of anomalous scaling dimensions of single trace operators in planar N = 4 supersymmetry Yang-Mills theory, its ‘orbifolds’, and β and γ-deformed supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also touch upon some subtleties arising in these deformed theories. Furthermore, we consider complex excited states (bound states) in the su(2) sector and give their thermodynamic Bethe ansatz description.

Existing literature proposes many different potential spread determinants but fails to agree on which of them are important. As a result, there is a considerable uncertainty about the cor- rect model explaining the spread. We address this uncertainty by employing Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The BMA technique attempts to consider all the possible combinations of variables and averages them using a model fit measure as weights. For this empirical exercise, we consider 44 different explanatory variables for a panel of 47 OECD countries for the 1980 - 2010 pe- riod. Most of the previously suggested determinants, including "public debt" or "budget balance", were attributed low inclusion probabilities.

This paper proposed a new approach for providing secured authentication using visual cryptography & stenography. In the proposed work, first user has to select one cover image (secret image). Then user has to create one secret question & also has to provide the answer of that secret question. The answer of that question is hiding in the cover image (using steganography) which is selected by the user. Then we will create the shares of this cover image through visual cryptography. The process of share generation is done at the server, during this process two shares are generated & one share is given to the user & another is stored in the server. During transmission if attack is performed on the share than it is not possible to recover any information from the single share. When the user want to login, user has to provide the username & in place of password, user has to upload the share, which is provided to him/her after the registration, than at the server side both share are superimposed, one which is provided to the user & another which is stored in the server, this superimposing or stacking will reveal the cover image (secret image).

40|$|Coral reefs are {{increasingly}} threatened by global and local anthropogenic stressors, such as rising seawater temperature and nutrient enrichment. These two stressors vary widely across the reef face and parsing out {{their influence on}} coral communities at reef system scales has been particularly challenging. Here, we investigate the influence of temperature and nutrients on coral community traits and life history strategies on lagoonal reefs across the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). A novel metric was developed using ultra-high-resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) to classify reefs as enduring low (lowTP), moderate (modTP), or extreme (extTP) temperature parameters over 10 years (2003 to 2012). Chlorophyll-a (chl a) records obtained for the same interval were employed {{as a proxy for}} bulk nutrients and these records were complemented with in situ measurements to "sea truth" nutrient content across the three reef types. Chl a concentrations were highest at extTP sites, medial at modTP sites and lowest at lowTP sites. Coral species richness, abundance, diversity, density, and percent cover were lower at extTP sites compared to lowTP and modTP sites, but these reef community traits did not differ between lowTP and modTP sites. Coral life history strategy analyses showed that extTP sites were dominated by hardy stress-tolerant and fast-growing weedy coral species, while lowTP and modTP sites consisted of competitive, generalist, weedy, and stress-tolerant coral species. These results suggest that differences in coral community traits and life history strategies between extTP and lowTP/modTP sites were driven primarily by temperature differences with differences in nutrients across site types playing a lesser role. Dominance of weedy and stress-tolerant genera at extTP sites suggests that corals utilizing these two life history strategies may be better suited to cope with warmer oceans and thus may warrant further protective status during this climate change interval.

40|$|A brief lexicon of stemmatology The Parvum lexicon stemmatologicum (PLS) is a {{scholarly}} digital resource providing explanations for technical terms related to stemmatology, a discipline of classical and mediaeval philology aiming at understanding the historical evolution of textual traditions. The PLS was initiated, {{within the framework}} of the Studia Stemmatologica research network, by Odd Einar Haugen, who was its editor-in-chief until May 15, 2015. The necessity of creating such a digital resource becomes evident if one realises that stemmatology is by nature an interdisciplinary discipline, using concepts and methods from a variety of different fields: linguistics, codicology, palaeography, book history, etc. In addition, stemmatology is at the same time an old discipline (dating back from the first half of the nineteenth century in its modern form and from the Hellenistic period in its most ancient attestations) and a discipline that has recently undertaken a methodological revolution, not only because of the digital turn in the humanities, but perhaps more importantly because of the influence of phylogenetics. The PLS attempts to address the challenge of integrating old and new concepts, and besides includes the presentation of methods and tools used in stemmatology and sometimes borrowed from other disciplines, such as computer science, mathematics or biology. Moreover, as any other venerable discipline of the humanities, stemmatology has developed according to more or less national schools or traditions, in which the same concepts are not always used in exactly the same way. The PLS tries to address this linguistic aspect by providing equivalents of the terms in French, German, Italian, and – where appropriate – Latin. The list of editors and contributors to the PLS reflects the multidisciplinary and multicultural dimensions of this collective scholarly endeavour. In the last weeks before the release of this version 1. 0 (Nov. 13, 2015), much of the work of reviewing this very complex dictionary has been taken up by Marina Buzzoni, Aidan Conti, Odd Einar Haugen, in addition to the two present editors.

H 2 and deltaD(H 2) are calibrated using one, two, or three laboratory reference air cylinders, depending on measurement period. The H 2 mixing ratio of the reference cylinders was determined by UHEI-IUP or MPI-BGC. The deltaD(H 2) of the reference cylinders is linked to the VMOW scale by measurements of air mixtures containing H 2 standards of known isotopic composition.

A new method is presented to minimize the parameterization error using the Rayleigh scattering limit relations multiplied with a rational polynomial function of reflectivityweighted raindrop diameter to approximate the Mie character of scattering. A statistical relation between the shape parameter of the DSD with the median volume diameter of raindrops is derived by exploiting long-term disdrometer observations. On the basis of this relation, new optimal estimators of rain microphysical parameters and rainfall rate are developed {{for a wide range of}} rain DSDs and air temperatures using X-band scattering simulations of polarimetric radar observables. Parameterizations of radar specific path attenuation and backscattering phase shift are also developed, which do not depend on this relation.

40|$|China Beat has run {{several pieces}} {{recently}} on the Xinjiang riots. On October 2, we featured Rian Thum’s “The Ethnicization of Discontent in Xinjiang,” which {{argued that the}} riots had raised ethnic tensions in the region. A few days later, we published “Islamic Fundamentalism: An Ignored Specter in the Xinjiang Riot,” written by Liang Zheng. Zheng argued that the foreign media had ignored indications that the riots were instigated by fundamentalists from southern Xinjiang, an argument that preserves the notion of ethnic harmony in Urumqi itself. Today we run a response to Zheng’s argument from Mark Elliott, Professor of Chinese and Inner Asian History at Harvard University. Further responses may be sent to thechinabeat <b>gmail.</b> <b>com.</b> With great interest and no little concern I read the recent post by Liang Zheng (“Islamic Fundamentalism: An Ignored Specter in the Xinjiang Riot,” 6 October), arguing that Islamic fundamentalism is behind the violent protests {{that took place in}} Urumqi this past July. If Mr. Zheng’s claims were true, that would indeed be cause for alarm on more than one level. Yet, because this is such a contentious point – dovetailing as it does rather neatly with the government’s line on discontent generally in Xinjiang and the justification given for “striking hard” against Uyghur dissent – the evidence should be examined extremely carefully. As far as I can tell, the evidence presented by Mr. Zheng seems to be little more than hearsay. Disregarding the argument that Xinjiang’s shared border with Afghanistan and Pakistan is prima facie evidence of fundamentalist influence, the assertions in the post regarding the spread of Islamic extremism to Xinjiang and the July violence are based mainly on the comments of the journalist and blogger Gheyret Niyaz,quoted in an interview in the August 2 issue of Yazhou zhoukan (English translation here). Gheyret says first that during one street protest in Urumqi he heard slogans being shouted for the imposition of Shari’a law and the establishment of an Islamic state. One would like to have independent verification of these claims, and to know whether similar calls were made at other locations. I myself am unaware of any confirmed accounts that this was the case, but perhaps other readers of China Beat have information they can provide? Gheyret {{goes on to say that}} since these goals coincide with those of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Islamic Liberation Party, or ILP), that organization must have helped to organize the protests. This seems to be mere inference. As further evidence of this involvement, he points to the fact that the people in the crowd of one hundred he observed that day were all wearing tennis shoes; that “they came together and dispersed in unison, in a highly organized way”; and that they spoke with accents identifying them as coming from Kashgar and Khotan. On this last point he is tentative, since, as he says, “I could not see if they had knives” (!). None of this seems convincing to me as evidence of a link to outside fundamentalist organizations. (A perusal of ILP’s UK website turns up no indication of any special interest in events in Xinjiang or support for the Uyghur cause. Quite the contrary: it approvingly reports the Pakistani president’s praise of the Chinese government’s handling of the unrest. ...|$|R

40|$|PE READ PREPARE: A paired-end {{preprocessing}} {{script for}} de novo genome assembly Manojkumar Selvaraju Introduction: Quality filtering of raw data forms the primary step in NGS data analysis. This script combines {{the features of}} popular quality filtering tools like FASTX-toolkits. Commonly, reads from a paired-end data are pre-processed separately, and paired later for downstream analysis. This kind of analysis has the following pros and cons. Pros: 1) One can process read 1 and read 2 separately at the same time. Cons: 1) Read pairing will become a memory intensive process. 2) Many times one has to re-write the script depending on header format for pairing. Here, this script attempts to circumvent the above mentioned two issues by processing both the read pairs at one go. By doing so, the header information is merely used for printing in the quality passed reads, and also allows one to process data of any volume even in a laptop provided there is enough space to store the output. Disclaimer: Though I've tested this script several time, {{there is no guarantee}} that the results will be perfect. Hence, it's up to the user to optimize the parameters depending on his/her data quality profile. Any Bugs: If you find any bugs in this script or need more information, please reach me at manojsbiotech [at] <b>gmail</b> [dot] <b>com.</b> How To Use: To know how to use the script, in your terminal just run the script as described below: [user@ngs-server] perl /pe_read_prepare. 0. 1. pl Usage: perl pe_read_prepare. 0. 01. pl [Options] Optional Parameters: -s default (1) -s_r 1 default (1) -s_r 2 default (1) -l default (100) -n default (0) List Of Output Files: _ 01 _PE_R 1. fastq. gz _ 01 _PE_R 2. fastq. gz Files (1) & (2) will contain read pairs that passed your quality filter.
