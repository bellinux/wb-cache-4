40|$|International {{audience}} 1. <b>Shea</b> <b>nut</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa Gaertn) {{meal was}} fermented for 8 days with either Aspergillus niger, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, or {{a mixture of}} the two organisms. The fermentation was completed using two methods, an opened container or a closed container. 2. Each of the six samples was dried and incorporated into basal broiler diets at 90 g/kg. In addition, the unfermented <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal was incorporated in the diet at 90 g/kg and the basal diet (maize and soybean meal-based) was also provided as an eighth dietary treatment to individually caged broiler chickens. 3. All fermented fungi-treated <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meals had similar proximate nutrient compositions to the unfermented <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal, but there were substantial decreases in their hydrolysable tannins and saponin contents. Both fermentation methods gave similar (P> 0. 05) reductions in the concentrations of tannins and saponins. 4. <b>Shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal fermented with individual or both fungal organisms gave greater (P< 0. 001) growth performance than that of unfermented <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal. However, all <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meals including the unfermented meal gave lower (P< 0. 001) growth variables than those for the maize-soybean meal control. 5. The nutritional improvement of <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal achieved in this study still falls far short of what is expected for it to become valuable for the poultry feed industry. These fermentation methods using A. niger or C. subvermispora require further improvements to provide satisfactory feed products...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the prospects of the <b>Shea</b> <b>nut</b> industry in the Savelugu/Nantong district of the northern region of Ghana.

Primary data was solicited through a field survey whilst the secondary information was obtained from published and unpublished sources. To reduce bias, the simple random sampling technique was used to select the respondents from among the <b>Shea</b> <b>nut</b> business operators in the district. The study made use of descriptive techniques such as frequencies and percentages to present the field results. In spite of the huge potential of the <b>Shea</b> <b>nut</b> industry in the region, there exist a number of challenges militating against the production and extraction of Shea products in the study area.

40|$|Six {{juvenile}} West African dwarf rams {{were used}} for three periods in a double 3 x 3 Latin square design to test the nutritional value of three home-made diets meant for use as dry season sheep feed in the Tolong-Kumbungu district of the Northern region of Ghana. The three dietary treatments were: mixture of 625 g/kg DM rice straw and 375 g/kg DM groundnut haulms (T 1), T 1 + concentrate feed containing 115 g/kg DM <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> cake (T 2) and T 1 + concentrate feed containing 230 g/kg DM <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> cake (T 3). Each period consisted of 14 days of adaptation to the feed and 14 days in which data were collected. Total DMI was significantly low (p< 0. 05) when the rams were on T 1 (453. 4 g/d) compared to when on T 2 (612. 0 g/d) and T 3 (627. 6 g/d). Daily weight gain values obtained when rams were on T 1 and T 3 differed (p< 0. 05), but the value obtained when on T 2 was similar to T 1 and T 3; the values being 20. 3 g, 31. 2 g and 39. 3 g for T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively. Concentrate supplementation improved DM and CP digestibility with values being significantly higher on T 2. Supplementation {{did not affect the}} haematological and serum biochemical indices of the rams except total protein and albumin, which two values were significantly high on T 3. It was observed that supplementation increased DMI, daily weight gain and serum total protein and albumin due to the high crude protein and energy contents of the supplemental concentrate.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} performance and organoleptic properties of broilers fed {{varying levels of}} rumen filtrate fermented <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal (RFFSNM). One hundred and eighty (180) day-old Hubbard broiler chicks were randomly allotted to four dietary treatments using completely randomized design (CRD). Each treatment was replicated three times with 15 birds per replicate. T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4 contained 0, 5, 10 and 15 % replacement levels of RFFSNM for groundnut meal, respectively. Three (3) birds {{were randomly selected from}} each treatment, slaughtered and dressed while the meats were used to determine the organoleptic properties. The results obtained showed that there were no significant (P > 0. 001) differences among the treatment groups in cumulative weight gain. Although, there were {{no significant difference in the}} mortality among the different treatment groups, T 1 recorded the highest mortality (24. 45 %). The organoleptic values for roasted and cooked meats showed no significant (P > 0. 05) differences in the colour, tenderness, juiciness, flavour and overall acceptability among the treatment groups. However, birds fed diet with 5 % RFFSNM recorded highest acceptability values in roasted (7. 58) and cooked (6. 45) meats. It was concluded that the use of RFFSNM at 5 to 15 % levels as a replacement for groundnut meal did not have significant improvement on the growth performance and organoleptic properties of broiler chickens while an alternative method may be found to reduce the anti-nutritional factors in <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> meal...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the effect of attenuating osteoarthritis (OA) -induced pain and joint destruction in rats by administering <b>shea</b> <b>nut</b> oil triterpene concentrate (SheaFlex 75, which is more than 50 % triterpenes). An anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy (MMx) was used to induce OA in male Wistar rats. Different doses of SheaFlex 75 (111. 6 mg/kg, 223. 2 mg/kg, and 446. 4 mg/kg) were then intragastrically administered daily for 12 weeks after surgery. Body weight and the width of the knee joint were measured weekly. Additionally, incapacitance tests were performed at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 to measure the weight bearing of the hind limbs, and the morphology and histopathology of the medial femoral condyles were examined and were evaluated using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system. This study showed that SheaFlex 75 reduced the swelling of the knee joint with OA and rectified its weight bearing after ACLT plus MMx surgery in rats. Treatment with SheaFlex 75 also decreased ACLT plus MMx surgery-induced knee joint matrix loss and cartilage degeneration. SheaFlex 75 relieves the symptoms of OA and protects cartilage from degeneration.
