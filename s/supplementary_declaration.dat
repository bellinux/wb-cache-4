5000|$|The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights {{can be read}} as {{assuming}} a kind of moral universalism. The drafting committee of the Universal Declaration did assume, or at least aspired to, a [...] "universal" [...] approach to articulating international human rights. Although the Declaration has undeniably come to be accepted throughout the world as a cornerstone of the international system for the protection of human rights, a belief among some that the Universal Declaration does not adequately reflect certain important worldviews has given rise to more than one <b>supplementary</b> <b>declaration,</b> such as the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam and the Bangkok Declaration.|$|E
40|$|The Egyptian {{revolution}} {{is proving to}} be a very legal one. That {{is not to say that}} the revolution’s demands have been legalized, nor that Egypt’s law has been revolutionized, rather, the forces that have come to the fore since the toppling of Mubarak in Feb 2011 have chosen law as the privileged form through which to bargain with each other. The density of the legal back and fro has been overwhelming: constitutional amendments, constitutional <b>supplementary</b> <b>declarations,</b> parliamentary laws, legislative amendments, military decrees, court trials, constitutional court decisions overturning laws passed, conflicting decisions from various courts, presidential decrees, emergency laws annulled and then reclaimed in another form; in fact so much so, that to trace the historical unfolding of the Egyptian revolution, one would be wise to use the Gazette and law reports as one’s primary guide through the maze of events. It is hard to miss the fact that in the case of Egypt, no sooner the public space opened up for the political as an autonomous sphere–one that is only possible through genuine democratic practice–than that sphere became annexed by the legal...|$|R

In mid-June however, another 100-member assembly was officially selected a week after a deal was reached between the ruling military council and representatives of 22 parties. Tensions later resumed after a court ruled that the entire Islamist-dominated parliament was illegally elected and ordered the body to dissolve, which angered the Brotherhood and Mohamed Beltagy called it a [...] "full-fledged Revolution". On 18 June, the SCAF issued a <b>supplementary</b> constitutional <b>declaration</b> that limits the to-be president's power over the military and gives it complete control over all army decisions. However, those controversial moves never changed the status of the constituent assembly as it was elected by the Shura Council not by parliament. Also, the same day the military delivered its statement, Hossam El-Gheriany was elected as chairman of the assembly. Military chief Mohamed Hussein Tantawi was forced to retire by Morsi on 12 August, {{a month and a half}} after the latter was elected and a week after a militant attack in Sinai that had the military preoccupied, leaving the constituent assembly's drafting process unchallenged.|$|R
