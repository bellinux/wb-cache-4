40|$|In a {{world that}} is {{constantly}} changing, the most important skill to acquire is learning how to learn. One of the aims of the education reform in Hong Kong is to help students to develop self-directed learning capabilities, leading to whole-person development and life-long learning. Self-directed learning refers to a process whereby the learner assumes a major responsibility for the initiation, planning, implementation and monitoring of their own learning. In this study, several <b>self-assessment</b> <b>tools,</b> introduced to the teachers, were used by the students in mathematics classrooms in order to facilitate students’ self-directed learning. The <b>self-assessment</b> <b>tools</b> included student reflective journals, think boards and mind maps. The purpose of this research is to explore ways to use guided self-assessment to build high quality self-directed learning processes in students, which will assist teachers and schools in producing successful and self-directed learners in mathematics. It also investigated the effectiveness of the intervention to enhance students’ mathematics capability. A total of 533 Secondary Three (S 3) students in 16 classes from 6 schools took the pre- and post-tests. Out of the 533 students, 315 engaged in self-assessment with teachers’ guidance. The students were asked to reflect on what they had learned in class using those <b>self-assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> Pre- and post-tests were administrated before and after the intervention respectively {{to see if there was}} a difference in gain between the treatment group and control group. The treatment group made significantly greater gains than the control group (effect size= 0. 27). Also, 101 samples of student self-assessment work were analyzed to understand the nature of the reflective learning that took place. The analysis showed that many of the components of self-directed learning were found in their self-assessment work. The results tell us that self-directed learning facilitated by self-assessment is a viable pedagogy in mathematics for these S 3 Hong Kong students. On the basis of this research, the use of student self-assessment to facilitate self-directed learning in other settings could be explored in the future. This study will guide future developments of interventions related to self-assessment and self-directed learning to enhance teaching and learning...|$|R
40|$|Formative {{assessment}} {{policies and}} self-regulation theories argue that student self-assessment {{of their own}} work and processes are useful for raising academic performance and self-regulatory skills. However, research into student self-evaluation raises serious doubts {{about the quality of}} self-assessment as an assessment process and identifies conditions which must be met if students’ judgments are to be useful, valid, and reliable. This paper recommends that student self-assessment should no longer be treated as an assessment, but instead as an essential competence for self-regulation. As such, we describe a potential curriculum approach that could guide teachers to appropriate use of <b>self-assessment</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R
