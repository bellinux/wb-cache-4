One of the main steam valves from the starboard boilers exploded, killing forty-four men in the boiler room and injuring another seven. The cause of the explosion was a defect in the construction of the valve. Prince Henry, aboard the nearby transport ship Pelikan, immediately ordered the ship to come to Brandenburgs aid, and took off the dead and wounded men. Brandenburg then put into Wiker Bucht, and was later towed to Kiel, where she entered the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) for repairs. The accident caused a minor political incident after the press criticized Wilhelm II for failing to send Prince Henry to the funerals for the sailors. Additionally, Vizeadmiral Friedrich von Hollmann, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Naval Office) stated before the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) that [...] "such accidents could occur again and again", which increased parliamentary resistance to further increases in naval budgets; this led to an initial rejection of funds for the first armored cruiser, [...] Admirals Eduard von Knorr and Hans von Koester criticized the comment, forcing Hollmann to publicly apologize.|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of image analysis {{has been used}} to assess the quality of model oriented <b>strand</b> board panels by investigating the relationships between shape and size of <b>strands,</b> the distribution of <b>strands</b> and bending properties. A batch of commercial <b>strands</b> was analysed by image analysis and the distribution of the shape and size of <b>strands</b> was quantified. The <b>strands</b> were categorised into five <b>strand</b> types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, <b>strand</b> shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in <b>strand</b> dimensions in commercial material. Bigger area <b>strands</b> had low aspect ratios and small <b>strands</b> had high aspect ratios. Half of the commercial <b>strands</b> were longer than 100 mm. Model OSB panels were manufactured in the laboratory by hot pressing <b>strand</b> mats formed from each of the five <b>strand</b> types. <b>Strands</b> were laid up by hand into the forming mat and following pressing the orientation and shape of <b>strands</b> was evaluated by image analysis and the panels were tested in a three point bending. Large area (type 3) <b>strands</b> with high aspect ratios produced model panels with optimum <b>strand</b> orientation and mechanical properties. Type 3 panels were also fabricated from <b>strands</b> dropped through a slotted forming device in order to simulate the delivery of <b>strands</b> to the forming line under factory conditions. As the height of <b>strand</b> delivery increased from 0 to 100 to 200 mm the disorientation of <b>strands</b> in the pressed panels progressively increased and as a result mechanical properties in bending were reduced. Image analysis is therefore a powerful tool for evaluating the distribution of commercial <b>strand</b> shapes and the relationship between <b>strand</b> geometry, <b>strand</b> orientation and the mechanical properties of oriented <b>strand</b> board...|$|R

The results indicate that random and incidental <b>strand</b> undulations in the longitudinal and transverse directions are significant; these inherent attributes of oriented <b>strand</b> composites influence the physical and mechanical behavior of composite panels. <b>Strand</b> orientations through the thickness of oriented <b>strand</b> panels in the longitudinal and transverse directions were quantified, and the effects of <b>strand</b> geometry and vane spacing on these out-of-plane deviations were investigated. Discrete Fourier expansions accurately rep-resented <b>strand</b> undulations through composite thickness. Location through composite thickness and length of a <b>strand</b> influence the distribution of undulation angles. <b>Strands</b> closer to the faces and shorter in length tend to result in larger undulation angles. In the transverse direction, <b>strand</b> deviation angles ranged between 0 and 60 degrees for the core <b>strands</b> and between 0 and 50 degrees for surface <b>strands.</b> Cumulative distribution plots indicate that smaller <b>strand</b> widths tend to result in higher percentages of larger undulation angles in the transverse direction for long <b>strands.</b> A two-parameter Weibull probability density function adequately fits both longitudinal and transverse direction <b>strand</b> undulation data...|$|R

50|$|The {{first one}} {{describes}} a bias and an asymmetric mutational pressure on each DNA <b>strand</b> during replication and transcription. Due to the asymmetric {{nature of the}} replication process, an unequal mutational frequency and DNA repair efficiency during the replication process can introduce more mutations in one <b>strand</b> {{as compared to the}} other. Furthermore, the time used for replication between the two <b>strands</b> varies and may lead to asymmetric mutational pressure between leading and lagging <b>strand.</b> In addition to mutations during DNA replication, transcriptional mutations can create <b>strand</b> specific nucleotide composition skew. Deamination of cytosine and ultimately mutation of cytosine to thymine in one DNA <b>strand</b> can increase the relative number of guanine and thymine to cytosine and adenine. In most bacteria majority of the genes are encoded in the leading <b>strand.</b> For instance, the leading <b>strand</b> in Bacillus subtilis encodes 75% of the genes. In addition an excess of deamination and conversion of cytosine to thymine in the coding <b>strand</b> compared to the non-coding <b>strand</b> has been reported. One possible explanation is that the non-transcribed <b>strand</b> (coding <b>strand)</b> is single <b>stranded</b> during the transcription process; therefore, it is more vulnerable to deamination compared to the transcribed <b>strand</b> (non-coding <b>strand).</b> Another explanation is that the deamination repair activity during transcription does not occur on the coding <b>strand.</b> Only the transcribed <b>strand</b> benefits from these deamination repair events.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the arrangement of wood <b>strands</b> at the surface of oriented <b>strand</b> board (OSB) by image analysis. Two-dimensional image analysis enables the number of <b>strands</b> and the area of each <b>strand</b> to be computed. In addition, the fiber direction of each <b>strand</b> may be measured manually by recording the acute angle between the fiber direction and the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The image analysis results suggest the following. the average <b>strand</b> area is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of <b>strands.</b> Samples containing many smaller <b>strands</b> exhibit a larger variation in <b>strand</b> size. The average <b>strand</b> area does not correlate with the distribution of the <b>strand</b> area represented by the coefficient of variation. However, there is a reasonable correlation between the number of smaller <b>strands</b> in the range 0 to 1 cm(2) and the coefficient of variation of <b>strand</b> area. At low average fiber orientations, i. e. better orientation with the principal panel axis, there is smaller variability in orientation. The upper side and lower side of OSB exhibit a different relationship between average fiber orientation and <b>strand</b> area. The upper side of the specimens contains larger <b>strands</b> and exhibits better fiber orientation than the lower side. This is thought to be a function of the production process. The lower side <b>strands</b> fall on a smooth moving substrate, whereas the upper side <b>strands</b> fall on a stable substrate of <b>strands.</b> The number of <b>strands</b> is lower on the upper side of the OSB panel because small size <b>strands</b> tend to migrate to the lower side of the OSB during production.

In present study we compared the Reids colposcopic index with Swede score. From the present study it is evident that Swede score of 8 or more has 100 % specificity and can be used for performing direct excisional procedure as a “see-and-treat” method at this cut-off.

40|$|Summary A high {{proportion}} of females of the C 3 H strain of mice develop tumours of the mammary gland which are caused by mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) transmitted through the milk. We have examined whether administration of mouse interferon (IFN) to nursing mothers and/or their suckling offspring only {{during the period of}} nursing, can affect the incidence of tumours developing in these animals. In two separate experiments, animals receiving IFN by direct injection while suckling, and remaining virgin showed a marked and statistically significant decrease in tumour incidence. Mice receiving the same or a tenfold higher dose of IFN while lactating showed no such reduction in tumour incidence, even if they had also received IFN while suckling. The results suggest that IFN can affect the initial establishment of the MMTV infection in suckling mice sufficiently to delay tumour development provided the animals are not exposed to the hormonal stimulus of pregnancy and lactation.

40|$|In a {{world of}} {{increasing}} environmental awareness and activism, is it economically advantageous for a forestry resource firm to be proactive in the integration of community stakeholders’ desires into the business operations? To what degree, and in what form, does the firm include the local community as a stakeholder? What are the economic consequences to the firm from taking various stances {{in relationship to the}} community and the resulting allocation of forest resources to the firm? The objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that large industrial resource companies should decentralize more of the production process to the communities which they draw the resource from as a means of sustaining their profitability within a changing sociopolitical climate of community resource ownership. The Province of Saskatchewan and more specifically northwest Saskatchewan including the towns of Meadow Lake, Beauval, Green Lake, and north are the geographic focus of this study. This research examines the economic feasibility of decentralizing the Oriented Strand Board (OSB) feedstock manufacturing process to the remote communities where the primary resource is extracted. A game-theoretic approach is used to assess the long-run gain or cost of co-operating with the community and installing a remote stranding facility instead of hauling the unprocessed fiber to a centrally located Oriented Strand Board (OSB) plant. There are no technical reasons for lack of implementation of remote stranding facilities in North America. Current practices relate to the economics of centralization and to the ownership/control of the resource. This research shows that the major forestry firm’s long-term profitability could improve, or diminish less, with a remote stranding plant due to a stabilized wood-supply to the OSB plant. The installation of the remote <b>strander</b> reduces the community’s incentive to seeking alternative allocation, through judicial and/or legal means, for the wood fiber that it deems to be its property. Based on this research, the forestry resource firm needs to examine the ability of the community to process the regional wood fiber instead of the firm. The community development corporation can empower itself through the acquisition of the technical expertise and financial backing to process some of the wood fiber from the region. This would increase their bargaining credibility as a viable threat to the firm, and thus induce co-operation from the resource firm in pursuing community economic development. If they have the capabilities to follow through on alternative processing, the forestry firm should view the community as having a high salience to their long-term profitability...|$|E
