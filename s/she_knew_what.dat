On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E

25|$|During the 1860s, Patti {{possessed a}} sweet, high-lying voice of birdlike purity and {{remarkable}} flexibility which was ideal for such parts as Zerlina, Lucia and Amina; but, as Verdi noted in 1878, her lower notes gained fullness and beauty when she grew older, enabling her {{to excel in}} weightier fare. Patti, however, turned into a conservative singer in {{the final phase of}} her operatic and concert career. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> suited her aging voice to perfection and she stuck to it. Typically, her recital programs during the 1890s featured an array of familiar, often sentimental, not-too-demanding popular tunes of the day, which were sure to appeal to her adoring fans.|$|E

25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was occurring. He kissed her hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.|$|E

Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that [...] "the song should put he Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that [...] "Manic Monday" [...] was [...] "infectious" [...] and, along with [...] "If <b>She</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>What</b> She Wants", both were [...] "refreshingly melodic". Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "The first single 'Manic Monday' represents slumming songwriter Prince's attempt mostly successful save for the inevitable getting down interlude to concoct a modern day Mamas and the Papas hit." ...|$|E

[...] However, several critics {{commented that the}} book was {{straightforward}} and presented few interesting stories. Susan Shapiro of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Although the paradoxes of being 'a celebrity nobody knows' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook." [...] Rosellen Brewer of the Library Journal commented that [...] "Cartwright's own life notwithstanding, there is nothing really new or exciting here. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{she wanted to do}} and was able to do it; end of story." [...] Lee Bacchus of The Province wrote that [...] "This little book by the voice of Bart Simpson reads as if it were written by a 10-year-old boy. Not that that's all bad. Cartwright, who voices Bart along with Ralph Wiggum and a few others on The Simpsons, gives a very unchallenging tour behind the scenes of the phenomenally successful series. It's kind of fun to discover how the show is put together and how an adult woman snagged one of the coolest jobs in the world [...] If only it wasn't all so relentlessly perky." ...|$|E

At the time, it was unknown if it would be a one-off or if a longer relationship would start. An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that Roxy and AJ are both looking for fun and they [...] "hit it off" [...] because she loves [...] "a man who can make her laugh and AJ definitely ticks that box." [...] They added that they have [...] "great chemistry" [...] but said that as Roxy is sidetracked by another man, [...] "AJ will have to fight [...] for her affections" [...] if he wants her. An insider also told the Daily Star that the two [...] "can't keep their hands off each other" [...] and [...] "Roxy is more than up for it." [...] They added that [...] "Zainab would go mental if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they were up to under her roof and {{it remains to be seen}} whether they can get away with it. Roxy is the last person who Zainab would want AJ to hook up with. [...] Even Masood could not defend his brother this time as he had been pretty disrespectful." [...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rick Edwards titled Under the Skin of Leona Lewis on 28 February 2010 for 4Music, Lewis revealed {{that she is a}} fan of Oasis and that [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] is a [...] "great song" [...] with a [...] "beautiful sentiment behind it". She continued to say herself and label boss Simon Cowell discussed the possibility of Lewis recording a discussed cover version. Lewis cited her reason for wishing to record her own version as being a [...] "massive" [...] fan of rock bands, and that she wanted to put a [...] "different spin on it". When asked the question of if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> Gallagher thought about her version, she replied saying that she had not spoken to them and that she did not know if they had listened to her version. Originally written solely by Gallagher, Lewis's cover version was produced by Steve Robson. Both Robson and Lewis were the vocal producers on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". It was engineered by Richard Flack, who was assisted in the process by vocal engineer Seth Waldmann. It was mixed by Jeremy Wheatly at Twenty-One Studios, located in London, England. A range of instrumentalists were bought in for the song; Karl Brazil played the drums, while Luke Potashnick provided guitar. John Garrison played the bass and Robson the piano. The London Session Orchestra performed the strings on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] and it was arranged by Will Malone, while the choir was organised and arranged by Lawrence Johnson.

Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself. But sooner or later, I reckon she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E

After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe {{she had to do}} the extreme acrobatic actions as {{described}} in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them. Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to expect subsequently. The role made Moss, who later said that [...] "I had no career before. None." [...] Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it.

[...] She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she wanted to do for a career [...] "pretty much since [...] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.|$|E
