5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch <b>style</b> <b>was</b> said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would {{have been one of the}} last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E

5|$|BoxBoy! {{received}} a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive {{use of the}} box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly surprised {{by the amount of}} content that was offered and agreed that the package was good value for money. However, the game's simple art <b>style</b> <b>was</b> divisive among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general <b>style</b> <b>was</b> played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|However, Swelim's {{theory is}} not widely accepted. Grimal, Helck, Wilkinson and Stadelmann {{point out that}} during the 3rd dynasty it became a fashion that royal stone bowls with {{polished}} surfaces showed only Horus names, without any guiding inscriptions. This {{is also the case}} for the stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor <b>style</b> <b>was</b> practiced still under Sneferu, the founder of the 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close {{to the end of the}} Third Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal <b>style</b> <b>was</b> also a knowing collage.

But {{they did not do}} what Winehouse did, mixing Bettie Page with Brigitte Bardot and adding that little bit of Ronnie Spector.|$|E

The Altar of Veit Stoss in St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków {{is one of the most}} magnificent art works of its kind in Europe.|$|E

Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing <b>style</b> <b>was</b> often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
