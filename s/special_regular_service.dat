25|$|It was {{reported}} that {{for each of the}} months from August to November, an increase of the average number of passengers carried per day was recorded, from 38 in August to 159 in November. In March, the South Eastern Railway Bill had its second reading in Parliament. Sir Charles Russell, MP stated that the South Eastern Railway (SER) had done everything in its power to obstruct the English Channel Steamship Company. Lord Elcho stated that if the railway was sincere in its desire to improve communication with the continent (the stated aim of the bill), then it would run its trains to suit Castalia, rather than expecting the ship to run to suit its trains. After some discussion, the bill passed its second reading. Sir Edward Watkin was asked about this state of affairs at a shareholders meeting of the SER on 3 August. He replied that the railway could not run a <b>special</b> and <b>regular</b> <b>service</b> of trains to meet an irregular sailing schedule such as that operated by Castalia, which did not run in the winter. The boats that connected with the SERs trains operated a <b>regular,</b> year-round <b>service.</b>|$|R

25|$|New steam {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in India well into the early 1970s; the last broad-gauge steam locomotive to be manufactured, Last Star, a WG-class locomotive (No.10560) was built in June 1970, followed by the last meter-gauge locomotive in February 1972. Steam locomotion continued to predominate on Indian Railways through the early 1980s; in fiscal year 1980–81, there were 7,469 steam locomotives in <b>regular</b> <b>service,</b> compared to 2,403 diesels and 1,036 electrics. Subsequently, steam locomotion was gradually phased out from <b>regular</b> <b>service,</b> beginning with the Southern Railway Zone in 1985; the number of diesel and electric locomotives in <b>regular</b> <b>service</b> surpassed the number of steam locomotives in service in 1987–88. All <b>regular</b> broad-gauge steam <b>service</b> in India ended in 1995, with the final run made from Jalandhar to Ferozpur on 6 December. The last meter-gauge and narrow-gauge steam locomotives in <b>regular</b> <b>service</b> were retired in 2000. After being withdrawn from service, most steam locomotives were scrapped, though some have been preserved in various railway museums. The only steam locomotives remaining in <b>regular</b> <b>service</b> are on India's four heritage lines.|$|R
