500|$|Lhermitte's last {{victim was}} her eldest daughter, Yasmin. The mother called over Yasmin {{and told her}} she had a {{surprise}} for her, just like she had done with Myriam. Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house. Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{believed}} that the public expected [...] "a certain thing" [...] from her when she first appeared with Ja Rule, however she wanted to record the type of music she was signed to do. She said that [...] "AM to PM" [...] was a [...] "cool record", {{but it was not}} what the public expected. Milian felt that her record label was confused as to how they wanted her image to be portrayed; one second she was young and singing [...] "AM to PM", and next she was a grown woman singing [...] "Get Away". <b>She</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> change confused the audience, and that [...] "nobody was buying it". To explain that she was serious about her musical career, Milian approached the executives at Island Def Jam, and [...] "cussed them all out", telling them that they were not listening to her.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{felt that}} Island Def Jam was {{confused}} {{as to how}} they wanted her image to be portrayed; one second she was young and singing [...] "AM to PM", and next she was a grown woman singing [...] "Get Away". <b>She</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> change confused the audience, and that [...] "nobody was buying it". In 2003, Milian's label Def Soul was shut down and absorbed by its parent Def Jam, although Milian was instead moved over to Island Records. After the international release of her debut album, Milian went back into the recording studio. The singer felt that music trends had changed into rock music, hardcore hip hop and tribute songs, and her music did not fall into those categories. Milian decided to stop recording and toured overseas {{for a year and a}} half. When she returned to the US, she decided not to release her previous album domestically, and started working on a new album. Milian traveled the world, working with the popular producers Bloodshy & Avant, [...] "Darkchild", Cory Rooney, Warryn Campbell, Bryan-Michael Cox and Polli Paul.|$|E
50|$|Buffy tracks down Parker, but {{she finds}} him putting the same moves he used on her on another girl. <b>She</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sex they had was {{meaningless}} {{to him and}} thinks it's her fault.|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{talks about}} how a man sets off to Arizona, and {{promises}} to send for the woman (the narrator) when he has things set up. Time goes by and she gets one postcard with no return address, then nothing more. She tries to hold out hope that he'll come back or send for her but finally, as her friends keep asking her when <b>she's</b> going, <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dream of having a better life with him in Arizona {{is never going to}} come true. <b>She</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wonderful, love-filled paradise she had hoped for was just a lie, or, to be generous, a pipe dream, the man told her when he left her. Her vision of Arizona does not exist.|$|R
50|$|Wonder Woman tells Cassie {{that she}} is friends with Supergirl because she is {{mourning}} Conner, and that Kara will become bitter and jealous when he returns. Cassie is momentarily crushed when <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clone of Conner retains no memories of her time with him.|$|R
2500|$|Lola's {{inheritance}} is from Doña Theresa's use {{of natural}} resources and Indian resources. For example, one day while bathing along the Colorado River, <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pebbles were actually gems. In the hopes of pleasing her, [...] "the Indians brought her emeralds and rubies, seeing that she like pretty pebbles." [...] Doña Theresa's use of Indian labour and resources pertain to the indigenous exploitation during the Spanish colonization.|$|E
2500|$|The Y {{chromosome}} {{was identified}} as a sex-determining chromosome by Nettie Stevens at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 during a study of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor. Edmund Beecher Wilson independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by Hermann Henking. <b>She</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to {{the presence or absence of}} the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome [...] "Y" [...] simply to follow on from Henking's [...] "X" [...] alphabetically.|$|E
2500|$|Due to her {{dissatisfaction with}} Kisss {{constrained}} timeframe of two months, Jepsen went into writing Emotion {{with the intent}} of crafting a project that was authentic and timeless. Whereas Kiss was developed in a acquiescent manner as Jepsen was simply grateful for the opportunity, Emotion was spurred by her desire to take more creative control. Jepsen commented that much of the album is about [...] "trying to get some power back" [...] after a recent break up and subsequent move to New York. She sought to channel a [...] "heart-on-your-sleeve sensibility" [...] reminiscent of the 1980s era after attending a Cyndi Lauper concert in Japan: [...] " [...] this is when pop was at its finest. [...] I would put out 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' today and I wouldn’t change a bloody thing." [...] These themes were further explored through [...] "old-school" [...] Prince and Madonna records on morning runs before Cinderella rehearsals. An epiphany came to Jepsen after finishing [...] "Emotion", the album's title track, where <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1980s pop sound combined with a more [...] "alternative" [...] production was what she had been seeking. This fashioned the album's direction entirely, which developed as the midway point between the [...] "pure" [...] pop she recorded in Los Angeles and the indie folk effort that was scrapped in New York. Jepsen has stated that the album is not strictly a period piece, but is [...] "tinted with shades of that era".|$|E

When <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{painting}} is her mother, nude, she becomes ashamed of her. As her mother appears in the doorway, she runs past her.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quake {{has opened}} a deep fault running {{through the center of}} North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further {{instability}} will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions.|$|R

60|$|Honora sat down. There seemed {{nothing else}} to do. She remembered him {{perfectly}} now, and <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nimble-witted clerk had meant to send her to a gentleman.|$|E
6000|$|But Barbara's attention, {{had wandered}} off again into that queer medley of thoughts, and feelings, {{out of which}} the little man had so {{abruptly}} roused her. Then <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meeting was breaking up, and her mother saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|Jane {{commenced}} {{to wonder}} what his plans were. Would he take {{her back to the}} beach or would he keep her here? Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> matter did not seem to give her much concern. Could it be that she did not care! ...|$|E

60|$|The man {{unlocked}} {{his door}} and entered, still whistling. Sometimes the whistle was soft and low, again it was louder and more cheerful. Josie listened in suspense. As long as the whistling continued <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theft of the black satchel remained undiscovered.|$|E
60|$|The girl laughed, {{perhaps because}} <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{memory of the}} last few weeks would remain with her. She also remembered that he had said that the stillness among the white peaks and in the scented bush was filled with a glamour that seized on one.|$|E
60|$|It is a sweet face, whereon the half-obliterated {{lines of}} sorrow vie with that look of supreme {{happiness}} which first crept {{into her eyes}} when <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dear and constant friend who had loved her so dearly, was as true to her in his joy {{as he had been}} in those dark days when a terrible crisis had well-nigh wrecked her life.|$|E
50|$|Three months later, Brears visits Sax and Sax is {{surprised}} that she can understand his gibberish as Aklo, {{the language of the}} fishmen. She tells him that she is pregnant with the child of <b>the</b> fishman. <b>She</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> events in Lovecraft's fiction are actually premonitions of a future apocalypse that will be heralded by the birth of her child, Cthulhu.|$|R

60|$|He swung {{himself into}} the saddle, and Grace went on alone, well content that he had gone, but {{nevertheless}} wondering whether she had ventured too far on Ingleby's behalf, for <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rejoinder which had closed the discussion was not altogether excusable. She did not care to ask herself why Esmond's insinuations should have stirred her to an indignation that was stronger than her sense of what was fitting.|$|E
60|$|Ozma smiled, but {{her smile}} was not so cheerful as usual. The Princess of Oz found herself confronted with a serious problem, and {{although}} she had no thought of despairing <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Skeezers and their island, as well as Dorothy and herself, were in grave trouble and that unless she could find a means to save them they would be lost to the Land of Oz for all future time.|$|E
60|$|He came no nearer, but stood still, {{looking at}} her with elation and trouble curiously mingled in his face, and <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fight was but half won. He had of late {{sloughed}} off his wayward carelessness {{and she knew that}} there had always been a depth of resolute character beneath it. He was a man who would do what he felt was the fitting thing, even though it hurt him.|$|E

60|$|Laura was {{conscious}} of a certain resentment against the loquacious storekeeper. It was disconcerting to feel that it was generally recognized that she was acquainted with Nasmyth's affairs, especially as <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fact might appear significant to his English relative. It would scarcely be advisable, she decided, to ask the stranger to walk on to dinner at the ranch, since such an invitation would probably strengthen any misconceptions he might have formed.|$|E
60|$|After the last, long dive the Ithaca righted herself laboriously, wallowing drunkenly, but {{apparently}} upon {{an even keel}} in less turbulent waters. One long minute dragged after another, yet no suffocating deluge poured in upon the girl, and presently <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship had, at least temporarily, weathered the awful buffeting of the savage elements. Now she felt but a gentle roll, though the wild turmoil of the storm still came to her ears through the heavy planking of the Ithaca's hull.|$|E
60|$|She {{made another}} discovery. Ever {{since she had}} entered the forest she had become aware of a {{fullness}} in her head and a something affecting her nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But presently her head cleared somewhat and <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> thick pine odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch. The smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength. Also her throat and lungs seemed to burn.|$|E
50|$|Veena (Meera Jasmine) {{aspires to}} become a world-renowned singer. When <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music within her has no ways of flowing out, she is driven almost to madness, but {{eventually}} {{finds a way to}} express it.
