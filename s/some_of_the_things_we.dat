60|$|Any one {{of these}} three {{questions}} {{may be used to}} define introspection. I should favour introspection {{in the sense of the}} first question, i.e. I think that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> observe cannot, even theoretically, be observed by any one else. The second question, tentatively and for the present, I should answer in favour of introspection; I think that images, in the actual condition of science, cannot be brought under the causal laws of physics, though perhaps ultimately they may be. The third question I should answer adversely to introspection I think that observation shows us nothing that is not composed of sensations and images, and that images differ from sensations in their causal laws, not intrinsically. I shall deal with the three questions successively.|$|E

In addition to that, we decided to touch basically every facet of the game. We wanted to make the music and sound better, the graphics - so we basically retouched every area of the Myth gaming experience.|$|E

5000|$|After David {{managed to}} crack the American music {{industry}} with his hit debut studio album, Born to Do It, his musical style began to alter {{to appeal to the}} worldwide market on his second studio album. In an interview with ANDPOP's Adam Gonshor, David revealed the inspiration for some of the songs on the album. He was forced to stay in a hotel room for a week following the September 11 attacks in New York City in 2001, and it was this event that inspired him to write the song [...] "World Filled with Love". In the interview, he said, [...] "I was thinking, I'm actually in this world that's filled with madness, with this drama that's going on. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> were talking about in music, in the big picture, are so trivial...I thought music is a form of escapism, so I used it to write a song hopefully for positive means to say, we are in a world that's filled with love." [...] David also commented that the album title could be looked at in two different ways: [...] "On the one hand, it's coming across like I'm arrogant. On the other hand, it's saying I have a lot more composure on the album." [...] The album was leaked onto the internet prior to its official release, but David was not too bothered as he felt that it [...] "spreads the word".|$|E
