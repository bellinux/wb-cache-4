5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> {{to be remembered as}} an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling {{she would not be}} able to do it justice. Six months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Kuroki visited Italy {{where she}} met Cicciolina, whom she regards as sensei. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to find that many of their {{opinions}} coincided, but was surprised by Cicciolina's discomfort with Kuroki's masochistic tendencies and preference for the S genre. Kuroki attributes this to cultural and personal differences, and does not feel that S equates to submissiveness. Indeed, Fornander points out that Kuroki made AVs in general, and S in particular a feminist issue in Japan.|$|E

The poet was taken to meet Queen Caroline, and, while he was there, word came {{of the death of}} his wife, but Clarke kept the news from Duck until after the interview with the Queen. For her part, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> and gave Duck an annuity and a small house.|$|E
25|$|Three {{months after}} Hair opened, Hunt {{was on the}} cover of British high-fashion {{magazine}} Queen, the first black model to appear on their cover. In 1968, Hunt posed nude for photographer Patrick Lichfield after the opening night for Hair and the photo appeared {{on the cover of}} British Vogue′s January 1969 issue. Almost 40 years later Hunt again posed nude for Litchfield, recreating the pose for her Vogue Magazine cover five weeks after she had had her right breast and lymph glands removed to halt the spread of cancer. The photo appeared on the cover of her 2005 book Undefeated, about her battle with cancer. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to work with the photographer under such differing circumstances, though in her autobiography she expressed confusion as to why the photo has been so often reprinted. Hunt has also been photographed by Lewis Morley, Horace Ové, and Robert Taylor.|$|E

25|$|Gorghiu, {{who joined}} the PNL in 2002, has held two elected offices. From 2004 to 2008, she was a local {{councillor}} on the Sector 5 council in Bucharest. Then in 2008, she {{was elected to the}} Chamber of Deputies. There, she served as vice president of the committee for investigating abuses and corruption and for petitions. She was also president of the committee of enquiry for verifying the amounts of money paid by the Youth and Sport Ministry through documents signed by minister Monica Iacob-Ridzi for organising the 2009 Youth Day festival. The committee's report, the findings of which were announced by Gorghiu in July 2009, declared that Ridzi had committed embezzlement and abused public office, and sought her indictment by prosecutors. When the minister resigned several days later, Gorghiu stated <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> but that the action should have come some time earlier. She was one of the Chamber's vice presidents from September to December 2012.|$|E
25|$|By 1770, {{her home}} on Hill Street {{had become the}} premiere salon in London. Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, and Horace Walpole {{were all in the}} circle. For writers, being {{introduced}} there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, Frances Burney, Anna Barbauld, Sarah Fielding, Hester Chapone, James Beattie, and Anna Williams. Samuel Johnson's hostess, Hester Thrale, was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician Messenger Monsey. Among the blue stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, but she was the woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse, and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of Samuel Richardson, both Fieldings (Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding), and Fanny Burney, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to discover that Laurence Sterne was a distant relation. She was related to Laurence Sterne through the Botham family. Sterne entrusted her with the disposition of his papers upon his departure for France. He was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of Bishop Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.|$|E

Screenrant writer Jack O'Keefe named the episode {{one of the best}} television dream sequences, writing: [...] "Adventure Time dips into the surreal often and without hesitation, making it nearly impossible to pick a stand-out dream sequence. However, the dream sequence that makes up 'King Worm' is one of Adventure Time‘s highest artistic achievements among many." ...|$|E

In December, Linnaeus had a [...] "disagreement" [...] with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West lauded the episode, {{writing that}} it [...] "had almost {{everything we could}} want: all the {{major players in the}} mix, an unexpected (not-really) twist, a juicy little revelation, and the short-term promise of a Jim/Pam reunion." [...] <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the emphasis on Jim and the way he [...] "wonderfully bookended the conflicting emotions Michael inspires." [...] West also believed that the [...] "writers did a great job of creating the sense of crisis that resulted in the Scranton branch instead absorbing Stamford (I never trusted that Josh guy) even though fans of the original {{knew it was going to}} end up that way." [...] Television Without Pity graded [...] "Branch Closing" [...] with an A.|$|E

Gillian Robespierre said that she found the {{descriptor}} reductive, but also said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> that the word [...] "abortion" [...] was being used on the film's poster and in headlines about the film. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Emily Blake speculated that the film's lack of recognition in mainstream award circles {{may have been due}} to its label as [...] "the abortion comedy". NBC drew criticism for requesting that the word [...] "abortion" [...] be removed from an online advertisement {{for the film}}; it apologized after a petition circulated by Planned Parenthood accused the network of censorship. The film was marketed in conjunction with the abortion-rights organization NARAL Pro-Choice America.|$|E

Overall, she described the episode as [...] "a very solid hour of entertainment, with very few nitpicks... a slick package with the values I consider to be real Trek". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] wasn't enthusiastic about a particularly [...] "lackluster" [...] action scene which he felt was a bad cross between [...] and Andromeda. However, he was pleased with the other aspects of the plot and praised the clever scripting. He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V.

[...] However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> the show's production for featuring contestants who were [...] "friendly" [...] and [...] "relatable," [...] rather than [...] "chosen for their reprehensibility."

Green described the overall plot as [...] "feeble", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Rajiin" [...] demonstrated {{that there was an}} intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera. He thought that the episode was average for the third season, and wasn't as good as [...] "".
