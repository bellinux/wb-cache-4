40|$|This paper extends {{existing}} research on activity of broiler chickens and describes a novel system to automatically assess the spatial use of chickens with different gait scores by image technology. For this study, 30 broiler chickens (Ross- 308) {{at the age}} of 26 days were visually scored by the experts for their degree of lameness according to the method of Kestin et al. (1992) and five birds per gait score group (GS 0 to GS 5) were used in the experiments. The experimental period of in total 12 days was subdivided into two times six days. The first experimental period (day 1 - 6) was conducted in a laboratory test installation consisting of a stainless steel compartment with six integrated pens. Five birds (each having the same gait score) were housed in each pen resulting in a stocking density of five birds /m 2. The chicken’s activity was automatically recorded on each day of the first experimental period (day 1 - 6) for six hours resulting in 432 data sets per gait score group. In the second experimental period (day 7 – 12), the <b>separation</b> <b>fences</b> between all pens were removed. Thus, the different chicken groups were merged to one group and were kept together within the stainless steel compartment. A novel monitoring system with color tracking features was developed to calculate the activity of the merged chickens. The activity was automatically monitored by this system for six hours each day resulting in another 432 data sets. Additionally, the spatial use of broiler chickens in relation to different lameness degrees was investigated by this fully-automated monitoring system during the second experimental period. A significant relation between the gait score given by an expert and activity automatically monitored by image analysis system was observed for both experimental periods. The broilers with gait score 3 (GS 3) showed a significantly higher activity than other gait scores in both experimental periods (P< 0. 05). GS 4 and GS 5 showed a significantly lower activity (P< 0. 05). During the second experimental period the spatial use of mixed chickens was investigated revealing that GS 0 and GS 3 chickens explored the compartment area more than chickens with a higher gait score. status: submitte...|$|R

In her judgment, Beinisch accepted the military commander’s claim that the fence in Bil'in area was built for reasons of national security. Nevertheless, she held that the military commander had determined the route of the fence while taking into account the future construction plans for new Israeli neighborhoods near this area. These planned neighborhoods do not constitute a vital security need, and hence cannot be taken into account when determining the route of the fence. Thus, Beinisch concluded, the route of the fence in the Bil'in area did not meet the proportionality requirement.|$|E

40|$|Lameness, an {{increasing}} animal welfare problem, {{has a negative}} impact on milk production, body condition and reproductive performance in dairy cows. This paper describes a synchronized system which is useful for automatic lameness detection in dairy cattle. The system consists of a pressure sensitive mat, two cameras and a <b>separation</b> <b>fence.</b> The pressure mat measures the pressure distribution over time for each hoof of the cow. The cameras record the posture and movements of the cow. The <b>separation</b> <b>fence</b> ensures {{that there is only one}} cow passing the corridor with the synchronized system. When a cow passes the <b>separation</b> <b>fence</b> the recording of the pressure mat is started. The mat sends a synchronization signal to the camera system, which automatically triggers the cameras to start recording. When there is no activity on the pressure mat for some time, a signal is send again to the camera system which stops the recording of the cameras. The recordings of the pressure mat and the cameras are saved together with (relative) timestamps so they can be combined afterwards. The setup of this system provides us with synchronized data on the pressure distribution under the hoof of the cow in combination with images of the posture of the cow at the same moment in time. When combined in MatLab the information can be used for automatic lameness detection. Experiments with this system were performed on ILVO farm in Ghent Belgium in October 2008. The system recorded postures and pressure distributions of 66 lactating Holstein cows while passing the corridor after milking. The pressure mat was recording at a rate of 60 frames per second, where the cameras were working at 20 frames per second on average. The average synchronization error between the pressure mat and the camera was less than 16 ms tested on 30 recordings. It is assumed that synchronized data of pressure distribution and posture of cows increases the potential for early online and automatic lameness detection. status: submitte...|$|E

40|$|What meaning {{does the}} term border take on {{referring}} to a city? The city of Jerusalem is an interesting case study because with it the whole polysemy of the word border shows up, on every geographical scale. Since {{the start of the}} Al- Aqsa Intifada in 2000, support for the idea of a physical barrier between Israel and the Palestinian territories has grown tremendously among Israelis. On Jerusalem´s external boundary, this barrier takes the form of an eight-metershigh- wall. The Israeli government does not admit that the barrier’s sole purpose was the prevention of terrorist incursions. A policy of ethnic separation was clearly intended, the argument being that co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians had been a failure. How did the Holy city reach this pessimistic point, considering that the idea of an international city was proposed twice {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, when its inhabitants had already suffered a separation between 1948 and 1967, and when a peace process had been initiated in 1994 ?

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I focus on legal {{complications}} of fighting terrorism. Democracies {{are faced with}} a threat that fights outside the laws. Imposing restrictions on liberties and rights in order to constrain the threat may be argued necessary; nonetheless it challenges one of the pillars of democracy itself: the rights and liberties of the individual. The state of Israel has, as occupant of the Palestinian Territories since 1967, faced international – and domestic – criticism concerning the rights of the Palestinians. The Supreme Court of Israel (ISC), sitting as the High Court of Justice (HCJ), has by its judicial annexation of the Palestinian Territories faced the dilemma of the competing values of Israeli security and Palestinian human rights for decades. The recently retired President of the ISC (September 7, 2006), Aharon Barak describe that: “Fighting against terrorism in an effective manner entails finding the right balance between security and public interests, on one hand, and the need to safeguard human rights and basic freedoms, on the other. This is a very complex process. ” Critics of the HCJ like the Israeli sociology professor Baruch Kimmerling claims that the laws are not equal to everyone. Liberal rhetoric in rulings and statements give the impression of legal equality but do not create precedence and are often so vague that the initial problem is not actually solved. Kimmerling is by no means moderate in his article “Jurisdiction in an Immigrant-Settler Society” which “will demonstrate that the practices of the Israeli HCJ generate a façade of legitimacy to the Israeli state’s internal and external colonization and territorial expansion efforts. ” Aharon Barak pointed out above that the ISC needs to ensure that the state of Israel is respecting the rule of law also in times of conflict. The dilemma of Israeli security and preservation of Palestinian rights is often exaggeratedly viewed as a zero-sum game by both parties: Neither interest can be satisfactory fulfilled without reducing the others. Without a matrix of control over the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT) the frequency of terrorist attacks would definitely increase in lack of a complete political solution. At the same time, the matrix of control is splitting the West Bank up in Bantustans, hindering free movement of the individual, choking the Palestinian economy and in lead to hardship {{in the life of the}} Palestinians which again fuel the conflict. Additionally, the conflict has been viewed as a typical territorial conflict: Neither parts have alternative homelands and is frequently referred to by both parties as a conflict of existence. After the breakout of the second Palestinian intifada, the wave of terrorist attacks gained political and public support to the old plans of building a separation barrier to separate Israelis and Palestinians. The Israeli professor Ronen Shamir stress that a Court’s impartiality is a prerequisite if they are to play a legitimizing role. Studies suggest that courts systematically support and uphold state-sponsored policies. Shamir claims that analysis of cases where the HCJ ruled to defend Palestinian’s and Israeli Arab’s human rights did not lead to similar results in subsequent cases and the significance of the cases was exaggerated, allowing them to appear as symbols of justice. The ISC enjoys a special position in Israeli in the public opinion and in the political system of Israel, which enables it to be a possible unique actor in terms of reducing tension between Israelis and Palestinians. The initial question would be if it manages, or even has the possibility, to be truly impartial as an integrated part of the Israeli state. This thesis addresses implications of exercising judicial review over the military authorities’ actions in an occupied territory, being the sole guarantee of the individual rights of the conflicting party. Following the liberal rhetoric of the Aharon Barak and the criticism from scholars, organizations and others I would like to do an analysis of the ISC, sitting as High Court of Justice, ruling of 30 th of June 2004; HCJ 2056 / 04 – Beit Sourik Village Council v. 1. The Government of Israel and 2. Commander of the IDF Forces in the West Bank. The ruling was made 10 days prior to the advisory ruling on the security fence made by the International Court of Justice in Hague and got a lot of attention. It appeared to be a “landmark case” ruling against the legality of the orders of taking possessions of land north-east of Jerusalem and to erect a <b>separation</b> <b>fence</b> on the land. The Beit Sourik ruling was the first ruling where the HCJ extensively reviewed the legality of the separation barrier and its route. In light of the criticism of the Supreme Court cited above, I will do an critical review of the HCJ 2056 / 04 ruling as it is stated in the Piskei Din (decision) ...|$|E
