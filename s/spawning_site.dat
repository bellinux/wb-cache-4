5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, <b>spawning</b> <b>site</b> position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E

40|$|Overfishing {{of stock}} and {{decreasing}} biodiversity are grave {{concerns for the}} U. S. {{and the rest of}} the world. Understanding and applying spatial and temporal information of marine species? reproductive ecology and critical life habitat is vital to the development of effective strategies for marine resource management. In the Caribbean, one of the critical science gaps hindering effective management is the lack of information on how environmental factors may make fish <b>spawning</b> aggregation (FSA) <b>sites</b> optimal for <b>spawning.</b> Understanding the patterns of seafloor characteristics of <b>spawning</b> aggregation <b>sites</b> is of great interest to managers who need a means to efficiently design marine protected areas to help rebuild regional fish stocks. The specific goals of the study were: (1) to map the seafloor at historically known grouper and snapper <b>spawning</b> aggregation <b>sites</b> in three different countries, and (2) to characterize quantitatively the geomorphology of the sites including horizontal and vertical curvature profiles of the reefs, bottom depth at <b>spawning</b> <b>sites,</b> distance between <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> and shelf-edges/reef promontory tips, and the shortest distance between the <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> and 100 m water depth. These data were field-collected with a GPS and single-beam eco-sounder that provided latitude/longitude and depth. The point data were interpolated to surfaces in GIS to determine slope, aspect, curvature, and distance from <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> and three-dimensional reef structures. 	This study revealed that all 12 known Nassau grouper <b>spawning</b> aggregation <b>sites</b> in Belize and 5 known sites in the Cayman Islands were located at convex-shaped seaward extending reefs (reef promontories) jutting into deep water, within 1 km of reef promontory tips. However, spawning aggregations did not always occur at the tips of reef promontories, though all were found along the shelf edges within 1 km of promontory tips. Sixteen <b>sites</b> were multi-species <b>spawning</b> <b>sites.</b> These general characteristics were used to predict an undiscovered multi-species spawning aggregation in Belize. A successful prediction in Belize, together with the compiled data from multiple sites indicate: 1) reef promontories are vital locations for transient reef fish spawning aggregations, and 2) this study provides a potential tool for prediction of unknown <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> in the Caribbean...|$|R

25|$|In the Banggai cardinalfish, {{courtship}} {{behavior is}} usually {{initiated by the}} female. Upon choosing a mate, the female isolates her potential mate from other individuals in the colony by creating a spherical <b>spawning</b> <b>site</b> that is about 50-60 centimeters in diameter. The general movement that the female exhibits is called ‘side by side trembling,’ {{which is where the}} female approaches the male from behind with a vigorous trembling motion while the male stays motionless. Then she places herself alongside him and tilts her body thirty degrees outward from its vertical plane, when the male and female’s caudal and anal fins come into contact. The female repeats this movement until the male responds with sporadic ‘mouth opening,’ a sign of receptiveness. Such courtship behavior may last from several hours to two to three days. When an intruder interrupts a female’s courtship behavior, the female would rapidly and aggressively chase the intruder away if the intruder is of the same sex. However, when the secondary male, or the intruder male approaches, he, instead of the female, exhibits trembling behavior, and also helps to defend the female and primary male’s isolated territory. If the primary male does not respond to female’s trembling, the female leaves periodically to visit the secondary male and displays trembling behavior which often results in mating.|$|E
500|$|Spawning is {{preceded by}} {{significant}} upstream migrations if high spring flows or floods allow. Radio-tracked Murray cod in the Murray River have migrated up to [...] upstream to spawn, {{before returning to}} exactly the same snag from where they departed, an unusual homing behaviour in a freshwater fish. Decades of observations by recreational and commercial fishermen suggest such spring spawning migrations are common across the Murray cod's geographical range. Spawning is initiated by pairing up and courtship rituals. During the courtship ritual a <b>spawning</b> <b>site</b> is selected and cleaned — hard surfaces such as rocks in upland rivers and impoundments, and logs and occasionally clay banks in lowland rivers, {{at a depth of}} , are selected. The female lays the large adhesive eggs as a mat on the spawning surface, which the male fertilises. The female then leaves the <b>spawning</b> <b>site.</b> The male remains to guard the eggs during incubation, which takes six to 10 days (depending on water temperature), and to guard the hatched larvae for a further week or so until they disperse. Larvae disperse from the nest site by drifting in river currents at night, and continue this behaviour around four to seven days. During this dispersal process, larvae simultaneously absorb the remainder of their yolk sac and begin to feed on pelagic zooplankton, small, early life-stage macroinvertebrates and epibenthic/epiphytic (bottom dwelling/edge clinging) microinvertebrates.|$|E

A recent decline in the recruitment of Western Baltic spring-spawning herring (WBSSH) increases the urgency of filling the knowledge gap for this stock, especially because one bottleneck in the recruitment seems to occur before hatching. We examined the successful 2003 – 2009 <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> of WBSSH in the main spawning ground, the Greifswalder Bodden lagoon.

50|$|The second {{display is}} known as the Wiggle Waggle Display. This display {{occurred}} when a female that would be a potential spawning partner entered into his territory. The male would begin by approaching the desired female very slowly, if she stays and does not swim away, he will begin to “dance” erratically; meaning he will then swim toward the spawning vegetation in an up and down pattern while raising and lowering his dorsal and anal fins, and alternately flexing and opening his pelvic fins. This behavior will continue from the male for a few minutes.

Aggregations of 3400 – 5500 birds gathered at {{a small number of}} sites along the same 8 -km stretch of shoreline each year that spawn was available there. Aggregations occurred in {{only a small fraction of}} the habitat area where spawn was available. Duration of stay at <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> averaged 2 – 3 weeks and many birds re-turned to their wintering grounds afterwards. Birds moving to <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> represented 55 – 87 % of the total wintering population. The proportion of local wintering populations that moved to <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> was negatively related to the distance they had to travel, and few birds travelled farther than 80 km. The decline in proportions moving with increas-ing distance suggests that more distant individuals may be constrained by a lack of information or that there are trade-offs between the benefits of exploiting spawn and the costs of movement. This raises a conservation concern because the temporal and geographic range of herring spawning in British Columbia is contracting and some wintering water-bird populations may be losing access to this important late-winter food.

Iden-tification and protection of critical spawning habitat for northern pike Esox lucius and muskellunge Esox masquinongy is important for preserving the reproductive potential of both species. In this study, we implanted miniature radio transmitters through the ovi-duct into the egg masses of female northern pike and muskellunge just prior to spawn-ing. This non-surgical procedure is a novel approach for identifying <b>spawning</b> <b>sites</b> if transmitters are expelled with the eggs during egg deposition. <b>Spawning</b> <b>sites</b> can then be located by finding the shed transmitters. Preliminary studies in three lakes showed that northern pike and muskellunge deposited transmitters in likely spawning habitat.
