A 3 D contact formulation has been implemented to recover accuracy in the contacts detection and the application of contact forces; it considers the 3 D model kinematic and introduces the local geometry of the contact area. The model behavior with blade-to-casing contacts is analyzed through two approaches: the first one assumes permanent contacts while the other one allows intermittent contacts.

Higher efficiency requirements leading to reduced clearance between blade-tips and casing together with the rotation of the blade disk increase the possibility of interaction between these traveling waves through direct contact. By definition, large amplitudes as well as structural failure may be expected. A very simple two-dimensional model of outer casing and bladed disk is introduced in order to predict the occurrence of such phenomenon in terms of rotational velocity. In order to consider traveling wave motions, each structure is represented by its two $n_d$-nodal diameter standing modes. Equations of motion are solved first using an explicit time integration scheme in conjunction with the Lagrange multiplier method which accounts for the contact constraints, and then by the Harmonic Balance Method.

Cement is the primer material used for zonal isolation and permanent P&A as barrier material. However, it is recognized that cement {{may not be}} a suitable material. Other barrier materials are being developed and tested. The high costs of establishing barriers and durability of materials persuaded engineers to check the usability of naturally established barriers, such as creeping formations. The concept of formation as barrier (FAB) is to use earth itself as barrier material. It is desirable to exploit the displaced formation <b>surrounding</b> <b>casing</b> considering it is cost efficient, saves time and makes operation performance carried out in a safe manner.

These mechanisms still remain unclear and understanding their origins is a new challenge. On that subject, the present work deals with a new full 3 D strategy in order to provide meaningful insights to designers. It involves reduced computational costs and a robust contact methodology able to account for high relative displacements at the contact interface. The first aspect of the problem is addressed through the reduction of the structures using the Craig-Bampton approach. The second one is treated with the use of spline concepts in order to smooth the contact surface and thus, avoid numerical issues. Accordingly, one set of interface nodes belonging to the area where contact is anticipated is defined for each structure. The contact constraints are enforced through a surface spline attached to the interface nodes of the casing. The respective contact forces are calculated using the Lagrange multiplier framework within an explicit time-marching procedure. Accuracy and computational costs are controlled {{by the size of the}} reduced-order models. The capabilities of this very versatile strategy encompass a wide range of finite element meshes and interaction problems that may occur in fan, turbine or compressor sections.

40|$|International audienceReducing the {{clearance}} between blade tips and casing {{is an important factor}} in increasing the performance of turbomachines such as turbofan engines. However, small clearances lead to more chances of rotor-stator contact, which can cause unstable vibrations. To improve the prediction of such contact-related phenomena, this paper proposes a model that includes potential contacts between the fan blade tips and their <b>surrounding</b> <b>casing.</b> This phenomenological model consists of a fully flexible bladed rotor and a flexible casing. The bladed rotor model is built according to the method developed by Lesaffre and based on the approximations used by Sinha [2]. The casing model is composed of an elastic ring with isotropic suspension. Two different contact formulations have been developed: a 3 D contact detection law, which incorporates 3 D model kinematics along with 3 D local geometry of the contact area, is compared to a simpler formulation. For both formulations, once {{the clearance}} has been consumed, contact forces are introduced with normal contact stiffness, and friction is considered using Coulomb’s Law. In an initial step, linear harmonic results serve to compare these contact formulations in their ability to detect contact. Next, the stability of balanced static solutions is studied and transient analyses are carried out to confirm the static results. Study results highlight the influence of 3 D kinematics and 3 D local geometry on both contact detection and the dynamic stability of the system subjected to blade-casing contact...|$|E

Using a novel approach, the device seeks to accelerate incoming air above minimum velocities required for economical power generation. The novel approach employs a funnel shaped inlet with relief vents along the circumference, so as to alleviate backpressure. Both inlet and outlet sections utilize funnel shapes with both parabolic and hyperbolic regions. All geometry and mesh models were created using ICEM 12. 1. Simulations were performed using Fluent 12. 1. 2. Turbulence was modeled using the standard k-epsilon model. All mesh models contained roughly 500, 000 unstructured computational cells.

40|$|International audienceMinimizing the {{clearance}} between turbofan blades and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>casing</b> is a key factor to achieving compressor efficiency. The deposition of an abradable coating on casings {{is one of the}} technologies used to reduce this blade-casing clearance and ensure blade integrity in the event of blade-casing contact. Aircraft in-service condi-tions may lead to interactions between the blade tip and the coated casing, during which wear of the abradable coating, blade dynamics and interacting force are critical yet little-understood issues. In order to study blade/abradable-coating interactions of a few tens of milliseconds, experiments were conducted on a dedicated test rig. The experi-mental data were analyzed with the aim of determining the friction-induced vibrational modes of the blade. This involved a time-frequency analysis of the experimental blade strain using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, combined with a modal analysis of the blade. The latter was carried out with two kinds of kinematic boundary conditions at the blade tip: free and modified, by imposing contact with the abradable coating. The interaction data show that the blade vibration modes identified during interactions cor-respond to the free boundary condition, due to the transitional nature of the phenomena and the very short duration of contacts. The properties of the Continous Wavelet Trans-form were then used to identify the occurence of blade-coating contact. Two kinds of blade/abradable-coating interactions were identified: bouncing of the blade over short time periods associated with loss of abradable material, and isolated contacts capable of amplifying the blade vibrations without causing significant wear of the abradable coat-ing. The results obtained were corroborated by high-speed imaging of the interactions...|$|E

This technical choice possibly leads to interactions between elastic structural components through direct unilateral contact and dry friction, events which are now accepted as normal operating conditions. Subsequent nonlinear dynamical behaviors of such systems are commonly investigated with simplified academic models mainly due to theoretical difficulties and numerical challenges involved in non-smooth large-scale realistic models. In this context, the present paper introduces an adaptation of a full three-dimensional contact strategy for the prediction of potentially damaging motions that would imply highly demanding computational efforts for the targeted aerospace application in an industrial context. It combines a smoothing procedure including bicubic B-spline patches together with a Lagrange multiplier based contact strategy within an explicit time-marching integration procedure preferred for its versatility. The proposed algorithm is first compared on a benchmark configuration against the more elaborated bi-potential formulation and the commercial software Ansys. The consistency of the provided results and the low energy fluctuations of the introduced approach underlines its reliable numerical properties. A case study featuring blade-tip/casing contact on industrial finite element models is then proposed: it incorporates component mode synthesis and the developed 3 D contact algorithm for investigating structural interactions occurring within a turbomachine compressor stage. Both time results and frequency-domain analysis emphasize the practical use of such a numerical tool: detection of severe operating conditions and critical rotational velocities, time-dependent maps of stresses acting within the structures, parameter studies and blade design tests...|$|R

40|$|During aero-engine operation, rotor misalignment, thermal and {{centrifugal}} dilatations, and unbalanced parts lead {{to contact}} between the rotating blade and the abradable lining of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>casing.</b> Observation of aero-engine service has highlighted undesirable issues and relative wear mechanisms that have created problems during operation, with significant reductions in aero-engine performance. Examples of issues observed were adhesive transfer of abradable material to the blade tip, along with blade wear. These observations have highlighted the final result of the {{contact between the}} blade and abradable; however, the complexity of introducing instruments to the aero-engine {{has led to a}} gap in knowledge with respect to the parameters that influence these wear mechanisms. This issue has provided the motivation for this research, where wear mechanism between a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rotating blade and abradable material AlSi-hBN has been investigated on a scaled test platform. AlSi-hBN has been chosen as it represents the most common technology used in the compressor stage of the engine. Alternative approaches that characterised the wear mechanism in real time were introduced {{in order to try to}} explore the nature of the contact. The introduction of an innovative stroboscopic imaging technique allowed the progression of adhesive transfer / blade wear to be investigated in real time during a test, revealing that the standard practice of performing analysis of adhered material at the end of a test does not necessarily characterise the overall mechanics of adhesive transfer satisfactorily. In addition, the measurement of contact force and the calculation of the efficiency of cut and force ratio, highlighted different material behaviour in relation to the incursion rate and hardness. It was shown that it was difficult to dislocate the material at low incursion rate, with consolidation evident, whereas at higher incursion rates the material was well fractured. The measurement of the coating temperature highlighted the heat generated in the contact, along with the effect of changing coating hardness on the thermal properties of the abradable, leading to markedly different thermal behaviour at low hardness, and in particular at low incursion rate. The wear mechanisms observed, adhesive transfer, blade wear and cutting, were mainly incursion rate dependent, with a thermal wear mechanism at low incursion rate and a well cut mechanism at high incursion rate. At low incursion rate, different wear mechanisms were observed in relation to the hardness, with adhesive transfer on the blade tip from the hard coating and blade wear in the test performed against the soft coating, with similar results observed at all blade speeds. A wear map was generated in relation to the input parameters, such as the incursion rate, speed and coating hardness, and also the reflected different thermal properties of the coating. This indicated that it is better to have a high thermally conductivity coating; therefore, the use of a hard AlSi-hBN is a better option, because less thermal damage was observed. The wear map with the highlighted wear regimes is a useful design tool with respect to planning running and handling manoeuvres for the engine, where the manufacturer has the option to control incursion parameters. As these represent the most significant incursion performed, this finding is of particular benefit...|$|E

When too much water is used to prepare the slurry, alkaline bleed -water can drain through or along the cement sheath <b>surrounding</b> the <b>casing.</b> This results in an increase in the pH measurements of groundwater samples. This bleed-water can separate from the cement in-three ways: it can move into the formation during cementing, it can accumulate within the cement forming pockets and channels behind the casing, and it can remain within the interconnected capillaries that exist throughout the cement sheath. The drainage of alkaline bleed -water from the cement can be greatly reduced by controlling the amount of water used in the preparation of the slurry. The amount of water added can be monitored during well construction by measuring the slurry density. By implementing this quality control procedure during well construction along with specifying the correct amount of mix-water for the slurry, the elevated pH levels in groundwater samples should be greatly reduced if not completely eliminated...|$|R
