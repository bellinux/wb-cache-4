[...] Optical injection has been described using over a dozen different names or phrases (see bulleted lists below). Some trends in the literature are clear. The first term of the technique is invariably a derivation of word laser, optical, or photo, and the second term is usually in reference to injection, transfection, poration, perforation or puncture. Like many cellular perturbations, when a single cell or group of cells is treated with a laser, three things can happen: the cell dies (overdose), the cell membrane is permeabilised, substances enter, and the cell recovers (therapeutic dose), or nothing happens (underdose). There have been suggestions in the literature to reserve the term optoinjection for when a therapeutic dose is delivered upon a single cell, and the term optoporation for when a laser generated shockwave treats a cluster of many (10s to 100s) cells.

The methodology {{of this study}} is based on a pelvis phantom and a physical printed 3 D model of the prostate with dominant intra-prostatic-lesion and surrounding organs at risk segmented from a patient MR images. Cyberknife prostate treatment planning was performed to have at least 95 % the planning target volumes (PTV: prostate expanded with margins of 5 mm in all directions except 3 mm posteriorly) covered by 3625 cGy (725 x 5) and a <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dose</b> escalation to 4750 cGy on the dominant intra-prostatic-lesion. Plan dosimetry verification was performed using Gafchromic EBT 3 films on a Stereotactic Dose Verification Phantom. First, film calibration was done on Gafchromic EBT 3 films exposed to various doses of 0 - 2500 cGy based on a LINAC (Trilogy) and CyberKnife monthly quality assurance (QA) for machine output calibration. Second, absolute dose measurements were taken by using films within the dose range 0 - 2250 cGy. Third, Gafchromic EBT 3 films were placed in coronal and sagittal planes on the standard “blue phantom” or Stereotactic Dose Verification Phantom (SDVP) on which one fraction of the treatment plan is delivered for verification measurements. Then, on the prostate-pelvis phantom, a dosimetry inserts were used with films through the DIL region. After the calibration, the accuracy of absolute dose measurements with EBT 3 was verified to be ≤ 1 % in the dose range of interest (500 - 1500 cGy). On the SDVP phantom, comparison of films vs. plan for the coronal plane yielded ≥ 99. 7 % passing rates while for sagittal plane yielded ≥ 95. 3 % passing rates under the gamma criteria of ≤ 2 % in dose and ≤ 2 mm in distance to agreement (DTA).

40|$|Intermittent dosing of free {{nitrous acid}} (FNA), {{with or without}} the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dosing</b> of {{hydrogen}} peroxide, is a new strategy developed recently for the control of sulfide production in sewers. Six-month field trials have been carried out in a rising main sewer in Australia (150 mm in diameter and 1080 m in length) to evaluate the performance of the strategy that was previously demonstrated in laboratory studies. In each trial, FNA was dosed at a pumping station for a period of 8 or 24 h, some with simultaneous hydrogen peroxide dosing. The sulfide control effectiveness was monitored by measuring, on-line, the dissolved sulfide concentration at a downstream location of the pipeline (828 m from the pumping station) and the gaseous H 2 S concentration at the discharge manhole. Effective sulfide control was achieved in all nine consecutive trials, with sulfide production reduced by more than 80 % in 10 days following each dose. Later trials achieved better control efficiency than the first few trials possibly due to the disrupting effects of FNA on sewer biofilms. This suggests that an initial strong dose (more chemical consumption) followed by maintenance dosing (less chemical consumption) could be a very cost-effective way to achieve consistent control efficiency. It was also found that heavy rainfall slowed the recovery of sulfide production after dosing, likely due to the dilution effects and reduced retention time. Overall, intermittent dose of FNA or FNA in combination with H 2 O 2 was successfully demonstrated to be a cost-effective method for sulfide control in rising main sewers...|$|E

Logarithmic-phase cultures were exposed to peak antibiotic concentrations observed in human serum after the administration of intravenous doses of 3 g of piperacillin and 0. 375 g of tazobactam or 0. 5 g of sulbactam. Piperacillin and inhibitor were either dosed simultaneously or piperacillin was dosed sequentially 0. 5 h after dosing with the inhibitor. In studies with all four test strains, the pharmacodynamics observed after <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dosing</b> {{were similar to those}} observed with the sequential regimen. Since the ratio between piperacillin and tazobactam was in constant fluctuation after sequential dosing, these data suggest that the pharmacodynamics of the piperacillin-inhibitor combinations were not dependent upon maintenance of a critical ratio between the components. Furthermore, when regrowth was observed, the time at which bacterial counts began to increase was similar between the simultaneous and sequential dosing regimens. Since the pharmacokinetics of the inhibitors were the same for all regimens, these data suggest that the length of time that the antibacterial activity was maintained over the dosing interval with these combinations was dictated by the pharmacokinetics of the beta-lactamase inhibitor in the combination. The antibacterial activity of the combination appeared to be lost when the amount of inhibitor available fell below some critical concentration. This critical concentration varied depending upon the type and amount of enzyme produced, as well as the specific inhibitor used. These results indicate that the antibacterial activity of drug-inhibitor combinations, when dosed at their currently recommended ratios, is more dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the inhibitor than on those of the beta-lactam drug...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{modeling}} of combination therapy can describe {{the effects of}} each antibiotic against multiple bacterial populations. Our aim was to develop an efficient experimental andmodeling strategy that evaluates different synergy mechanisms using a rapidly killing peptide antibiotic (nisin) combined with amikacin or linezolid as probe drugs. Serial viable counts over 48 h were obtained in time-kill experiments with all three antibiotics in monotherapy against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA 300 strain (inoculum, 108 CFU/ml). A sequential design (initial dosing of 8 or 32 mg/liter nisin, switched to amikacin or lin-ezolid at 1. 5 h) assessed the rate of killing by amikacin and linezolid against nisin-intermediate and nisin-resistant populations. Simultaneous combinations were additionally studied and all viable count profiles comodeled in S-ADAPT and NONMEM. A mechanism-based model with six populations (three for nisin times two for amikacin) yielded unbiased and precise (r 0. 99, slope 1. 00; S-ADAPT) individual fits. The second-order killing rate constants for nisin against the three populations were 5. 67, 0. 0664, and 0. 00691 liter/(mg · h). For amikacin, the maximum killing rate constants were 10. 1 h 1 against its susceptible and 0. 771 h 1 against its less-susceptible populations, with 14. 7 mg/liter amikacin causing half-maximal killing. After incorporating the effects of nisin and amikacin against each population, no additional synergy function was needed. Linezolid inhibited suc-cessful bacterial replication but did not efficiently kill populations less susceptible to nisin. Nisin plus amikacin achieved sub-population synergy.

Patients with previously untreated small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) received escalating doses of cyclophosphamide (C) 1100 - 1300 mg m- 2 intravenously (i. v.) on day 1, doxorubicin (D) 50 - 60 mg m- 2 i. v. on day 1, etoposide (E) 110 - 130 mg m- 2 i. v. on days 1, 2, 3 and every 14 days for at least three courses. Along with chemotherapy, G-CSF (filgastrim) 5 micrograms kg- 1 from day 5 to day 11 was administered subcutaneously (s. c.) to all patients. Twenty-five patients were enrolled into the study. All patients at the first dose level (C 1100, D 50, E 110 x 3) completed three or more cycles at the dose and schedule planned by the protocol and no 'dose-limiting toxicity' (DLT) was seen. At the second dose level (C 1200, D 55, E 120 x 3) three out of five patients had a DLT consisting of 'granulocytopenic fever' (GCPF). Another six patients were treated at this dose level with the addition of ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day and only two patients had a DLT [one episode of documented oral candidiasis and one of 'fever of unknown origin' (FUO) with generalised mucositis]. Accrual of patients proceeded to the third dose level (C 1300, D 60, E 130 x 3) with the prophylactic use of ciprofloxacin. Four out of six patients experienced a DLT consisting of GCPF or documented non-bacterial infection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{establish}} an empirical model of the ion recombination in the Advanced Markus ionization chamber for measurements in high dose rate/dose-per-pulse electron beams. In addition, we compared the observed ion recombination to calculations using the standard Boag two-voltage-analysis method, the more general theoretical Boag models, and the semiempirical general equation presented by Burns and McEwen. Two independent methods were used to investigate the ion recombination: (a) Varying the grid tension of the linear accelerator (linac) gun (controls the linac output) and measuring the relative effect the grid tension has on the chamber response at different source-to-surface distances (SSD). (b) Performing <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dose</b> measurements and comparing the dose-response, in beams with varying dose rate/dose-per-pulse, with the chamber together with dose rate/dose-per-pulse independent Gafchromic™ EBT 3 film. Three individual Advanced Markus chambers {{were used for the}} measurements with both methods. All measurements were performed in electron beams with varying mean dose rate, dose rate within pulse, and dose-per-pulse (10 (- 2)  ≤ mean dose rate ≤  10 (3) Gy/s, 10 (2)  ≤ mean dose rate within pulse ≤  10 (7)  Gy/s, 10 (- 4)  ≤ dose-per-pulse ≤  10 (1)  Gy), which was achieved by independently varying the linac gun grid tension, and the SSD. The results demonstrate how the ion collection efficiency of the chamber decreased as the dose-per-pulse increased, and that the ion recombination was dependent on the dose-per-pulse rather than the dose rate, a behavior predicted by Boag theory. The general theoretical Boag models agreed well with the data over the entire investigated dose-per-pulse range, but only for a low polarizing chamber voltage (50  V). However, the two-voltage-analysis method and the Burns & McEwen equation only agreed with the data at low dose-per-pulse values (≤  10 (- 2) and ≤  10 (- 1)  Gy, respectively). An empirical model of the ion recombination in the chamber was found by fitting a logistic function to the data. The ion collection efficiency of the Advanced Markus ionization chamber decreases for measurements in electron beams with increasingly higher dose-per-pulse. However, this chamber is still functional for dose measurements in beams with dose-per-pulse values up toward and above 10  Gy, if the ion recombination is taken into account. Our results show that existing models give a less-than-accurate description of the observed ion recombination. This motivates the use of the presented empirical model for measurements with the Advanced Markus chamber in high dose-per-pulse electron beams, as it enables accurate absorbed dose measurements (uncertainty estimation: 2. 8 - 4. 0 %, k =  1). The model depends on the dose-per-pulse in the beam, and it is also influenced by the polarizing chamber voltage, with increasing ion recombination with a lowering of the voltage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) and agonistic {{antibodies}} to death receptor 4 and 5 are promising candidates {{for cancer therapy}} due {{to their ability to}} induce apoptosis selectively in a variety of human cancer cells, while demonstrating little cytotoxicity in normal cells. Although TRAIL and agonistic {{antibodies to}} DR 4 and DR 5 are considered safe and promising candidates in cancer therapy, many malignant cells are resistant to DR-mediated, TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In the current work, we screened a small library of fifty-five FDA and foreign-approved anti-neoplastic drugs in order to identify candidates that sensitized resistant prostate and pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Methods FDA-approved drugs were screened for their ability to sensitize TRAIL resistant prostate cancer cells to TRAIL using an MTT assay for cell viability. Analysis of variance was used to identify drugs that exhibited synergy with TRAIL. Drugs demonstrating the highest synergy were selected as leads and tested in different prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and one immortalized human pancreatic epithelial cell line. Sequential and <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dosing</b> modalities were investigated and the annexin V/propidium iodide assay, in concert with fluorescence microscopy, was employed to visualize cells undergoing apoptosis. Results Fourteen drugs were identified as having synergy with TRAIL, including those whose TRAIL sensitization activities were previously unknown in either prostate or pancreatic cancer cells or both. Five leads were tested in additional cancer cell lines of which, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and mithramycin demonstrated synergy in all lines. In particular, mitoxantrone and mithramycin demonstrated significant synergy with TRAIL and led to reduction of cancer cell viability at concentrations lower than 1 μM. At these low concentrations, mitoxantrone demonstrated selectivity toward malignant cells over normal pancreatic epithelial cells. Conclusions The identification of a number of FDA-approved drugs as TRAIL sensitizers can expand chemotherapeutic options for combination treatments in prostate and pancreatic cancer diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sulfate {{reduction}} {{is the primary}} source of hydrogen sulfide production in the anaerobic rising main sewers. Hydrogen sulfide causes many problems including odor, corrosion, and health and safety hazards. Methane is another important sewer gas generated by methanogens. Methane is a very potent green-house gas and imposes the possibility of explosion. Only very recently did researchers realize the importance of methane formation in sewers. Among many chemical dosing strategies to control sulfate reduction and methane production, nitrate and nitrite are the economic and popular choices in water industry. The overall objective of this thesis is to develop and optimize dosing strategies that can achieve effective control of both sulfate reduction and methane production in sewers by adding nitrate or nitrite. However, many mechanistic aspects of nitrate/nitrite dosing are largely unknown. To achieve this goal, this thesis has investigated several factors on the control of sulfate reduction and methane production. These included nitrate/nitrite concentrations, exposure time, pH, and dosing frequency. The experiments were conducted in either laboratory-scale rising main sewer reactors or real sewers. Significant contributions from this thesis are as below. The anoxic and anaerobic sulfur transformation by sewer biofilms acclimated to nitrate dosing was investigated using laboratory-scale sewer reactors. Elemental sulfur was found to be an important intermediate product during sulfide oxidation. Anoxic sulfide oxidation (with nitrate) proceeded in two steps sequentially, namely the oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur and then elemental sulfur to sulfate. The first step was considerably faster than the second one. Under anaerobic conditions, the reduction of sulfate and elemental sulfur occurred simultaneously, with sulfate reduction much faster than elemental sulfur reduction. The two reduction processes are likely conducted by S 0 dedicated (sulfur-reducing bacteria) and SO 42 – dedicated (sulfate-reducing bacteria) bacteria, respectively. Nitrite inhibition on sulfate reduction and methane production was studied with both lab reactor tests and a field trial. It was found that the inhibition of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis depends on both nitrite concentration and exposure time. To achieve a certain level of inhibition, longer exposure time can compensate for lower nitrite concentration and vice versa. However, there is a minimum nitrite concentration and exposure time required for an inhibition level. Nitrite can be applied intermittently to achieve sulfide and methane control in sewers. Field trial showed that 33 hour intermittent dosage of nitrite at a concentration of 100 mg-N/L over a period of three days completely suppresses sulfide and methane production. Sulfide production was at a significantly reduced rate in the following three weeks without nitrite addition, while methane production remained at negligible to low levels for at least three months. Methanogens are more susceptible to nitrite than SRB. The decrease of sulfide and methane production caused by nitrite at low pH was investigated with anaerobic sewer biofilms developed in laboratory-scale sewer reactors. The viability of biofilm cells were measured under a range of pH (5  7), nitrite concentrations (0  120 mg-N/L), and exposure times (6  24 hours) conditions. The results indicated that cell viability is highly correlated with the free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration rather than pH or the nitrite concentration. FNA concentration at 0. 2 – 0. 3 mg-N/L was observed to induce 85 – 95 % of biofilm cell death. Longer exposure time could achieve higher cell death rate. Physical disrupted biofilm was more susceptible to FNA, although some biofilm cells still showed resistance to FNA. Anaerobic biofilm reactors dosed with nitrite at lowered pH (FNA concentrations at 0. 18 and 0. 36 mg-N/L) confirmed the cell deactivation after FNA dosage. The recovery of sulfide and methane production resembled microbial growth patterns, suggesting the regrowth of sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens after stopping FNA dosage. The optimization of intermittent and <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dosing</b> of nitrite and hydrochloric acid (forming FNA at low pH) as a measure for controlling sulfide and methane production in sewers is investigated. Three key operational parameters namely the dosing concentration, dosing duration and dosing interval were optimized experimentally using lab-scale sewer reactors. FNA as low as 0. 26 mg-N/L was able to suppress sulfide production after an exposure of 12 hours. In comparison, 0. 09 mg-N/L of FNA with 6 -hour exposure was adequate to restrain methanogenesis effectively. The recovery of sulfide production was well described by an exponential recovery equation. Model-based analysis revealed that, 12 -hour dosage at an FNA concentration of 0. 26 mg-N/L every 5 days can reduce the average sulfide production by > 80 %. Economic analysis showed that intermittent FNA dosage is more cost-effective than many other chemicals, such as ferric/ferrous, nitrate, that are commonly used in sewers...|$|E
40|$|Altered {{metabolism}} is {{a hallmark}} of almost all cancers. A tumor’s metabolic phenotype can drastically change its ability to proliferate and to survive stressors such as hypoxia or therapy. Metabolism {{can be used as}} a diagnostic marker, by differentiating neoplastic and normal tissue, and as a prognostic marker, by providing information about tumor metastatic potential. Metabolism can further be used to guide treatment selection and monitoring, as cancer treatments can influence metabolism directly by targeting a specific metabolic dysfunction or indirectly by altering upstream signaling pathways. Repeated measurement of metabolic changes during the course of treatment can therefore indicate a tumor’s response or resistance. Recently, well-supported theories indicate that the ability to modulate metabolic phenotype underpins some cancer cells’ ability to remain dormant for decades and recur with an aggressive phenotype. It follows that accurate identification and repeated monitoring of a tumor’s metabolic phenotype can bolster understanding and prediction of a tumor’s behavior from diagnosis, through treatment, and (sadly) sometimes back again. The two primary axes of metabolism are glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and alteration of either can promote unwanted outcomes in cancer. In particular, increased glucose uptake independent of oxygenation is a well-known mark of aggressive cancers that are more likely to metastasize and evade certain therapies. Lately, mitochondria are also gaining recognition as key contributors in tumor metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism has been shown to promote metastasis in a variety of cell types. Most tumor types rely on a combination of both aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, but the two axes’ relative contributions to ATP production can vary wildly. Knowledge of both glycolytic and mitochondrial endpoints is required for actionable, systems-level understanding of tumor metabolic preference. Several technologies exist that can measure endpoints informing on glycolytic and/or mitochondrial metabolism. However, these technologies suffer from a combination of prohibitive cost, low resolution, and lack of repeatability due to destructive sample treatments. There is a critical need to bridge the gap in pre-clinical studies between single-endpoint whole body imaging and destructive ex vivo assays that provide multiple metabolic properties, neither of which can provide adequate spatiotemporal information for repeated tumor monitoring. Optical technologies are well-suited to non-destructive, high resolution imaging of tumor metabolism. A carefully chosen set of endpoints can be measured across a variety of length scales and resolutions to obtain a complete picture of a tumor’s metabolic state. First, the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -Deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG) can be used to report on glucose uptake. The fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) reports on mitochondrial membrane potential, which provides information regarding capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. Vascular oxygenation (SO 2) and morphological features, which are critical for interpretation of 2 -NBDG and TMRE uptake, can be obtained using only endogenous contrast from hemoglobin. Three specific aims were proposed toward the ultimate goal of developing an optical imaging toolbox that utilizes exogenous fluorescence and endogenous absorption contrast to characterize cancer metabolic phenotype in vivo. In Aim 1, we optimized the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -Deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG) to report on glycolytic demand in vivo. Our primary goal was to demonstrate that correcting 2 -NBDG uptake (NBDG 60) by the rate of delivery (RD) showed improved contrast between distinct tumor phenotypes. We showed that the ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD served as a delivery-corrected measure of glucose uptake in the dorsal skin flap window chamber models containing normal tissues and tumors. Delivery correction was able to minimize the effects of a large change in the injected 2 -NBDG dose. Further, the endpoint showed a significant inverse correlation with blood glucose levels. Since glucose has been shown to competitively inhibit 2 -NBDG transport into cells, this finding indicating that we were indeed reporting on glucose uptake. Importantly, the ratio was able to distinguish specific uptake of 2 -NBDG from accumulation of a fluorescent control, 2 -NBDLG, which is identical to 2 -NBDG in molecular weight and fluorescent spectrum, but is unable to undergo active transport into the cell. The ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was then leveraged to compare different tumor phenotypes and to characterize the dependence of glucose uptake on vascular oxygenation within these tumors. Our results showed that 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was an effective endpoint for comparing in vivo glucose uptake of metastatic 4 T 1 and nonmetastatic 4 T 07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas. Further, the addition of vascular information revealed metabolic heterogeneity within the tumors. The primary conclusion of Aim 1 was that delivery-corrected 2 -NBDG uptake (2 -NBDG 60 /RD) is an appropriate indicator of glucose demand in both normal and tumor tissues. In Aim 2, we optimized fluorescent tetramethyl rhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) for measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). We then leveraged the relationships between MMP, glucose uptake, and vascular endpoints to characterize the in vivo metabolic landscapes of three distinct and extensively studied murine breast cancer lines: metastatic 4 T 1 and non-metastatic 67 NR and 4 T 07. Using two-photon microscopy, we confirmed that TMRE localizes to mitochondrial-sized features in the window chamber when delivered via tail vein. The kinetics of TMRE uptake were robust across both normal and tumor tissues, with a stable temporal window for measurement from 40 - 75 minutes after injection. We saw that TMRE uptake decreased as expected in response to hypoxia in non-tumor tissue, and in response to chemical inhibition with a mitochondrial uncoupler in both non-tumor and 4 T 1 tissue. MMP was increased in all tumor types relative to non-tumor (p We leveraged the relationships between the now-optimized endpoints of MMP (Aim 2), glucose uptake (Aim 1) and vascular endpoints (Aims 1 and 2) to characterize the in vivo metabolic landscapes of three distinct and extensively studied murine breast cancer lines: metastatic 4 T 1 and non-metastatic 67 NR and 4 T 07. Imaging the combination of endpoints revealed a classic “Warburg effect” coupled with hyperpolarized mitochondria in 4 T 1; 4 T 1 maintained vastly increased glucose uptake and comparable MMP relative to 4 T 07 or 67 NR across all SO 2. We also showed that imaging trends were concordant with independent metabolomics analysis, though the lack of spatial and vascular data from metabolomics obscured a more detailed comparison of the technologies. We observed that vascular features in tumor peritumoral areas (PA) were equally or more aberrant than vessels in the tumor regions that they neighbored. This prompted consideration of the metabolic phenotype of the PA. Regional metabolic cooperation between the tumor region and the PA was seen only in 4 T 1, where MMP was greater in 4 T 1 tumors and glucose uptake was greater in 4 T 1 PAs. Because of their regional metabolic coupling as well as their demonstrated capacity for glycolysis and mitochondrial activity, we hypothesized that the 4 T 1 tumors would have an increased ability to maintain robust MMP during hypoxia. 67 NR and 4 T 07 tumors showed expected shifts toward decreased MMP and increased glucose uptake during hypoxia, similar to the trends we observed in normal tissue. Surprisingly, 4 T 1 tumors appeared to increase mitochondrial metabolism during hypoxia, since MMP increased and SO 2 dramatically decreased. Overall, this aim demonstrated two key findings: 1. TMRE is a suitable marker of mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo in normal tissue and tumors, and 2. imaging of multiple metabolic and vascular endpoints is crucial for the appropriate interpretation of a metabolic behavior. Finally, in Aim 3 we evaluated the feasibility of combined 2 -NBDG and TMRE imaging. The primary objective was to enable simultaneous imaging of the two fluorophores by minimizing sources of “cross-talk”: chemical reaction, optical overlap, and confounding biological effects. A secondary objective was to transition our imaging method to a new platform, a reflectance-mode, high-resolution fluorescence imaging system built in our lab, which would expand the use of our technique beyond the dorsal window chamber model. We first used liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry to confirm that the chemical properties of the two fluorophores were compatible for simultaneous use, and indeed saw that the mixing of equimolar 2 -NBDG and TMRE did not form any new chemical species. We also performed a phantom study on the hyperspectral imaging system, used for all animal imaging in Aim 1 and Aim 2, to estimate the range of 2 -NBDG and TMRE concentrations that are seen at the tissue level in normal and tumor window chambers. We created a new phantom set that spanned the range of estimated in vivo concentrations, and imaged them with the reflectance-mode fluorescence imaging system. The phantom experiments gave us two important findings. First, we saw that fluorescence intensity increased linearly with fluorophore concentration, allowing for accurate quantification of concentration changes between samples. Most importantly, we found that we could exploit the optical properties of the fluorophores and our system’s spectral detection capability to excite the two fluorophores independently. Specifically, we could excite 2 -NBDG with a 488 nm laser without detectable emission from TMRE, and could excite TMRE with a 555 nm laser without detectable emission from 2 -NBDG. With this characterization, the optical properties of the two fluorophores were considered compatible for simultaneous imaging. Next, we sought to determine whether biological or delivery interactions would affect uptake of the two fluorophores. Surprisingly, both in vitro and in vivo imaging suggested that <b>simultaneous</b> <b>dosing</b> of the 2 -NBDG and TMRE caused significant changes in uptake of both probes. Since we previously found that TMRE equilibrates rapidly at the tissue site, we hypothesized that staggering the injections to allow delivery of TMRE to tissue before injecting 2 -NBDG would restore the full uptake of both fluorophores. Two sequential injection protocols were used: in the first group, TMRE was injected first followed by injection of 2 -NBDG after only 1 - 5 minutes, and in the second group, TMRE was injected first followed by injection of 2 -NBDG after 10 - 15 minutes. Both sequential injection strategies were sufficient to restore the final fluorescence of both fluorophores to that seen in the separate TMRE or 2 -NBDG imaging cohorts; however, the shorter time delay caused changes to the initial delivery kinetics of 2 -NBDG. We concluded that sequential imaging of TMRE followed by 2 -NBDG with a 10 - 15 minute delay was therefore the optimal imaging strategy to enable simultaneous quantification of glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo. Applying the sequential imaging protocol to 4 T 1 tumors demonstrated a highly glycolytic phenotype compared to the normal animals, as we had seen in Aim 2. However, mitochondrial membrane potential was comparable for the normal and tumor groups. The next study will test an extended delay between the injections to allow more time for TMRE delivery to tumors prior to 2 -NBDG injection. Overall, the key finding of Aim 3 was that a carefully chosen delivery strategy for 2 -NBDG and TMRE enabled simultaneous imaging of the two endpoints, since chemical and optical cross-talk were negligible. The work presented here indicates that an optical toolbox of 2 -NBDG, TMRE, and vascular endpoints is well poised to reveal interesting and distinct metabolic phenomena in normal tissue and tumors. Future work will focus on the integration of optical spectroscopy with the microscopy toolbox presented here, to enable long-term studies of the unknown metabolic changes underlying a tumor’s response to therapy, its escape into dormancy, and ultimately, its recurrence.

For all patients the radiotherapy was the primary treatment of pros-tate cancer, some patients underwent an androgen deprivation before, during or after the irra-diation. For toxicity assessment the CTCAE v 3. 0 was used. The median follow up was 54 month, progression free survival was 84. 5 % over all patients, 70 %, 90 % and 87 % for low- intermedi-ate- and high-risk group, respectively. 21. 5 % and 4. 3 % of the patients showed genitourinary and gastrointestinal late toxicity grade 2 or higher.

Data sources Pubmed database, evidence-based medicine websites, General Directorate of Health, Portuguese Association of General Practitioners, MGFamiliar. net, Index of Portuguese Medical Magazines. Review methods Research of clinical guidelines (CG), Systematic reviews (SR) and original studies using the MeSH terms: venous thrombosis; heparin, low-molecular-weight; anti-inflammatory agents. The search was limited to articles published between 2008 and 2011. Exclusion criteria were: repeated articles; ST during hospital admittance; ST not in the LL; pediatric ST; ST prophylaxis; Complicated ST; Risk factor related ST. American Family Physician’s Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) {{was used to assess}} the level of evidence. Results 215 articles were obtained. We have selected one CG, two SR and one randomized clinical trial (RCT). Evidence supports that there is improvement in patients’ symptoms with ST treated with LMWH or NSAIDs compared with placebo, reducing the incidence of recurrences and complications, without differences in safety profile in the short term. The evidence also highlights the anticoagulation as first-line therapy. The simultaneous use of NSAIDs and LMWH showed greater efficacy in symptomatic relief than LMWH alone in a RCT. Conclusions LMWH and NSAIDs are the two options with evidence supporting its use as first-line treatment (SOR B). Anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks is indicated especially when severity criteria are identified (SOR B). More randomized clinical trials are needed, particularly regarding the choice between LMWH or NSAIDs or its’ <b>simultaneous</b> use, <b>doses</b> and treatment’s length...|$|R

The exponential decay rate of the 13 C/ 12 C ratio after pulse-dosing 13 C-acetate, 13 C-propionate, or 13 C-butyrate into the rumen was compared with the decay rate of rumen valerate concentration following a <b>simultaneous</b> pulse <b>dose.</b> The unlabeled valerate, CoEDTA, and each labeled VFA, one at a time, were concurrently mixed with the evacuated ruminal content of 6 lactating cows in two 3 x 3 Latin squares. The clearance of VFA by passage to the omasum {{was assumed to be}} equivalent to the decay in ruminal Co concentration and was around 50 % of the total clearance. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate had similar fractional clearance rates (31. 2, 33. 4, 30. 4 %/h, respectively), but propionate had a higher absorption rate (19. 2 %/h) than butyrate (14. 2 %/h). Linear regression determination coefficients using the valerate clearance rate as an estimator for acetate, propionate, and butyrate rumen clearance were 0. 51, 0. 56, and 0. 99, respectively. In a second experiment, the 13 C-valerate fractional clearance rate estimate (33. 7 %/h) was similar to the estimate obtained with unlabeled valerate (35. 0 %/h) by the valerate-Co technique.
