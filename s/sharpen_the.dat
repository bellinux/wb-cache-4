5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E

25|$|The {{spectral}} shape {{and intensity of}} the optical signals from the N-V− centers are sensitive to external perturbation, such as temperature, strain, electric and magnetic field. However, the use of {{spectral shape}} for sensing those perturbation is impractical, as the diamond {{would have to be}} cooled to cryogenic temperatures to <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> N-V− signals. A more realistic approach is to use luminescence intensity (rather than lineshape), which exhibits a sharp resonance when a microwave frequency is applied to diamond that matches the splitting of the ground state levels. The resulting optically detected magnetic resonance signals are sharp even at room temperature, and can be used in miniature sensors. Such sensors can detect magnetic fields of a few nanotesla or electric fields of about 10 V/cm at kilohertz frequencies after 100 seconds of averaging. This sensitivity allows detecting a magnetic or electric field produced by a single electron located tens of nanometers away from an N-V− center.|$|E

25|$|The facial pit {{actually}} visualizes {{thermal radiation}} {{using the same}} optical principles as a pinhole camera, wherein {{the location of a}} source of thermal radiation is determined by the location of the radiation on the membrane of the heat pit. However, studies that have visualized the thermal images seen by the facial pit using computer analysis have suggested that the resolution is actually extremely poor. The size of the opening of the pit results in poor resolution of small, warm objects, and coupled with the pit's small size and subsequent poor heat conduction, the image produced is of extremely low resolution and contrast. It is known that some focusing and sharpening of the image occurs in the lateral descending trigeminal tract, and {{it is possible that the}} visual and infrared integration that occurs in the tectum may also be used to help <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> image. In addition, snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites with low thermal background radiation (colder areas) to maximize the contrast of their warm prey in order to achieve such a high degree of accuracy from their thermal “vision”.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using {{artificial}} means to try to accelerate the natural aging process. In Ancient Rome a smoke chamber known as a fumarium was used to enhance the flavor of wine through artificial aging. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color just like aged wine. Modern winemaking techniques like micro-oxygenation can have the side effect of artificially aging the wine. In the production of Madeira and rancio wines, the wines are deliberately exposed to excessive temperatures to accelerate the maturation of the wine. Other techniques used to artificially age wine (with inconclusive results on their effectiveness) include shaking the wine, exposing it to radiation, magnetism or ultra-sonic waves. More recently, experiments with artificial aging through high-voltage electricity have produced results above the remaining techniques, as assessed by a panel of wine tasters.|$|E
25|$|Frank Geyer, a Philadelphia detective {{tracking}} Holmes, {{found the}} decomposed {{bodies of the}} two Pitezel girls in the Toronto cellar. After removing the bodies from their shallow graves, Geyer noticed that Nellie's feet had been removed. After discovering that Nellie had club foot, he theorized that Holmes had cut off her feet to prevent a distinctive identification of the body. He then followed Holmes to Indianapolis, where Holmes had rented a cottage. Holmes {{was reported to have}} visited a local pharmacy to purchase the drugs which he used to kill Howard Pitezel, and a repair shop to <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> knives he used to chop up the body before he burned it. The boy's teeth and bits of bone were discovered in the home's chimney. Holmes' murder spree finally ended when he was arrested in Boston on November 17, 1894, after being tracked there from Philadelphia by the Pinkertons. He was held on an outstanding warrant for horse theft in Texas, as the authorities had become more suspicious at this point and Holmes appeared poised to flee the country in the company of his unsuspecting third wife.|$|E

However, AO on large ground-based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete. Most AO systems <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> view over a very narrow field—Lucky Cam, for example, produces crisp images just 10" [...] to 20" [...] wide, whereas Hubble's cameras produce crisp images across a 2½' (150") field. Furthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint—but nevertheless discernible—airglow that washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{extensively}} marketed through video trailers.

The first game cinematic was released on May 15, 2012, depicting {{a scene in which}} Joel and Ellie are ambushed by hunters. This was followed by a second trailer titled [...] "The Sky has Turned Grey", released on May 16.

500|$|To <b>sharpen</b> <b>the</b> {{precision}} of description and classification Joachim Jung (1587–1657) compiled a much-needed botanical terminology which has {{stood the test}} of time.

His observations started with the local plants of Cambridge where he lived, with the [...] (1860) which later expanded to his , essentially the first British Flora. Although his [...] (1682, 1688, 1704) provided a step towards a world Flora as he included more and more plants from his travels, first on the continent and then beyond. He extended Caesalpino's natural system with a more precise definition of the higher classification levels, deriving many modern families in the process, and asserted that all parts of plants were important in classification. He recognised that variation arises from both internal (genotypic) and external environmental (phenotypic) causes and that only the former was of taxonomic significance. He was also among the first experimental physiologists. The [...] can be regarded as the first botanical synthesis and textbook for modern botany. According to botanical historian Alan Morton, Ray [...] "influenced both the theory and the practice of botany more decisively than any other single person {{in the latter half of}} the seventeenth century". Ray's family system was later extended by Pierre Magnol (1638–1715) and Joseph de Tournefort (1656–1708), a student of Magnol, achieved notoriety for his botanical expeditions, his emphasis on floral characters in classification, and for reviving the idea of the genus as the basic unit of classification.|$|E
