2500|$|Cyril Falls, the 36th (Ulster) Division historian, {{wrote in}} 1922 that at {{conferences}} and in questionnaires {{there was some}} criticism of H-Hour being a few minutes too early and that the creeping barrage had moved too quickly but that the troops had kept up, which contributed {{to the success of}} the attack. The mine explosions had guaranteed the capture of the front system up to the red line and had thoroughly demoralised the Germans further back; the tanks had been useful and had prevented some casualties but were not essential {{to the success of the}} attack. All regimental officers praised the rear-area services for their prompt arrival on the ridge with <b>supplies,</b> <b>stores</b> and equipment. The infantry judged the new platoon structure introduced in February 1917 with SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, to have turned platoons into [...] "...a little self-sufficing force, an army in miniature....", some of which had been led with great tactical skill.|$|E
60|$|As I have said, {{until this}} {{unexpected}} {{state of affairs}} happened, Mobile had been looked upon as the objective point of Sherman's army. It had been a favorite move of mine from 1862, when I first suggested to the then commander-in-chief that the troops in Louisiana, instead of frittering away {{their time in the}} trans-Mississippi, should move against Mobile. I recommended this from time to time until I came into command of the army, the last of March 1864. Having the power in my own hands, I now ordered the concentration of <b>supplies,</b> <b>stores</b> and troops, in the department of the Gulf about New Orleans, with a view to a move against Mobile, in support of, and in conjunction with, the other armies operating in the field. Before I came into command, these troops had been scattered over the trans-Mississippi department {{in such a way that}} they could not be, or were not, gotten back in time to take any part in the original movement; hence the consideration, which had caused Mobile to be selected as the objective point for Sherman's army to find his next base of supplies after having cut loose from Atlanta, no longer existed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study to}} develop and implement Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for inventory management system in a <b>supply</b> <b>store</b> unit. Firstly, data was collected to identify the existing inventory management problems in the <b>supply</b> <b>store</b> management, and then followed by defining requirements of the system which suggested the use of RFID technology to fulfill these requirements. The development process included the utilization of specific hard-ware and self developed software programmed for usage in the <b>supply</b> <b>store</b> management. The system was tested in order to evaluate its efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, security and cost justification. It was found that the newly developed system had successfully managed to capture inventory data, track the borrower ID, keep the record updated and able to display the history of borrowed items, and also the fine imposed due to late return. The system also generated reports for inventory management and audit works in the <b>supply</b> <b>store...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Holland Lop rabbit {{should be}} fed daily with good quality pellets, fresh vegetables, and {{unlimited}} grass or timothy hay, {{as well as}} fresh water. Pellets should be fed one ounce per pound of body weight. Rabbits enjoy {{many different types of}} fresh vegetables, such as romaine lettuce, endives, parsley, coriander, dill, fennel and arugula, as well as carrots. Fresh leafy vegetables should be fed at a rate of at least 1 packed cup per 2 pounds of body a day. Leafy greens high in oxalic acid, such as parsley and spinach, should not be fed every day. Non-leafy vegetables such as carrots or peppers should be fed in much smaller quantities, about 1 tablespoon per 2 pound of body weight per day. Alfalfa hay or alfalfa based pellets should only be fed to juvenile rabbits under 1 year. Treats from pet <b>supplies</b> <b>stores</b> are often not particularly safe for rabbits to ingest. They often are high in sugar or fat, or contain foods that rabbits cannot digest.|$|E
