5|$|In 1958, the Comos {{celebrated their}} silver wedding anniversary {{with a family}} trip to Italy. On the {{itinerary}} was an audience with Pope Pius XII. Como, who sat in a <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> of the Long Island church where he attended Sunday Mass {{in an effort to}} avoid attracting attention, was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world. A thorough check of both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.|$|E
25|$|It is an {{exceptional}} {{house with a}} very narrow body, a <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> with entrance on the it. Most interesting are the arrangement of loggias, pinnacles, narrow and tall windows with small gargoyles to drain the water.|$|E
25|$|The Delta 9 as {{described}} in Flight was expected to carry 36 passengers in two <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> cabins for a gross weight of 38,000lb on three 1,000hp engines. The cabins were expected {{to have at least}} a 6-foot headroom but lacked side windows.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was expanded with small <b>side</b> <b>wings</b> in 1935 and expanded much further in 1966 with larger <b>side</b> <b>wings</b> that doubled the building's size, but the central block remains prominent.|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s, the {{original}} building was extended with {{east and west}} wings designed by Joseph Morris. In the 1880s, a new chapel {{was added to the}} rear of the main block, together with long <b>side</b> <b>wings.</b> Both chapel and <b>side</b> <b>wings</b> were also designed by Morris.|$|R
50|$|The {{central section}} of the {{building}} contains the court room. It is {{one and a half}} storeys high, whilst the two <b>side</b> <b>wings</b> are single storeyed. Internally, the court room is centrally located, with rooms for support staff in the <b>side</b> <b>wings.</b> These include rooms for the judge, jury, clerks, registrars and, at the rear, toilets.|$|R
25|$|One notable {{building}} was the wooden Pogodinskaya Cottage (1856, architect Nikolay Nikitin), owned by historian Mikhail Pogodin, once {{the center of}} Moscow literary elite. Extant building is actually a <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> of a larger wooden estate. In 1882-1886, Tsaritsynskaya street acquired a two-story Archive Building, now the exhibition hall of Central Archive of Ancient Acts.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} {{is the original}} part of the airport. It houses check-in for Terminals A and B. Terminal A features check-in counters A01–A18, with the largest user being Ryanair alongside several other airlines like Aeroflot. Terminal B, located in a <b>side</b> <b>wing,</b> was originally reserved for transit passengers to and from West Berlin who took advantage of cheaper air fares and package tours arranged by an East German travel agency. Nowadays, it is used exclusively by EasyJet with check-in counters B20–B29 and has been refurbished in recent years. The airside consists of three jet bridges {{as well as several}} walk-boarding aircraft stands located at Pier 3a, an extension that was opened in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{aircraft}} overran {{the end of}} the runway, {{went over}} the edge of a hill, and became airborne for [...] It then struck the ground again, shearing off the main landing gear and displacing the nosewheel rearward. The Boeing 707 slid down an embankment and came to rest [...] from {{the end of the}} runway. The fuselage ruptured, and the structure of one wing failed during the crash. The right <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> of the plane caught fire as it left the runway. All 29 passengers and 7 crew members escaped the aircraft, with two passengers requiring hospitalization. [...] One of the hospitalized passengers died as a result of their injuries four days after the accident. The 707 was damaged beyond repair and regarded as a complete write off after the fire damaged right wing and broken fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|Terminal B (also called [...] "Nebel-Hall" [...] after German spaceflight pioneer Rudolf Nebel) is a {{converted}} former waiting {{area in a}} <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> of the main building and features check-in counters B20–B39. There is only one bus-boarding aircraft stand directly serving it.|$|E
2500|$|The rectory, {{no longer}} extant, {{was also a}} frame {{structure}} with brick veneer that was covered with permastone. [...] Designed in a vernacular style, it was a two-story, three bay front-gable house with a two-story <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> and further additions. [...] A portion {{of one of those}} additions that included the garages remains behind the Gathering Center.|$|E
2500|$|Another, albeit {{less common}} offense, is the [...] "motion c", {{sometimes}} nicknamed [...] "washing machine offence", {{in which two}} [...] "weak-side" [...] (to {{the right of the}} goal for right-handed players) perimeter players set up as a wing and a flat. [...] The remaining four players swim in square pattern in which a player swims from the point to the hole and then out to the strong <b>side</b> <b>wing.</b> The wing moves to the flat and the flat to the point. The weak <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> and flat then control the tempo of play and try to make passes into the player driving towards the centre forward who can then either shoot or pass. This form of offence is used when no dominate hole set is available, or the hole defence is too strong. It is also seen much more often in women's water polo where teams may lack a player of sufficient size or strength to set up in the centre forward. The best advantage to this system is it makes man-coverage much more difficult for the defender and allows the offence to control the game tempo better once the players are [...] "set up". The main drawback is this constant motion can be very tiring as well as somewhat predictable as to where the next pass is going to go.|$|E
50|$|The side {{elevations}} have regularly spaced, tall multi-paned sash {{windows with}} expressed architraves and sills. The rear elevation has a central recessed verandah with tiled skillion awning flanked by projecting <b>side</b> <b>wings.</b> The <b>side</b> <b>wings</b> have two tall multi-paned sash windows with expressed architraves and sills, the verandah is enclosed with aluminium framed glazing, and high level glazing is located above the awning.|$|R

2500|$|During World War I, {{caring for}} {{children}} was increasingly difficult for women, many of whom could not support themselves, and whose husbands had died or were fighting in the war. Many women {{had to give up}} their children to children's homes infamous for abuse and neglect. These children's homes were unofficially dubbed as [...] "angel factories". After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks shut down an infamous angel factory known as the 'Nikolaev Institute' situated near the Moika Canal. The Bolsheviks then replaced the Nikolaev Institute with a modern maternity home called the 'Palace for Mothers and Babies'. This maternity home was used by the Bolsheviks as a model for future maternity hospitals. The countess who ran the old Institute was moved to a <b>side</b> <b>wing,</b> however she spread rumours that the Bolsheviks had removed sacred pictures, and that the nurses were promiscuous with sailors. The maternity hospital was burnt down hours before it was scheduled to open, and the countess was suspected of being responsible.|$|E
2500|$|A twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{constructed of}} wood, the Delta 8 looked {{at first sight}} rather like a conventional pod and twin boom machine. [...] It had a central nacelle, almost elliptical in profile, suspended beneath the wing and containing the glazed cabin. [...] This had tandem seats, accessed via a starboard side door. [...] The wings were built around two conventional transverse spars, unusual only in becoming deeper between the outer boundary of the centre section and the inboard limit of the narrow chord outer sections. [...] The latter carried ailerons over the whole of its trailing edges. [...] The longitudinal spars of the [...] "side wings", acting as booms, slipped into slots cut into the transverse wing spars. [...] On each side, three longitudinal and very long chord ribs, plus a stiffening diagonal rib that ran to the rear end of the <b>side</b> <b>wing,</b> formed the aerofoil section of these wings. [...] The transverse section of the side wings was also aerofoil shaped, blunt on the inner edge and fine outboard.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{front-wheel drive}} W-body Grand Prix coupes {{were built in}} October 1987, and {{released}} on January 12, 1988 for the 1988 model year. This generation Grand Prix was built in Kansas City, Kansas. The Grand Prix was introduced as base, LE and SE coupes. All featured GM's MPFI 2.8 L V6 that made [...] and [...] of torque. A five-speed manual or four-speed automatic were the transmissions offered. The LE was well equipped with power windows and door locks and digital dashboard with analogue tachometer. SE models upgraded with power front seats with multiple lumbar, side bolster, <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> adjustments, an AM/FM Cassette stereo, and a trip computer and compass located {{in the center of}} the dash. Some models of this generation have the rare feature of a split front bench seat with a column shifter. Another unique feature only found on the Grand Prix is the combination lock for the glove box, rather than a key. Grand Prix was Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 1988.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, quite enough," [...] cried Mr. Yates, [...] "with {{only just}} a <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> or two run up, doors in flat, and {{three or four}} scenes to be let down; nothing more would be {{necessary}} on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more." ...|$|E
60|$|The rooms {{which were}} {{inhabited}} by {{the lady who}} had already taken so marked a position at the court of France were as humble as were her fortunes {{at the time when}} they were allotted to her, but with that rare tact and self-restraint which were the leading features in her remarkable character, she had made no change in her living with the increase of her prosperity, and forbore from provoking envy and jealousy by any display of wealth or of power. In a <b>side</b> <b>wing</b> of the palace, far from the central salons, and only to be reached by long corridors and stairs, were the two or three small chambers upon which the eyes, first of the court, then of France, and finally of the world, were destined to be turned. In such rooms had the destitute widow of the poet Scarron been housed when she had first been brought to court by Madame de Montespan as the governess of the royal children, and in such rooms she still dwelt, now that she had added to her maiden Francoise d'Aubigny the title of Marquise de Maintenon, with the pension and estate which the king's favour had awarded her. Here it was that every day the king would lounge, finding in the conversation of a clever and virtuous woman a charm and a pleasure which none of the professed wits of his sparkling court had ever been able to give to him, and here, too, the more sagacious of the courtiers were beginning to understand, was the point, formerly {{to be found in the}} magnificent salons of De Montespan, whence flowed those impulses and tendencies which were so eagerly studied, and so keenly followed up by all who wished to keep the favour of the king. It was a simple creed, that of the court. Were the king pious, then let all turn to their missals and their rosaries. Were he rakish, then who so rakish as his devoted followers? But woe to the man who was rakish when he should be praying, or who pulled a long face when the king wore a laughing one! And thus it was that keen eyes were ever fixed upon him, and upon every influence that came near him, so that the wary courtier, watching the first subtle signs of a coming change, might so order his conduct as to seem to lead rather than to follow.|$|E

25|$|The dacha {{was built}} in 1783-84 to a design by Giacomo Quarenghi. It's a central three-storey {{building}} with round turrets in the corners, joined with arched galleries to two symmetrical <b>side</b> <b>wings.</b> In {{the first half of}} the 19th century the <b>side</b> <b>wings</b> were linked by a chain railing held in the mouths of twenty-nine cast-iron lions. There used to be a large landscape park with pavilions.|$|R
