50|$|There are {{two forms}} of oocyst: <b>sporulated</b> or late oocyst, and unsporulated or early oocyst. An {{infected}} host releases oocysts into the environment in their unsporulated form. These contain a multi-layered cell wall making them highly resistant to environmental pressures. Once released, the unsporulated oocysts undergo meiosis upon contact with oxygen and moisture. This process is known as sporulation and the oocysts take approximately 2 to 7 days to become infectious. The <b>sporulated</b> oocyst {{is said to be}} tetrasporic meaning it contains four sporocysts, while each sporocyst is dizoic, i.e. it contains two sporozoites.|$|E
50|$|The rabbits ingest <b>sporulated</b> oocysts. <b>Sporulated</b> oocysts contain sporozoites that {{hatch and}} travel via the {{hepatic portal vein}} to the liver, and {{eventually}} penetrate the bile duct epithelium, where they undergo asexual reproduction known as schizogony. Rupture of the schizont consequently causes epithelial cell rupture and death. Merozoites will penetrate other cells and create more merozoites for one to several rounds. Eventually, a merozoite becomes a male microgamecyte and asexually reproduces in epithelial cells. A ruptured microgamecyte infects a cell with the female macrogamecyte and through sexual reproduction create a zygote. The zygote develops a protective shell before expulsion in the bile excreation and then the feces as an oocyst.|$|E

Neither freezing nor Triton X- 100 treatment of vegetative cells produced a detectable effect on their [14 C]benzylpenicillin-binding capacity.

50|$|For a dog {{to become}} infected, the dog has to have {{ingested}} oocysts {{that can be found}} in fecal material or another host animal. When a dog is infected, the parasite {{can be found in the}} small intestinal epithelium which are the cells that line the cavity of the small intestine. It can also be found in tissues such as spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes (located in the walls of the intestines). <b>Sporulated</b> oocyst then releases 8 sporozoites. These sporozoites attack the intestinal epithelial cells where they develop into a schizont. Schizonts are part of the asexual stages where there are three generations of schizonts. After the last part of the multiplication process, gametes are formed. Gametes are part of the sexual stages, and they can invade other cells. Male gametes divide and break out to the host cell, then go invade cells containing the female gamete. Once the male gametes and the female gamete are in the same host cell, they will fuse creating a zygote. The zygote develops into an oocyst. The oocyst then breaks out of the host cell and leaves the host through its feces. The oocyst are noninfectious in the feces but will sporulate in 4 days becoming infectious for the next host and for the cycle to begin again.The clinical signs associated with Cystoisospora canis are severe when the oocysts ingested are <b>sporulated</b> instead of being ingested unsporulated.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic genetic array {{analysis}} is generally conducted using colony arrays on petriplates at standard densities (96, 384, 768, 1536). To perform a SGA analysis in S.cerevisae, the query gene deletion is crossed systematically with a deletion mutant array (DMA) containing every viable knockout ORF of the yeast genome (currently 4786 strains). [...] The resulting diploids are then <b>sporulated</b> by transferring to a media containing reduced nitrogen. The haploid progeny are then put {{through a series}} of selection platings and incubations to select for double mutants.

50|$|Research {{conducted}} by Growell India reveals that coccidiosis burdens the livestock industry with $3 {{billion in annual}} expenses due to impaired growth rates, disease, infertility, and morbidity. Subclinical coccidiosis is often undetected by farmers, though it causes havoc on animal health and productivity. Coccidiosis is caused by Eimeria. Its life cylce completes in a week. Active “oocysts” are {{picked up by the}} bird (or other livestock) and swallowed. An “oocyst” is a capsule with a thick wall protecting the parasites. They “sporulate” and then become infective. The disease-causing oocyst is a hard and persistent structure resistant to chemical damage and degradation. They remain after treatment with diluted sodium hypochlorite or sulfuric acid. An unsporulated oocyst can survive up to seven months in fecal tissue, and a <b>sporulated</b> oocyst 2 years in an exogenous environment.|$|E
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiosis and spore {{formation}} {{as well as}} mating {{are controlled}} by mating-type genes. Diploids heterozygous for mating type (aα) can <b>sporulate</b> but cannot mate; homozygous aa and αα diploids can mate, but cannot <b>sporulate.</b> From an αα diploid parental strain, we have isolated mutants which have gained the ability to <b>sporulate.</b> Those mutants which continue to mate as αα cells have been designated CSP (control of sporulation). Upon sporulation, CSP mutants yield asci containing 4 α spores. The mutant gene which allows αα cells to <b>sporulate</b> is unlinked to the mating-type locus and also acts to permit sporulation in aa diploid cells. Segregation data from crosses between mutant αα and wild-type aa diploids and vice versa indicate (for all but one mutant) that the mutation which allows constitutive sporulation (CSP) is dominant over the wild-type allele. Some of the CSP mutants are temperature-sensitive, <b>sporulating</b> at 32 °, but not at 23 °. In addition to CSP mutants, our mutagenesis and screening procedure led to the isolation of mutants which <b>sporulate</b> by virtue {{of a change in}} the mating-type locus itself, resulting in loss of ability to mate...|$|R

If the given concentration of EB is added after the early part of stage 1, sporogenesis is unaffected. The synthesis of the serine protease and antibiotic, which are believed to be associated with sporulation events during the early part of stage 0, are not inhibited by EB.

50|$|The oocyst {{is about}} egg-shaped {{and has a}} smooth, single-layered wall about 1 μm thick.

Near one end, there is one a light, rounded nuclear region. Unlike most rodent-infecting Isospora species, I. hammondi lacks both an oocyst residuum and Stieda bodies. Most other species that also lack both of these structures have a differently shaped oocyst.

5000|$|The first {{published}} report of Cyclospora cayetanensis in humans {{appears to be}} by Ashford (1979), who found unidentified Isospora-like coccidia in the feces of three individuals in Papua, New Guinea. The photomicrographs in the paper reveal an organism morphologically identical to that we see now. Later, Narango et al. (1989) reported {{what may be the}} same organism from several Peruvians with chronic diarrhea and termed the organism Cryptosporidium muris-like. Other investigators thought the unsporulated oocysts appeared more similar to cyanobacteria, and the name [...] "cyanobacterium-like body" [...] or CLB became prevalent in the literature (occasionally, authors also used the term [...] "coccidian-like body", or CLB). Eventually, Ortega et al. (1992) published an abstract reporting that they had <b>sporulated</b> and excysted the oocysts, resulting in placement of the parasite in the genus Cyclospora. They also created the name Cyclospora cayetanensis at this time. However, since no morphologic information was presented in the abstract, C. cayetanensis technically became a nomen nudum (a named species without a description). Although Ortega et al. (1993) later published additional details about this coccidian, it wasn't until 1994 that a complete morphologic description was published to validate the name (Ortega et al., 1994). Thus, the correct name for this parasite is Cyclospora cayetanensis Ortega, Gilman, & Sterling, 1994, and the etymology of the nomen triviale is derived from Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, Peru. During this 2-year period when C. cayetanensis was a nomen nudum, anyone wishing to publish a complete morphologic description and change the name would have been free to do so.|$|E

These same protoxins varied in toxicity against T. ni by at least 16 -fold, with the cryIA(c) protein being the most toxic.

Comparing the toxicities of individual protoxins with that of <b>sporulated</b> cultures demonstrates that no individual protoxin was as toxic to S. exigua as the <b>sporulated</b> cultures.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the 100 -kDa mosquitocidal toxin (Mtx) during vegetative growth and sporulation in nine different mosquito-larvicidal strains of Bacillus sphaericus has been analyzed.

Strains in four out of the six DNA homology groups of B. sphaericus produced intracellular and extracellular proteases, which degraded the 100 -kDa toxin, during sporulation.
