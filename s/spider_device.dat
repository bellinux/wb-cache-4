40|$|Objectives : Simultaneous {{bilateral}} {{carotid artery}} stenting (SBCAS) is a challenging procedure, and selection criteria {{play an important}} role in determining the final outcome. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the SBCAS in a series of 9 patients with significant bilateral carotid artery disease (> 50 % on the symptomatic side and > 60 % on the asymptomatic side). Materials and Methods: The present study is a retrospective study of 9 patients from January 2005 to December 2012 in a tertiary care center. There were 8 males and 1 female in the age range 50 to 75 years and an average mean age of 63 years. Inclusion criteria of the present study were patients with bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis > 50 % (50 - 99 %) in the symptomatic side and > 60 % in the asymptomatic side as seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). SBCAS with use of distal protection device (<b>Spider</b> <b>device,</b> ev 3), to prevent intra-procedural embolic migration, was done in all the patients. Results: Technical success was achieved in all patients (100 %). Post-procedural events in the form of hypotension and bradycardia occurred in 3 patients after the placement of stent on both the sides, in 2 patients after the placement of the first stent, and in 1 patient after the placement of the second stent. We did not encounter any cases of hyperperfusion, which was a concern in these patients. There were no deaths, major or minor strokes, or myocardial infarction either in the post-procedural period (up to 1 month) or on clinical follow-up 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Conclusion: SBCAS was an effective and safe alternative treatment method in a select group of patients with bilateral carotid artery disease. It can be considered as a feasible treatment option with acceptable risks...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{approach}} to the problem is to combine real-time derived information, component analysis, manual data and UAProfiles {{to deal with the}} actual device itself rather than the idealised representation of [...] "offline" [...] approaches such as UAProf or WURFL. This approach allows detection of devices modified by the user, Windows Mobile <b>devices,</b> Legacy <b>devices,</b> <b>Spiders</b> and Bots, and is evidenced in at least one commercially available system.|$|R
5000|$|REX 2.0 Robotic Spider - [...] "REX 2.0" [...] is {{a remote}} {{controlled}} surveillance device {{that resembles a}} robotic <b>spider.</b> The <b>device</b> is named after Jinn's pet spider, Rex, but Jinn was {{quick to point out}} that spiders have 8 legs, not four, so technically it does not qualify as a spider. REX 2.0 was created by Robert as a way to gather information the course of investigations, when surveillance in person can't be accomplished. REX 2.0 is guided by remote control in the form of a rewired video game system controller which controls its movements. Using special goggles, the user can see the environment that REX 2.0 is scrambling over via a small web camera installed in its central shell. In the case of [...] "A Friend in Need", REX 2.0 was stomped on by Ben Crenshaw's father, a suspect in an investigation by Raymond. REX 2.0 has not returned to active duty, and is still awaiting repairs by Robert.|$|R

The Italian National Space Plan (PSN) has started up its strategic programme <b>SPIDER</b> (Space Inspection <b>Device</b> for Extravehicular Repairs), which is scheduled in three phases, with the final goal of performing docking and precision repairing in the Space Station environment. SPIDER system is an autonomous integrated space robot, using mature Artificial Intelligence tools and technics for its operational control. The preliminary results of a study on the information architecture of the spacecraft are described...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVariation of {{directional}} emissivity upon emission angle can be deduced theoretically from the complex refractionindex. Nevertheless, theoretical relations are only valid for perfectly smooth surfaces and homogeneous materials. Directional emissivity is generally nearly constant for emission angles lower than 60 {{degrees from the}} normalincidence, but strong variations are expected for angles higher than 60 degrees either for dielectric materials or forconducting ones. Many experimental devices were developed to determine {{directional emissivity}} of materials. Generally, these devices are quite complex and fail in measuring directional emissivity for angles greater than 80 degrees. Thus, it is still difficult to point out deviations between theoretical and experimental values for highemission angles. Current work concerns {{the development of a}} <b>device</b> (<b>SPIDER</b> Instrument) allowing to determinedirectional emissivity of dielectric or conducting materials. The rear face of the sample is heated periodically. Temperature variations are recorded using a thermocouple. Sample surface temperature variations are recordedusing an infrared camera. By comparing at several frequencies and emission angles, the temperature amplitudesrecorded, it is possible to determine relative variations of directional emissivity. If directional emissivity is known ata given emission angle, then directional emissivity can be calculated at any emission angl...|$|R
40|$|Scent Whisper’ is a {{wireless}} jewellery set of two brooches {{inspired by the}} comic hero Spiderman. It can be worn by two people each wearing a brooch: a spider and a beetle. It works by the first user whispering a secret into the spider’s abdomen which has a humidity sensor embedded in a brooch. A message is ‘scent by {{a wireless}} web’ to a the second user wearing a wireless bombardier beetle brooch. The beetle brooch retaliates by spraying a scent (or poison) to a lover (or enemy) dependent upon the response from the humidity sensor embedded in the <b>spider.</b> This jewellery <b>device</b> is able to dispense airborne nano-litre sized droplets of fragrance using lab-on-a-chip technology that allows efficient scent delivery. About exhibition: The exhibition was a homage to the inspirational power of bugs and insects, taking in craft, design, fashion and film on the way. It featured a range of objects from John Dilnot’s insect prints and Micromagic System’s Hexapod robots to Stephen Webster’s gold and sapphire bug jewellery and Georgina Griffiths yellow and black glass take on a wasp. There was also a good selection of work by contemporary artists: Mark Wallinger and Cornelia Parker (part of the Byam Shaw School of Art’s Bugs Portfolio project) – {{as well as some}} historical items including a pair of Turkish slippers embroidered with metal thread and shiny beetle wings...|$|R

The dress demonstrates a new way to deliver fragrances for health, wellbeing and stress-reduction. It mimics the human body, in particular the circulation and nervous system, senses and scent glands. The dress interacts with human emotions whereby the aroma dimension is an integral part of the wearer’s sensory experience. It is made from two layers of while organza silk with medical tubes in-between, containing coloured liquid that demonstrate a selection of different fragrances embedded within the garment. The fragrances are diffused depending on the different moods and emotions of the user. The tubes represent an “aroma rainbow”, so that the fabric gives the impression it is creating an olfactory experience. The fundamental advantage is the use of body sensors to determine ‘colour therapeutic’ scent release when a person is stressed, with the ability to shield a ‘Scentient Being’ (the user) from a negative mood they should be protected from. The benefits are for everyone, as recent research shows that fragrance has a positive effect on brain activity to improve mental and physical health. The dress therefore enhances mental and physical well-being, whilst acting as a medium for communicating thoughts or emotions through smell, our most ancient and primitive sense...|$|R
