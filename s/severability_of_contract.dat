40|$|Established {{doctrine}} on the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> unconstitutional {{statutory provisions}} has drawn criticism {{on almost every}} conceivable basis. Commentators have condemned severability doctrine as too malleable and as too rigid; as encouraging judicial overreaching and as encouraging judicial abdication. They have criticized the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on legislative intent and its disregard of legislative intent; its excessive attention to political concerns and its inattention to political concerns; its lack of any coherent explanation. The reasons for this lingering controversy are easy to discern. One is purely pragmatic. 2 ̆ 2 We live {{in an age of}} statutes. 2 ̆ 2 Legislation provides our primary source of law in the late twentieth century, and legislation of a certain type: lengthy, reticulated statutes comprising several titles addressing numerous, sometimes unrelated, subjects. Questions <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> inhere in such legislation. A more profound explanation lies in severability doctrine itself. Since the mid-nineteenth century, when they began to address the question seriously, courts have analyzed the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions under a contracts approach. That is, in determining the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> unconstitutional statutory provisions, courts have applied essentially the same test they employ to determine the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> illegal <b>contract</b> terms. A statute is viewed for these purposes as a 2 ̆ 2 bargain 2 ̆ 2 among the legislators who enact it; in deciding whether a given statutory provision is severable, a court will look to that provision 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 importance 2 ̆ 2 in that 2 ̆ 2 bargain. 2 ̆ 2 Just as in contracts law, the writing will not necessarily dispose of the question. Because severability turns on the intent of the legislators, a court may examine the statute 2 ̆ 7 s legislative history for indications of what the legislators would have wanted. While it may create a 2 ̆ 2 presumption 2 ̆ 2 in favor <b>of</b> <b>severability,</b> even an express severability clause cannot overcome 2 ̆ 2 strong 2 ̆ 2 indications in the legislative history that the legislators in fact 2 ̆ 2 intended otherwise. 2 ̆ 2 The contracts approach makes less sense with respect to statutes. A statute is not a private ordering that affects only the legislators who enact it. Rather, a statute is a 2 ̆ 2 political document 2 ̆ 2 that binds persons outside the legislative branch. Those persons have only limited access to the statute 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 negotiations. 2 ̆ 2 In order to conform their conduct to the requirements of law, they must rely on the text of the statute itself. Moreover, unlike a contract, a statute does not exist apart from its written text. The statute is the written text: the intent of the legislators has no independent authority. Finally, it is much more difficult to determine the intent of the legislators who pass a statute than it is to determine the intent of the parties to a traditional bipolar contract. In resolving questions about the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions, courts should forgo the contracts approach in favor of a textual approach. Under such an approach, the text of the statute would be dispositive. Where the text addressed severability, either directly or indirectly, a court would enforce the statute 2 ̆ 7 s commands; a court would not, as under the contracts approach, look to legislative history to overcome the plain meaning of statutory language in this regard. Where the statute remained silent on the question, the court would, as a matter of default, sever the unconstitutional provision and enforce the remainder of the statute. Part II of this Article describes the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> illegal <b>contract</b> terms and demonstrates how the focus on the parties 2 ̆ 7 shared intent comports with a proper understanding <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Part III discusses the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions and shows why the contracts approach makes much less sense with respect to statutes. Part IV sets forth a textual approach to the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions. Finally, this Article concludes in Part V with some observations about the utility of further comparative study of contractual and statutory interpretation...|$|R

50|$|The {{issue on}} appeal was whether a {{question}} of federal law {{was involved in the}} Minnesota Supreme Court's decision. Justice Sutherland, writing for a unanimous court, held that whether a federal question existed was irrelevant, because where there is an independent question of state law which is adequate to support the state court's judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. The <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> a contractual clause was an issue of state law, and the invalidity of the arbitration clause had already been determined by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Paramount case. The state court's determination of the non-severability of the unlawful clause was thus adequate to render the contract invalid, and was independent of any question of federal law.|$|R
40|$|When a court holds a {{provision}} of a statute unconstitutional, a question remains regarding {{the validity of}} the remainder of the statute. The court may find that the unconstitutional provision may be severed from the statute and leave the remainder of the statute in effect. Alternatively, the court may hold that the unconstitutional provision cannot be severed and invalidate the entire statute. This article argues that the jurisprudence surrounding the issue <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> is confusing and inconsistent. After explaining the concept <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> and its ramifications for statutes, I trace the development of the current judicial test for determining when a statute should be found severable. I then discuss the effect <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> clauses - statutory provisions directing courts to leave the remainder of the statute in effect in the event {{a provision}} is found unconstitutional, concluding that such clauses do not necessarily cause a court to reach a particular result. Next, I examine the question of legislative intent in the context <b>of</b> <b>severability,</b> concluding that courts have departed from established methods of determining legislative intent, opting instead to attempt to answer the hypothetical question whether the legislature would have chosen to enact the remaining parts of the statute without the unconstitutional provision. Because the current jurisprudence <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> is unsettled, this article asserts that courts should follow several general principles regarding severability. First, courts should apply a plain meaning rule to severability clauses, so that a statute containing such a clause will automatically be considered severable. Second, when a statute does not contain a severability clause, the courts should look to the history, purpose, and structure of the statute to ascertain legislative intent. Finally, to assist in this inquiry, I advocate the creation of a legislatively-enacted clear statement rule requiring that courts consider a statute severable when a statute is silent on the issue <b>of</b> <b>severability...</b>|$|R

50|$|As to the {{question}} <b>of</b> the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> the provisions inconsistent with the Constitution from the remaining provisions of sections 65A to 65M, Kriegler J held (Chaskalson P, Mahomed DP, Ackermann J, Didcott J, Kentridge AJ, Langa J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, O'Regan J and Sachs J concurring) {{that it was impossible}} to excise only those provisions which failed to distinguish between the two categories of debtors. The reason was that, in order to achieve this, the court would have to engage in the details of law-making, which was a constitutional activity given to the legislatures. It was, however, possible to sever the provisions which made up the option of imprisonment. In so severing such provisions, the court would nevertheless leave intact the object of the statute: to provide a system to assist in the collection of judgment debts. The removal of one of the options available under the system did not render the system contrary to the purpose of the legislative scheme. The infringing provisions could accordingly be severed, and the balance of the system usefully remain in force.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} in this dissertation investigates the impact of pacta sunt servanda in the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The notion that agreements seriously entered into must be honoured is an age-old principle which has found recognition in South African law. The common law foundational principles <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law are explained {{and the impact of}} the Constitution on these principles is analysed. The Constitution is the highest law in the land and all law, including the common law, must conform to it. The cornerstones of the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> are good faith, freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and privity <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The competing common law foundational values are discussed with particular emphasis on the principles <b>of</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The notion <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is a constitutionally recognised principle which is associated with party autonomy and denotes minimal state interference. Pacta sunt servanda states that obligations created in terms of an agreement must be honoured; therefore parties who enter into contractual agreements with the relevant intention are obliged to respect the agreement. There are many dimensions to a contract which affect its meaning as a legal instrument, apart from the legal dimension there is also a structural dimension <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> With regards to the structural dimension, the interpretation and the drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is relevant because this is the process by which the agreement between the parties is codified and interpreted. In order for the principle of pacta sunt servanda to operate successfully in contractual agreements, the written contract must clearly indicate the intention of the parties. In this research both interpretation and drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> will be examined to identify their impact on the principle of pacta sunt servanda. Pacta sunt servanda influences the interpretation and drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and must therefore always be considered when executing contractual agreements.

40|$|Within our commercialised market society, {{contractual}} relationships are objectified and valued in monetary terms. This {{raises the question}} of the transferability <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> implies a substitution of one the existing contractual parties. It intends the transfer of the entire contractual position of the transferor to a third party, as a result of which the latter would fully replace the transferor, who is completely discharged from the contractual relationship. An important advantage is that the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> upholds the identity of the contractual relationship and thus maintains that relationship with all its securities and defences. The term <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and any prescription which has commenced, will continue to run and the contract will in principle be governed by the law as applied {{at the time of its}} conclusion. In Belgian and French law a general theory <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is lacking. Not only the possibility of a full substitution of a contractual party, but also the requirements for the conclusion of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and its consequences are highly debated. Moreover, the distinction between a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and a transfer of contractual rights/debts is unclear. The research therefore envisages to develop a general legal regime for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> ut singuli. The first part of the research is a conceptual analysis of the possibility of a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> It focuses on the concept of contractual relationship/contractual position as distinct from the concept of contractual right or contractual debt/ obligation. Subsequently, the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is considered as a (subjective) modification of the contractual relationship.
