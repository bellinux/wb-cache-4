40|$|Although {{concrete-filled}} tubular columns {{are becoming}} popular in multi-storey building frames, {{connections between the}} columns and beams using normal blind bolts are limited {{in the level of}} moment-carrying capacity and stiffness they can achieve. This is because of the extensive localised yielding of the thin tube wall caused by the blind bolts bearing {{on the inside of the}} tube wall. This paper reports the results of an innovative modified version of blind bolt that aims to develop economical semi-rigid to rigid connections that are simple to construct. It uses a high tensile threaded rod cut to the required length with two special nuts, one acting as a bearing head on the inner tube wall in association with ONESIDE <b>split</b> <b>washer</b> and the other as an anchoring device in the concrete core. The results from full-scale pullout tests on bolts connected to concrete-filled circular and square hollow sections are presented. The objective of this work was to investigate the anchorage performance of the special blind bolts, including failure modes, strength and stiffness. The parameters selected were tube wall thickness, blind bolt diameter, and concrete strength. The results show that the full tensile capacity of the threaded rod can be achieved in the circular columns with higher strength concrete, whereas the performance is compromised in the square column with lower strength of concrete. These test results provide valuable information for developing a novel concept of blind-bolted moment connections to ensure sufficient strength and stiffness when they are used in momentresisting frames in low seismic regions such as Australia...|$|E
40|$|Extract] When {{one of us}} (A. G. B.) {{was rather}} younger than he is today, he {{acquired}} the solemn responsibility for mowing the family lawn with a somewhat battered two-stroke motor mower. Each week, he would wheel it out, prime the carburettor and pull the starter cord. Occasionally it would start, but most weeks it would not. Out came the spanners, screwdrivers and a handy hubcap to keep all the bits, as the motor was stripped down and rebuilt. Finally, it would be repaired and the lawn mowed. But a paradox remained, for every time the mower was stripped down and rebuilt, a few pieces were left over: a <b>split</b> <b>washer,</b> a few screws, a nut or a strangely shaped piece of metal that seemed to fit… nowhere. After some years of this treatment, the question had to be asked: How few pieces can a lawnmower have and still run? The contemporary history of experimental models in immunology has taken something of an opposite path. Once the T-cell receptor (TCR) was cloned {{and the structure of}} the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -encoded ligands determined (and that nasty business with I-J swept under the carpet), there was a general feeling that the vertebrate immune system did not need many parts. It should be possible (it was reasoned) to create an experiment that would demonstrate at what point tolerance was induced and what cell or factor was responsible for its production. And so the three pieces of the machine were assembled: TCR; peptide antigen; and restriction molecule. The critical tool in the assembly was the use of transgenic technology...|$|E
25|$|Metals {{and other}} solid {{materials}} expand upon heating and contract upon cooling. This is an undesirable occurrence in electrical systems. Copper {{has a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} for an electrical conducting material. Aluminium, an alternate common conductor, expands nearly one third more than copper under increasing temperatures. This higher degree of expansion, along with aluminium’s lower ductility, can cause electrical problems when bolted connections are improperly installed. By using proper hardware, such as spring pressure connections and cupped or <b>split</b> <b>washers</b> at the joint, {{it may be possible to}} create aluminium joints that compare in quality to copper joints.|$|R

Collins, 6608 Cahuenga Terrace, Hollywood with bill to Good Packaging, 260 California st. San Francisco; The {{story is that}} Kirkhill started with a simple {{pasteboard}} box for their rubber washers, and progressed to a flossy lithographed tin with a patent cigaret tin opener; 1. The original pasteboard box, as it left the factory, neat and clean, and as it looked after it got battered, a corner <b>split,</b> <b>washers</b> spilling out [...] the two boxes in one photo 'Before' and 'After'; 2. Next came 50 washers on a card, like buttons [...] show how neat it looked when new, and also how it looked {{after a few weeks}} on the dealer's counter, with over half the washers pulled off and sold, and the card dirty, worse for wear; 3. The friction top tin for washers, maybe the different brands, Pignose, Grizzly,etc. One tin open, washers spilled out neatly as if for sale to a customer.; 4. The workman's tool kit, a compartment box, shown open [...] maybe a second box in same picture, with workman slipping it closed in his overalls pocket [...] just the leg, pocket and maybe a hand.; 5. The flossy new tin for Grizzly washers with the patent cigaret opener, shown closed and open.; 6. An assortment of Kirkhill's rubber tank balls in counter packages, wrapped in cellophane, dozen to box, several brands.; These pictures are to furnish about 75 percent of the interest in a packaging story, with text.; I have ordered the packages; Wayne Price" [...] on letter...|$|R
