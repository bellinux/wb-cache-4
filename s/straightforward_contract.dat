40|$|The {{carriage}} {{of goods}} by sea starts off with a contract of carriage, an essentially simple and <b>straightforward</b> <b>contract</b> between two parties, the shipper and the carrier. Very often, however, a bill of lading is issued and a third party appears on the scene: the holder {{of the bill of}} lading. The holder was not involved in the making of the contract of carriage, but does have rights, and possibly obligations, against the carrier at destination. The holder of the bill of lading is entitled to claim delivery and has title to sue the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods, but he can also be liable to pay freight or other costs. The question then is how the third party holder of the bill acquires those rights and obligations. The thesis analyzes the different theories that have been proposed to explain the position of the third party holder. In doing so, a distinction is made between contractual theories and non-contractual theories. The former try to explain the holder's position by building on the initial contract of carriage and applying contract law mechanisms. The latter, although obviously not denying the existence of the contract of carriage, construe the position of the third party holder independently. Within the group of contractual theories, there is a further distinction to be made between those theories that have the holder succeed to all of the shipper's rights and obligations and thus have the holder step into the shoes of the shipper, and the theories that see the holder's position as contractual but independent, and thus not necessarily identical to the position of the shipper. Within the first group (contractual, identical position) agency, assignment and novation are looked at. The second group (contractual, non-identical position) includes the third party beneficiary clause, multi-party contracts and accession, and direct contracts between the carrier and the holder. The third group (statutory) includes the bill of lading as a quasi-contract, statutes explicitly or implicitly dealing with the holder's position, the bill of lading as a negotiable instrument, the bill of lading as a voluntary engagement and the bill of lading as part of the Lex Maritima. Following the analysis and appraisal of the different theories, the case is made that the position of the third party holder of the bill of lading is not obvious or self-evident; the question what the holder's position is needs to be asked and answered. It is further argued that, al-though it is easy to understand why contractual approaches were initially chosen and are still preferred, they are nevertheless not the best possible solution. It is submitted that a statutory approach to the position of the holder of the bill of lading has advantages and would be preferable...|$|E

In contrast to the current <b>straightforward</b> <b>contracts,</b> SLAs can be extended to include more features (e.g., delivery time, reliability, penalty for no delivery).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{solution}} for the hold up problem, when more than two parties are involved. The case we consider is a company selling identical products to two buyers that have a common interest in inducing the seller to make a quality enhancing investment. We show that a trilateral contract may provide the correct incentives to restore optimal efficiency. The contract induces a coalition proof Nash equilibrium and holds under complete as well as incomplete information. The extension to more than two buyers is <b>straightforward.</b> Multilateral <b>Contract,</b> Trilateral Contract, Hold-up Problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{negotiation}} {{of even the}} most <b>straightforward</b> real-world <b>contracts</b> tends to be quite complex. A contract with only 25 distinct issues with two alternatives each presents the parties with more than 33 million possible contracts, far too many to be evaluated exhaustively within feasible time constraints. Furthermore, contract issues that exhibit high levels of interdependence result in highly nonlinear utility functions with the possibility of many local optima. This paper employs hybrid computational models, integrating both simulated annealing and tabu list optimization, to aid in the design of social heuristics and institutional mechanisms that may serve to improve the effectiveness of human negotiators.

40|$|Abstract: Developing economies share both microeconomic and {{macroeconomic}} characteristics {{which are}} often unique relative to their more developed counterparts. Indeed, many authors (e. g. Parente and Prescott 2000) have emphasized the role of institutional frictions within developing nations as {{a major determinant of}} economic growth (or the lack thereof). We examine one type of institutional friction, concerning the observation and reporting of information, and construct a <b>straightforward</b> dynamic <b>contracting</b> model of foreign donor investment in an aid project. We show that even within a simple class of such models, the dynamic contracting problem rapidly becomes computationally intensive, yet remains manageable when high performance. We argue that the natural modeling, simulation and testing environment to both analyze development aid issues and help generate effective aid policy should involve-indeed, rely upon-high performance computational resources. ...|$|R

40|$|This book details nearly 20 {{years of}} {{research}} into the outsourcing phenomenon, and is companion to the earlier Palgrave volume Information Systems and Outsourcing: Studies in Theory and Practice. Using an unparalleled database of over 650 longitudinal case studies the authors document and analyses outsourcing’s rise prominence in the 1990 s, pinpointing trends, practices and lessons. It finds {{that many of the}} so-called ‘strategic alliances’ of this period tended to be <b>straightforward</b> ‘fee-for-service <b>contracts</b> in practice. The book develops critieria for making sourcing decisions, and provides details of the practices that work, and those that do not. The authors then detail developments in the IT, business process and offshore outsourcing service markets from 2000 on. They show that, against a background of growth in global revenues, outsourcing provided real promise on costs and service, new models, but also new challenges to client organizations and suppliers alike. Based on their research work, the authors point to thirteen future global sourcing trends from 2009 - 14. The book documents how organizations have been learning, experientially, and often painfully, how to manage back office outsourcing. But the increased size, importance, complexity of the phenomena, and the risks they engender, suggest that in the next phase, already started in some organizations discussed in the book, research will be into how organizations seek to provide leadership in outsourcing. For the authors, this shift will be a necessary one if governance, control, flexibility and superior business performance are to be outsourcing’s consequences...|$|R
40|$|After {{reviewing}} {{some basic}} self-enforcing labour contracts models, we expose how self-enforcing labour market theory can help explain some important dynamic properties of key macroeconomic variables. Calmès (1999, 2003) detail how self-enforcing labour contracts improve the way macroeconomic models {{account for the}} response of the economy to external shocks. The introduction of a state-dependent outside opportunity for the manager {{is the first step in}} generalizing the theory (Calmès 2007, Thomas and Worrall 2007). In this paper, we discuss the next step, the endogenization of capital. Although desirable, this task is not <b>straightforward</b> as the <b>contract</b> set might no longer be compact in this case. Relatedly, we also discuss the introduction of a third agent (the financial intermediary) in the model. We also analyse the link between stationarity and set convexity when incorporating growth in the model. A stochastic trend may be considered but then the non-convexity issue arises again. The aggregation of heterogeneous individual contracts can also lead to the same problem.

40|$|This paper models {{a supply}} chain of a manufacturer, a {{retailer}} and two different consumer segments. One segment has a high willingness-to-pay {{and the other a}} low willingness-to-pay. The manufacturer decides on the wholesale price and the selling price is determined by the retailer. It is well known that a <b>straightforward</b> wholesale price <b>contract</b> does not coordinate the channel. In this paper we show that two other types of contracts, namely the revenue sharing and the profit sharing mechanisms do coordinate the supply chain and, furthermore, provide win-win for the entire range of parameter values. Our analysis has also established an equivalence relationship between the revenu and the profit sharing mechanisms. It is also shown that the pull discount mechanism (that is: the manufacturer provides a discount directly to the end consumers) coordinates for a greater range of parameter values compared to the wholesale price discount but not for the entire possible range. Moreover, for the situation where the manufacturer designs the targeted push-pull discount (Manufacturer provides a wholesale price discount to the retailer and a pull discounts which can be availed only by the low willingness to pay consumers) it is shown that it is possible for the channel to make a greater profit by extracting surplus from the high willingness-to-pay customers. However, “targeted push-pull” is feasible only with certain restrictions. Interestingly, we found that the revenue sharing or the profit sharing mechanisms with the targeted pull discount is feasible when the “targeted push-pull” fails to coordinate. Even, in this case the performance of the targeted pull discount in combination with the revenue or profit sharing mechanisms is equivalent...|$|R
40|$|Both public {{authorities}} and private companies increasingly outsource {{facilities management services}} to external suppliers. A new service industry with its own culture and contracting practices is developing. This study discusses factors that influence trust and relationship culture in the Swedish FM sector. A multilevel perspective is taken, so that processes on institutional and market levels are discussed in relation to contract principles and management as well as interpersonal relations. The study {{is based on a}} review of FM literature and interviews with leading clients, consultants and service providers. The findings are analysed using general theories on sources of trust and the relationship between trust and contract. A general background on the development of FM is included, and the empirical section outlines views on trends, market structure, contract models, procurement, contract relationships and management, differences between clients, etc. The discussion focuses more specifically on trust issues. It is concluded that while industry level efforts to develop standard contract and create trust in contracting out FM services have been successful, contracting practice is slower to harmonize because of the influx of first time clients. Although there {{does not seem to be}} a <b>straightforward</b> relation between <b>contract</b> design and relationship quality, it was found that detailed service specifications and active monitoring may support both learning and trust since they entail mutual understanding and focused discussions. Less extensive contracts may, paradoxically, result in less innovation because of lower client and supplier engagement. This risk is higher when FM services are perceived as support services compared to when they are seen as strategic service relations. Further, it is concluded that since relational trust develops between client employees and supplier employees who interact closely, services need different kinds of management depending on the interaction patterns they entail. Typically, low level interaction relations such as technical property services may need a focus on fostering trust, while soft services call for formalization and distance...|$|R
