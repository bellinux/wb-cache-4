40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of a gasket’s shape and size on its high-frequency shielding-effectiveness as measured with the <b>stripline</b> <b>test</b> method. Based on full-wave simulations it is shown that the main influencing parameter for the shielding-effectiveness is the gasket’s conductivity. Through a comparison with the reverberation room method, it is shown that differences due to shape and size of the gasket are not related to the stripline set-up, but are a reflection of the true shielding effectiveness of the gasket. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|SRRC is {{currently}} developing a RF kicker for the lon-gitudinal feedback system. The kicker is a pill-box cavity with nine pieces of striplines. The resonant frequency is {{tuned to the}} designing value 1125 MHz by adjusting {{the length of the}} striplines. Excited by a single <b>stripline,</b> cold <b>test</b> results indicate that the full 3 dB bandwidth exceeds 250 MHz and the shunt impedance deduced from bead-pull measurement is about 80 Ω...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{accurate}} {{values for}} insertion loss (S 21) on {{printed circuit boards}} has become ever more critical to SI modeling as signal speeds required for next-generation networking equipment move into the 10 + GHz range. Existing industry-standard insertion loss estimation techniques assume that the copper conductors (PCB traces) are smooth, {{when in fact they}} are not. The error thus induced is less significant at lower speeds, but cannot be ignored at frequencies above a few GHz. Accurate estimation of PCB laminate dissipation factor (Df) is another goal integral to SI modeling. Industry-standard methods again assume the smooth copper case, with consequent frequency-dependent error introduced into extracted values of Df. This paper describes a set of <b>stripline</b> PCB <b>test</b> vehicles used to correlate copper trace surface roughness to insertion loss. The main error...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} and characterized ultrafast and highly sensitive photodetectors based on GaAs nanowhiskers fabricated with an improved top-down etching method. We evaluated the material {{properties of the}} etched nanowhiskers by micro photoluminescence measurements and studied the effect of post annealing on nanowhiskers' luminescence. The nanowhiskers were integrated into the coplanar <b>striplines</b> for device <b>testing</b> using DC and time-resolved electro-optic characterization techniques. Our photodetectors exhibit a very low dark current below 500 pA at 10 V bias {{as well as a}} high responsivity of 0. 19 A/W at 30 V, and a cut-off frequency of 1. 3 THz. These characteristics make the GaAs nanowhisker photodetectors very promising candidates for high-speed optoelectronics and efficient THz emitters. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering, İzmir, 2011 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 49 - 62) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishx, 77 leavesElectrical {{products are}} used {{in every aspect of}} our lives. Every electrically device has the potential of causing unintentional interference to other electrical devices. All unwanted currents or voltages that may arise in a system generate electrical noise. All kinds of unexpected radio-frequency (RF) energy produce this kind of noise. The term Electromagnetic Interference [...] EMI [...] describes the situation that electrical noise destroys the functionality of systems. Therefore, emissions and immunity tests have to be performed according to the harmonized European norms like EN 55020 standard. In this thesis, immunity to radiated fields testing will introduce and the basic requirements of the suggested test site which is a TEM stripline will also be mentioned. Stripline is a transmission line construction which provides a uniform electromagnetic field between its parallel plates. Radiated immunity can be defined as the product's ability to withstand EM energy that arrives via free-space propagation for its functionality. Design of a new TEM <b>stripline</b> for EMC <b>testing</b> is given in order to construct an alternative test site, a new stripline bigger than the one given by the standard was built. Main attention has been focused on the design parameters (characteristic impedance, field uniformity etc.) and calibration of the designed stripline. Defined stripline in the standard has 80 cm height but it is not sufficient for big equipments under test (EUTs). Then an alternative stripline can be used if it fulfills the specifications required by the standard...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the design study of Future Linear Colliders, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) aims for electron-positron collisions with high luminosity at a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 3 TeV. To achieve the luminosity requirements, Pre-Damping Rings (PDRs) and Damping Rings (DRs) are required: they reduce the beam emittance before the beam is accelerated in the main linac. Several injection and extraction systems are needed to inject and extract the beam from the PDRs and DRs. The work of this Thesis consists of the design, fabrication and laboratory tests of the first stripline kicker prototype for beam extraction from the CLIC DRs, although the methodology proposed can be extended to stripline kickers for any low emittance ring. The excellent field homogeneity required, as well as a good transmission of the high voltage pulse through the electrodes, has been achieved by choosing a novel electrode shape. With this new geometry, it has been possible to benefit from all the advantages that the most common shapes introduce separately. Furthermore, a detailed study of the different operating modes of a stripline kicker allowed the beam coupling impedance to be fully characterized at low frequencies. The optimum design of the striplines and their components has been based on studies of impedance matching, field homogeneity, power transmission, beam coupling impedance and manufacturing tolerances. Other studies concerning higher order modes and electrodes heating have been done. The striplines have been manufactured by the spanish company Trinos Vacuum Projects, and laboratory tests without beam have been carried out in order to characterize the <b>striplines.</b> The following <b>tests</b> have been done: power reflection, longitudinal and transverse beam coupling impedance and RF breakdown. Finally, new ideas for further improvement of the performance of future striplines are reported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{stripline}} {{structure is}} closed and therefore protected against surrounding EMI {{and it is}} easy to bury in multiplayer structures, which offer higher circuit density. This thesis focuses on the evaluation (and verification via actual structures) of the correct simulation of striplines and, as a new aspect, the advantages of using a dual-stripline. Multiple design methods and electromagnetic simulation systems were tested and properties of these are compared. For a reliable design it is still necessary to use at least two tools, at first a very fast tool having excellent circuit parameter optimization methods and then some electromagnetic simulator, which can be used to the complete the realizable layout. That is, because all the electromagnetic simulators suffer from the same limiting factors, the memory capacity of the computer and the unacceptable calculation time. It has been discovered through modelling that the "cat-eye" shape having many more and larger local inaccuracies at the thinned edge areas of the sintered conductor in LTCC structures increases the conductor losses. Therefore it is important to develop new manufacturing methods capable of producing better-shaped conductors. A combination of broadside coupled parallel connected <b>striplines</b> has been <b>tested</b> both in High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) and LTCC materials. A two-conductor stripline, a dual stripline, raises the power handling capability of a microwave bandpass HTS filter. In addition, it offers the possibility to use a normal metal protection layer at the surface of the superconductor without degradation of electrical properties, thus increasing the power handling capability even more. The dual stripline solution in LTCC would offer some preferable properties in high power filters only. The shape of the ground plane used for trimming the coupling between resonators was also found to have a remarkable influence on the quality factor of the resonator. A quite narrow ground strip can offer a much better quality factor with the same coupling level than a meshed or continuous ground plane, but it requires accurate design and manufacturing methods. It would help to design filters with lower loss in the passband without compromises in the attenuation outside the passband...|$|R
