The method of construction {{is based on}} Kelvin's investigations into linearized disturbances in an unbounded Couette flow.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} linear {{growth of the}} magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) {{in the short time}} limit using nonmodal methods. Our findings are quite different to standard results, illustrating that <b>shearing</b> <b>wave</b> energy can grow at the maximum MRI rate, -dΩ/d r, for any choice of azimuthal and vertical wavelengths. In addition, by comparing the growth of shearing waves with static structures, we show that over short time-scales shearing waves will always be dynamically more important than static structures in the ideal limit. By demonstrating that fast linear growth is possible at all wavelengths, these results suggest that nonmodal linear physics could play a fundamental role in MRI turbulence.

40|$|We {{consider}} the nonaxisymmetric linear theory of radially-strati¯ed disks. We {{work in a}} shearing-sheet-like approximation, where the vertical structure of the disk is ne-glected, and develop equations {{for the evolution of}} a plane-wave perturbation comoving with the shear °ow (a <b>shearing</b> <b>wave,</b> or "). We calculate a complete solu-tion set for compressive and incompressive short-wavelength perturbations in both the strati¯ed and unstrati¯ed shearing-sheet models. We develop expressions for the late-time asymptotic evolution of an individual shwave {{as well as for the}} expectation value of the energy for an ensemble of shwaves that are initially distributed isotropically in k-space. We ¯nd that: (i) incompressive, short-wavelength perturbations in the unstrat-i¯ed shearing sheet exhibit transient growth and asymptotic decay, but the energy of an ensemble of such shwaves is constant with time (consistent with Afshordi, Mukhopad-hyay, & Narayan 2004); (ii) short-wavelength compressive shwaves grow asymptotically in the unstrati¯ed shearing sheet, as does the energy of an ensemble of such shwaves; (iii) incompressive shwaves in the strati¯ed shearing sheet have density and azimuthal velocity perturbations ±§, ±vy » t¡Ri (for jRij ¿ 1), where Ri ´ N 2 x=(q) 2 is the Richardson number, N 2 x is the square of the radial Brunt-VÄaisÄalÄa frequency and q is the e®ective shear rate; (iv) the energy of an ensemble of incompressive shwaves in the strati¯ed shearing sheet behaves asymptotically as Rit 1 ¡ 4 Ri for jRij ¿ 1.

40|$|AbstractShear wave {{velocity}} measurement is a promising method in evaluation of tissue stiffness. Several {{methods have been}} developed to measure the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity, however, it is difficult to obtain quantitative <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> image in real-time by low cost system.

This {{study is}} aimed at developing a workflow, and ultimately a model, for quantitative interpretation of sonic and seismic data. Measured data collected {{at the point of}} logging can be fraught with errors that can lead to wrong interpretation. One of such data is the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity which in most cases is collected with the compressional wave velocity. The measured <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity log may contain errors that are due to drilling conditions, mud invasion etc. It may also contain cycle skips and might contain a lot of missing data and information. It is because of the poor quality of this type of log that has often made well log analysis companies and log interpreters neglect the measured <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log and subsequently generate or create an estimated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log which they use for interpretation and modelling to check how the amplitudes vary with increasing offsets, among other uses. The workflow presented in this study considers the effect of working with the measured data, a reprocessed <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log and a locally estimated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log. Specific correction procedures for invasion of the logs was done and synthetic seismograms were created for each type after correction for comparison to a 3 D seismic data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that oil based mud invasion can cause significant problems to sonic logs especially the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log. It also suggests that, if a <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log is of low or bad quality, a reprocessed <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log would be better for interpretation and modeling rather than a locally calibrated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log or an estimated <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> log using global predictions.

5000|$|Various {{parameters}} of tissue characterizing its structure and state such as anisotropy, viscosity, and nonlinearity {{can be assessed}} using <b>shear</b> <b>waves.</b> <b>Shear</b> <b>waves</b> are polarized which makes them sensitive to tissue anisotropy, an important structural anatomical characteristic that can have diagnostic value.

The large frequency range of the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> that can be generated in tissue provides potential for using this high bandwidth for tissue viscoelastic properties estimation. The <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> attenuation is high so the waves do not propagate very far.

30|$|Ultrasonic <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> were {{propagated}} {{through the}} breadth {{direction of a}} wood beam which was subjected to a bending load such {{that it was in}} a plane-stress state. The oscillation direction of the <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> with respect to the wood beam axis was varied by rotating an ultrasonic sensor, and the relationship between the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity and the oscillation direction was examined. The results indicate that when the oscillation direction of the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> corresponds to the tangential direction of the wood beam, the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity decreases sharply and the relationship between <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity and rotation angle tends to become discontinuous. When the oscillation of the <b>shear</b> <b>waves</b> occurs in the anisotropic direction of the wood beam instead of in the direction of principal stress, the <b>shear</b> <b>wave</b> velocity exhibits a peak value. In addition, the polarization direction was found to correspond to the direction of anisotropy of the wood beam according to the theory of acoustoelastic birefringence with respect to plane stress.
