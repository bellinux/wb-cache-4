40|$|This study {{established}} {{a method of}} evaluating the color change during the <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> of different varieties of chicory. The RGB system was used for digitizing the color images. Four colored areas, white, red, yellow and brown, were segmented according to the Hierarchical Classification using Projection Pursuit (HICUPP) decision tree. Experiments were conducted with six varieties of chicory. In the experiments, a comprehensive index, Sc, was presented and used for estimating the unfavorable color change (turning to brown and red). The index is based on comprehensive consideration of the colored area and degree of the color change. The translation among the segmented color areas has been discussed, {{to explain why the}} rgb values decrease during the <b>shelf</b> <b>storage.</b> The effects of red and brown separately on the color change as well as changing temperature on Sc are discussed. Finally, the effect of different varieties on the yellow leaf growth and the effect of a commercial cut on Sc have been analyzed. The results indicate that two commercial varieties, Focus and Sigma, and a test variety, Pax, have better characteristics for the red and brown colors of the core. The results also show that the segmented areas translate with time. In the first 4 days the red area increases more rapidly than the brown; while from the fourth day on the brown increases more prominently. Higher temperatures (T 10 - 18 degreesC) during the first 2 days of <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> lead to more serious red and brown coloring compared with the lower temperatures (T 2 - 5 degreesC) for both Sigma and Focus. The lower the humidity, the slower the color change is. The recommended humidity range for <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> is between 50 and 65 %RH. The higher temperature also leads to stronger leaf-growth; the effect of humidity on the leaf-growth is small. Changing temperatures during storage often lead to a serious red and brown coloring. So avoiding to change temperature during <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> is reasonable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Smoothies are blended {{beverages}} {{that could}} contain fruit pulp, fruit juice, vegetables, yoghurt, milk, or honey.

Accordingly, different physicochemical parameters, bioactive compounds, as well as the antioxidant activity, were assessed in commercial smoothies along different <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> periods. ANOVA, HCA and LDA statistical tools were used to allow a suitable comprehension of the obtained results. Some significant differences were found at initial time, which might be associated to smoothies’ composition.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the warehouse strategy and availability, the cycle times of the <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval machines is a factor influencing the throughput of a high-bay warehouse. However, driving storage and retrieval machines can cause substantial mast vibration. This can have an adverse effect on stress, the positioning operation and warehouse cycle times. To increase capacity and reduce dynamic stress, it is therefore important {{to be able to}} drive storage and retrieval machines {{in such a way that}} unwanted vibrations can either be avoided or corrected. The studies relating to the travel drive control are based on the elastokinetic model of the two-mass oscillator. The dual-mass model simulates the vibration behaviour of the <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval machine very closely and is ideal for examining the coefficient of oscillation which characterizes vibration. In {{addition to}} the initial mast vibration conditions, the given acceleration characteristic and the control unit used are the only other factors which can influence the coefficient of oscillation to be minimized. The results of a parameter study show that the current state-of-the-art cascade control is incapable of damping mast vibration. However, tests have shown that vibration behaviour can be improved considerably by using state control and fuzzy control. These active vibration damping measures make it possible to position the <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval machine and simultaneously control vibration. Vibrations induced by changing rates of acceleration while the <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval machine is traveling are correct immediately, thereby reducing dynamic stress. A comparison of the controls discussed shows that the state control best meets the existing requirements by virtue of its closed-loop control dynamics. (orig.)

40|$|After the rollout of Space Shuttle Discovery in April 2005 in {{preparation}} for return-to-flight, there was {{a failure of the}} Orbiter (OV- 103) helium signature leak test in the gaseous hydrogen (GH 2) system. Leakage was attributed to the Flow Control Valve (FCV) in Main Engine 3. The FCV determined to be the source of the leak for OV- 103 is designated as LV- 58. The nitrile/Buna N rubber O-ring seal was removed from LV- 58, and failure analysis indicated radial cracks providing leak paths in one quadrant. Cracks were eventually found in 6 of 9 FCV O-rings among the three Shuttle Orbiters, though none were as severe as those for LV- 58, OV- 103. Testing by EM 10 at MSFC on all 9 FCV O- rings included: laser dimensional, Shore A hardness and properties from a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and an Instron tensile machine. The following test data was obtained on the cracked quadrant of the LV- 58, OV- 103 O-ring: (1) the estimated compression set was only 9. 5 %, compared to none {{for the rest of the}} O-ring; (2) Shore A hardness for the O. D. was higher by almost 4 durometer points than for the rest of the O-ring; and (3) DMA data showed that the storage/elastic modulus E was almost 25 % lower than for the rest of the O-ring. Of the 8 FCV O-rings tested on an Instron, 4 yielded tensile strengths that were below the MIL spec requirement of 1350 psi-a likely influence of rubber cracking. Comparisons were made between values of modulus determined by DNA (elastic) and Instron (Young s). Each nitrile/Buna N O-ring used in the FCV conforms to the MIL-P- 25732 C specification. A number of such O-rings taken from <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> at MSFC and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) were used to generate a reference curve of DMA glass transition temperature (Tg) vs. <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> time ranging from 8 to 26 years. A similar reference curve of TGA onset temperature (of rubber weight loss) vs. <b>shelf</b> <b>storage</b> time was also generated. The DMA and TGA data for the used FCV O-rings were compared to the reference curves. Correlations were also made between the DMA modulus (at 22 C) and Shore A hardness for all 9 of the FCV O-rings used among the three Shuttle Orbiters. The radial cracking in the FCV O-rings was determined to be due to ozone attack, as nitrile/Buna N rubber is susceptible to such attack. Nitrile/Buna N material under MIL-P 25732 C should be used in a hydraulic fluid environment to help protect it from cracking. However, the FCV O-rings were used in an air only environment. The FCV design has as much as a 9 -mil gap that allows the O. D. of the O-ring to be directly exposed to ozone, pressurized air and some elevated temperatures, accelerating the weathering process that leads to O-ring cracking. Space Shuttle flights will likely not continue past 2010. Therefore, Shuttle management decided to continue using the nitrile/Buna N material for the FCVs, but have each O-ring replaced after 3 years to minimize any chances for crack initiation...|$|E
