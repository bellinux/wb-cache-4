Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
500|$|... "We used mainly analog {{compressors}} on the vocals, sometimes {{very cheap}} or mid-budget stuff, recorded with a Sony G800 tube mic, a Neve 8081 preamp and an LA-2A compressor/limiter. But everything {{is about the}} setting... We experiment a lot with vocal sounds. For example, the pitch-down vocal at the end was initially much longer. The mix of this one was very hard — like almost all tracks — because {{there was so much}} <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on. This is why maybe the final version is so simple." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Cure" [...] {{was written}} after Gaga's {{performance}} at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga worked with longtime collaborator DJ White Shadow (aka Paul Blair) for the track. He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as [...] "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the [...] "terrible <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> {{on in the world}} right now, it's like when you're a creative person you do your best to try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." [...] Gaga and her team wanted to release the [...] "one-off" [...] single as soon as production was completed.|$|E

Of his fashion line, called StarStruk, Spanky explains, “Everything I wear, I’m going to make. It’s just going to be a dope, fun company. Hopefully, I see like a lot of people rocking <b>stuff.</b> So I’m <b>going</b> to keep everything different that way. I don’t know.

500|$|Godrich's {{father died}} {{on the day of}} the {{recording}} of the string sessions for [...] "Burn the Witch". According to Godrich, [...] "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, which {{experienced}} a record 16cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, [...] "A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied {{to so much}} history. This {{is as good as}} it gets. If people aren't watching, that's their problem, because we got some great <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on here." [...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, trying to get the (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for him. And I think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that– he's got that spark, you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|Kreisberg {{described}} the crossover between both shows as [...] "a superhero a-go-go!", saying: [...] "It’s insane {{to have them}} all together." [...] Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: [...] "This [...] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really feels like a 2-hour movie [...] over two nights." [...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash have a pretty big jaw-dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow. Then we do some things with the characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major." ...|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the album}} was {{released}} frontman Travie McCoy stated [...] "It's just gonna be a real, real solid record. The demos we have now are just bananas, ...(Guitarist) Disashi is just a monster on the new <b>stuff.</b> You're <b>going</b> {{to hear a lot}} more of him singing on this one and a lot more of his guitar skills that I don't think he really got to flex on the last record." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{few months}} later, he {{continued}} {{talking about the}} hosting gig at an interview for Playboy. There he said he told a producer, [...] "I don't know why you hired me, because you haven't given me anything. I just don't think this <b>stuff's</b> <b>going</b> to be good". He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry. Before Twitter, I always had that buffer period when I could actually think and decide, Is this worth it? ... For me Twitter is a dangerous thing".|$|R
500|$|... "Dirrty" [...] {{was among}} the last tracks to be {{recorded}} for Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped. It was recorded at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank and Conway Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles by Oscar Ramirez, Wassim Zreik, and Dylan [...] "3-D" [...] Dresdow. Aguilera desired to create a [...] "down and dirty" [...] song that would announce her new image. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder, {{who had worked with}} her on [...] "Lady Marmalade", and suggested recording a song in the vein of Redman's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)". [...] "Dirrty" [...] ultimately became a [...] "near-remake" [...] of its predecessor, as Entertainment Weekly said. Rapper Redman, who previously appeared on Eminem's 2001 song [...] "Off the Wall", in which Eminem disses Aguilera, is featured on the song. Aguilera intended to use a misspelled title to personalize the song, also considering [...] "Dirtee" [...] or [...] "Dirrdy". The title reflects the music video, which Aguilera describes as [...] "gritty, [...] underground, illegal <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games called Phantom Hourglass {{one of the}} few [...] "masterpieces" [...] on the Nintendo DS, {{which made}} it [...] "worth every penny". Believing that Phantom Hourglass {{improves}} on everything that was great about its predecessor, The Wind Waker, GamePro predicted that the sequel would be another successful game in the franchise. Although feeling that the game does not live up to the standards set in , Game Informer still felt that the adventure is worthy of The Legend of Zelda series, and noted that it [...] "has enough great <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> for it" [...] for them to consider it one of the year's best video game adventures. GameZone enjoyed the [...] "spectacular blend of touch-screen combat, brilliant puzzles, and Wind Waker beauty" [...] in Phantom Hourglass, calling it a [...] "can't-miss adventure" [...] and one of Nintendo's and the year's best games. Hypers Jonti Davies commended Phantom Hourglass for its [...] "perfect controls and supreme world and dungeon designs". However, he criticized the game for only giving around 30 hours of gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Big Boi leaked the album's first {{official}} single, [...] "Shutterbugg", on April 6. It was officially released {{as a single}} on April 26. It was also issued on interactive music site MXP4, which enabled users to play with, mix, remix, and sing along with the track. Its music video was directed by Chris Robinson and premiered on May 26. The video's concept incorporates various scenes that accentuate different lines from Big Boi's lyrics. On its concept, Big Boi {{said in an interview}} for MTV, [...] "It goes with the rhymes. Chris Robinson was definitely onboard [...] What he took from the song was a lyrical, visual adventure. There's a lot of special <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on. He's freaking the visuals like I'm freaking the rhymes". [...] "Shutterbugg" [...] spent two weeks on the US R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at number 60, and it charted at number 99 on the US Hot 100 Airplay. It also reached number 31 and spent four weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and at number eight on the Deutsche Black Charts in Germany. Rolling Stone named [...] "Shutterbugg" [...] the 14th best single of 2010. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Rhodes was {{included}} on Granta's Best of Young British Novelists list in 2003, {{to his own}} bemusement and frustration, partly because of Granta's selection methods ("It's one thing to judge a writer by stuff they've written, but to judge them on <b>stuff</b> they're <b>going</b> to write is lunacy") but also {{because some of the}} others on the list failed to respond to his request to sign a joint statement protesting against the Iraq war.|$|R
5000|$|Gallagher was {{inspired}} {{to write the book}} by informal experimentation with his own infant sons, who he has called his [...] "two favourite science projects". He cited [...] "bonding with your baby, the intellectual stimulation, becoming more exposed to the field of child development and all the cool <b>stuff</b> that's <b>going</b> on" [...] as reasons to read Experimenting with Babies, but wanted to avoid suggesting any benchmarks or measures of intelligence for the babies.|$|R
2500|$|Kath {{reportedly}} had a self-admitted {{history of}} drug abuse, including alcohol. Seraphine knew that Kath {{had a high}} tolerance for drugs, but later recalled Kath telling him, [...] "I'm going to get things under control... if I don't, this <b>stuff</b> is <b>going</b> to kill me." [...] Chicago bandmates have indicated that he was also increasingly unhappy. However, Guercio has said that Kath {{was working on a}} solo album before he died, and Pankow adamantly denies that Kath was suicidal.|$|R
500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Speaking to NME about the song's {{reference}} to Public Enemy, Shinoda said, [...] "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 17, 1984 by Jive Records. The group had a developed a large following in Britain and Europe prior {{to the release of}} Escape, although success in the United States had initially been limited. [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] and [...] "Freaks Come Out at Night" [...] became their first legitimate hits in their home country. According to the New York Times, these could be [...] "heard almost constantly in New York dance clubs, as well as on local urban-contemporary radio stations." [...] Ecstasy said that audiences were finally ready for hip-hop music, and Whodini were [...] "just beginning to break through on radio. Rather than listening to Stevie Wonder or someone do an inferior version of rap, people want to hear the real thing, with the original complexity to it. This is the most complex, interesting <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on in black music today, and the radio's just beginning to discover that the public eats it up." [...] By December 1984, the 7- and 12-inch singles [...] "Friends" [...] and [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] were approaching sales of 350,000, and received more airplay than the [...] "Magic's Wand" [...] and [...] "Haunted House of Rock" [...] from Whodini's first album. Billboard reported the airplay, noting that despite the increased play, the songs were unreported and often played during the night. The month before Escape release, Whodini appeared at the 1984 Swatch Watch New York City Fresh Fest as part of the first national tour featuring hip-hop groups. The 27-date tour featured Run–D.M.C., Kurtis Blow, The Fat Boys and Newcleus, and grossed $3.5 million.|$|E
2500|$|He has remarked in {{the past}} that his work at Fox opened his eyes to what critics cite as bias in the {{mainstream}} press. Wallace has stated, [...] "Fox News wouldn't exist if it weren't for this kind of <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on in the mainstream media. That's why people are fed up with that and want the antidote to it because they get it and they've gotten it for years – the so-called bias in the objective press." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with WWE on February 27, Scott said “We’re {{going to go in}} the studio probably around May and record our next record. If you like [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen" [...] and [...] "Click Click Boom", and more dynamic <b>stuff,</b> it’s <b>going</b> to be an ass-whooping of a record. It’s going to be 45 minutes of ass-whooping!” Saliva toured with Sevendust in South Korea, Japan and a brief stint in Europe until July 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{critics of}} the actions of the police have {{suggested}} that it was not Meyer's actions which led to his removal, but the content of his remarks. For example, writer Palast said, [...] "When you bring up uncomfortable <b>stuff,</b> it's <b>going</b> to create discomfort. Obviously, if he was speaking about baseball scores—if he maybe had a different political viewpoint that wasn't seen as combative or outside of what's permissible—then the cops' backs wouldn't have been up." ...|$|R

2500|$|Stephen Dorff portrays Hal Hartman, an unhinged Texas Ranger that pursues Leatherface and {{his family}} for revenge {{for the murder of}} his daughter. Dorff {{described}} Leatherface as a [...] "survival film for my character and a retribution film for Hartman, who I play. But it definitely has the moments of some sick <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on, and I think you realize that this family's not to be messed with. You want to stay clear away from the Sawyers and not confront them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Altman {{was one of}} the few filmmakers who [...] "paid full {{attention}} to the possibilities of sound" [...] when filming. He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks. During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a [...] "dense audio experience" [...] for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, [...] "I like to see a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early test {{screenings}} {{did not go}} well, {{with the}} strong violence in some scenes being too much. At the first test screening, eighty people walked out during a graphic torture scene involving Johnnie Farragut. Lynch decided not to cut anything from the film and at the second screening one hundred people walked out during this scene. Lynch remembers, [...] "By then, I knew the scene was killing the film. So I cut it {{to the degree that}} it was powerful but didn't send people running from the theatre". In retrospect, the filmmaker said, [...] "But that was part of what Wild at Heart was about: really insane and sick and twisted <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on." ...|$|E
5000|$|Araya commented {{about the}} {{misconception}} {{of the band}} labeled as Satan worshippers, [...] "Yeah, yeah I think that's {{one of the biggest}} misconceptions towards the band, but next to that just the fact that we're normal." [...] If guitarist King writes a good song, Araya puts his beliefs aside, [...] "I'm not one that's going to go, 'This sucks because it's contrary to my beliefs.' To me it's more like 'This is really good <b>stuff.</b> You're <b>going</b> to piss people off with this.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Giamatti {{called the}} novel [...] "an embarrassment of riches" [...] and said: [...] "what's {{going to be}} tragic is what's {{going to have to}} go, because <b>stuff</b> is <b>going</b> to have to go and ... it will kill me {{whatever}} goes, because you want it all to be in there and you've still got to have this stuffed bag of stuff." [...] He also praised the actors and Coscarelli's choices, stating, [...] "Don cast it brilliantly. The actors were so good." ...|$|R
5000|$|What happened, he explains, {{was that}} he had already been in England {{recently}} for a literary festival; he is booked for another trip soon, and had been travelling so much that he asked the prize organisers, [...] "Would it be possible to see Her Majesty when I was actually in London?" [...] "They thought it would be better just to cancel than for me to ask Her Majesty to do that. Then all this <b>stuff</b> started <b>going</b> out in English tabloids." ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the Band's [...] "grittily distinctive" [...] sound coming together, according to Hoskyns. Its author, Robertson, has explained that it was based on an actual Yazoo Street in a town in Arkansas, Helm's home state: [...] "I thought, 'Wow, they don't have streets like that in Canada. There's no streets up there called Yazoo!' It was like, 'Jesus, let me make up a little story here about <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on in this kind of almost red light district.' Everything was lit in red in that song for me." [...] Initially, Robertson recorded the lead vocal for the first version of this song, but because it was set in the South, the Hawks decided that Levon Helm would be a more appropriate singer, employing what Hoskyns describes as his [...] "best redneck-wildcat yelp".|$|E
2500|$|Wireds Erika Milvy {{commented that}} [...] "Fox's Simpsons Cartoon Studio {{may be more}} the '90s answer to Colorforms than a finely tuned {{animation}} resource, but dang if it isn't fun to watch Smithers and Mr. Burns hula across the monitor as a three-eyed fish swims by," [...] and added that [...] "for the anally inclined, there's certainly a way to have these cartoons make more sense. But I prefer to toss rhyme and reason out the window." [...] Joseph Szadkowski of The Washington Times wrote that [...] "For the amount of complicated computer <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on — frame by frame editing, character motion, voice overlays — even the most computer-illiterate individual {{should be able to}} figure this out. The Simpsons Cartoon Studio [...] is a very fun, relatively inexpensive jaunt into the mind of Mr. Groening." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Let It Happen" [...] {{opens the}} album, {{and is about}} [...] "finding {{yourself}} always {{in this world of}} chaos and all this <b>stuff</b> <b>going</b> on around you and always shutting it out because you don't {{want to be part of}} it. But at some point, you realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E
5000|$|García {{has also}} {{adjusted}} {{his approach to}} the strike zone, being especially careful not to leave pitches {{in the middle of}} the plate: [...] "He doesn't really have the electric <b>stuff,</b> so he's <b>going</b> to stay on the corners and stay out of the zone." ...|$|R
500|$|William Shatner said: [...] "There is a mythological {{component}} , {{especially with}} science fiction.

If we accept the premise {{that it has a}} mythological element, then all the <b>stuff</b> about <b>going</b> out into space and meeting new life – trying to explain it and put a human element to it – it's a hopeful vision. All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future." ...|$|R
