5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide <b>surrender.</b> They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional <b>surrender</b> and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against <b>surrender.</b> In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional <b>surrender</b> of his garrison, but he chose to delay the <b>surrender</b> until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{their leader}} fall, the Loyalists began to <b>surrender.</b> Some Patriots {{did not want}} to take prisoners, as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or 'Tarleton's Quarter,' in which Banastre Tarleton's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford's Continental {{soldiers}} after the latter tried to <b>surrender.</b> (At Waxhaws, Tarleton's horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of <b>surrender.)</b> Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to <b>surrender.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, as the Channel Islands lacked {{strategic}} significance, the Allies bypassed {{them when}} they invaded Normandy.
