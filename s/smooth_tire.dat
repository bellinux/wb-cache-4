5000|$|Paddle {{tires are}} mainly used on off road vehicles, {{specifically}} designed for use in sand and mud. They consist of a <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> core which has a series of large rubber cups (or paddles) attached to it. The volume inside of a paddle is {{much larger than the}} void of a knobby tire, so it is unlikely to clog up with sand/mud. A street legal mud tire is a more or less normal tire, but with extra large gaps or [...] "voids" [...] between each tread block (called [...] "lugs") to allow centrifugal force to [...] "self-clean" [...] or fling the mud out of the gap. Smaller gaps trap the mud in between the tire lugs, which turns the tire into something resembling a [...] "slick" [...] with no tread at all, which will have no traction in mud. A paddle tire is an even more extreme version of this, optimized for mud or sand. The paddle provides superior traction in the sand, in part, because the paddles dig into the sand and push off from the buried sand, not just the surface, and in mud, the gigantic [...] "voids" [...] give no place for mud to stick. They work something like a paddle wheel on a paddle-steamer. Street legal mud tires are a compromise between large voids and a smooth rolling shape for on-road use. The more [...] "extreme" [...] a mud tire (such as a [...] "Super Swamper") is, the harsher and louder it is on a hard surface. A [...] "tractor tire" [...] on a farm tractor is a somewhat more mild version of a paddle tire, only the voids are smaller to allow for limited use on hard surfaces, and the [...] "lugs" [...] are angled to give lateral traction. A paddle tire is so optimized for mud that the shape is of no use on anything other than a soft surface, since the vibration and lack of control of the tire would render a vehicle almost unusable. One other way the paddle tire is a specialized-application-only is that it gives only forward/rearward traction. This means that it is used on a wheel that drives a vehicle to push it forward, but gives little [...] "lateral" [...] (side-to-side) traction. For that reason, the tires of the vehicle that steer it are generally more [...] "normal" [...] tires, since a paddle tire on a steering wheel will just slide sideways rather than pulling the vehicle with it. So many 4WD vehicles will use paddle tires only on the rear, although the front wheels are powered as well. On a 2WD or a motorbike, the rear wheel is the only drive wheel, and so putting a paddle tire on the front wheels is useless or worse, since steering performance will be negatively impacted.|$|E
40|$|Thin overlays, diamond grinding, {{longitudinal}} grooving, transverse grooving, {{and milling}} {{have been successful}} techniques for restoring frictional properties on portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. Shotblasting offers a lower cost alternative if successful. Five test sections of shotblasting were placed on IA 9 from Decorah east to the Winneshiek County line (milepost 260. 0 to 270. 0). Both <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> and ribbed tire friction testing (ASTM E 274) was performed. The conclusions and recommendations are: Based on the study, friction enhancement by shotblasting has a relatively short service life when measured by the ribbed tire test. However, when measured by the <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> test, the friction enhancement is longer lasting.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} many important issues associate with pavement surface friction testing, in particular using the <b>smooth</b> <b>tire.</b> This study utilized 3 -D FEM program {{to investigate the}} fundamental friction phenomenon in light of energy dissipation during friction process. It was demonstrated that the pavement friction depends on many factors such as test tire, test speed, surrounding conditions, pavement surface texture, and pavement type. A great amount of friction data has been collected so as to investigate variations involved in pavement friction measurements. System variations depend on the feature of pavement surface. The standard deviations due to system errors are usually less than 5. The <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> tends to provide greater variations than the ribbed tire. As air temperature increases, the friction number does not necessarily decrease. No consistent relations were identified between friction measurements and test seasons. Seasonal friction variations are negligible. The largest directional variation is 16 with the <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> on a State road. The State and U. S. roads tend to produce greater directional variations than the interstates. Driving lane usually has lower friction than other lanes. The greatest lateral variation arose due {{to the effect of}} wheel track. Longitudinal friction variations depend on traffic distribution, pavement type, and surrounding conditions. Friction measurements taken at 1. 0 -mile spacing can provide realistic network pavement friction information. Pavement frictions on interstates decreased faster than those on State and US roads. INDOT conducts pavement inventory friction test every year on interstates and every three years on State and US roads. The force transducers should be calibrated every month and the whole system performance verified every week so as to identify potential significant performance changes. A minimum of three to five test runs must be conducted for system verification. The standard <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> is recommended for INDOT network pavement inventory friction test. In general, the friction number measured with the ribbed tire is greater than that with the <b>smooth</b> <b>tire.</b> However, the differences decrease as the surface texture becomes rougher. The average friction difference is about 20 on highway pavements. Friction test speed should be determined in light of the traffic conditions. Three test speeds of 30 mph, 40 mph, and 50 mph are recommended for network pavement inventory friction testing. Determination of the minimum friction requirement should consider its impact on wet-pavement accidents and agency’s budgets. Taking into account the minimum friction requirement recommended by NCHRP Report- 37 and the differences between the ribbed and smooth tires, a friction number of 20 with the <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> at 40 mph is recommended as the minimum friction requirement for network pavement inventory friction testing. It was found that this requirement is economically reasonable in light of the network pavement maintenance and resurfacing. No good correlations were identified between pavement friction and wet-pavement accidents...|$|E

The effect of fog sealing sprinkle treated pavements was studied by testing friction levels {{before and after the}} application of the fog seals. Conclusions of the report are: 1. Current aggregate selection criteria for a. c. pavement surface courses provides adequate friction levels through 10 years and should remain effective through a 15 year design life. 2.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effects of pavement surface condition on the cornering forces developed by a group of 6. 50 x 13 automobile tires of different tread design was conducted at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility. The tests were made at fixed yaw angles of 3, 4. 5, and 6 deg at forward speeds up to 80 knots on two concrete surfaces of different texture under dry, damp, and flooded conditions. The results showed that the cornering forces were extremely sensitive to tread pattern and runway surface texture under all conditions and that under flooded conditions tire hydroplaning and complete loss of cornering force occurred at a forward velocity predicted from an existing formula based on tire inflation pressure. Futher, tests on the damp concrete with a <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> and a four-groove tire showed higher cornering forces at a yaw angle of 3 deg than at 4. 5 deg; this indicated that maximum cornering forces are developed at extremely small steering angles under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Four years ago, the Michelin Tire Corporation {{proposed}} {{a problem on}} experimental design, to improve the manufacturing process for their tires. The idea is basically {{to determine the effects}} of placements for various layers built up in the construction of a tire, to allow the design of a <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> with a smooth ride. A highly success solution was developed, and it has been reported that this method introduced savings of over half a million dollars in their test processes. This year, Michelin returned to the workshop with an extension to the original problem, to address specific refinements in the testing method. This report summarizes the work completed in course of the five day workshop. It was clear early in the workshop that this problem could be handled quickly by reviewing the analysis which was done in 2000, and extending those ideas to the new problems at hand. We reviewed the required Fourier techniques to describe the harmonic problem, and statistical techniques to deal with the linear model that described how to accurately measure quantities that come from real experimental measurements. The “prime method” and “good lattice points method” were reviewed and re-analysed so we could understand (and prove) why they work so well. We then looked at extending these methods and successfully found solutions to problem 1) and 2) posed by Michelin. Matlab code was written to test and verify the algorithms developed. We have some ideas on problems 3) and 4), which are also described...|$|E
40|$|Availability of {{analytical}} and numerical tools {{that can provide}} reliable and accurate estimates of wet frictional resistance in different pavements would preclude the need for time consuming field tests. Therefore, many research efforts {{have been made to}} develop such tire-pavement friction predictive tools that are invaluable for friction management programs. However, due to the complexity of the problem, most existing tools have been developed based on several simplifying assumptions and without field verification of their predictions. The current study is focused on the evaluation of two specific prediction methods {{that can be used to}} predict friction on a <b>smooth</b> <b>tire</b> sliding on a rough moist pavement by comparing the corresponding predictions with the results of field experiments. A 3 -dimensional finite element model (FEM) formulated in ANSYS software and an analytical method based on computing hysteresis friction from viscous energy dissipation are the two methods considered in this study. Both prediction tools are capable of considering rough pavement surface texture while the FEM method can even incorporate the specific tire geometric and material properties. Friction predictions of the two methods based on the macrotexture data collected at a selected test surface provide reasonably accurate results when compared to the corresponding field evaluation. The main finding of the investigation is the availability of relatively easily executed analytical methodologies that are comparable in accuracy to more rigorous finite element tools. The second stage of the research was focused on wet weather friction of a tire sliding on a randomly rough pavement. A numerical model was developed to predict the drag force of a sliding tire on a wet rough pavement. The model consists of three sub-models; the fluid model based on the Reynolds equation, tire model developed with two sets of springs and a rigid pavement model. As a contribution to the state-of-the-art the author modeled the pavement by including randomly rough properties which represent real pavements. The results of the parametric study based on the model predictions are agreeable with physical principles and intuition. However, this model is only capable of simulating laminar water flow between the tire and the pavement whereas in reality turbulent flow can occur very often on a randomly rough pavement...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{has been applied}} for investigating the temperature distribution in a <b>smooth</b> tread bias <b>tire</b> of a light truck, operated under different speeds, pneumatic pressures, and loading conditions. Prior to simulation by the finite element analysis, two separate sets of testing, namely dynamic mechanical testing and material testing, have been conducted {{in relation to the}} evaluation of hysteresis (H) and total strain energy (Used), respectively. Hysteresis loss energy is given as (H × Used) and considered to relate directly to heat generation rate. Temperature rise is assumed to be due to the energy dissipation from periodic deformation. This dissipation of energy may be equated to be the primary heat generation source. Hysteresis energy loss is used as a bridge to link the strain energy density to the heat source in rolling tires; temperature distribution of rolling tires may be obtained by the steady-state thermal analysis. The above procedure has been shown to facilitate the simulation of the temperature distribution in the rolling tire. An efficient computational process is being introduced to decrease the time for coupled 3 D dynamic rolling simulation of tire. Temperature rise under different conditions is discussed with reference to the results of other published studies. © 2004 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 32 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 8 - 11 July 2013 "Transport and Sustainable Infrastructure", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Skid resistance values found in older design manuals were typically based on studies where the worst case scenarios of bald <b>tires,</b> <b>smooth</b> pavement and wet conditions were used. The graphs depicting these values were first published in the AASHTO Policy for the Geometric Design of Rural Highways, 1954. In the AASHTO Policy for the Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 2001, skid resistance ceased to define braking distance (the second component of Stopping Sight Distance) and a standard deceleration of 3. 4 m/s 2, based on comfort, became the design norm at all speeds. These design values are of little use in the reconstruction of crashes. The skid resistance for specific scenarios must be determined. Values obtained from published sources can serve as guidance to orders of magnitude and as reference values. The stopping -performance of modern cars under ideal conditions {{can be in the}} order of 8 to 9 m/s 2. With GPS loggers and accelerometers now generally available, field tests can be done with similar vehicles under comparable conditions {{at a fraction of the}} cost of the formal testing equipment. The acceptance of these values has not been tested in court and the credibility of the results will have to be agreed by the experts acting for the Court or be tried by the court based on the facts presented. Values for road surfaces contaminated by gravel (sand to stone chips) could not be found in literature. Tests, using a Race Technology DL 1 data logger with accelerometer, were conducted on a good gravel road and on an abandoned section of sealed road with sand and crushed stone gravel on. All the tests were done in dry conditions. The gravel roads were included to establish a measure of comparison. The skid resistance of the gravel roads were found to be 0. 53 to 0. 63. The skid resistance of the sealed road with sand contamination were found to be between 0. 36 and 0. 44. The skid resistance of 13. 2 mm and 6. 7 mm stone used for seal resurfacing on the sealed road varied between 0. 37 and 0. 47. The skid resistance of dry gravel roads and surface roads contaminated with sand and gravel are still greater than the comfort-based design value of 0. 35. This does not imply that such areas are safe for all vehicles (motorcycle and bicycles being especially vulnerable). The skid resistances of surfaced contaminated roads do not meet the brake performance of 4. 4 m/s 2 (skid resistance of 0. 44) required in the National Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996.
