The intensity of disturbance steadily decreases with increase in size of the fragment. The study revealed that tree species richness increased from 49 species in 1 -ha fragment to 64 species in > 5 -ha fragment. Tree species richness was positively related to fragment size, but was inversely related to the degree of disturbance. Impact of fragment size on density and basal cover did not differ much between the fragments. D iversity and dominance indices did not varied much along the fragment size gradient. Out of ten most dominant species, dominance of four species decreased along increasing size gradient while dominance of remaining species consistently decreased from 1 -ha to > 5 -ha fragments. Overall tree population structure was pyramid shaped in all the fragments. About 16 - 25 % species showed good regeneration in all the fragments. Percentage of species showing fair, poor and no regeneration progressively increases with increase in size of the fragments. Large percentages (44 %) of new species were found regenerating in small fragments compared to large fragments where only 3 new species were regenerating.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in <b>subtropical</b> <b>humid</b> <b>forests</b> of Meghalaya to study the distribu-tional pattern of species, floristic composition, community structure and tree population structure. Forest fragments of varying sizes (0. 5 ha, 1 ha, 2 ha and 5 ha) were used in the study. All of the forest fragments are distributed within the same altitudinal range, and had similar rainfall and temperature regimes. Four forest fragments were sampled using random quadrats to analyze the impact of fragment size on tree diversity and population structure. Indices were used to compare the dispersion pattern of plant species, species diversity among fragments, and the heterogeneity and homogeneity of the fragments. A total of 45 tree species were recorded from all the fragments and simple correlation showed that the species richness was positively re-lated to fragment size (n = 4, P< 0. 05). Other measures such as stand density, basal cover, diversity and dominance indices were unrelated to fragment size. Forest canopy was composed mainly of Castonopsis in-dica, C. armata, Schima khasiana and Engelhardtia spicata in all of the fragments.

The maximum stand density, basal area, Shannon diversity index and Simpson dominance index was recorded in a 5 -ha fragment.

The overall density of seedlings, saplings and adult trees formed a pyramidal structure, indicating that the period between the sapling and adult stage was a critical stage in tree life cycles, as the maximum mortality occurred during this period. These groves are mildly/highly disturbed by communitiesusing forests for their timber and fuel wood requirements as well as cattle and goat grazing. Tree regeneration was apparently not limited, as was evidenced by high density of saplings. These human activities may have been responsible for a decrease in tree diversity in the smaller fragments.

Nevertheless, only scarce early Paleogene paleoclimatic records are known from the South American continental sequences deposited at these latitudes. In this contribution clay mineralogy and paleobotanical analyses (fossil woods and phytoliths) were used as paleoclimate proxies from the lower and middle parts of the Río Chico Group (Golfo San Jorge basin, Patagonia, Argentina). These new data may enable to understand the changing climatic conditions during part of the Paleocene-Eocene transition. In this setting, three clay mineral assemblages were identified: S 1 assemblage (smectite) dominates the Peñas Coloradas Formation; S 2 assemblage (smectite>kaolinite) occurs in the stratigraphic transition to the Las Flores Formation; and S 3 assemblage (kaolinite>smectite) dominates the Las Flores Formation. These trend of change in the detrital clay mineral composition is interpreted as resulting mainly from the changing paleoclimatic conditions that shifted from seasonal warm temperate to tropical affecting the same source area lithology. Moreover, the paleobotanical data suggest that the Early Paleogene vegetation in the Golfo San Jorge basin underwent significant composition and diversity changes, ranging from mixed temperate - subtropical forest to mixed <b>subtropical</b> - tropical, <b>humid</b> <b>forest.</b> The integrated analysis of the clay mineral composition and the palaeobotanical assemblages suggests that, in central Argentinean Patagonia, the Paleocene-Eocene climate changed from temperate warm, humid and highly seasonal precipitation conditions to subtropical-tropical, more continuous year-round rainfall conditions...|$|R
