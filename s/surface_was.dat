5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, they were {{surprised to discover that}} the <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E

5|$|Telescopic {{observations}} in the mid-20th century began to hint at Io's unusual nature. Spectroscopic observations suggested that Io's <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> devoid of water ice (a substance {{found to be}} plentiful on the other Galilean satellites). The same observations suggested a surface dominated by evaporates composed of sodium salts and sulfur. Radiotelescopic observations revealed Io's influence on the Jovian magnetosphere, as demonstrated by decametric wavelength bursts tied to the orbital period of Io.|$|E
5|$|The {{adhesive}} <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> {{protected by}} a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge.

5|$|The father {{panel is}} {{signed and dated}} on both sides, {{in what may be}} the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{when the}} contact angle is smaller than 90 °, the solid <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be ‘lyophilic’ which means wetting of liquid on the <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> favorable. When {{the contact angle}} is larger than 90 °, the solid <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> considered ‘lyophobic’ which indicates the liquid will minimize its contact {{on the surface and}} form a compact liquid droplet. When the contact angle is greater than 150 °, the solid <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> considered to be ‘super-lyophobic’. And when the contact angle is almost 0 °, the <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> considered to be ‘super-lyophilic’ [9].|$|R
50|$|In general, the two SMS optical {{surfaces}} do {{not need}} to <b>be</b> refractive. Refractive <b>surfaces</b> <b>are</b> noted R (from Refraction) while reflective <b>surfaces</b> <b>are</b> noted X (from the Spanish word refleXión). Total Internal Reflection (TIR) is noted I. Therefore, a lens with two refractive <b>surfaces</b> <b>is</b> an RR optic, while another configuration with a reflective and a refractive <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> an XR optic. Configurations with more optical <b>surfaces</b> <b>are</b> also possible and, for example, if light is first refracted (R), then reflected (X) then reflected again by TIR (I), the optic is called an RXI.|$|R

5|$|Coandă {{described}} a different, more sturdy {{system for the}} attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{size of its}} coma, Halley's nucleus is {{relatively}} small: barely 15kilometers long, 8kilometers wide and perhaps 8kilometers thick. Its shape vaguely resembles that of a peanut. Its mass is relatively low (roughly 2.2kg) and its average density is about 0.6g/cm3, indicating that it is made {{of a large number}} of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile. Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley's rotation period was about 7.4 days. Images taken by the various spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52hours. Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley's rotation is likely to be complex. Although only 25% of Halley's <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> imaged in detail during the flyby missions, the images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.|$|E
5|$|Features on Io {{are named}} after {{characters}} and places from the Io myth, {{as well as}} deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno: names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the <b>surface</b> <b>was</b> first seen up close by Voyager 1, the International Astronomical Union has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include patera ("saucer"; volcanic depression), fluctus ("flow"; lava flow), vallis ("valley"; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was {{the first sign of}} volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, plateaus, layered terrain, and shield volcanoes include the terms mons, mensa ("table"), planum, and tholus ("rotunda"), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term regio. Examples of named features are Prometheus, Pan Mensa, Tvashtar Paterae, and Tsũi Goab Fluctus.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour {{of a new and}} more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty.
