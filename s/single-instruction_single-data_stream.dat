40|$|Introduction The Real World Computing (RWC) Project aims at {{developing}} "flexible information processing" {{technologies for}} real world applications. Main research areas are optical computing, theoretical basis, novel functions, and massively parallel computing. A series of massively parallel computers are {{planned to be}} developed to serve {{as part of the}} infrastructure of the project. The first in the series, RWC- 1, is now under development [4]. RWC- 1 is based on the "RICA architecture" in which computation and communication is closely coupled. The close coupling enables efficient fine-grain parallel computation, which is desirable in flexible computational tasks. Multiple-instruction, multiple-data stream (MIMD) type parallel computers [...] - RWC- 1 is one such [...] - allow more flexible computation than <b>single-instruction,</b> <b>single-data</b> <b>stream</b> (SIMD) type parallel computers, since constituent processors does not run in a lock-step manner but and asynchronously and freely.

Moreover, the proposed two algorithms both are applicable to the noncoordinated system. However, the centralized scheme is suggested to apply for the noncoordinated system, as the decentralized scheme is a suboptimal solution in this situation.|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} {{and implementation of}} a VLSI chip set that vector quantizes (VQ) image sequences in real time is described. The chip set forms a programmable Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) machine which can implement various vector quantization encoding structures. Its VQ codebook may contain unlimited number of codevectors, N, having dimension up to K = 64. Under a weighted least squared error criterion, the engine locates at video rates the best code vector in full-searched or large tree searched VQ codebooks. The ability to manipulate tree structured codebooks, coupled with parallelism and pipelining, permits searches in as short as O (log N) cycles. A full codebook search results in O(N) performance, compared to O(KN) for a <b>Single-Instruction,</b> <b>Single-Data</b> (SISD) machine. With this VLSI chip set, an entire video code can be built on a single board that permits realtime experimentation with very large codebooks...|$|R
