50|$|At 10am on 11 May 1877 a <b>seismic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>wave</b> {{from the}} 1877 Iquique {{earthquake}} caused an 18 inch high wave up the Clutha River past Kaitangata, with the river eventually rising to four feet above its former height. This repeated hourly {{for most of}} that day.|$|E
50|$|The tsunami {{was unusually}} {{powerful}} {{for the size}} of the earthquake. The event was classified as a tsunami earthquake due to the discrepancy between {{the size of the}} tsunami and the relatively low surface wave magnitude.

2500|$|An {{earthquake}} [...] is {{the result}} of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. [...] At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by vibration, shaking, and sometimes displacement of the ground. Earthquakes are caused by slippage within geological faults. The underground point of origin of the earthquake is called the seismic focus. The point directly above the focus on the surface is called the epicenter. Earthquakes by themselves rarely kill people or wildlife. It is usually the secondary events that they trigger such as building collapse, fires, tsunamis (<b>seismic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>waves)</b> and volcanoes. Many of these could possibly be avoided by better construction, safety systems, early warning and planning.|$|R

40|$|The {{case for}} a glacial origin for the upper Proterozoic Kingston Peak Formation is weak. Stratigraphic {{correlations}} and rock descriptions suggest a marine depositional environment for the entire formation. The Lower Sandstone Unit of the Kingston Peak Formation is best interpreted as an Antediluvian inner shelf deposit. It is underlain by other widespread shelf deposits, the Beck Spring Dolomite followed by the Crystal Spring Formation which rests on granitic gneiss. Overlying these deposits are thick accumulations of puddingstones (called diamictite by many) interpreted as debrites. These, in turn, are overlain by rhythmically laid breccias and megabreccias interpreted as suspension-sturzstrom deposits. The debrites and sturzstrom are comprised of debris derived mainly from the underlying Beck Spring Dolomite and Crystal Spring Formation. Large-scale catastrophic plate tectonics associated with the subduction zone to the west caused the Antediluvian sea floor to collapse. Debris flows moving {{at the rate of}} 15 - 30 m/s were instantly generated at the onset of massive local faulting associated with the event. A displacement of perhaps 950 m or more in some areas along the giant fault scarp converted the shelf to a 60 0 slope environment. This activity spawned <b>seismic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>waves.</b> Sheet flows of fluidized rock masses fell over the cataract and flowed across the basin at 50 - 100 m/s.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} to make available and archive the background scientific data and related information collected on geologic hazards during {{the preparation of the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) for Phases 3 and 4 of the Hawaii Geothermal Project (HGP) as defined by the state of Hawaii in its April 1989 proposal to Congress. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a notice in the Federal Register on May 17, 1994 (Fed Regis. 5925638) withdrawing its Notice of Intent (Fed Regis. 575433) of February 14, 1992, to prepare the HGP-EIS. Since the state of Hawaii is no longer pursuing or planning to pursue the HGP, DOE considers the project to be terminated This report presents a review of current information on geologic hazards in the Hawaiian Islands. Interrelationships among these hazards are discussed. Probabilities of occurrence of given geologic hazards are provided in various regions where sufficient geologic or historical data are available. Most of the information contained herein is compiled from recent U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) publications and open-file reports. This report describes the natural geologic hazards present in the area and does not represent an assessment of environmental impacts. Geologic hazards originate both onshore and offshore. Onshore geologic hazards such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, surface rupture, landslides, uplift, and subsidence occur mainly on the southern third of the island of Hawaii (hereinafter referred to as Hawaii). Offshore geologic hazards are more widely distributed throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Examples of offshore geologic hazards are submarine landslides, turbidity currents, and <b>seismic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>waves</b> (tsunamis). First, overviews of volcanic and earthquake activity, and details of offshore geologic hazards is provided for the Hawaiian Islands. Then, a more detailed discussion of onshore geologic hazards is presented with special emphasis on the southern third of Hawaii and the east rift zone of Kilauea...|$|R

Unlike normal ocean waves which are generated by wind, or tides which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water. [...] Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves, because their wavelength is far longer. [...] Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide, and for this reason they are often referred to as tidal waves, although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because tsunamis are not tidal in nature. Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called [...] "internal wave train". [...] Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous and they can affect entire ocean basins; the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean.|$|E

40|$|Following the Alaska {{earthquake}} the <b>Seismic</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Wave</b> Warning System {{issued a}} first advisory message indicating {{the possibility of}} a tsunami not quite 1 1 / 2 hours after the earthquake, and a formal tsunami warning just over 3 hours after the earthquake. By the time the initial advisory message was issued, all affected Alaskan communities had already been struck by the locally generated tsunamis or the initial waves of the major tsunami. Unofficial warnings led to some saving of life; more lives could have been saved if the earthquake itself or initial waves had been perceived as warnings, but at some places the waves arrived too soon for any warning to be effective. SSWWS warnings were received early enough at affected communities outside of Alaska to have induced appropriate response (except in Canada which {{was not part of the}} system). The responses varied greatly, however, from community to community, depending on the experience and understanding of system officials and of the public. Fatalities from the tsunamis totaled 103 in Alaska and 15 elsewhere. This brief summary of the warning of tsunamis associated with the 1964 Alaska earthquake and of human responses to these warnings, is not intended to be comprehensive or particularly detailed. Its focus is on the general description of the range of warnings and of responses among the several communities in Alaska and elsewhere that were struck by the tsunamis or warned of possible tsunami effects.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the seismicity and tectonic evolution of the eastern end of the Azores – Gibraltar Fracture Zone. The location of the main seismogenetic areas in this region is related to the complex geometry of the boundary between the Iberian and African lithospheric plates. To the west of the San Vicente Cape the seismicity can be related to a local compression at the Gorringe Bank. A detailed seismotectonic analysis allows the geological interpretation of the position of the hypocenter for the 12 th February 2007 earthquake. It had Mw 6. 0 and was placed on a fault having a NNE-SSW strike and a high dip to NW. The fault shows an oblique displacement (sinistral) and locates in the margin of the Horseshoe abyssal basin. Displacement along this fault is here tentatively related to complex deformation in the outer swell of an incipient downgoing plate. This can be the first indication of the beginning of subduction of {{the northern part of the}} African plate under the continental margin of Iberia. On the other hand, an analysis of the location of earthquakes having Mw > 6. 0 generated to the SW of the San Vicente Cape and the estimated isoseismal map has been made.

40|$|Modernity {{is as much}} a {{state of}} mind as it is a {{material}} condition. As such its quality can most clearly be described as a transformative ethic that has as its engine pushing it forwards and outwards the positivistic and economistic rationalism that is capitalism. That is to say, with capitalism as its mechanism and its fuel, modernity seeks a progressive and linear transformation of the human experience into a rationally and reflexively ordered lifescape that can be pro-actively controlled and manipulated for the purposes of providing an ever more comfortable, fulfilling, liberating, challenging, and complex life for its human architects. Mediating the mental and the material aspects of modernity are the institutions and organisations which individuals and groups construct in order that they might express their consciousness through the process of creative adaptation. In other words, institutions and organisations are the social mechanisms by which people not only create their environment out of the mental images they have developed but also are the method by which people accommodate themselves to the circumstances of their lives. For at the heart of modernity is the individual’s moral responsibility to discover his or her authentic inner consciousness and substantiate it in lived experience. 	Moreover, because capitalism requires expansion if it is not to implode under the weight of its own internal contradictions, so capitalist modernity compulsively expands out from its centre in the West. In so doing, it becomes both a globalising and a totalitarian phenomenon. Globalising {{in the sense that it}} ceaselessly and ineluctably extends into previously untouched areas of the world and totalitarian in the sense that as it enters into and interacts with ever deeper and wider realms of the human consciousness it becomes a seductive and beguiling yet enforced and problematic liberation from traditionalism. Like a giant <b>seismic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>wave</b> it colonises and envelops the future as well as the present and the past in its steady irresistible advance across and around the earth. Yet, just as the advancing wave, by dint of the underwater terrain it encounters, must possess within it cross- and counter-currents, so modernity, as it spreads out from its epicentre, contains the capacity to mutate according to the character of the domains it confronts. Consequently, through the process of the globalisation of capitalism, modernity becomes not a singular phenomenon but evolves to develop and exhibit a variety of forms according to the circumstances of its initial appearance and subsequent development in any particular region of the world. 	Nevertheless, an epiphenomenon of the globalising tendency of capitalist modernity is that of the collision and convergence of different versions of the modern. Specifically, the inherently compulsive expansion of capitalism eventually and inevitably leads to the collision and perhaps even convergence of different versions of itself. Accordingly, the ongoing transformative process of the destruction, reconstruction, and mutation of ever more complex versions may also have within it the capacity for capitalism to evolve itself into a singular global phenomenon. Thus, with capitalism as its engine, is it not possible that different versions of modernity might also collide and converge to form a globalised singularity...|$|E
