By application of P11-4 on the tooth surface, the peptide diffuse through the intact hypomineralized plate into the early caries lesion body and start, due to the low pH in such a lesion, to self-assemble generating a peptide scaffold mimicking the enamel matrix. Around the newly formed matrix de-novo enamel-crystals are formed from calcium phosphate present in saliva. Through the remineralization caries activity is significantly reduced in comparison with a fluoride treatment alone. In aqueous oral care gels the peptide is present as matrix.

The <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> <b>properties</b> of these binary conjugates result in different degrees of AIEE and then achieve the formations of FONs (fluorescent organic nanoparticles), which present efficient FRET and singlet oxygen generations. Biologically, FONs-photosensitizers from these compounds were much more phototoxicities to cancer cell than to normal cell without significant dark toxicity. In addition, their intracellular fluorescent colors switching upon photo-excitation are expected to be used for further cell death biomarker applications. This improved photodynamic activity might be due to the aggregation of compounds in the cell that form FONs which can promote PDT (photodynamic therapy) and are observed in cancer cell but not normal cell.

Highly ordered thin films, of the benzyl terminated Pc, (2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24 -octa(2 -benzyloxyethoxy) phthalocyaninato) copper, CuPc(OC₂OBz) ₈ and its di-hydrogen analogue were prepared and characterized. These materials form ordered Langmuir films composed of close packed columnar assemblies. Full compression of these materials produces thin films of stable bilayers that show remarkable mechanical stability, and can be transferred with high efficiency to substrates using a horizontal transfer protocol.

40|$|Introduction General {{concepts}} {{involved in}} {{the scope of this}} PhD Thesis are briefly presented. Part I: Bioinspired iron oxide mineralization Using single amino acids may be thought an over-simplification of larger proteins or peptides. However, their use as model system already enables the understanding of some crystalline phase selection processes. Some general rules about iron oxide biomineralization in the presence of amino acids and thus, as an extension, in the presence of proteins are drawn out of this study. Part II: Small <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> peptides and the transcription of their chiral information into inorganic materials Small <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> peptides can be tuned to <b>self</b> <b>assemble</b> in organogels. The 3 D organogel self-organization scheme can be transcribed into inorganic materials using processes involving metal alkoxide (sol-gel) technologies. The peptide synthesis and the selfassembling motives, material synthesis (silica and anatase based materials) and characterization are described in this part. Part III: Using organogels to synthetize nanoparticles and to orient them on a peptide fiber Organogels prepared from two chemically and structurally similar peptides can be mixed to prepare a homogenous 3 D network which will present on its surface complexing properties depending on the structure of the peptides chosen. This scaffold could be used to organize nanoparticles or to prepare silver-based nanostructures. Peptides involved, their <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> schemes, the structures created and rationalization of this approach will be presented in this part. Part IV: Using small <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> peptides to create new porous materials The preparation of metal-organic frameworks using a slightly modified version of the model peptide which was used througout the PhD Thesis is possible. We present here the synthesis and spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the materials obtained. Conclusions In this section the achievements realized during the PhD will be discussed. Some new tracks to further exploit these systems will also be introduced...|$|R

40|$|Self-Assembling {{is based}} on a {{spontaneous}} process in which organic molecules (alkanethiols, silanes) are adsorbed on a substrate (gold, glass, silicon). Although the implementation is extremely easy, it shows a big disadvantage in timing, because the solution has to be in contact overnight with the substrate under mild shaking. An alternative method of molecular deposition is the Electrochemically Deposed Multilayers commonly used in our laboratory for further immobilization of biological molecules in order to obtain specific biosensors for several analytes. It consists in applying a constant potential on gold working electrode (1. 3 V vs. Ag/AgCl) for driving molecules in proximity of the electrode and allow them to react on the surface and form a layer similar to <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> ones.

40|$|Brief fabricational and {{applications}} surveys on semiconductor quantum dots {{and the subsequent}} motivation for further development of theoretical modeling are presented. In order to study the electronic structure of quantum dots, k • p models are introduced. Both the 8 band k • p model and the effective mass model were used in order to study electronic structure of quantum rods. Existence of bound state in continuum in quantum rods is demonstrated. The vibrational structure and electron–phonon interaction in semiconductor quantum dots was studied via bulk models for <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> quantum dots and continuum models for colloidal quantum dots. The concept of polarons due to very strong electron–longitudinal optical phonon interaction was demonstrated for single <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> quantum dot and for supercrystal of colloidal quantum dots. Lattice anharmonicity is also considered as a main mechanism enabling the non-radiative relaxation process of the polarons in <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> quantum dots. Optical properties of such 3 D confinement structures are modeled using dipole Hamiltonian approximation and properly incorporated into k•p model formalism {{within the framework of}} linear response theory. Radiative and non-radiative lifetimes in <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> quantum dots were studied and correlation between them was established. Transport properties of colloidal quantum dot supercrystals were also studied within the framework of linear response theory. Variational polaron theory is introduced in order to examine formation of polarons dependent on temperature, interdot coupling strength and strengths of electron–phonon interactions. It was found that small polaron formation occurs at room temperature for possible interdot couplings. It was also found that small polaron formation narrows the bands and localizes the carriers inside each dot in the supercrystal. Available experimental data on the issue were discussed by using the results of the model...|$|R

40|$|We report many {{different}} nano-structures which are formed when model nano-particles {{of different sizes}} (diameter σ n) are allowed to aggregate in a background matrix of semi-flexible <b>self</b> <b>assembled</b> polymeric worm like micellar chains. The different nano-structures are formed by the dynamical arrest of phase-separating mixtures of micellar monomers and nano-particles. The different mor- phologies obtained {{are the result of}} an interplay of the available free volume, the elastic energy of deformation of polymers, the density (chemical potential) of the nano-particles in the polymer ma- trix and, of course, the ratio of the size of <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> nano-particles and <b>self</b> avoidance diameter of polymeric chains. We have used a hybrid semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation scheme to obtain the (non-equilibrium) phase diagram of the self-assembled nano-structures.

We first summarize the structure of different oxide layers, and we discuss the role of geometric and electronic factors in the formation of ordered Au and Fe NP arrays on the selected systems.

40|$|Trichogin GA IV {{is a short}} lipopeptaibol {{antibiotic}} that {{is capable}} of enhancing the transport of small cations through the phospholipid double layer of the membrane. The antibiotic activity of the undecapeptide is thought to be based on either its <b>self</b> <b>assembling</b> or membrane-modifying <b>property.</b> The chemical equilibrium between self-aggregated and non-aggregated molecular states was studied by CW-ESR spectroscopy using solutions of TOAC nitroxide spin-labelled trichogin analogues in an apolar solvent to mimic the membrane bound state. At room temperature the two different sets of signals observed in the spectrum were attributed to the presence of both monomers and aggregates in the sample. The ESR spectra of the monomeric and aggregated forms were separated and the dependence of the fraction of monomeric peptide molecules on concentration was obtained over the range 5 x 10 (- 6) to 7 x 10 (- 4) m. A two-step aggregation mechanism is proposed: dimerization of peptide molecules followed by aggregation of dimers to assemblies of four peptide molecules per aggregate. The equilibrium constants were estimated for both steps. In addition, the lower lifetime limit was determined for dimers and tetramers. It is shown that when the peptide concentration exceeds 10 (- 5) m, the major part of the peptide molecules in solution has the form of tetrameric aggregates. Independently, the PELDOR technique was used to investigate the concentration dependence of the parameters of the dipole-dipole interaction between spin labels in frozen (77 K) glassy solutions of aggregates of mono-labelled TOAC analogues. The number of molecules in aggregates as well as the frequency and amplitude of PELDOR signal oscillations were found to be concentration independent in the range 5 x 10 (- 4) to 8 x 10 (- 3) M. In the frozen glassy solution state, the number of peptide molecules per aggregate was determined to be close to four, which is in agreement with the value obtained for spin-labelled trichogin at room temperature. The present data provide experimental evidence in favour of a self-assembling rather than a membrane-modifying ion conduction mechanism...|$|R
