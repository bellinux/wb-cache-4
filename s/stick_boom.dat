40|$|The {{construction}} industry, {{being one}} of the largest industrial sectors in Canada, has been continually searching for automated methods that can be adopted to monitor the productivity, consistency, quality and safety of its construction work. The automated recognition of construction operational resources (equipment, workers, materials etc.) has {{played a significant role in}} achieving the full automation in monitoring and control of the construction sites. Considering that construction equipment is one of the main operational resources in executing construction tasks, this research work is focused on automated recognition of such equipment from on-site images. In order to achieve this, it is first necessary to evaluate the construction equipment recognition performances of existing object recognition methods. The currently available object recognition datasets that are used to validate the existing recognition methods contain only limited categories of objects, where construction equipment are not included. As a result, it is unclear whether these methods could be used to recognize construction equipment from on-site images, especially considering that construction sites are typically dirty, disorderly, and cluttered. To fill this gap, this research work proposes to create a standardized dataset of construction equipment images that can be used to measure the construction equipment recognition performances of existing object recognition methods. Almost 2, 000 images have been collected and compiled to create the dataset, which covers 5 common classes of construction equipment (excavator, loader, tractor, compactor and backhoe loader). Each image has been annotated with information concerning the equipment class, identity, location, orientation, occlusion, and labeling of equipment components (bucket, <b>stick,</b> <b>boom</b> etc.). The effectiveness of the dataset has been tested on two common object recognition methods in computer vision. The recognition tests imply that the recognition methods can be adopted comprehensively for the recognition of construction equipment with the dataset developed in this research. The performances of these two methods are further compared on the basis of the recognition tests conducted in this work. The results show that the construction equipment recognition performance of existing object recognition methods can be evaluated with the dataset in a standard, unbiased, and extensive way...|$|E

5000|$|A walking {{excavator}} or popularly spider excavator is {{a special}} type of all-terrain excavator. Like the regular excavator it consists of a <b>boom,</b> <b>stick,</b> bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the [...] "house". However, the house sits atop {{a different type of}} undercarriage. The undercarriage consists of leg or arm-like extensions with or without wheels. All can move in increments hence the name walking excavator. This is different from an early 20th century dragline excavator where a set of feet plate are alternately lifted and lowered.|$|R

40|$|Excavators are {{intended}} for excavating rocks and soils. It consists of four link members: the bucket, the <b>stick,</b> the <b>boom</b> and the revolving super structure (upper carriage). The excavator mechanism must work reliably under unpredictable working conditions. Thus {{it is very much}} necessary for the designers to provide not only a equipment of maximum reliability but also of minimum weight and cost, keeping design safe under all loading conditions. The two important factors considered during designing an excavator arm are productivity and fuel consumption. Also the bucket volume is increased to compensate for the loss in production due to the reduction in digging force. Increased in bucket volume will also increase the amount material to be fed in the bucket. The present paper is review of various analysis done on components of excavator arm and there are various forces affects on components of excavator arm. This paper will be helpful for those who are working in the field of civil engineering...|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulic {{excavators}} {{are just}} beginning to be integrated using GPS technology and are typically indicate only. Excavators use GPS technology in conjunction with angle sensors integrated in the machine's <b>boom,</b> <b>stick,</b> and bucket. This allows the operator to see how deep they are digging by comparing the actual bucket location to the site design on the GPS display.In recent years, Komatsu has released excavators offering semi-automatic functions. With these functions, the machine will automatically raise the to maintain the predetermined design grade. These machines also offer an auto stop function, preventing the bucket and boom function from lower beyond the predetermined design grade. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ELceB420I ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} this design is to move the feed antenna and its {{supports}} {{out of the path}} of the incoming radio waves. In an ordinary front-fed dish antenna, the feed structure and its supports are located {{in the path of the}} incoming beam of radio waves, partially obstructing them, casting a [...] "shadow" [...] on the dish, reducing the radio power received. In technical terms this reduces the aperture efficiency of the antenna, reducing its gain. In the offset design, the feed is positioned outside the area of the beam, usually below it on a <b>boom</b> <b>sticking</b> out from the bottom edge of the dish. The beam axis of the antenna, the axis of the incoming or outgoing radio waves, is skewed at an angle to the plane of the dish mouth.|$|R
40|$|The {{task and}} design {{requirements}} for a vision system for manipulator position sensing in a telerobotic system are described. Model-based analysis-by-synthesis techniques offer generally applicable methods {{with the potential}} to meet the system's requirement for accurate, fast and reliable results. Edge-based chamfer matching allows efficient computation of a measure, E, of the local difference between the real image and a synthetic image generated from arm and camera models. Gradient descent techniques are used to minimise E by adjusting joint angles. The dependence of each link position on the position of the link preceding it allows the search to be broken down into lower dimensional problems. Intensive exploitation of geometric constraints on the possible position and orientation of manipulator components results in a correct and efficient solution to the problem. Experimental results demonstrate the use of the implemented prototype system to locate the <b>boom,</b> <b>stick</b> and bucket of an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. This thesis {{studies the}} concept of finite element method and its {{application}} to the Bucket attachment for excavator design. In fact, {{the purpose of this}} thesis was to find a new way for designing an excavator, which is more efficient from the economic and mechanical point of view. The present review provides brief information about the Bucket attachment for an excavator. The use of Hradox- 400 material instead of Steel ASAI C 2010 in the Bucket Attachment for the Excavator can increase the volumetric capacity of the bucket and make it lighter. As the present mechanism used in Bucket attachment for excavator is subjected to torsional and bending stresses, so it is necessary to design a new mechanism. The finite element method was used to find out the optimized design solution. SOLIDWORKS 2013 Software was used for CAD design. Finite Element Methodology was used to find out dynamic fatigue failure of excavator arm mechanism design using SIMWISE 4 D software for different material properties. Finite Element Methodology vi increased the productivity of Bucket attachment for excavator mechanism design, helped to conceptualize the product, reduced time required to design and analysis. The results of this thesis are stress; strain and displacement of the final geometry of the Hardox- 400 for arm and boom are lower than max stress and strain. In addition, the attach how can make the weight of the <b>stick</b> and <b>boom</b> lighter than steel. Although the costs of mechanical components made of Hardox- 400 are more expensive than those made of steel, {{the results of this study}} clearly reveal the benefit of the increased capacity of the excavator outweighs the initial cost problem in the end.

At NEST he supplies the other Autobots with weaponry, including a new cannon for Ironhide and introduces himself to Director Mearing. He is presumed killed when the Autobots' ship is destroyed, but survives along with the others. During the battle in Chicago, he supplies Sam, Epps, and their team with grapple gloves and <b>boom</b> <b>sticks</b> (which Sam later uses to kill Starscream), but is captured by Soundwave, Barricade, and several other Decepticons. Barricade and Soundwave decide to execute Que/Wheeljack, Bumblebee, and the three other captured Autobots and starts with him. He tries to talk to the Decepticons about not killing them, but a Decepticon protoform blasts him and Barricade finishes him off with a blast to the back which knocks his head off. His death is soon avenged when Bumblebee kills Soundwave, who ordered his death, and the Decepticon protoform, who was partially responsible for Que/Wheeljack's death, minutes later. Barricade is later damaged by several soldiers who coincidentally use boomsticks created by Que/Wheeljack to cripple him.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{some aspects}} of an ongoing research on a commercial compact excavator. The interest {{is focused on the}} analysis and modelling of the whole hydraulic circuit that, beside a load sensing variable displacement pump, features a stack of nine proportional directional control valves modules of which seven are of the load sensing type. Loads being sensed are the <b>boom</b> swing, <b>boom,</b> <b>stick</b> and bucket, right and left track motors and work tools; instead, the blade and the turret swing users do not contribute to the load sensing signal. Of specific interest are the peculiarities that were observed in the stack. In fact, to develop an accurate AMESim modelling, the stack was dismantled and all modules analysed and represented in a CAD environment as 3 D parts. The load sensing flow generation unit was replaced on the vehicle by another one whose analysis and modelling have been developed using available design and experimental data. Although both the Hydraulic Component Design library as well as the Planar Mechanical library were used extensively in the process of modelling the entire circuit, some simplifications became necessary and are detailed in the paper. As the modelling phase was developing, a number of field experiments on the vehicle were also performed: these served the purpose of providing reference data to the end of progressing with the validation phase of the AMESim model. Regarding predictive simulation results, these are appropriately consistent with gathered experimental outcomes. The AMESim model will be instrumental for upcoming analyses that foresee the substitution of the original stack with other load sensing post-compensated modules so to assess with reasonable confidence the effects on potential energy savings...|$|R
40|$|Though {{displacement}} controlled {{hydraulic systems}} {{have proven to}} be an efficient way to minimize the valve metering losses to valve controlled actuators, the pump requirement for each actuator makes the multi actuators system more expensive and need more space than the other. Other hydraulic systems with individual metering valves and low side pressure maintain line enable the regeneration mode, but only under assistive loads. Topography with Integrated Energy Recovery (TIER) system is used to control the swing, <b>boom,</b> <b>stick</b> and bucket motion of an excavator. The TIER system often has several operating modes available for completing tasks, and some modes involve multiple actuators supplied by a single pump. ^ The objective of this work is to evaluate and characterize a new control mode taking advantage of displacement control and individual metering control, where two actuators are supplied by a single pump. This operating mode is within the capabilities of the TIER system. It can also be generalized for other multi-actuator systems served by one pump, including more than two actuators. ^ In support of the control mode development, a hydraulic system simulation model was developed to predict and characterize the performance of the system. The system schematic is a subset of TIER, with one pump, two actuators and eight high speed electrically-actuated proportional valves. A two-level controller including supervisory mode selection and local controller was developed and applied to the hydraulic system model. The hybrid displacement control mode has been simulated using flow control and pressure control algorithms to test the stability of the controller. A loading cycle derived using experimental data from a 5 -ton compact excavator was used as input to the model. From the simulation study with the specific loading cycle, the proposed control mode can work in both assistive and resistive load conditions. The hybrid displacement control reduced fuel consumption for the loading cycle by 14. 8 % compared to the same loading cycle with individual metering control. ...|$|R
