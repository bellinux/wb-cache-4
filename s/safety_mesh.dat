40|$|SummaryThe high {{recurrence}} rate of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {{of up to}} 30 % after pelvic {{reconstructive surgery}} makes a more refined surgery imperative, {{as well as the}} need for either biological or synthetic prostheses as adjuvant treatment. Patients with recurrence risks may benefit from the adjuvant treatment: (1) to substitute for the lack of supportive tissue; (2) to reinforce inadequate tissue; (3) to induce new supportive tissue; and (4) to consolidate and complement the insufficient surgical techniques. However, some debatable issues in use of the prosthetics remain. The use of prosthetics enables the simultaneous repair of all vaginal defects of POP and concomitant anti-incontinence surgery to be faster, easier and more precise. Nevertheless, great care should be devoted to the actual and theoretical short- and long-term risks, many of which have not been fully elucidated. Despite the lack of various ideal characteristics, the type I monofilament, macroporous polypropylene, has been suggested to have the lowest incidence of infection and erosion among the nonabsorbable prostheses. There is good evidence to support the use of nonabsorbable synthetic mesh for abdominal sacrocolpopexy, while the use of prostheses for repairing isolated anterior and posterior compartment defects remains controversial. There have been no long-term studies with sufficient patient numbers to prove whether synthetic or biological prostheses are superior during vaginal surgery. Tension-free vaginal mesh techniques with procedural kits are being adopted increasingly, despite the paucity of data. Although short-term follow-up studies have shown tension-free vaginal mesh to be a safe and effective technique to correct POP, anatomic and functional results of long-term follow-up studies, however, have not yet confirmed the effectiveness and <b>safety.</b> <b>Mesh</b> erosion remains a concern, with variable rates according to different materials and approaches. Newly developed prostheses offer an alternative option to pelvic reconstructive surgery. However, some questions remain: (1) Should prostheses be considered for primary repairs, secondary repairs, or solely in patients with risk factors for recurrence? (2) Which prosthetic material is better: synthetic or biological ones; absorbable or nonabsorbable ones? (3) Do the benefits of prosthetics in pelvic reconstructive surgery outweigh the risks of complications? These questions are explored and reports in the literature reviewed.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{undertaken}} in four sample villages {{of the two}} sample districts in Jharkhand state, namely, Ranchi and Dumka to track the changes in rural poverty in eastern states of India. The data pertains to these two representative districts, one representing socioeconomically developed district (Ranchi) and other representing the socioeconomically backward district (Dumka). Primary data collected from four villages of Jharkhand i. e., two villages each from Ranchi and Dumka districts of Jharkhand state. A sample of 40 households from each village, making a total household sample of 160 was selected for detailed investigation in project entitled “Tracking Change in Rural Poverty in Households and Village Economies in South Asia”. Besides simple statistical tools, loreze curve are plotted. Gini Ratio is computed to measure income inequality among villages of Jharkhand. Diversification index is computed to have an idea about diversity of income sources. Linear regression model is adopted to identify the determinants of income. The study reveales Per capita income reflects the purchasing power and living standard of the people. The per capita income/annum in sample villages ranged from 6, 378 to 14, 871 which shows a difference of more than doubles (8, 493). There are various sources of income however; non-farm activity was prominent source of income among all villages (37. 19 % to 63. 67 %). More interestingly, Jajmani system is still prevalent {{in the state and}} accumulating a considerable income. This shows that income diversification is a long practiced strategy by many livelihoods in order to reduce risk of external shocks. State has great diversity of income. Livestock system {{is an integral part of}} livelihoods of rural poor however its contribution is negligible. Livestock sector could be revived through the technological intervention from research institutes, development departments and policy planners. Study shows that age, education, size of households, non-farming income, and adoption of high yielding varieties are the main determining factors who had a significant impact on households’ income. Gini ratio shows that highest inequality was found in Dumariya village (0. 43). The ranges of Gini ratio were 0. 33 - 0. 43. The highest inequality was observed among labour class (0. 55) followed by large (0. 50), medium (0. 37) and small (0. 34) category. Income inequality is higher across villages and households and education and income level emerged as important sources of inequality. The findings have important policy implications. At government point of view, there is dire need for generating more non-farm labour opportunities through public works. These opportunities could lead to the better infrastructure facilities and rural livelihoods in rural India. Providing labour opportunities outside the agricultural activities can serve manifold and can reduce the income inequalities among the rural poor. It can play an important role in poverty reduction intervention and will provide <b>safety</b> <b>mesh</b> for income shocks. It will assist in reducing unemployment and under-employment in rural area. Education is an instrument for change.

40|$|Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Environment, Safety, and Health (ES&H) Self-Assessment Program {{ensures that}} Integrated Safety Management (ISM) is {{implemented}} institutionally {{and by all}} divisions. The Self-Assessment Program, managed by the Office of Contract Assurance (OCA), provides for an internal evaluation of all ES&H programs and systems at LBNL. The functions of the program are to ensure that work is conducted safely, and with minimal negative impact to workers, the public, and the environment. The Self-Assessment Program is also the mechanism used to institute continuous improvements to the Laboratory's ES&H programs. The program is described in LBNL/PUB 5344, Environment, Safety, and Health Self-Assessment Program and is composed of four distinct assessments: the Division Self-Assessment, the Management of Environment, <b>Safety,</b> and Health (<b>MESH)</b> review, ES&H Technical Assurance, and the Appendix B Self-Assessment. The Division Self-Assessment uses the five core functions and seven guiding principles of ISM {{as the basis of}} evaluation. Metrics are created to measure performance in fulfilling ISM core functions and guiding principles, as well as promoting compliance with applicable regulations. The five core functions of ISM are as follows: (1) Define the Scope of Work; (2) Identify and Analyze Hazards; (3) Control the Hazards; (4) Perform the Work; and (5) Feedback and Improvement. The seven guiding principles of ISM are as follows: (1) Line Management Responsibility for ES&H; (2) Clear Roles and Responsibilities; (3) Competence Commensurate with Responsibilities; (4) Balanced Priorities; (5) Identification of ES&H Standards and Requirements; (6) Hazard Controls Tailored to the Work Performed; and (7) Operations Authorization. Performance indicators are developed by consensus with OCA, representatives from each division, and Environment, Health, and Safety (EH&S) Division program managers. Line management of each division performs the Division Self-Assessment annually. The primary focus of the review is workplace <b>safety.</b> The <b>MESH</b> review is an evaluation of division management of ES&H in its research and operations, focusing on implementation and effectiveness of the division's ISM plan. It is a peer review performed by members of the LBNL Safety Review Committee (SRC), with staff support from OCA. Each division receives a MESH review every two to four years, depending on the results of the previous review. The ES&H Technical Assurance Program (TAP) provides the framework for systematic reviews of ES&H programs and processes. The intent of ES&H Technical Assurance assessments is to provide assurance that ES&H programs and processes comply with their guiding regulations, are effective, and are properly implemented by LBNL divisions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Incarcerated hernias {{represent}} about 5 - 15  % of all operated hernias. Tension-free mesh is {{the preferred}} technique for elective surgery due to low recurrence rates. There is however currently no consensus {{on the use of}} mesh for the treatment of incarcerated hernias, especially in case of bowel resection. AIM: The aims of this study were (i) to report our current practice for the treatment of incarcerated hernias, (ii) to identify risk factors for postoperative complications, and (iii) to assess the <b>safety</b> of <b>mesh</b> placement in potentially infected surgical fields. METHODS: This retrospective study included 166 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for incarcerated hernia between January 2007 and January 2012 in two university hospitals. Demographics, surgical details, and short-term outcome were collected. Univariate analysis was employed to identify risk factors for overall, infectious, and major complications. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients (50. 6  %) presented inguinal hernias, 43 femoral (25. 9  %), 37 umbilical hernias (22. 3  %), and 2 mixed hernias (1. 2  %), respectively. Mesh was placed in 64 patients (38. 5  %), including 5 patients with concomitant bowel resection. Overall morbidity occurred in 56 patients (32. 7  %), and 8 patients (4. 8  %) developed surgical site infections (SSI). Univariate risk factors for overall complications were ASA grade 3 / 4 (P[*]=[*] 0. 03), diabetes (P[*]=[*] 0. 05), cardiopathy (P[*]=[*] 0. 001), aspirin use (P[*]=[*] 0. 023), and bowel resection (P[*]=[*] 0. 001) which was also the only identified risk factor for SSI (P[*]=[*] 0. 03). In multivariate analysis, only bowel incarceration was associated with a higher rate of major morbidity (OR[*]=[*] 14. 04; P[*]=[*] 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Morbidity after surgery for incarcerated hernia remains high and depends on comorbidities and surgical presentation.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{this review}} is to discuss the latest {{developments}} in the use of synthetic meshes for vaginal prolapse repair. RECENT FINDINGS: The literature addressing the use of meshes in vaginal reconstructive surgery is limited. Few studies show a sufficient high level of evidence. Early studies cannot demonstrate a clear advantage of meshes and vaginally placed meshes show a high erosion rate (> 10 %). Despite this, pelvic organ prolapse surgery with meshes is increasing. Recent publications report better results and lower erosion rates (0 - 6. 9 %) that approach those of laparoscopic or open sacrocolpopexy (3 - 5 %). Several recent studies suggest that transvaginal implantation of polypropylene mesh is an effective and safe technique for the correction of anterior prolapse. Synthetic meshes are used less frequently for posterior prolapse repair as traditional repair with native tissue yields good results. The recent results on synthetic meshes for total prolapse repair are encouraging. The improved mesh designs and prosthetic kits are important developments and might reduce the risk for complications. Mesh-related complications are manageable. SUMMARY: Recent publications suggest that synthetic meshes are promising for vaginal prolapse repair. Long-term controlled studies will have to confirm the effectiveness and <b>safety</b> of new <b>meshes</b> and will have to include more functional data on sexuality and quality of life, before transvaginal meshes can be accepted as routine surgery. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Prophylactic mesh {{augmented}} reinforcement during {{closure of}} abdominal wall incisions {{has been proposed}} in patients with increased risk for development of incisional hernias (IH). As part of the BioMesh consensus project, a systematic literature review has been performed to detect those studies where MAR was performed with a non-permanent absorbable mesh (biological or biosynthetic). Methods: A computerized search was performed within 12 databases (Embase, Medline, Web-of-Science, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL, Pubmed publisher, Lilacs, Scielo, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Google scholar) with appropriate search terms. Qualitative evaluation was performed using the MINORS score for cohort studies and the Jadad score for RCTs. Results: For midline laparotomy incisions and stoma reversal wounds, 2 RCTs, 2 case control studies and 2 case series were identified. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of mesh configuration (cross linked versus non cross linked), mesh position (intraperitoneal versus retromuscular versus onlay), surgical indication (gastric bypass versus aortic aneurysm), outcome results (effective versus non effective).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Large ventral {{hernia repair}} {{represents}} a major reconstructive surgical challenge, especially under contaminated conditions. Synthetic mesh is usually avoided {{in these circumstances}} because of fear of mesh infection, although evidence is outdated and does not regard new materials and techniques. The authors evaluated the <b>safety</b> of synthetic <b>mesh</b> in large contaminated ventral hernia repair. METHODS: All large ventral hernias repaired with the components separation technique and polypropylene mesh were included in analysis. Primary outcomes were wound and medical complications, {{with a focus on}} surgical-site infection and mesh removal. For risk analysis, patients were stratified by surgical wound class, Ventral Hernia Working Group grade, and modified Ventral Hernia Working Group grade. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients were included, {{with a mean age of}} 58. 6 years, mean body mass index of 26. 6 cm, and mean defect size of 235. 6 cm. Surgical-site infection and total wound complication rates were 16. 1 and 48. 9 percent, respectively. The surgical wound class distribution of surgical-site infections was as follows: clean, five of 56 (9. 1 percent); clean-contaminated, five of 34 (14. 7 percent); contaminated, three of 19 (15. 8 percent); and dirty/infected, nine of 28 (32. 1 percent). Seven meshes (5. 1 percent) needed removal, two after clean repairs, three after clean-contaminated repairs, and two after dirty/infected repairs. Surgical wound class (OR, 1. 77; 95 percent CI, 1. 20 to 2. 61) and Ventral Hernia Working Group grade (OR, 2. 31; 95 percent CI, 1. 24 to 4. 28) were predictors of surgical-site infection.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the use of}} nonlocal regularisation in a coupled consolidation problem of an excavated slope in a strain softening material. The considered boundary value problem allows for a thorough evaluation of the nonlocal regularisation approach, as it does not entail any kinematic restraint on the slip surface development. The examined nonlocal strain softening constitutive model requires the specification of one additional parameter, the defined length DL, which essentially modifies the rate of softening. In addition, the optional radius of influence parameter, RI, can be specified {{to reduce the number}} of local strains referenced in the nonlocal strain calculation and thus increase the efficiency of the analysis. The nonlocal strain softening constitutive model reduces significantly the mesh dependency of cut slope analyses for a range of mesh layouts and element sizes in comparison to the conventional local strain softening approach. The nonlocal analyses are not entirely mesh independent, but the predicted time to failure and horizontal displacement over time are much more consistent compared to analyses that employ the local strain softening constitutive model. Further investigation, computing the Factor of <b>Safety</b> of various <b>mesh</b> arrangements showed that for drained conditions the nonlocal regularisation eliminates the mesh dependence shown for the same analyses by the conventional local strain softening model. The impact of the two nonlocal parameters, DL and RI, on the numerical predictions is also parametrically examined. The parameter DL modifies the softening rate of the soil and therefore its selection should be based on simulating a realistic softening rate for the examined soil material. The RI parameter was found to reduce significantly the computational cost at the expense of affecting the development of the secondary slip surfaces. Overall though, the results and the critical slip surface were similar for all considered values of RI...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Concerns {{have been}} raised {{regarding}} the potential risk of mesh complications after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the risk of mesh and nonmesh morbidity after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy and to compare the <b>safety</b> of synthetic <b>meshes</b> with biological grafts. DESIGN: This was a retrospective review. SETTINGS: The study used data collated from prospective pelvic floor databases in 5 centers (3 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Australia, and 1 in Italy). PATIENTS: All of the patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral rectopexy over a 14 -year period (1999 - 2013) at these centers {{were included in the}} study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was mesh morbidity, classified as vaginal erosion, rectal erosion, rectovaginal fistula, or perineal erosion. Secondary outcomes were nonmesh morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 2203 patients underwent surgery; 1764 (80. 1 %) used synthetic mesh and 439 (19. 9 %) used biological grafts. There were 2 postoperative deaths (0. 1 %). Forty-five patients (2. 0 %) had mesh erosion, including 20 vaginal, 17 rectal, 7 rectovaginal fistula, and 1 perineal. Twenty-three patients (51. 1 %) required treatment for minor erosion morbidity (local excision of stitch/exposed mesh), and 18 patients (40. 0 %) were treated for major erosion morbidity (12 laparoscopic mesh removal, 3 mesh removal plus colostomy, and 3 anterior resection). Erosion occurred in 2. 4 % of synthetic meshes and 0. 7 % of biological meshes. The median time to erosion was 23 months. Nonmesh complications occurred in 11. 1 % of patients. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study including patients with minimal follow-up. The study was unable to determine whether patients will develop future erosions, currently have asymptomatic erosions, or have been treated in other institutions for erosions. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is a safe operation. Mesh erosion rates are 2 % and occasionally require resectional surgery that might be reduced by the use of biological graft. An international ventral mesh registry is recommended to monitor mesh problems and to assess whether type of mesh has any impact on functional outcomes or the need for revisional surgery for nonerosion problems...|$|R
40|$|More than {{a decade}} has passed since {{the passage of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. During that time the U. S. tuna purse seine neet reduced its {{incidental}} porpoise mortality rate more than 10 -fold. This was made possible through the development of gear and techniques aimed at reducing the frequency of many low probability events that contribute to the kill. Porpoise are killed by becoming entangled or entrapped in folds and canopies of the net and suffocating. The configuration of the net, both before and during the backdown release procedure, is a major determinant of the number of porpoise killed. Speedboats can be used to tow on the corkllne to prevent net collapse and also to adjust the net configuration to reduce net canopies prior to backdown. Deepening a net can reduce the probability of porpoise being killed by prebackdown net collapse. The effects of environmental conditions and mechanical failures on net configuration can result in high porpoise mortality unless mitigated by skilled vessel maneuvers or prevented by the timely use of speedboats to adjust the net. The backdown procedure is the only means to effectively release captured porpoise from a purse seine. It is also the time during the set when most of the mortality occurs. The use of small <b>mesh</b> <b>safety</b> panels and aprons in the backdown areas of nets reduces porpoise entanglement, and Increases the probability of an effective release. The tie-down points on the net for preparing the backdown channel must be properly located in order to optimize porpoise release. A formula uses the stretched depth of the net to calculate one of these points, making it a simple matter to locate the other. Understanding the dynamics of the backdown procedure permits a thorough troubleshooting of performance, thus preventing the repetition of poorly executed backdowns and thereby reducing mortality. Porpoise that cannot be released must be rescued by hand. A rescuer in a rigidly inflated raft can rescue porpoise effectively at any time during a net set. Hand rescue can make the difference between above average kill and zero kill sets. In all circumstances, the skill and motivation of the captain and his crew are the final determinants in the prevention of incidental porpoise mortality in tuna seining.
