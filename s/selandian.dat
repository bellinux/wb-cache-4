40|$|With {{evidence}} from planktonic foraminifera, it is {{shown that the}} Lower <b>Selandian</b> (which overlies the Danien in the type area) belongs to the Globorotalia angulata biozone. Since ROSENKRANTZ (1924) proposed the preliminary stage name <b>Selandian</b> for the glauconitic marls and clays deposited upon the Upper Danian lime-stones and overlain by the Ypresian ash layers, much doubt has existed as to the stratigraphical age of the deposits. The lithology of the <b>Selandian</b> sediments was described in detail by GRY (1935). The lithological development of the <b>Selandian</b> sediments starts with a basal conglomerate containing {{a large amount of}} redeposited Upper Danian fossils.

40|$|The global stratotype {{sections}} and {{points for the}} bases of the <b>Selandian</b> (Middle Paleocene) and Thanetian (Upper Paleocene) stages have been defined in the coastal cliff along the Itzurun Beach at the town of Zumaia in the Basque Country, northern Spain. In the hemipelagic section exposed at Zumaia {{the base of the}} <b>Selandian</b> Stage has been placed {{at the base of the}} Itzurun Formation, ca. 49 m above the Cretaceous/ Paleogene boundary. At the base of the <b>Selandian,</b> marls replace the succession of Danian red limestone and limestone-marl couplets. The best marine, global correlation criterion for the basal <b>Selandian</b> is the second radiation of the important calcareous nannofossil group, the fasciculiths. Species such as Fasciculithus ulii, F. billii, F. janii, F. involutus, F. pileatus and F. tympaniformis have their first appearance in the interval from a few decimetres below up to 1. 1 m above the base of the <b>Selandian.</b> The marker species for nannofossil Zone NP 5, F. tympaniformis, first occurs 1. 1 m above the base. Excellent cyclostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy in the section creates further correlation potential, with the base of the <b>Selandian</b> occuring 30 precession cycles (630 kyr) above the top of magnetochron C 27 n. Profound changes in sedimentology related to a major sea-level fall characterize the Danian-Selandian transition in sections along the margins of the North Atlantic. The base of the Thanetian Stage is placed in the same section ca. 78 m above the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. It is defined at a level 2. 8 m or eight precession cycles above the base of the core of the distinct clay-rich interval associated with the Mid-Paleocene Biotic Event, and it corresponds to the base of magnetochron C 26 n in the section. The base of the Thanetian is not associated with any significant change in marine micro-fauna or flora. The calcareous nannofossil Zone NP 6, marked by the first occurrence of Heliolithus kleinpelli starts ca. 6. 5 m below the base of the Thanetian.

40|$|Evidence from clinoptilolite-replaced foraminifera {{shows that}} the Upper <b>Selandian</b> non-calcareous greensand must belong strati-graphically to the Paleocene. The {{presence}} of clinoptilolite-replaced foraminifera indicates that the low CaC 03 content at least par-tially is caused by diagenetic changes in connection with pre-cipitation of the clinoptilolite. The source of the solutions allowing clinoptilolite to precipitate is unknown but may be connected with early Tertiary volcanism. The formation of the clinoptilolite is autigenic. Only a few authors have so far published information concerning the Upper <b>Selandian</b> non-calcareous deposits.

40|$|International audienceWell {{exposed and}} stratigraphically well {{constrained}} by numerous studies, the Zumaia section {{is one of}} the best places to conduct studies on the Palaeocene in basin facies. Thus, this section has been chosen [Schmitz et al., 2011] as a stratotype of <b>Selandian</b> basal and terminal limits (GSSP: Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point). The sediments consist of carbonate hemipelagites interbedded with fine carbonate (Maastrichtian to <b>Selandian)</b> and siliciclastic (Thanetian to Eocene) turbidites. The purpose of this work is to geochemically characterize the <b>Selandian</b> by trace element contents (strontium and manganese) and to try to assess the chemical composition of seawater during the Paleocene. Analysis of various separated granulometric fine fractions show that hemipelagic sediments from the Zumaia section present a high preservation quality of the original records of trace-element contents. Late burial diagenesis plays only a minor role and geochemical breaks are not reducible to a change in the nature of carbonate producers. The strontium contents of Paleocene sediments require that the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater was lower than that in the present ocean. The <b>Selandian</b> is characterized by a positive excursion of the strontium curve. This accident is also recognized in several worldwide sections and is related to the platform/basin carbonate sedimentation budget and the intensity of oceanic hydrothermalism. The Mn content of hemipelagites is very high and can reach 2500 – 3000 ppm in the Paleocene. A comparison of analyses by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that both Mn 2 + (in the calcite lattice) and Mn 4 + (as oxide micro nodules) coexist. The Mn content fluctuations are related to the opening phases of the North Atlantic during the Paleocene by submarine volcanism and hydrothermalism in the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) ...|$|E
40|$|The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for {{the base}} of the <b>Selandian</b> Stage is defined in the Zumaia section (Spain) at an abrupt change in {{lithology}} (base of Itzurun Formation), which coincides with the onset of a negative carbonate carbon isotope shift. However, this lithological change is not always very well expressed in other sections. In order to document the stratigraphic position of the Danian/Selandian boundary (DSB) on a more global scale, we have investigated three sections across the DSB, the Zumaia reference section (GSSP), the Loubieng section (auxiliary DSB reference section, France) and the Sidi Nasseur section (Tunisia). The Danian/Selandian boundary interval is subdivided and correlated throughout low latitudes, from the Altlantic Bay of Biscay to the Southern Tethys, on the basis of seven calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminiferal events (E-events). The base of the <b>Selandian</b> is proved to coincide {{with the end of the}} Braarudosphaera acme, which correlates with the lowest consistent occurrence (LCsO) of Lithoptychius aff. bitectus (=Fasciculithus janii sensu Steurbaut and Sztrákos, 2008) (event E 4), but which is slightly posterior to the second radiation of the fasciculiths, up to now considered to represent the primary correlation tool of the DSB. A short-term δ 13 Corg negative excursion, associated with an increase in pCO 2 is recorded at the very base of the <b>Selandian.</b> It is interpreted as a short period of global warming (hyperthermal), the duration of which is estimated at ~ 30 kyr. It is followed in all the three studied sections by a long-term decoupled carbon isotope event, marked by increasing δ 13 Corg and decreasing δ 13 Ccarb values. It may reflect a period of climatic cooling of a few 100 kyr, interpreted as a possible precursor of the global cooling event, marking the late Paleocene in the North Atlantic realm. The integration of the biostratigraphic and the isotope data indicates major differences in sedimentation rates during the early <b>Selandian</b> in the studied sections, but there is no evidence of substantial breaks in sedimentation in any of the sections during this interval. The lithological shift at {{the base of}} the <b>Selandian</b> points to an abrupt palaeoenvironmental reorganisation, although our integrated bio-chemostratigraphical investigation does not allow for estimating its duration nor the presence of a hiatus at that time. status: publishe...|$|E

The boundary is constrained within a 7 -m-thick interval, between the last occurrence of Maastrichtian larger benthic foraminifers and the Wrst occurrence of Danian benthic foraminifers. Although this interval is intensively dolomitized, {{there is no}} sedimentological evidence of a major hiatus at the K/P boundary.

40|$|Danian and <b>Selandian</b> {{successions}} {{in western}} Siberia {{are rich in}} calcareous benthic foraminifers. The assemblages with a constant systematic composition that have the widest lateral occurrence are distinguished as foraminiferal zones. The Brotzenella praeacuta Zone {{was established in the}} low-carbonate, clayey beds that form the transition from the Gankinskaya Suite to the Talitskaya Suite. These transitional beds are assigned to the Danian. The calcareous benthic foraminifers in this zone occur mainly together with agglutinated forms. The zone is traced along the areas of the largest subsidence of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic basin, principally in depressions. The transition from the Cretaceous to the Palaeogene is represented by a continuous succession, in which the Danian deposits escaped from erosion and were found to contain the B. praeacuta assemblage. In Danian rocks with a shallow-marine facies (near Beryozovo and in the Ust’-Tym depression, Fig. 1), the Bathysiphon nodosarieformis – Glomospira charoides assemblage occurs. It is dominated by primitive forms in addition to more advanced tests (mainly Late Maastrichtian relic species). The overlying <b>Selandian</b> (Middle Palaeocene) foraminiferal assemblages are assigned to the Talitskaya Suite. The Ammoscalaria friabilis assemblage is widely spread and is represented mainly by agglutinated quartz-siliceous forms.
