5|$|Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective is a {{scholarly}} {{history of the}} Three Mile Island accident, written by J. Samuel Walker and published in 2004. Walker is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's historian and his book is the first detailed historical analysis <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late June 2007, reports {{circulated}} {{that the}} park was testing the new Gerstlauer trains. Eyewitnesses reported red and blue trains running on the track with test dummies in the seats. On July 4, 2007, Son of Beast reopened {{for the first time}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> the year before. Despite the lack of the vertical loop, the coaster continued to hold the record as tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
40|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> at <b>the</b> Three-Mile Island (TMI) and m Chernobyl {{nuclear power}} plants (NPPs), the safety of NPPs has become an even more {{important}} concern to both the nuclear power industry and the general public. The demand for safer plants has ever <b>since.</b> Responding to <b>the</b> demand, many scientists increased have investigated augmenting NPP safety in various ways. For m example, innovative reactor designs, better safety system R designs, human factor studies, stricter safety regulations, and so on, have been developed and implemented in <b>the</b> years <b>since</b> <b>the</b> above-mentioned <b>accidents...</b>|$|R

5|$|No {{aircraft}} {{has ever}} taken off from Værøy Airport after the accident, except in June 1992, when a Cessna 172 brought 3 skydivers from Bodø Skydiving Club (Bodø Fallskjermklubb) to the island, {{accompanied by a}} Piper Cherokee 140 from Bodø Flyklubb and an experimental plane. The Cessna made 2 landings and take-offs, and dropped the skydivers over the runway at approx. 8000 feet. The Piper and experimental craft made at least one landing and take-off each, during a public show held close to the airport. In 1992, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications decided to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b> In 1995, Værøy Heliport was opened further south on the island, and Helikopter Service was awarded the public service obligation to operate the route. The helicopter service sometimes uses the closed airport as a reserve airport during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Maria never {{approached}} any land areas while {{a tropical}} system, but tracked toward northern Europe after becoming an extratropical storm on September 10. The first land effects were felt in Iceland on September 12, where tropical storm-force winds were reported. The strongest winds {{were recorded in}} Vestmannaeyjar where sustained winds in excess of 67mph (107km/h) were reported {{as well as a}} minimum pressure of 979 mbar. The storm then brushed the northernmost part of Scotland, with no reported damage there either. The extratropical Maria merged with another system and this storm made landfall in Norway. This storm brought tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall to that country, and caused flooding and several mudslides, particularly around Bergen, the most important of which occurred in Hatlestad. One person was killed immediately, at least nine others were injured, and numerous homes were destroyed. Marine interests were also affected, as a large number of ferries were docked in the Baltic Sea. On September 18, a woman died of injuries. Her daughter died on February 7, 2006, after having been kept alive in a respirator <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport. The airport was immediately closed after the incident; no public flights have taken off from the Airport after Flight 839. Private flights still use the airport on occasion. The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided on 17 January 1992 to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b> This made Værøy Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time. Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights from Hanna Bakken-jorden on 1 January 1993. Construction of a new heliport started in 1996 and Værøy Heliport opened on 15 February 1997. The old airport was in 2000 bought by a private individual who has converted the terminal building into a private dwelling and uses the control tower for a small-scale chocolate factory.|$|E
5000|$|Managing {{director}} Bhanu Prakash Tayal {{shared that}} KRC {{was unable to}} engineer critical components like the [...] "swing arrestor" [...] and [...] "switching apparatus" [...] which could have potentially addressed the safety concerns that surrounded <b>the</b> project <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 2004 <b>accident.</b>|$|R

5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E

25|$|Students, {{players and}} staff wore ribbons {{with the number}} 4, and the coaches' {{initials}} in remembrance. Additionally, a memorial was set up inside Gallagher-Iba Arena bearing semblance to these ribbons in honor of Coach Budke and Coach Serna. Assistant coach Jim Littell was named interim head coach and team's following two games were canceled. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> the university expanded its rules prohibiting single-engine aircraft travel to include coaches, staff and pilots, while rules {{were put in place}} to ensure all flight aircraft would be reviewed by a consultant.|$|E
25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi NPS {{has several}} {{seawater}} piping trenches which were {{originally designed to}} house pipes and cables running from the Unit 24 turbine buildings to their seaside, which doesn't directly connect to the sea. Inside the trench, radioactive contaminated water has been accumulating <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident.</b> Due {{to the risk of}} soil or ocean contamination from these trenches, TEPCO has been trying to remove the accumulated water in the trenches by pumping it back into the turbine buildings, as well as backfilling the trenches to reduce or prevent further incursion of contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the crash of Flight 316, Greek {{authorities}} charged pilot Fritz Schmutz with manslaughter plus other charges. At a trial in 1983, Schmutz, along with co-pilot Deuringer, were found guilty of multiple charges including manslaughter with negligence, causing multiple bodily injury, and obstructing air traffic, and were sentenced to five and {{two and a half}} years in prison respectively. Schmutz and Deuringer were set free on bail while they appealed their sentences. A year after their sentencing, the court ruled Schmutz and Deuringer could substitute fines in place of jail time. Neither pilot had flown <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> but they were employed by Swissair.|$|E
50|$|The Hinton train {{collision}} was {{a railway}} accident that occurred on February 8, 1986. Twenty-three {{people were killed}} in a collision between a Canadian National Railway freight train and a Via Rail passenger train. It was the deadliest Canadian rail disaster <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Dugald <b>accident</b> of 1947 which killed thirty-one people, and would not be surpassed until the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster in 2013 which killed forty-seven. It was surmised that <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> was a result of the crew of the freight train becoming incapacitated, and the resulting investigations revealed serious flaws in CN's employee practices.|$|R
50|$|Ponni, {{the village}} chief's daughter, {{was going to}} marry. Before the marriage, the villagers {{including}} her father and Velusamy (Ranjith) met an <b>accident.</b> Most of <b>the</b> villagers died. <b>Since</b> this <b>accident,</b> <b>the</b> villagers began to hate Ponni.

50|$|The introspective main {{character}} of the series. He seems like the stereotypical character of a Ren-ai game, {{but he is also}} very intelligent and cynical at times. Ever <b>since</b> <b>the</b> traffic <b>accident,</b> which killed his parents and left him living on borrowed time, Ikuru is haunted by memories of his death and his body's self-destruction, which leaves him occasionally unable to eat and paralyzed in place.|$|R
25|$|When later {{interviewed for}} a {{television}} video program, Trotter stated {{that all of}} the components were rated to handle the combined weight of the participants, and, at the time, he thought the assembly was safe. Later studies showed that his design had failed {{to take into account the}} increased g-load caused by the pendulum action of the jump, exceeding the ratings on the components and leading to catastrophic failure of the structural integrity of the bungee cable. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident,</b> no other groups have attempted to perform a stunt jump from the bridge. This incident was broadcast on the television program Destroyed in Seconds, on March 2, 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} is {{confirmed}} where radiation levels in humans have exceeded limits <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> at the plant. One worker {{in his thirties}} received 678 mSv, while another one in his forties received 643 mSv. Before the accident the limit for emergency situations was 100 mSv, but it was raised {{by the government to}} 250 mSv just after the accident. The two TEPCO workers were on duty in the central control rooms of reactors Nos. 3 and 4 and told the health and labor ministry that they didn't remember whether they wore protective masks or not when a hydrogen explosion occurred at reactor No. 1 on 12 March.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2006, 21 {{people were}} injured at Liseberg when two roller coaster trains, on the rollercoaster Lisebergbanan, collided. The crash {{happened}} when the chain that pulls trains up the initial climb malfunctioned, causing a fully loaded train to roll backward into the loading platform, hitting another train that was unloading riders. Since {{only part of the}} train was on the lift, the anti-rollback mechanism had not fully engaged and broke. The steel roller coaster was built in 1987 and is one of Sweden's largest, reaching speeds up to 80km/h. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> the roller coaster has opened again, after a technical adjustment.|$|E
