50|$|In {{collaboration}} with Peter Wheeler she developed the Expensive Tissue Hypothesis, regarding early humans, {{according to which}} there is an inverse correlation between the increase in brain size during human evolution and the parallel reduction of the digestive tract {{as a result of}} richer protein animal foods. Another idea she posited, was that higher reproductive costs would be the effect of this increase in brain size, which was compensated by the females increasing in size faster than the males. She highlighted that terrestriality (movement of early hominids from forest to savannahs) is the oldest stage that led to human civilization. The second stage was bipedialism and the third is encephalization (evoking larger brains). Aiello identified social implications of meat eating; one of which is food sharing, which does not happen often in primates, which strengthens the bond between female and offspring. The other <b>societal</b> <b>implication</b> is that meat eating likely led to division of labor between males and females (males hunting, females caring for dependent young). Meat eating did not cause larger brains, but simply made them possible.|$|E

This paper builds on the findings of the thermal comfort field study carried out in air conditioned office buildings in Makati City (Manila), Philippines to investigate the applicability of the universal values of comfort temperatures recommended by international comfort standards.

With fixed resources, {{which is the}} assumption in Colonel Blotto games, we show for the common ratio form contest success function that the second mover is never deterred. This stands in contrast to Powell’s (Games and Economic Behavior 67 (2), 611 – 615) finding where the second mover can be deterred. With variable resources both players exert efforts in both sequential and simultaneous games, whereas fixed resources cause characteristics of all battlefields or rents to impact efforts for each battlefield. With variable resources only characteristics of a given battlefield impact efforts are to win that battlefield because of independence across battlefields. Fixed resources impact efforts and hence differences in unit effort costs are less important. In contrast, variable resources cause differences in unit effort costs to be important. The <b>societal</b> <b>implication</b> is that resource constrained opponents {{can be expected to}} engage in warfare, whereas an advantaged player with no resource constraints can prevent warfare...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} projection for ambulance {{demand is}} essential to enable better resource planning for the future that strives to either maintain current levels of services or reconsider future standards and expectations. More than 2 million cases of emergency room attendance in 2008 {{were obtained from the}} Hong Kong Hospital Authority to project the demand for its ambulance services in 2036. The projection of ambulance demand in 2036 was computed in consideration of changes in the age-gender structure between 2008 and 2036. The quadratic relation between average daily temperature and daily ambulance demand in 2036 was further explored by including and excluding age-gender demographic changes. Without accounting for changes in the age-gender structure, the 2036 ambulance demand for age groups of 65 and above were consistently underestimated (by 38 %- 65 %), whereas those of younger age groups were overestimated (by 6 %- 37 %). Moreover, changes in the 2008 to 2036 age-gender structure also shift upward and emphasize relationships between average daily temperature and daily ambulance demand {{at both ends of the}} quadratic U-shaped curve. Our study reveals a potential <b>societal</b> <b>implication</b> of ageing population on the demand for ambulance services. postprin...|$|E

RAPATAC In Gävle Level: Final {{assignment}} for Bachelor Degree in Business Administration Authors: Peiying Kuang and Zhonglv Song Supervisor: Dr. Maria Fregidou-Malama Examiner: Jonas Kågström  Date: 2013 May Aim: The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the factors that influence social enterprises to access funding. Method: This study has chosen a social enterprise as a single case study. We design the questions and collect the data based on five assessment factors from both the social enterprise and funders’ perspective. We use interview and questionnaires to investigate whether these five assessment factors influence funders’ decision.       Result and Conclusions: In our study, we found that five assessment factors could influence the funders’ decision. Social mission and the qualities of the leader are crucial factors influencing funding decisions. The performance of SE, financing sustainability and communication transparence influence social enterprise to maintain a long-term relationship with funders.   Suggestion for further studies: This investigation based on a single case study in Gavle, and we have collected data from a limited number of responders. Thus, we suggest using multiple case studies and collecting data from more responders. The further study should not be limited to one city. Contribution of the thesis: Our theoretical contribution is providing a model to complete theory. This model includes five factors which affecting funding of social enterprise. In managerial aspect, both current and potential social entrepreneurs can refer to these five assessment factors to improve their competence to attract funders. For the <b>societal</b> <b>implication,</b> this study shows the value and challenge of social enterprise to people and government, which enhance the public recognition of the social enterprise.
