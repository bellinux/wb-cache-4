Tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time. [...] Like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat or in the round.|$|E

It later moved to a former independent broadcast station (WGTW 48) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights (Early Saturday morning) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself, {{as well as the}} lack of FCC oversight at that late hour, many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings, along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos.|$|E
5000|$|The rifle had a <b>simple</b> <b>folding</b> {{backsight}} {{with the}} standard large lock mechanism (initially marked 'Tower' and 'G.R.' under a Crown; later ones after the battle of Waterloo had 'Enfield'), with a swan-neck cock as fitted to the 'Brown Bess.' Like the German Jäger rifles, it had a scrolled brass trigger guard to help ensure a firm grip and a raised cheek-piece on the left-hand side of the butt. The stocks were made of walnut and held the barrel with three flat captive wedges. The rifle also had a metal locking bar to accommodate a 24-inch sword bayonet, {{similar to that of}} the Jäger rifle. The Baker was 45 inches from muzzle to butt, 12 inches shorter than the Infantry Musket, and weighed almost nine pounds. Although Infantry Muskets were not issued with cleaning kits, the Baker rifle had a cleaning kit, greased linen patches and tools, stored in the 'butt-trap' or patchbox; the lid of this was brass, and hinged at the rear so it could be flipped up. It was needed because, without regular cleaning, gunpowder fouling built up in the rifling grooves, and the weapon became much slower to load and less accurate.|$|E
40|$|Fold {{maps are}} higher {{dimensional}} versions of Morse functions, which play {{important roles in}} the studies of smooth manifolds, and such general maps also have been fundamental tools in the studies of smooth manifolds by using generic maps. In this paper, we study <b>simple</b> <b>fold</b> maps, which are fold maps such that any connected component of the inverse image of each singular value includes at most one singular point. More precisely, we consider <b>simple</b> <b>fold</b> maps having <b>simple</b> structures locally or globally and show that the source manifolds are bounded by (PL) manifolds obtained by considering the structures of maps under appropriate conditions. Such studies are regarded as extensions of results obtained by Saeki, Suzuoka etc. by 2005, which state that closed manifolds admitting <b>simple</b> <b>fold</b> maps and more generally stable maps into manifolds of lower dimensions without boundaries inverse images of whose regular values are always disjoint unions of spheres are bounded by compact manifolds obtained by observing the given maps.

40|$|Arabia–Eurasia {{convergence}} {{is achieved}} in the NW Zagros {{by a combination of}} shortening on NW–SE-trending folds and thrusts, mainly in the <b>Simple</b> <b>Folded</b> Zone, and by right-lateral strike-slip on the NW–SE-trending Main Recent Fault. A balanced and restored cross-section across this part of the range indicates c. 49 km of shortening. This probably occurred since c. 5 Ma, providing an estimate of the long-term shortening rate across the <b>Simple</b> <b>Folded</b> Zone of c. 10 mm a- 1. The geometries of exposed structures suggest both basement thrusts and thin-skinned décollement levels, with major folds possibly nucleated above basement faults. Fold geometries indicate several décollement horizons; shale units are candidates, as well as evaporites in the Neogene, Mesozoic, Lower Palaeozoic and upper Proterozoic successions. The SE part of the <b>Simple</b> <b>Folded</b> Zone deforms by north–south shortening on broadly east–west-trending folds and thrusts. The link between these regions occurs via a set of fault blocks c. 400 km wide in total, each bounded by north–south right-lateral faults. Incremental changes in the strike of some of the folds occur across these right-lateral faults, with more east–west orientations to the east...|$|R

When employed in the infantry assault role, the HK21E stores its ammunition belt in a 100-round sheet metal container, fastened {{to the bottom of}} the feed mechanism (as in the HK21A1).

40|$|For a given mountain-valley {{pattern of}} {{equidistant}} creases {{on a long}} strip paper, there are many folded states consistent with the pattern. Among these folded states, we like to fold a paper so {{that the number of}} the paper layers between each pair of hinged paper segments is minimized. We first formalize this problem as optimization problem. The complexity of the problem is not known. In this paper, we give partial results related to the problem. First, we show that the problem is well-defined even in a <b>simple</b> <b>folding</b> model. The <b>simple</b> <b>folding</b> model is the most primitive model of basic origami models, and hence the folding availability is very restricted. We show a universality theorem of the <b>simple</b> <b>folding</b> model for this problem. That is, every flat folded state consistent with any given pattern can be folded by a sequence of simple foldings. Next, we investigate the number of folded states consistent with a given pattern. For a given random mountain-valley pattern, the expected number of folded states consistent with the pattern is exponential. ...|$|E
