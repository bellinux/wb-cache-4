The white form of A.phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.|$|E

5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. They took the portcullis down, but could not find boats to cross the Doubs, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not knowing that the battle had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do <b>so.</b> <b>Some</b> believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} have included attempts to breed them in captivity {{and to reduce}} fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when they fall off the nests and die of starvation, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them to join their wild siblings.|$|E

5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} <b>so.</b> <b>Some</b> birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and <b>so</b> <b>some</b> trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as possible.

Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and <b>so</b> <b>some</b> of their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over the course of several months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace. The exhibition coincided with the uprising's 80th anniversary.|$|E

5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E
5|$|The Orlando Magic first {{participated in}} the National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft on June 27, 1989, about five months before their inaugural NBA season. The NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds from 1989 onward. Before each draft, an NBA draft lottery determines the first round {{selection}} order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> years a team could have more than or less than two picks.|$|E
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E

5|$|The young hatch {{after a few}} weeks, and {{typically}} have only three pairs of legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually moult, adding further segments and legs as they do <b>so.</b> <b>Some</b> species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although some species continue to moult after adulthood. Furthermore, some species alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures regress during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet their}} protein {{requirements}} and obtain nitrogen, these lemurs also hunt small arthropods. In captivity, P.furcifer strongly favored preying mantises and moths {{of the family}} Sphingidae while ignoring grasshoppers, larva of the moth genus Coeloptera, and small reptiles. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the hands, a stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as galagos. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed on are high in protein, <b>so</b> <b>some</b> fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects.|$|E
