30|$|We find {{evidence}} <b>of</b> significant asymmetric <b>adjustment</b> for the 3 -month rates. In particular, we employ a Wald test with a null hypothesis {{for which the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> above τ {{is equal to the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> below τ.

Conversely, the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for the 3 -month lending rate is higher when monetary policy rate increases. More specifically, the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for positive deviations is 1.5 times the one for negative deviations in the case of deposit rates, suggesting that negative deviations are more persistent, whereas the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for negative deviations is two times the one for positive deviations in the case of lending rates, suggesting that positive deviations are more persistent.|$|R

We demonstrate that the transitional dynamics of the economy is characterized by two speeds of adjustment: a speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> arising from status-preference and a speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> arising from installation costs of investment. This structure implies that the current account balance depends on both speeds <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{as well as on the}} long-run equilibrium.

40|$|This {{research}} contains three essays that {{explore the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> volatility and {{noise in the}} Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The estimated speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the speed <b>of</b> price <b>adjustment</b> to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> provide consistent result <b>of</b> 30 minute <b>adjustment</b> period. Negative relation after 5 -minute return interval between speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price. In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The optimal frequency to estimate the efficient variance, on average, is nine minutes. The variance ratio of daily efficient variance to daily open-to-close reveals significant private information underlying price process in the Indonesia Stock Exchange...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Research {{has shown}} that {{individuals}} reporting a low level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, defined as having few possibilities to temporarily adjust work demands to illness, have {{a higher risk of}} sick leave. To what extent lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude influences the individual when making the decision to take sick leave is unknown. We hypothesize that ill individuals are more likely to take sick leave on days when they experience a lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude at work than on days with access to adjustment latitude. Methods: A case-crossover design was applied to 546 sick-leave spells, extracted from a cohort of 1 430 employees at six Swedish workplaces, with a 3 - 12 month follow-up of all new sick-leave spells. Exposure to lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the first sick-leave day was compared with exposure during several types of control periods sampled from the previous two months for the same individual. Results: Only 35 % of the respondents reported variations in access to adjustment latitude, and 19 % reported a constant lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude during the two weeks prior to the sick-leave spell. Among those that did report variation, the risk of sick leave was lower on days with lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, than on days with access (Odds Ratio 0. 36, 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 25 - 0. 52). Conclusions: This is the first study to show the influence <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the decision to take sick leave. Among those with variations in exposure, lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude was a deterrent of sick leave, which is contrary to the a priori hypothesis. These results indicate that adjustment latitude may not only capture long-lasting effects of a flexible working environment, but also temporary possibilities to adjust work to being absent. Further studies are needed to disentangle the causal mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on sick-leave...|$|R

40|$|When {{firms are}} faced with a demand shock, {{adjustment}} can take many forms. Firms can adjust physical capital, human capital, or both. The speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> may differ as well: costs <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> the type <b>of</b> shock, the legal and economic enviroment all matter. In this paper, we focus on firms that downsized between 1992 and 1997, but ultimately survive, and investigate how the human capital distribution within a firm influences the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> ceteris paribus. In other words, when do firms use mass layoffs instead of attrition to adjust the level of employment. We combine worker-level wage records and measures of human capital with firm-level characteristics of the production function, and use levels and changes in these variables to characterize the choice <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> method and speed. Firms are described/compared up to 9 years prior to death. We also consider how workers fare after leaving downsizing firms, and analyze if observed differences in post-separation outcomes of workers provide clues to the choice <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> speed. ...|$|R
