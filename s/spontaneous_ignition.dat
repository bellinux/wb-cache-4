However, these areas were undergoing profound climate variations, and the savannah we see today was not always the environment in which early hominins developed (NRC 2010). Perhaps, instead of the savannah driving human evolution, some of these savannah landscapes are in fact ancient evidence of hominin fire spreading practices going back millions of years.|$|R

40|$|Combustion can {{be defined}} as a fast {{oxidation}} process of a solid, gaseous or liquid fuel at elevated temperatures. In any combustion process, ignition plays an essential role. Not only to initiate the combustion process, but also to maintain it. Especially in solid fuel combustion on a grate, where fuel is abundantly available, the ignition of the fresh fuel determines the stability of the combustion process. To be able to control the combustion process properly, the understanding of the ignition processes of solid fuels is of great importance. The work described in this thesis gives more insight in the ignition behaviour of waste, biomass and solid fuels in general. Modelling and experimental work on piloted, <b>spontaneous</b> and <b>ignition</b> during continuous operation is presented. A conclusion from the work described in this thesis are that flashback of flammable gases in a waste layer is very unlikely to occur. It is also concluded that the combustion of solid char is the driving mechanism for the ignition front movement when the furnace radiation is low. A third conclusion is that when two dimensional effects are token into account, the ignition front is predicted to be twice as fast as when only one dimension is token into account. Finally, it is concluded that there exists a maximal primary air velocity beyond which no piloted ignition of the fuelbed can take place...|$|R

40|$|In missile {{propulsion}} technology it is conventional {{to employ}} solid rocket boosters. These boosters {{are loaded with}} solid propellants, which are energetic compositions where raw materials are comprised of solid particulates, such as fuel, and oxidizer particles, in which are dispersed and immobilized throughout a binder (polymeric) matrix. The processability of these compositions is not simple because {{it is difficult to}} incorporate a high percentage of solids in polymeric matrix. Its has been problematic to formulate a safe composition so as to prevent an accidental ignition of solid propellant or other device that uses energetic materials. Accidents and incidents with solid rocket motor, during production, handling and storage, without apparent causes, led to studies by independent groups [1, 2, 3, 4]. These studies generated important conclusions on the realm of solid rocket motor safety; furthermore, subsequent investigations suggest that <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>ignition</b> can be attributed to electrostatic discharge.

In this paper, the effect of additives such as formaldehyde (CH 2 O) for the control of ignition in natural-gas HCCI engines have been investigated by adopting a single-zone model in Chemkin Pro software. The chemical kinetic mechanism incorporated the GRI- 3. 0 mechanism that considers 53 species and 325 reactions. It was found that an additive-free mixture did not ignite for the intake temperature of 315 K. A mixture containing a small quantity of additives at the same temperature was ignited.

40|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> {{radiative}} <b>ignition</b> {{and transition}} to flame spread over thin cellulose fuel samples was studied aboard the USMP- 3 STS- 75 Space Shuttle mission, and in three test {{series in the}} 10 second Japan Microgravity Center (JAMIC). A focused beam from a tungsten/halogen lamp was used to ignite {{the center of the}} fuel sample while an external air flow was varied from 0 to 10 cm/s. Non-piloted radiative ignition of the paper was found to occur more easily in microgravity than in normal gravity. Ignition of the sample was achieved under all conditions studied (shuttle cabin air, 21 %- 50 % O 2 in JAMIC), with transition to flame spread occurring for all but the lowest oxygen and flow conditions. While radiative ignition in a quiescent atmosphere was achieved, the flame quickly extinguished in air. The ignition delay time was proportional to the gas-phase mixing time, which is estimated using the inverse flow rate. The ignition delay was a much stronger function of flow at lower oxygen concentrations. After ignition, the flame initially spread only upstream, in a fan-shaped pattern. The fan angle increased with increasing external flow and oxygen concentration from zero angle (tunneling flame spread) at the limiting 0. 5 cm/s external air flow, to 90 degrees (semicircular flame spread) for external flows at and above 5 cm/s, and higher oxygen concentrations. The fan angle was shown to be directly related to the limiting air flow velocity. Despite the convective heating from the upstream flame, the downstream flame was inhibited due to the 'oxygen shadow' of the upstream flame for the air flow conditions studied. Downstream flame spread rates in air, measured after upstream flame spread was complete and extinguished, were slower than upstream flame spread rates at the same flow. The quench regime for the transition to flame spread was skewed toward the downstream, due to the augmenting role of diffusion for opposed flow flame spread, versus the canceling effect of diffusion at very low cocurrent flows...|$|R

40|$|This review {{analyses}} and summarises the previous investigations on the oxidation of linseed {{oil and the}} self-heating of cotton and other materials impregnated with the oil. It discusses the composition and chemical structure of linseed oil, including its drying properties. The review describes several experimental methods {{used to test the}} propensity of the oil to induce <b>spontaneous</b> heating and <b>ignition</b> of lignocellulosic materials soaked with the oil. It covers the thermal ignition of the lignocellulosic substrates impregnated with the oil and it critically evaluates the analytical methods applied to investigate the oxidation reactions of linseed oil. Initiation of radical chains by singlet oxygen (1 Δ g), and their propagation underpin the mechanism of oxidation of linseed oil, leading to the self-heating and formation of volatile organic species and higher molecular weight compounds. The review also discusses the role of metal complexes of cobalt, iron and manganese in catalysing the oxidative drying of linseed oil, summarising some kinetic parameters such as the rate constants of the peroxidation reactions. With respect to fire safety, the classical theory of self-ignition does not account for radical and catalytic reactions and appears to offer limited insights into the autoignition of lignocellulosic materials soaked with linseed oil. New theoretical and numerical treatments of oxidation of such materials need to be developed. The self-ignition induced by linseed oil is predicated on the presence of both a metal catalyst and a lignocellulosic substrate, and the absence of any prior thermal treatment of the oil, which destroys both peroxy radicals and singlet O₂ sensitisers. An overview of peroxyl chemistry included in the article will be useful to those working in areas of fire science, paint drying, indoor air quality, biofuels and lipid oxidation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present PhD study is to determine risk indices to prevent and fight forest fires in the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) area Thrakomakedones (Athens, Greece), using analytical methods and lab-scale techniques, {{in connection with the}} topographic and meteorological data. The {{objective of}} the first work is to determine the forest species relative particle foliar combustibility, using thermal analysis (TG, DTG and SDTA) under oxygen atmosphere, calorimetry and a new lab-scale flame spread test. Based on the thermal-calorimetry analysis and flame spread test data, the examined forest species were ranked into categories. Thus, the most combustible fuel was Pinus halepensis and the least one was Cistus incanus. A method was developed to measure the relative particle ignitability (spontaneous and pilot) of forest species using thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) and limiting oxygen index (LOI) techniques. The relationships of <b>spontaneous</b> with pilot <b>ignition</b> and ignitability with other flammability parameters (i. e., combustion duration), were investigated. Based on the above ignitability measurements the examined forest species were ranked into categories. Thus, the most ignitable fuel was forest litter and the least one Pistacia lentiscus. Moreover, the particle and plant flammability of various forest species have been determined, using analytical and lab-scale tests. The analytical technique chosen was differential thermogravimetry (DTG), under air flow conditions, and the lab-scale ones were limiting oxygen index (LOI) and flame spread tests. Based on the above techniques, a method was developed for measuring all particle and plant flammability parameters: ignitability, combustibility, sustainability and consumability. Comparing the particle with the plant flammability we found that particles are more flammable than the leaves. However, the relative particle flammability is very close to the relative plant flammability. The main purpose of the last work is to evaluate and combine various thermochemical parameters deriving from lab scale, analytical scale fire tests and field data (i. e., calorific values, flame spread rate at different inclinations, flame intensity values, meteorological data, elementary chemical composition and heavy metal contents) for determining risk indices to prevent and fight forest fires in the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) area Thrakomakedones (Athens, Greece). Two indices were calculated: (a) Bioclimatic Flammability Index (BFI), based on meteorological data and calorific values and (b) Flammability Inclination Index (FII), based on flame spread rate values at different inclinations. The resulting indices can be very useful to estimate fire hazard and fight forest fires effectively...|$|R
40|$|As {{modernisation}} takes place, {{fossil fuel}} burning {{is one of}} the quickest ways to meet the ever rising energy demand. The increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, as a result of excessive fossil fuel burning had been blamed for global climate change. Vegetation-based biomass is a form of bioenergy and a recognised solid renewable fuel with potential to replace coal in combating anthropogenic climate change in the power generation sector. Nevertheless, it is not a straight forward case for biomass to replace coal since biomass is an extremely reactive fuel prone to self-heating leading to self-ignition. <b>Spontaneous</b> biomass <b>ignition</b> leading to disastrous fires during biomass handling and storage could be avoided if the causes of biomass low temperature ignition are well understood. Detailed studies on woody and herbaceous biomass fuels commonly used in UK power stations were examined according to several British Standards. On top of characterising all the biomass samples, BS EN 50281 - 2 - 1 and BS EN 15188 were adhered to specifically in investigating low temperature ignition during biomass handling and biomass storage respectively. Many power stations use a mix of different biomass in their fuel inventories which can lead to dusts of biomass mixtures. Thus the low temperature ignition characteristics of biomass blends have been studied. Other factors that may impact on ignition risks are binders (added to give strength to briquettes or pellets) and pretreatments (washing and torrefaction). Washing aims to improve ash properties towards the end of combustion process while torrefaction is used to increase the calorific value of biomass that is naturally lower than fossil fuels. The reaction kinetics of some biomass dust layers deposited on a constant temperature hot surface and corresponding ignition delay time were estimated mathematically. Results from minimum dust layer ignition temperature determination showed that all biomass, regardless of woody or herbaceous, with or without binder, before or after pre-treatments, had critically ignited within a very small temperature range. This was consistent with the results of self-ignition propensity risk ranking that concluded that biomass possess medium-high risk of self-igniting. An exception to this is torrefied biomass which had not sustained a much higher temperature before it critically ignited as compared with the untreated counterpart; unlike many anticipations and therefore, the low temperature ignition characteristics were discussed from many other aspects, mainly on the reduced particle size or dust layer density. For biomass storage, scaling up method and Frank-Kamenetskii method derived from Thermal Explosion Theory had been applied to forecast the critical ignition temperature and ignition delay time for large-scale industrial storage from smaller laboratory scale experiments. Non-negligible error was detected when extrapolating to industrial volume especially for the ignition delay time and appropriate recommendation was made as a possible remedy. Emissions when biomass smouldered and critically ignited that happened at 10 ˚C apart were examined with a three-stage emission sampling and compared, with the aims of obtaining a suitable biomass self-ignition indicator. Detailed studies were required since only one organic compound was detected to be consistently different between smouldering and critically-igniting biomass dust. Within this small temperature difference, different volatile species with respective intensities had been modelled with FG-BioMass software. Towards the end of this work, conclusions were drawn for each section and suggestion of combining both pre-treatments with binder addition were recommended for further studies. The work in the thesis provides a large data-set which will help inform power plant operators in their dust management risks. The laboratory-scale experiments give a useful risk-ranking for dust layer ignition, but uncertainties in ignition-delay times, especially for large biomass quantities, indicate that improvements are required to BS EN 15188 (biomass storage test) to enable scaling-up with more certainty...|$|R
