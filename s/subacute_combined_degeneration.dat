25|$|The {{specific}} myelin damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, or it will be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is <b>subacute</b> <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration</b> of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E
25|$|The main {{occupational}} risks {{posed by}} this acid are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, {{although there is}} a risk of subsequent pulmonary edema if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the respiratory tract are inconclusive as of 1997. Repeated occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists may increase the chance of lung cancer by up to 64 percent. In the United States, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1mg/m3: limits in other countries are similar. There have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to vitamin B12 deficiency with <b>subacute</b> <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration.</b> The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show demyelination, loss of axons and gliosis.|$|E

40|$|The author {{studies the}} {{significance}} of the accurate test of vibration sense for the diagnosis of some diseases of the nervous system. This work is divided into three main parts. First part - After reviewing the medical literature on the nature, pathways and physiopathology of the vibration sense, the author states the following conclusions : 1. Pallesthesia is an inespecific type of sensation. 2. The receptors for vibratory stimuli include both the superficial structures designed to record the cutaneous deformation, and the end-organs located in the muscles, ligaments, joints and periosteum. 3. On the light of more recent experimental work, carried on by neuro-physiologists and clinical neurologists, it becomes evident that the muscle spindles are the end-organs mostly concerned in the reception of vibratory stimuli. 4. These facts lead to the conclusion that vibration sense impulses run in the spinal cord by tactile and proprioceptive pathways. There are reasons to believe that lesions of the dorsal funiculi are more apt to interfere with the conduction of vibratory stimuli. 5. The dissociation between pallesthesia (lost or impaired) and joint sense (impaired or normal), frequently met with in several nervous diseases, must be ascribed to the fact that injury of nerve fibers lengthens the refractory period; the vibratory stimuli, which normally are transmitted almost in the limit of nerve fiber ability, are thus summed up and does not evoke the vibratory sensation any more. 6. The prevalence of kinesthesic over pallesthesic disturbances, which is said to occur in lesions of parietal lobes, {{can be explained by the}} discriminative character of the former type of sensation, as well as by a wider bilateral cortical representation of the vibration sense pathways. Second part - The analysis of variance of the vibratory perception thresholds measured with the "Bio-thesiometer" in 55 normal subjects lead the author to the following conclusions: 1. The vibration perception thresholds show wide variations according to the bodily area which is tested. 2. The variations of the vibration perception thresholds among subjects, although great, are lesser than the changes among bodily areas. 3. Among the bodily areas studied, the fingers and toes were the most sensitive to vibratory stimuli. 4. The vibration perception thresholds in the head are very high and are prone to great individual variations. 5. The least individual variations were shown by the bodily areas more sensitive to vibratory stimuli. 6. All these facts point to the selection of the fingers and toes as the bodily areas more suitable for the quantitative test of pallesthesia, with diagnostic purposes or to estimate the course of nervous diseases. 7. The variations of the vibration perception thresholds during regular time intervals (3 days) have not been significant in relation to the variations among bodily areas and subjects. 8. The average vibration perception thresholds of the left side of the body were lesser than those of the right side, although only in the great toes the difference was statistically significant. 9. It has been statistically proved that the method used in this work is a trustful procedure for the quantitative study of vibration sense. Third part - The study of 126 cases of nervous diseases due to lesions of various topographies, using the same quantitative method, allowed the following conclusions: 1. Vibration sense can be the only form of sensation impaired in several kinds of nervous diseases. 2. The quantitative test of pallesthesia has great semiotic significance since the increase of the vibration perception thresholds can be the only sign of damage of the sensory pathways. 3. Dissociation between pallesthesia and kinesthesia can be observed in several nervous diseases and as well in peripheral as in central lesions. 4. In cases of diabetic neuropathy the impairment of vibration sense is frequent and sometimes very conspicuous; it bears a close relation to the severeness of the whole neurologic picture. 5. In cases of herniated nucleus pulposus the test of vibration sense can cooperate in the diagnosis of the side of the protrusion. However, it must be emphasized that the changes in pallesthesia have not, in such cases, the semiotic significance which some authors have assigned to them. 6. In the <b>subacute</b> <b>combined</b> <b>degenerations</b> of the spinal cord, with constitutional or acquired achlorhydria, the test of vibration sense is imperative, owing to the early and marked impairment of this form of sensation. The quantitative method can disclose, in several cases, the existence of pallesthesic changes not shown by routine procedures, particularly those involving the upper limbs. 7. In poliradiculoneuritis the vibration sense is deeply impaired, even in the upper limbs, where other forms of sensation can be normal by routine examination. 8. In trigeminal nerve lesions the quantitative test of vibration sense is of little semiotic significance, owing to the great variability of the thresholds in the head and to the frequent confusion between vibration and auditory senses. In the four cases tested the increase of the thresholds was slight, even in two cases with associated facial palsy. 9. In cases of parietal lobe injuries, including two cases of hemisphe-rectomy, the impairment of vibration sense is remarkable and coincident or not with changes in the joint sense. 10. In other diseases of the nervous system, the quantitative test of vibration sense has proved worthful for the diagnosis, either as a positive or sometimes as a negative finding...|$|R

Sub acute <b>combined</b> cord <b>degeneration,</b> which is a rare cause of myelopathy is however the commonest neurological manifestation of vitamin B 12 deficiency. Case presentation: We present {{a case of a}} 66 year old Sinhalese Sri Lankan female, who is a strict vegetarian, pre-senting with one month’s history suggestive of Sub-acute <b>combined</b> cord <b>degeneration</b> in the absence of haema-tological manifestations of anaemia.

40|$|Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) {{deficiency}} associated neuropathy, originally called sub-acute <b>combined</b> <b>degeneration,</b> {{is particularly}} {{common in the}} elderly. The potential danger today is that with supplementation with folic acid of dietary staples such as flour, {{that the incidence of}} this disease could rise as folic acid, as opposed to natural folate (NsCH 3 HFGIu,), enters the cell and the metabolic cycle by a cobalamin independent pathway. This chapter briefly describes the clinical presentation of the disease, which unless treated will induce permanent CNS damage. The biochemical basis of the interrelationship between folate and cobalamin is the maintenance of two functions, nucleic acid synthesis and the methylation reactions. The latter is particularly important in the brain and relies especially on maintaining the concentration of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which, in turn, maintains the methylation reactions whose inhibition is con-sidered to cause cobalamin deficiency associated neuropathy. SAM mediated methylation reactions are inhibited by its product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). This occurs when cobalamin is deficient and, as a result, methionine synthase is inhibited causing a rise of both homocysteine and SAH. Other potential pathogenic processes related to the toxic effects of homocysteine are direct damage to the vascular endothelium and inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

Gaucher disease (GD) is characterized by dysfunctional lysosomal metabolism brought about by mutations in the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) : 606463; Enzyme Commission (EC) 3. 2. 1. 45, gene: GBA 1). In this study, we collected and examined available literature on the associations between GD, the second most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder in humans, and hampered vitamin B 12 metabolism.
