Twenty pre-presbyopic volunteers, aged between 24 and 30, were recruited. The ocular anterior segment of each subject was imaged using an extended <b>scan</b> <b>depth</b> OCT under non- and 3. 0 diopters (D) of accommodative demands on both horizontal and vertical meridians. All the images were analyzed to yield the following parameters: pupil diameter (PD), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior and posterior surface curvatures of the crystalline lens (ASC and PSC) and the lens thickness (LT). Two consecutive measurements were performed to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of this OCT. They were evaluated by calculating the within-subject standard deviation (SD), a paired t-test, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and the coefficient of repeatability/reproducibility (CoR). There {{were no significant differences}} between two consecutive measurements on either horizontal or vertical meridians under both two different accommodative statuses (P> 0. 05). The ICC for all parameters ranged from 0. 775 to 0. 998, except for the PSC (0. 550) on the horizontal meridian under the non-accommodative status. In addition, the CoR for most of the parameters were excellent (0. 004 % to 4. 89 %).

Mie report the features of a PAM incorporating a digital micromirror device, including the axial sectioning response to fluorescent thin films and the imaging of biological specimens. Three axial sectioning strategies were compared: line scans, dot lattice scans and pseudo-random sequence scans. The three strategies varied widely in light throughput, sectioning strength and robustness when used on real biological samples. The axial response to thin fluorescent films demonstrated a consistent decrease in the full width at half maximum (FWHM), accompanied by an increase in offset, as the unit cells defining the patterns grew smaller. Experimental axial response curves represent the sum of the response from a given point of illumination and cross-talk from neighbouring points, Cross-talk is minimized in the plane of best focus and when measured together with the single point response produces a decrease in FWHM, In patterns having constant throughput, there appears to be tradeoff between the FWHM and the size of the offset.

The results showed high accuracy of SD-OCT in measuring a bicurved test surface with a maximum height error of 17. 4 μm. The repeatability of in vivo measurement was also good. The standard deviations of the height measurement within a 14 -mm wide range were all less than 35 μm. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using extended depth SD-OCT to perform noninvasive evaluation of the ocular surface shape...|$|R
40|$|A dual-wavelength {{femtosecond}} laser pulse source and its application for digital holographic single-shot contouring are presented. The synthesized laser source combines sub-picosecond time scales {{with a wide}} reconstruction range. A center wavelength distance of the two separated pulses of only 15 nm with a high contrast was demonstrated by spectral shaping of the 50 nm broad seed spectrum centered at 800 nm. Owing to the resulting synthetic wavelength, the <b>scan</b> <b>depth</b> range without phase ambiguity is extended to the 100 -?m-range. Single-shot dual-wavelength imaging is achieved by using two CMOS cameras in a Twyman-Green interferometer, which is extended by a polarization encoding sequence to separate the holograms. The principle of the method is revealed, and experimental results concerning a single axis scanner mirror operating at a resonance frequency of 0. 5 kHz are presented. Within the synthetic wavelength, the phase difference information of the object was unambiguously retrieved and the 3 D-shape calculated. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that single-shot two-wavelength contouring on a sub-ps time scale is reported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for detecting interest points in 3 -D meshes and computing their corresponding descriptors. For that, we propose an intrinsic scale detection scheme per interest point and utilize it to derive two scale-in-variant local features for mesh models. First, we present the scale-invariant spin image local descriptor that is a scale-invariant formulation of the spin image descriptor. Second, we adapt the scale-invariant feature transform feature to mesh data by rep-resenting the vicinity of each interest point as a depth map and estimating its dominant angle using the principal component anal-ysis to achieve rotation invariance. The proposed features were experimentally shown to be robust to scale changes and partial mesh matching, and they were compared favorably with other local mesh features on the SHREC’ 10 and SHREC’ 11 testbeds. We applied the proposed local features to mesh retrieval using the bag-of-features approach and achieved state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy. Last, we applied the proposed local features to register models to <b>scanned</b> <b>depth</b> scenes and achieved high registration accuracy. I...|$|R
