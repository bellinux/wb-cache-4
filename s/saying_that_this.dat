5|$|On 7 October 2013, Miliband {{reshuffle}}d his Shadow Cabinet for {{the third}} time, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{would be the last}} reshuffle before the general election. In a move similar to his 2011 reshuffle, several MPs from the 2010 intake were promoted, while more long-serving MPs were moved. Tristram Hunt and Rachel Reeves received promotions, while Liam Byrne and Stephen Twigg were among those demoted.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The musicians at the {{sessions}} were recruited by Shambhu Das, who had assisted in Harrison's sitar tuition on his previous visit to Bombay, in 1966, and Vijay Dubey, {{the head of}} A for HMV Records in India. The line-up on the track was Aashish Khan (sarod), Mahapurush Misra (pakhavaj), Hanuman Jadev (shehnai), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri) and Rijram Desad (harmonium). In Lavezzoli's estimation, although these instruments are more commonly associated with the Hindustani discipline, the performers play them in a South Indian style, which adds to the Carnatic identity of the song. The recording features tabla tarang over the quiet, vocal interludes. Author Simon Leng refutes {{the presence of the}} oboe-like shehnai, however, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> part was played on an esraj, a bow-played string instrument. As with the Wonderwall selections recorded at HMV, Harrison directed the musicians but did not perform on the instrumental track.|$|E

5|$|Lucidi {{offered to}} let Edgardo's father {{accompany}} {{them to the}} inquisitor {{to discuss the matter}} with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was confidential. When the men begged him to at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.|$|E
5|$|The {{police were}} {{satisfied}} with the new story, and both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Georgian gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the Journal. They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target. The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. The police were quoted in The Atlanta Constitution <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.|$|E

But he mentions these are there because of recent defeats at Roman hands which had forced them over the river. (Tacitus, mentions that the Hermunduri were later welcomed on to the Roman border at the Danube.) In any case he says that the area near the Elbe itself is held by the Suebi.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s {{there were}} {{plans to start}} year-round traffic from the Hanko, the southernmost tip of the {{continental}} Finland, but even people in the Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority were doubtful about the project – the director's aide was quoted <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> close to the 60th parallel north winter traffic to Hanko would forever be a distant dream. Despite the opposition, a harbour and railway connection were built in 1872–73. Several domestic and foreign shipping companies attempted year-round traffic with varying commercial success, but the port of Hanko remained closed for several months nearly every year.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, Dirk Münch, Münch's son, {{publicly}} expressed {{his lack of}} comprehension of this interview. He explained {{that his father had}} been suffering from poor concentration for two years. He criticised the fact that Schindler's List had been watched directly before the interview, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would have been very exhausting due to the film's three-hour length and his father's advanced age. Dirk Münch stated that, after the film, his father had even confused the female house cat Minka with the male cat Peter. A German filmmaker who made a documentary about Münch also stated that he was non compos mentis. He was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

25|$|Operation Goodwood was {{launched}} {{at a time}} of great frustration in the higher command of the Allies, which contributed to the controversy surrounding the operation. The Allied bridgehead was about 20 percent of the planned size, which led to congestion and some fear of a stalemate. Allied commanders {{had not been able to}} exploit their potentially decisive advantages in mobility during June and early July 1944. Much of the controversy surrounding the objectives of the battle originates from the conflicting messages given by Montgomery. He talked up the objectives of Goodwood to the press on the first day, later <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was propaganda to encourage the Germans to keep powerful units at the east end of the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Premier Wen Jiabao {{delivered}} the working Government Report {{for the year}} 2006, and gave a policy outlook for 2007 during the opening session of the NPC {{on the morning of}} March 5, 2007. The speech lasted nearly two hours and fifteen minutes, and focused largely on populist issues such as health care and education, with an unprecedented tone addressing corruption, waste, and environmental concerns. As in previous years, urban-rural and regional disparities were a common theme. Wen opened <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the last year of the 10th National People's Congress, and thus the government's term will legally expire by March 2008. In his 2007 outlook he stressed various issues of general concern of late.|$|E
25|$|Görgei {{planned to}} attack {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} the Austrian troops on the Western Border of Hungary with the I., II., III. and parts of the VIII. corps, which were under the Central Operational Bureau's command, on the left Bank of the Danube, while the remainder of his troops had to protect the defensive line based on the Rába and Marcal rivers. Before the attack he hoped that the 12,000 soldiers led by Józef Bem, coming from the southern front and Transylvania, promised by Kossuth to arrive to join his forces (unfortunately Bem refused to come, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will leave Transylvania defenseless against the imminent Russian invasion). The Hungarian armies {{in the beginning of the}} Summer Campaign consisted of 150,000 soldiers, 464 field and 393 defensive (castle) cannons.|$|E

25|$|On August 24, 2010, the United Nations {{confirmed}} that rebels from the FDLR {{and from the}} Mai Mai militia raped and assaulted at least 154 civilians from July 30 to August 3, {{in the town of}} Luvungi in North Kivu province. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who had made protecting civilians and combating sexual violence central themes of his presidency, was reported to be outraged by the attack. Atul Khare, deputy head of the U.N.'s peacekeeping department, was dispatched to the region, and Margot Wallström, the organisation's special representative for sexual violence in conflict, was instructed to take charge of the U.N. response and follow up. The United Nations had withdrawn 1,700 peace keepers in recent months, responding to the Congolese government's demand to end the UN peacekeeping mission (recently renamed MONUSCO). Earlier Wallstrom was quoted as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> withdrawal would make the struggle against sexual violence in the region significantly more difficult.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} successes was the {{development}} in the 1970s of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, which is a processed extract of Artemisia annua, a herb traditionally used as a fever treatment. Researcher Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant. She says she was influenced by a traditional source <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> herb should be steeped in cold water, after initially finding high-temperature extraction unsatisfactory. The extracted substance, once subject to detoxification and purification processes, is a usable antimalarial drug – a 2012 review found that artemisinin-based remedies were the most effective drugs {{for the treatment of}} malaria. For her work on malaria, Tu received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Despite global efforts in combating malaria, it remains a large burden for the population. Although WHO recommends artemisinin-based remedies for treating uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance can no longer be ignored.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
