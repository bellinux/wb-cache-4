500|$|The book recounts how Erhard's {{childhood}} events, job {{positions and}} self-education {{lead to the}} development of the est training. Born Jack Rosenberg, Erhard was an inquisitive child who was close to his mother. In his student years, he read profusely and earned superior grades. As a teenager, Eerhard experienced both conflicts with his mother and a growing dissatisfaction with his life. Shortly after graduating from high school he married his girlfriend Pat Campbell, who had become pregnant. Instead of pursuing his plans for higher education, he took on a variety of jobs including meat-packing, heating and plumbing, estimating and selling cars. [...] By the age of 21, Erhard had become the top car salesman at the dealership he worked for. By the time he was 25, Erhard and his wife had four children and he was feeling increasingly restless and constrained. He formed a friendship with a woman named June Bryde, which gradually deepened into an affair. He secretly arranged a flight from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with June in 1960, leaving behind his wife and their four children, who would not hear from him for twelve years. The couple settled for a time in St Louis, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Werner Erhard with June changing hers to Ellen Erhard. After more work in car sales, Erhard joined the sales staff of Parents Magazine and was rapidly promoted to training manager and eventually appointed Vice-President in 1967. During this period Erhard moved frequently to different parts of the US as dictated by the demands of the job, finally settling in San Francisco. When Parents Magazine was sold to the Time-Life group, he was recruited by the Grolier Society as Divisional Manager. According to Grolier vice-president John Wirtz the intention of appointing Erhard was that he would bring “integrity, honesty and straightforwardness” to their <b>sales</b> <b>practices.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{emergence}} in September 2016 of the scandals involving unauthorized cross-selling {{and the creation}} of fake accounts, Wells Fargo in October 2016 became the largest bank ever to lose its accreditation with the Better Business Bureau and was also placed under investigation by the California attorney general for alleged criminal identity theft during the creation of millions of accounts without customer consent. Separately in October 2016, Wells Fargo settled upon a payout for a racketeering lawsuit alleging the overcharging {{of hundreds of thousands of}} homeowners by the bank for appraisals ordered after defaults on the customers' mortgage loans. In December 2016, following the scandal, the company amended its by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. A regulatory filing by Wells Fargo revealed in November 2016 that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its accounts <b>sales</b> <b>practices.</b> Also in November 2016, three U.S. senators alleged that Wells Fargo's sales scandal had extended from retail bankers to its brokerage employees, and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency placed new monitoring restrictions upon Wells Fargo's hiring of new executives, payments of [...] "golden parachutes" [...] to exiting managers, and branch openings and closures. In December 2016, Bloomberg News reported that regulators in California and New Jersey announced that Wells Fargo was under investigation to determine whether the bank signed up customers for Prudential Financial life insurance policies without their permission, and that Prudential announced it was suspending distribution of such policies through Wells Fargo.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 June, Henderson's {{announcement}} {{that all but}} four of the 24 properties at the development sold in October for record prices had been cancelled was met by uproar. Henderson said that [...] "there was nothing untransparent", and that failure to complete was [...] "very standard" [...] in the industry, and the buyers' initial deposits had been forfeited. The company said the properties would be remarketed. The government has pledged {{to follow up on}} the transactions. Current regulations in force are not codified, and are {{in the form of a}} voluntary code of conduct agreed with the Property Developers' Association. The revelations, as well as on-going complaints that property sales lacked transparency and allegations of the government's collusion with officials, are putting the government under increasing pressure to enact legislation governing property transactions and render property <b>sales</b> <b>practices</b> more transparent, at the risk of angering at the city's powerful developers. The only four flats to complete were on the 30th and 31st floors, and had sold for between only HK$37,800 and HK$40,900 a square foot–less than half of the 'record.

40|$|Preacquired account {{marketing}} is a <b>sales</b> <b>practice</b> that allows companies to charge consumers for services {{they do not}} know they ordered and do not use. The practice depends on a seller 2 ̆ 7 s ability to access a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s financial account without the consumer directly providing her account number and other access information to that seller. This flips the power dynamic in the solicitation process by shifting the burden to the consumer to stop the seller from accessing her account, rather than requiring the seller to ask the consumer for her account information before her account can be charged. This is possible because the seller has paid a financial institution, such as a bank, or another seller who retains consumer account numbers for the right to charge the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s account. Tens of millions of consumers have been affected by this <b>sales</b> <b>practice.</b> Many of these consumers have diminished mental capacity or struggle with the English language, making it more likely that they will not understand that they are being charged. This Article recommends that state legislatures or the United States Congress adopt the proposed Uniform Consumer Account Control Act, a total ban on preacquired account marketing. Prohibiting this form of {{marketing is}} conceptually less difficult than many other areas of consumer protection regulation because the regulatory costs in this situation are almost non-existent. A total ban forces sellers to actually reach an understanding with consumers. Experience has shown that lesser remedies, such as improved disclosures, are insufficient to control rampant consumer misunderstanding. They do not solve the fundamental problem of shifting control of account access from the consumer to the seller in a way that facilitates sorting of consumers into those unaware of account charges...|$|R

40|$|Value selling {{is often}} {{presented}} {{to be the}} most profitable and competitive <b>sales</b> <b>practice</b> in business markets. This paper argues that the relevant theory does not consider the consequences of introducing value selling for the relationship between the individual salesperson and buyer.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand how implementing value selling changes the salesperson-customer relationships. In a case study of two manufacturing firms and their implementation of value selling two changes have been identified. Firstly, value selling results in enhanced customer relationships, due to the salesperson’s improved understanding of the customer’s situation. Secondly, it leads to a stronger power position for the salesperson because of a decreased focus on prices and increased focus on value in the discussions with the customer...|$|R

Therefore because jellyfish has still not been officially defined by the European Legislation on Food Hygiene, we performed a survey on fifty-six jellyfish products sold on the Italian market. This was done by assessing label compliance with European law and with the new Chinese Food Safety Law of 2009. Our survey found many incongruences and shortfalls including the presence of a trade name referring to vegetables or a lack of an unequivocal specification of ingredients. Focus is therefore needed on the possible hazards associated with the consumption of jellyfish products.
