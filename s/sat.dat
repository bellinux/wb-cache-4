40|$|Self-administered {{treatments}} (<b>SATs)</b> {{are widely}} used {{by the general public}} and mental health profes-sionals. Previous reviews of the efficacy of <b>SATs</b> have included under this category interventions for nonclinical problems, group interventions, and interventions involving significant amounts of therapist contact. The efficacy of <b>SATs</b> for clinical levels of depression and anxiety with minimal therapeutic contact was examined by meta-analyzing 24 studies. The results show large effects for <b>SATs</b> when compared with no-treatment control groups (d 1. 00). However, unlike previous meta-analyses that found nonsignificant differences between <b>SATs</b> and therapist-administered treatments, in this sample <b>SATs</b> resulted in significantly poorer outcomes (d – 0. 31). Some differences in effect size were observed between the clinical targets of depression and anxiety. However, there were high correlations between clinical target, methodological quality of the study, and amount of contact. This makes it impossible to determine whether the observed differences could be explained {{by the nature of the}} disorders, methodological quality, or the amount of contact with a member of the research team. The implications of the findings for the clinical use of <b>SATs</b> and for future research are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|In 1936, <b>Sats</b> {{commissioned}} {{a work that}} was to change the history of performance for children. As {{the director of the}} Moscow Theater for Children, <b>Sats</b> wished to produce a play which would introduce children to the instruments of the orchestra. She commissioned Sergei Prokofiev to compose Peter and the Wolf and worked closely with him on its creation, contributing many ideas to the libretto. [...] Peter and the Wolf premiered at the Moscow Philharmonic on 2 May 1936. [...] Due to illness, <b>Sats</b> was not able to attend this premiere, which according to Prokofiev was not a success. However, three days later, <b>Sats</b> narrated Peter and the Wolf at its first performance in the Moscow Theater for Children. This second performance proved a huge success and effectively launched the work. Peter and the Wolf, dedicated to <b>Sats,</b> went on to international success. It has been recorded over 400 times, and translated into many languages. <b>Sats</b> continued to narrate performances of Peter and the Wolf through the rest of her career.|$|R

40|$|A primary {{feature of}} the preterm infant {{electroencephalogram}} {{is the presence of}} large infra-slow potentials containing rapid oscillations called slow activity transients (<b>SATs).</b> Such activity has not been described in animal models, and their generative mechanisms are unknown. Here we use direct-current and multisite extracellular, as well as whole-cell, recording in vivo to demonstrate the existence of regularly repeating <b>SATs</b> in the visual cortex of infant rats before eye opening. Present only in absence of anesthesia, <b>SATs</b> at postnatal day 10 – 11 were identifiable as a separate group of long-duration (� 10 s) events that consisted of large (� 1 mV) negative local-field potentials produced by the summation of multiple bursts of rapid oscillatory activity (15 – 30 Hz). <b>SATs</b> synchronized the vast majority of neuronal activity (87 %) in the visual cortex before eye opening. Enucleation eliminated <b>SATs,</b> and their duration, interevent interval, and sub-burst structure matched those of phase III retinal waves recorded in vitro. Retinal waves, however, lacked rapid oscillations, suggesting that they arise centrally. Multielectrode recordings showed that <b>SATs</b> spread horizontally in cortex and synchronize activity at coactive locales via the rapid oscillations. <b>SATs</b> were clearly different from ongoing cortical activity, which was observable as a separate class of short bursts from postnatal day 9. Together, our data suggest that, in vivo, early cortical activity is primarily determined by peripheral inputs—retinal waves in visual cortex—that provide excitatory input, and by thalamocortical circuitry, which transforms this input to beta oscillations. We propose that the synchronous oscillations of <b>SATs</b> participate in the formation of visual circuitry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{functionality}} of sense–antisense transcripts (<b>SATs),</b> although widespread {{throughout the}} mammalian genome, is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the <b>SATs</b> expression {{and its associated}} promoter DNA methylation status by surveying 12 tissues of mice to gain insights into the relationship between expression and DNA methylation of <b>SATs.</b> We have found that sense and antisense expression positively correlate in most tissues. However, in some <b>SATs</b> with tissue-specific expression, the expression level of a transcript from a CpG island-bearing promoter is low when the promoter DNA methylation is present. In these circumstances, the expression level of its opposite-strand transcript, especially when it is poly(A) -negative was coincidentally higher. These observations suggest that, albeit the general tendency of sense–antisense simultaneous expression, some antisense transcripts have coordinated expression with its counterpart sense gene promoter methylation. This cross-strand relationship is not a privilege of imprinted genes but seems to occur widely in <b>SATs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Speed–accuracy {{trade-offs}} (<b>SATs)</b> {{are thought}} to be a fundamental feature of biological information processing, yet most evidence of <b>SATs</b> comes from animals. Here, we examine <b>SATs</b> in the foraging decisions of an acellular, amoeboid organism: the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Slime moulds were given a simple discrimination task: selecting the highest-quality food item from a set of three options. We investigated the effect of two stressors, light exposure and hunger, on the speed and accuracy of decision-making. We also examined the effect of task difficulty. When given a difficult discrimination task, stressed individuals tend to make faster decisions than non-stressed individuals. This effect was reversed in plasmodia given easy discrimination tasks, where stressed individuals made slower decisions than non-stressed individuals. We found evidence of <b>SATs,</b> such that individuals who made fast decisions were more likely to make costly errors by selecting the worst possible food option. Our results suggest that <b>SATs</b> occur in a wider range of taxa than previously considered...|$|R
