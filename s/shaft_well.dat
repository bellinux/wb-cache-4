50|$|During {{the second}} phase (1879-84), the walls were {{constructed}} of smoothly dressed (ashlar) large marble and granite blocks (rectangular cuboids) laid down {{in an orderly manner}} (Flemish bond) with thick joints. Two-foot high marble surface stones, using an equal number of stretchers and headers, were backed by granite blocks from the 152-foot level (the first course above the rubble) to the 218-foot level, where marble headers become increasingly visible on the internal surface of the walls up to the 450-foot level, above which only marble stones are used. Between the 150- and 160-foot levels the inner walls rapidly slope outward, increasing the <b>shaft</b> <b>well</b> from 25 feet 1 inch square to 31 ft square with a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the walls and their weight. The second phase walls at the 160-foot level were 8 ft thick, which, combined with the larger <b>shaft</b> <b>well,</b> yields an outer dimension of 48 ft square at that level. The top of {{the second phase}} walls are 34 ft square and 1 ft thick. The second phase interior walls have rounded (2 ft radii) corners.

50|$|As {{a result}} of {{extensive}} surface and deep mining, Joplin is dotted with open-pit mines and mine shafts. Mining left many tailings piles (small hills of ground rock), which are considered unsightly locally. The open-pit mines pose hazards, but some find {{them to have a}} kind of beauty, as well. The main part of Joplin is nearly 75% undermined, with some mine <b>shafts</b> <b>well</b> over 100 ft (30 m) deep. These mine shafts have occasionally caved in, creating sinkholes. The mining history and geology are well documented in the mineral museum in town.|$|R

50|$|The Avispa is a twin-boom, pusher {{configuration}} low mid-wing monoplane. The wing has an Eppler profile, quite {{new in the}} 1970s, and {{is straight}} tapered with a swept leading edge and unswept trailing edge, resulting in 6.75° sweep at quarter chord. It is constructed from a sandwich of glass fibre and rigid foam and has 4.5° of dihedral. Fowler flaps, in two sections separated by the tail booms, fill the trailing edge out to the plain, untabbed ailerons. Accommodation and engine are in a central nacelle of glass reinforced plastic/honeycomb sandwich. Side-by-side seating is enclosed under a generous, three section canopy entered via upward, centreline hinged doors. A 115 hp (86 kW) flat four Lycoming O-235 piston engine, mounted {{in the rear of}} the nacelle with its output <b>shaft</b> <b>well</b> above the wing and booms and air-cooled via a semi-annular intake behind the cabin, drove a three-blade pusher propeller with a large spinner, designed to minimise noise.

40|$|Rotary kiln {{support roller}} and shaft are located under the kiln, {{which is in}} contact with the kiln ring. In recent years, it is {{estimated}} that many roller shaft failure occurs due to continuous loading condition that prevails in the industries due to inevitable facts. The shaft is affected by high stresses with respect to kiln load on the roller. A thorough insight over literature reports that it can be avoided by proper design and supportive remedial measures of the roller and <b>shaft</b> <b>well</b> before manufacturing. In the present study, the analyses of roller and shaft have been done using Finite Element Method. The loading position is varied according to kiln ring and the support roller for the actual working condition. The load calculations and analysis of the shaft are done by analytical and finite element method respectively. The results are compared between the existing and the new design by changing design metrics and material prospects...|$|E

50|$|One {{feature of}} Lemberg Castle is its shaft cistern, also, {{but not quite}} correctly, called the <b>well</b> <b>shaft.</b> After digging down 94.80 metres the well diggers had still not struck the ground water.

A spring on the hillside filled the shaft via the adit thus providing the required water supply. All the work was carried out with hammers and chisels.
