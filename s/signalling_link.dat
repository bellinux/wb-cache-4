5000|$|Paging Success by far is {{the most}} complex KPI to deal with as the process of paging touches almost all the nodes in GSM system and is {{influenced}} by performance of each of them. That’s the reason why this write up on paging looks too interwoven and cross refers to too many things. But the plus point with paging is by the time paging success rate in a network gets improved; almost all the other KPIs too stand improved. In response to an incoming call, the MSC initiates the paging process by broadcasting a [...] "paging request" [...] message on the paging sub channel (IMSI or TMSI of the MS and its Paging Group) and starts timer T3113. A [...] "paging message" [...] consists of the mobile identity (IMSI or TMSI) of the MS being paged and its [...] "paging group number". A Paging Request Message may include more than one MS identification. The maximum number of paged MS per message is 4 when using [...] "TMSI" [...] for identification of the MS (maximum number of paged MS per message is 2 when using IMSI). The BSC receives this page and processes the paging request and schedules it for transmission on the PCH at appropriate time. The MS on its part will analyse the paging messages (and immediate assignment messages) sent on the paging sub channel corresponding to its paging group. Upon receipt of a [...] "paging request" [...] message, MS will initiate within 0.7s an immediate assignment procedure. Upon receipt of a page at the MS, the MS responds by transmitting a channel request on the RACH. BSS {{in response to the}} received [...] "channel request", will process it and immediately assign the MS a SDCCH (immediate assignment / assignment reject; done over AGCH). MS Paging response- After receiving the immediate assignment command, MS switches to the assigned [...] "SDCCH" [...] and transmits a [...] "Paging Response". The establishment of the main <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> is then initiated with information field containing the [...] "PAGING RESPONSE" [...] message and the [...] "paging response" [...] is sent to the MSC. Upon receipt of the [...] "Paging Response" [...] MSC stops the timer T3113. If the timer T3113 expires and a [...] "Paging Response"message has not been received, the MSC may repeat the [...] "Paging Request" [...] message and start T3113 all over again. The number of successive paging attempt is a network dependent choice.|$|E

EZH 2 enhances cancer-cell invasiveness and regulates {{stem cell}} differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that EZH 2 can be phosphorylated at Thr 487 through activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK 1).

40|$|SummaryMany {{epidemiological}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that resting heart rate is a risk marker but also a risk factor in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure. In hypertensive subjects free from overt cardiac disease, the question has been less frequently addressed. A few cohort studies have shown that hypertensive patients with a high resting heart rate have an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death. However, intervention trials have not demonstrated that lowering the heart rate is beneficial in hypertensive subjects. Studies with an assessment of ambulatory heart rate tend to demonstrate a better association between cardiovascular outcomes and variables, including nighttime heart rate. Clinical trials comparing beta-blockers with non-slowing antihypertensive drugs have not demonstrated the superiority of the former. Finally, an elevated resting heart rate in hypertensive subjects free from overt cardiac disease seems to be more a risk marker than a risk factor. Although these patients are at high risk, no scientific data exist to support targeting heart rate. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological effects of heart rate, including vascular cell <b>signalling,</b> <b>link</b> with sympathetic activity and influence on central blood pressure, and the prognostic value and management of HR in hypertensive patients free from overt cardiac diseases...|$|E
40|$|Signalling is the {{critical}} component of telecommunications networks. Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use common channel signalling networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 links and ATM signalling links (i. e. ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs)), a new MTP will be needed for B-ISDN. This thesis is concerned with the design and engineering of the B-ISDN MTP The need for an ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> error monitor is identified as a key requirement. To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM signalling links during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM signalling links.

40|$|Lung cancer (LC) {{and chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) commonly coexist in smokers, {{and the presence}} of COPD increases the risk of developing LC. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify distinct proteomic profiles able to discriminate these two pathological entities. Protein content was assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 60 patients classified in four groups: COPD, COPD and LC, LC without COPD, and control with neither COPD nor LC. Proteins were separated into spots by bidimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) and examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). A total of 40 proteins were differentially expressed in the LC and/or COPD groups as compared with the control group. Distinct protein profiles were identified and validated for each pathological entity (LC and COPD). The main networks involved were related to inflammatory signalling, free radical scavenging and oxidative stress response, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. The most relevant <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> between LC and COPD was through the NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, the protein profiles identified contribute to elucidate the underlying pathogenic pathways of both diseases, and provide new tools of potential use as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of LC. Biological significance: Sequence coverage. The protein sequence coverage (95 %) was estimated for specific proteins by the percentage of matching amino acids from the identified peptides having confidence greater than or equal to 95 % divided by the total number of amino acids in the sequence. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Mapping of our proteins onto biological pathways and disease networks demonstrated that 22 proteins were linked to inflammatory signalling (p-value: 1. 35 * 10 - 08 - 1. 42 * 10 - 02), 15 proteins were associated with free radical scavenging and oxidative stress response (p-value: 4. 93 * 10 - 11 - 1. 27 * 10 - 02), and 9 proteins were related with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways (p-value: 7. 39 * 10 - 09 - 1. 58 * 10 - 02). © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|In the {{research}} {{described in this}} thesis, the trafficking of each CD 23 isoform was studied in detail in both wild-type and mutant CD 23 proteins, using an identical cell system and the same method of CD 23 ligation for both isoforms. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated intracellular sorting differences to exist between the two isoforms, with CD 23 a utilising the endocytic pathway, and CD 23 b following both the endocytic and phagocytic pathways in a B-cell line. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate a number of potentially key residues present in the unique N-terminal tail of each isoform. The serine groups at positions 7 and 5 in the CD 23 a and b isoforms, respectively, and the NNP tri-peptide motif in the b isoform {{were found to be}} necessary for accurate trafficking of these proteins. The discovery that the CD 23 isoforms utilise different trafficking pathways corroborates the hypothesis that CD 23 a and CD 23 b may have functionally different roles. Current models of human CD 23 <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> the CD 23 a isoforms to a cAMP-generating pathway and the CD 23 b isoform to stimulation of inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate production and calcium mobilisation. The ability of CD 23 to transmit a signal within various cells and the fact it has a very short cytoplasmic tail, of only 23 amino acids and bereft of catalytic motifs, strongly suggests that CD 23 may associate with other molecules involved in signal transduction. The divergence in the signalling pathways associated with each CD 23 isoform has been attributed to the unique amino acids at the N-terminal cytoplasmic tails, as the remainder of the proteins are identical. However, there is no definitive evidence to link directly CD 23 to any of these individual signalling pathways. The research presented in this thesis utilises the yeast two-hybrid assay to investigate binding partners for the N-terminal tail of CD 23. Filamin A was identified as a potential interacting protein, and was found to interact with both the CD 23 a and CD 23 b isoforms. It is hypothesised that CD 23 interacts with filamin A, which functions as an adaptor protein, to enable downstream responses to CD 23 through connections to the appropriate signalling pathways in an isoform-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} neurons to {{dynamically}} regulate {{their response to}} changing inputs {{is essential for the}} correct development and function of a nervous system capable of learning and memory. The post synaptic compartment of excitatory synapses contains a dense proteinaceous complex of molecules that link excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission to downstream signalling pathways that ultimately result in modification of the synapse. One of the most abundant of such postsynaptic signalling molecules, synaptic GTPase activation protein, SynGAP, represents a key <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> between the activation of the NMDA sensitive glutamate receptor to outcomes such as the structural rearrangement of synaptic sites and altered synaptic content of AMPA type glutamate receptors, molecular processes that underly learning and memory. The primary finding of this thesis is that different isoforms of SynGAP, which varies at it N terminus through alternative transcription start sites and at its C terminus through alternative splicing, can differentially affect the function of the synapse. Using primary murine neuronal cultures we show that despite being crucial for the survival of the mouse the absence of SynGAP does not effect mean dendritic spine morphology and density or miniature excitiatory post synaptic currents under a range of experimental conditions (days in vitro 10 – 14, with and without serum, high and low cell plating density). In order {{to examine the effects of}} different SynGAP isoforms we cloned two full length transcripts (SynGAP A-alpha- 2 and SynGAP Ealpha- 1) which were used to construct a range of isoforms. Whole cell patch clamping of SynGAP transfected neurons revealed that the post synaptic expression of SynGAPs which terminate as an alpha- 1 isoform can lead to the elimination of mEPSCs, while isoforms that terminate as an alpha- 2 isoform can lead to synaptic strengthening. The magnitude of the effect in both cases is determined by the identity of the N terminus of the protein; SynGAP A-alpha- 1 has the largest synaptic weakening effect and SynGAP B-and C alpha- 2 strenghten the synapse. The changes in miniature electrophysiological properties are not mirrored by changes in dendritic spine morphology, whole cell AMPA/NMDA currents, or synaptic responsiveness to stimulation suggesting an undefined novel mechanism of action. SynGAPs A, B and C appear to be under the control of different promoters which are differentially regulated by development and synaptic activity, thus the differential function of SynGAP N and C terminal combinations could play a part in the activity dependent regulation of synaptic strength.
