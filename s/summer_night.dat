25|$|Two years later, on a {{scorching}} hot <b>summer</b> <b>night,</b> Carnehan creeps {{into the}} narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags {{and he tells}} an amazing story. Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: traversing treacherous mountains, finding the Kafirs, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming of building a unified nation and even an empire. The Kafirs (pagans, not Muslims) were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their idols, and acclaimed him as a god, the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great. They show a whiter complexion than others of the area ("so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends") implying their ancient lineage to Alexander himself. The Kafirs practised a form of Masonic ritual, and Dravot's reputation was further cemented when he showed knowledge of Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2009, {{the band}} premiered the radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, {{commissioned}} by the Swedish public radio (SR) and featuring the Mael brothers themselves and Swedish actors Elin Klinga and Jonas Malmsjö, both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, {{tells the story of}} Bergman's relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with Smiles of a <b>Summer</b> <b>Night</b> (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. On October 28, 2009, the UK's BBC Radio 6 Music held a similar event in London whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC Broadcasting House in London and later to be broadcast with a Q with the Maels. In interviews for Swedish newspapers, the band said they hoped to be able to theatrically stage the musical as well as turn the musical into a feature film. Amongst the filmmakers cited as undertaking The Seduction of Ingmar Bergma with the Mael Brothers is Canadian avant-garde director Guy Maddin.|$|E
25|$|One <b>summer</b> <b>night</b> in 1916, near Ploegsteert, Eden had {{to lead a}} small raid into {{an enemy}} trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers, so as to {{identify}} the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in No Man’s Land under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, then he and three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later {{put it in his}} memoirs, a “chilly feeling down our spines”, unsure whether the Germans had not seen them in the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention that he had been awarded the Military Cross for the incident, something of which he had made little mention in his political career. On 18 September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme), he wrote to his mother “I have seen things lately that I am not likely to forget”. On 3 October, he was appointed an adjutant, with the rank of temporary lieutenant for the duration of that appointment. At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid-1950s, shortly after Bergman's award win at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival for Smiles of a <b>Summer</b> <b>Night.</b> After his return to Stockholm, Bergman feels {{compelled}} to go to a cinema and watch a Hollywood blockbuster movie. As he exits the cinema, he inexplicably finds himself transported to Hollywood, where a limo driver is waiting to take him to a film studio.

500|$|The first interracial kiss on {{television}} {{is a much}} debated topic concerning who the first two persons of different races to kiss {{on television}} were. For a time, it was understood to have occurred during an episode of the British soap opera Emergency– Ward 10 in 1964. However, in November 2015, a Granada Play of the Week, You in Your Small Corner, was uncovered which was broadcast in June 1962; that quickly led to the rediscovery of another play featuring the same young Jamaican actor, Hot <b>Summer</b> <b>Night,</b> televised in Britain on 1 February 1959. The first interracial kiss on U.S. television was broadcast in a 1960 episode of Adventures in Paradise, [...] "Makaha Surfing", also known as [...] "The Big Surf", between star Gardner McKay and Filipina Pilar Seurat. Competing claims have also been made in favour of I Love Lucy.|$|E
500|$|Altman's Gosford Park {{is similar}} to The Rules of the Game in many of its plot elements, {{including}} the relationship between wealthy people and their servants, and the hunting sequence. Italian film critic Francis Vanoye said The Rules of the Game [...] has influenced numerous films that feature a group of character who spend a short time together at a party or gatheringoften while hunting animalsduring which their true feelings about each other are revealed. Along with Gosford Park, these films include Jean Grémillon's Summer Light, Ingmar Bergman's Smiles of a <b>Summer</b> <b>Night,</b> Carlos Saura's The Hunt, Peter Fleischmann's Hunting Scenes from Bavaria, Nikita Mikhalkov's An Unfinished Piece for a Player Piano, Theo Angelopoulos's The Hunters and Denys Arcand's The Decline of the American Empire. The Rules of the Game [...] has also been compared to Paul Bartel's Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills and Lawrence Kasdan's The Big Chill.|$|E
500|$|In {{early years}} of the 20th century, Delius {{composed}} some of his most popular works, including Brigg Fair (1907), In a Summer Garden (1908, revised 1911), <b>Summer</b> <b>Night</b> on the River (1911), and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring (1912), of which McVeagh comments, [...] "These exquisite idylls, for all their composer's German descent and French domicile, spell 'England' for most listeners." [...] In 1910, Beecham put on an opera season at the Royal Opera House in London. Having access to the Beecham family's considerable fortune, he ignored commercial considerations and programmed several works of limited box-office appeal, including A Village Romeo and Juliet. The reviews were polite, but The Times, having praised the orchestral aspects of the score, commented, [...] "Mr. Delius seems to have remarkably little sense of dramatic writing for the voice". Other reviewers agreed that the score contained passages of great beauty, but was ineffective as drama.|$|E

500|$|The first {{recordings}} of Delius's works, in 1927, {{were conducted by}} Beecham for the Columbia label: the [...] "Walk to the Paradise Garden" [...] interlude from A Village Romeo and Juliet, and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring, performed by the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. These began {{a long series of}} Delius recordings under Beecham that continued {{for the rest of the}} conductor's life. He was not alone, however; Geoffrey Toye in 1929–30 recorded Brigg Fair, In a Summer Garden, <b>Summer</b> <b>Night</b> on the River and the [...] "Walk to the Paradise Garden". Fenby recounts that on his first day in Grez, Jelka played Beecham's First Cuckoo recording. In May 1934, when Delius was close to death, Fenby played him Toye's In a Summer Garden, the last music, Fenby says, that Delius ever heard. By the end of the 1930s Beecham had issued versions for Columbia of most of the main orchestral and choral works, together with several songs in which he accompanied the soprano Dora Labbette on the piano. By 1936 Columbia and HMV had issued {{recordings of}} Violin Sonatas 1 and 2, the Elegy and Caprice, and of some of the shorter works.|$|E
500|$|Forbidden Planet {{became an}} instant success, and roles in other MGM {{films such as}} Ransom! (1956), The Opposite Sex (1956) and Hot <b>Summer</b> <b>Night</b> (1957) followed. In 1957 he won the lead role {{opposite}} Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy Tammy and the Bachelor, which, as a Chicago Tribune critic wrote in 1998, made people consider Nielsen a dramatic actor and handsome romantic lead. However, dissatisfied with the films he was offered, calling the studios [...] "a Tiffany, which had forgotten how to make silver", Nielsen left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd got the role. After leaving the studios, Nielsen landed the lead role in the Disney miniseries The Swamp Fox, as American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. In a 1988 interview he reflected on the series, saying, [...] "That was a great experience, because the Disney people didn't do their shows like everyone else, knocking out an episode a week. ... We only had to do an episode a month, and the budgets were extremely high for TV at that time. We had location shooting rather than cheap studio backdrops, and very authentic costumes." [...] Eight episodes were produced and aired between 1959 and 1961.|$|E
500|$|Brigg Fair (1907) {{announced}} the composer's full stylistic maturity, {{the first of}} the pieces for small orchestra that confirm Delius's status as a musical poet, with the influences of Wagner and Grieg almost entirely absent. [...] The work was followed {{in the next few years}} by In a Summer Garden (1908), Life's Dance (1911), <b>Summer</b> <b>Night</b> on the River (1911) and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring (1912). The critic R.W.S. Mendl described this sequence as [...] "exquisite nature studies", with a unity and shape lacking in the earlier formal tone poems. These works became part of the standard English concert repertory, and helped to establish the character of Delius's music in the English concert-goer's mind, although according to Ernest Newman, the concentration on these works to the neglect of his wider output may have done Delius as much harm as good. [...] The typical mature Delian orchestral sound is apparent in these works, through the division of the strings into ten or more sections, punctuated by woodwind comments and decorations. [...] In the North Country Sketches of 1913–14, Delius divides the strings into 12 parts, and harps, horns, clarinets and bassoons evoke a lifeless winter scene. In Payne's view, the Sketches are the high water mark of Delius's compositional skill, although Fenby awards the accolade to the later Eventyr (Once Upon a Time) (1917).|$|E
