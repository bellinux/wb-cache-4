40|$|Presented {{here are}} the results of {{performance}} tests made with a single-cylinder, four stroke cycle, compression-ignition engine. These tests were made on a precombustion chamber type of cylinder head designed to have air velocity and tangential air flow in both the chamber and cylinder. The performance was investigated for variable load and engine speed, type of fuel <b>spray,</b> <b>valve</b> opening pressure, injection period and, for the spherical chamber, position of the injection spray relative to the air flow. The pressure variations between the pear-shaped precombustion chamber and the cylinder for motoring and full load conditions were determined with a Farnboro electric indicator. The combustion chamber designs tested gave good mixing of a single compact fuel spray with the air, but did not control the ensuing combustion sufficiently. Relative to each other, the velocity of air flow was too high, the spray dispersion by injection too great, and the metering effect of the cylinder head passage insufficient. The correct relation of these factors is {{of the utmost importance}} for engine performance...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{selective}} spraying {{could be}} a way for agriculture to reduce production costs, save resources, protect the environment and help to fulfill specific pesticide regulations. The objective {{of this paper was}} to investigate the use of a low-cost sonar sensor for autonomous selective spraying of single plants. For this, a belt driven autonomous robot was used with an attached 3 -axes frame with three degrees of freedom. In the tool center point (TCP) of the 3 -axes frame, a sonar sensor and a <b>spray</b> <b>valve</b> were attached to create a point cloud representation of the surface, detect plants in the area and perform selective spraying. The autonomous robot was tested on replicates of artificial crop plants. The location of each plant was identified out of the acquired point cloud with the help of Euclidian clustering. The gained plant positions were spatially transformed from the coordinates of the sonar sensor to the valve location to determine the exact irrigation points. The results showed that the robot was able to automatically detect the position of each plant with an accuracy of 2. 7 cm and could spray on these selected points. This selective spraying reduced the used liquid by 72 %, when comparing it to a conventional spraying method in the same conditions...|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{efficiency}} of a Pre- Rinse <b>Spray</b> <b>Valve</b> (PRSV) {{is one of the}} most cost effective water conservation methods in the Food Services Industry. A significant contributor to this cost efficiency is the reduction in the energy costs required to provide the mandatory hot water. This research paper estimates the potential quantity and dollar value of the water and energy that can be saved annually in Texas A&M University's dining services with the installation of low flow pre-rinse spray valves. The data collection was obtained from four of Texas A&M University's Dining Services facilities. The annual savings were estimated by contrasting the water consumption of the existing T & S Brass B 0107 -M PRSVs with the latest and most advanced available low flow T and S Brass B 0107 -C PRSV. The annual water consumption of the existing and new PRSVs were predicted by measuring an individual average flow rate for each and observing the number of hours per day the PRSV would be used. The observed and measured values were extrapolated to amount rates to determine cost savings. The dollar value was ascertained using the utility cost data recorded over a semester by the Facilities Coordinator of the Department of Dining Services. The findings of this study show that the water savings from a single PRSV could lead to an estimated annual saving ranging between 46 % and 78 % of the current operation cost. The T & S Brass B 0107 -C PRSV is currently priced between $ 52 - $ 60 per valve resulting in a payback period ranging between 1. 5 - 6 months per valve. If every valve on campus was replaced, the University could reap a savings in the range of $ 5, 400 - $ 22, 590 over the 5 year useful life of the valve, having initially invested less than $ 550...|$|E

50|$|Pressure is {{controlled}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} {{to ensure that the}} core itself does not reach its boiling point in which the water will turn into steam and rapidly decrease the heat being transferred from the fuel to the moderator. By a combination of heaters and <b>spray</b> <b>valves,</b> pressure {{is controlled}} in the pressurizer vessel which is connected to the reactor plant. Because the pressurizer vessel and the reactor plant are connected, the pressure of the steam space pressurizes the entire reactor plant to ensure the pressure is above that which would allow boiling in the reactor core. The pressurizer vessel itself may be maintained much hotter {{than the rest of the}} reactor plant to ensure pressure control, because in the liquid throughout the reactor plant, pressure applied at any point has an effect on the entire system, whereas the heat transfer is limited by ambient and other losses.|$|R

40|$|Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) is {{developing}} a computer model and spreadsheet tool for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help estimate the water savings attributable to their WaterSense program. WaterSense has developed a labeling program for three types of plumbing fixtures commonly used in commercial and institutional settings: flushometer valve toilets, urinals, and pre-rinse <b>spray</b> <b>valves.</b> This National Water Savings-Commercial/Institutional (NWS-CI) model is patterned after the National Water Savings-Residential model, which was completed in 2008. Calculating the quantity of water and money saved through the WaterSense labeling program requires three primary inputs: (1) the quantity of a given product in use; (2) {{the frequency with which}} units of the product are replaced or are installed in new construction; and (3) the number of times or the duration the product is used in various settings. To obtain the information required for developing the NWS-CI model, LBNL reviewed various resources pertaining to the three WaterSense-labeled commercial/institutional products. The data gathered ranged from the number of commercial buildings in the United States to numbers of employees in various sectors of the economy and plumbing codes for commercial buildings.

5000|$|Restaurants (and {{fast food}} places) {{account for about}} 3 percent of total CII use in Austin, Texas and 5 percent in Oakland, California (EBMUD) and up to 8 percent in the State of Florida. The largest uses of water in {{restaurants}} result from kitchen activities such as washing dishes, making ice, and preparing food. A significant amount of water is also used for restrooms.The proxy metrics data show WUIs in restaurants ranging from 474 to 578 g/ksf/d in selected Colorado utilities, an average of 589 g/ksf/d in Austin, Texas, and 670 g/ksf/d in Florida. Somewhat wider range of 356 to 907 g/ksf/d was reported in an earlier study. Data on functional metrics suggests that restaurants would use around 6 to 9 gallons of water per meal served, 20 to 31 gallons per seat per day, and 86 to 122 gallons per employee per day. [...] Other studies reported 17 gallons/seat/day in Santa Fe, New Mexico [...] and 29 gallons/seat per day in Colorado utilities. [...] Given the total floor space of 380 thousand food service buildings of 1,819 million square feet and assuming average use of 521 g/ksf/d, the total U.S.-wide use in restaurants would be 950 mgd or close to 8 percent of CII use.

40|$|Exploitation of {{the natural}} {{reserves}} of petroleum products has put a tremendous onus on the automotive industry. Increasing pollution levels and the depletion of the petroleum reserves have lead {{to the search for}} alternate fuel sources for internal combustion engines. Usage of vegetable oils poses some challenges like poor <b>spray</b> penetration, <b>valve</b> sticking and clogging of injector nozzles. Most of these problems may be solved by partial substitution of diesel with vegetable oil. In this work, the performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fueled by waste cooking oil-diesel emulsion with different water contents are evaluated. The use of waste cooking oil-diesel emulsion lowers the peak temperature, which reduces the formation of NOx. Moreover the phenomenon of micro explosion that results during the combustion of an emulsified fuel finely atomizes the fuel droplets and thus enhances combustion. Experiments show that CO concentration is reduced as the water content is increased and it is seen that 20 % water content gives optimum results. Also, there is a significant reduction in NOx emissions...|$|R

Steady state and transient heat load, water pressure/temperature and ambient pressure/temperature profiles were imposed by especially designed supporting test hardware. Testing in 1978 verified evaporator and duct heater thermal design, determined FES performance boundaries, and assessed topping evaporator plume characteristics. Testing in 1979 combined the FES with the other systems in the orbiter active thermal control subsystem (ATCS).

2500|$|The Rowland–Molina {{hypothesis}} was strongly disputed {{by representatives of}} the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The Chair of the Board of DuPont {{was quoted as saying}} that ozone depletion theory is [...] "a science fiction tale … a load of rubbish … utter nonsense". Robert Abplanalp, the President of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol <b>spray</b> can <b>valve),</b> wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements. Nevertheless, within three years most of the basic assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements and by direct observation in the stratosphere. The concentrations of the source gases (CFCs and related compounds) and the chlorine reservoir species (HCl and [...] ) were measured throughout the stratosphere, and demonstrated that CFCs were indeed the major source of stratospheric chlorine, and that nearly all of the CFCs emitted would eventually reach the stratosphere. Even more convincing was the measurement, by James G. Anderson and collaborators, of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the stratosphere. ClO is produced by the reaction of Cl with ozone—its observation thus demonstrated that Cl radicals not only were present in the stratosphere but also were actually involved in destroying ozone. McElroy and Wofsy extended the work of Rowland and Molina by showing that bromine atoms were even more effective catalysts for ozone loss than chlorine atoms and argued that the brominated organic compounds known as halons, widely used in fire extinguishers, were a potentially large source of stratospheric bromine. In 1976 the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report concluding that the ozone depletion {{hypothesis was}} strongly supported by the scientific evidence. [...] In response the United States, Canada and Norway banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 1978. Early estimates were that, if CFC production continued at 1977 levels, the total atmospheric ozone would after a century or so reach a steady state, 15 to 18 percent below normal levels. By 1984, when better evidence on the speed of critical reactions was available, this estimate was changed to 5 to 9 percent steady-state depletion.|$|R
