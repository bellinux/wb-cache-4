5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TB {{is made by}} identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., <b>sputum,</b> pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or <b>sputum</b> culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the <b>sputum</b> or nasal {{secretion}} may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased <b>sputum</b> production, {{a change in the}} color of the <b>sputum</b> from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, <b>sputum,</b> sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1706, George {{was seriously}} ill. There was {{blood in his}} <b>sputum,</b> {{but he seemed to}} recover, {{although}} he was too ill to attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and US {{government}} are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test {{for use in}} low- and middle-income countries. In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV. Many resource-poor places as of 2011 have access to only <b>sputum</b> microscopy.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COPD {{should be considered}} in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a chronic cough, <b>sputum</b> production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. Screening those without symptoms is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are <b>sputum</b> production, shortness of breath, and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a <b>sputum</b> sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple <b>sputum</b> cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of <b>sputum</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} <b>sputum</b> may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as <b>sputum.</b> The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, <b>sputum,</b> or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{criteria}} for the diagnosis of ABPA are not agreed upon. Chest X-rays and CT scans, raised blood levels of IgE and eosinophils, immunological tests for Aspergillus together with <b>sputum</b> staining and <b>sputum</b> cultures can be useful. Treatment consists of corticosteroids and antifungal medications.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{laceration}} {{is usually}} accompanied by hemoptysis (coughing up blood or of blood-stained <b>sputum).</b>|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of PCP include fever, non-productive cough (because <b>sputum</b> is too viscous to become productive), shortness of breath (especially on exertion), weight loss, and night sweats. There is usually not {{a large amount of}} <b>sputum</b> with PCP unless the patient has an additional bacterial infection. The fungus can invade other visceral organs (such as the liver, spleen, and kidney), but only in a minority of cases.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a soft, moist cough may be seen, most {{commonly}} {{in association with}} exercise or eating. This cough may be productive, with expectoration of thick, viscous <b>sputum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{organism}} was termed Diplococcus pneumoniae from 1920 {{because of}} its characteristic appearance in Gram-stained <b>sputum.</b> It was renamed Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1974 because it was very similar to streptococci.|$|E
25|$|HAPE can {{progress}} {{rapidly and}} is often fatal. Symptoms include fatigue, severe dyspnea at rest, and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink, frothy <b>sputum.</b> Descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of HAPE.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mycobacteria}} {{are also}} acid-fast. If the smear is positive, PCR or gene probe tests can distinguish M. tuberculosis from other mycobacteria. Even if <b>sputum</b> smear is negative, tuberculosis {{must be considered}} and is only excluded after negative cultures.|$|E
25|$|Jīnyė are {{ultimately}} extracted from food and drink, and constitute {{the raw material}} {{for the production of}} xuě; conversely, xuě can also be transformed into jīnyė. Their palpable manifestations are all bodily fluids: tears, <b>sputum,</b> saliva, gastric acid, joint fluid, sweat, urine, etc.|$|E
25|$|For PCR testing, the WHO {{recommends}} obtaining {{samples from}} the lower respiratory tract via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), <b>sputum</b> sample or tracheal aspirate as these have the highest viral loads. There have also been studies utilizing upper respiratory sampling via nasopharyngeal swab.|$|E
25|$|Bubonic and septicemic plague is {{generally}} spread by flea bites or handling an infected animal. The pneumonitic form {{is generally}} spread between {{people through the}} air via infectious droplets. Diagnosis is typically by finding the bacterium in fluid from a lymph node, blood, or <b>sputum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients were {{required}} to attend weekly lectures on tuberculosis. They were taught {{the proper way to}} dispose of <b>sputum</b> and other aspects of dealing with the illness. Piedmont staff hoped that they would go back to their home communities and teach other blacks about tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{commonly}} misdiagnosed as bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. The fungal infection {{can be demonstrated}} by microscopic detection of diagnostic cells in body fluids, exudates, <b>sputum</b> and biopsy tissue by methods of Papanicolaou or Grocott's methenamine silver staining. These stains can demonstrate spherules and surrounding inflammation.|$|E
25|$|A {{physical}} examination {{is done to}} assess the patient's general health. It cannot be used to confirm or rule out TB. However, certain findings are suggestive of TB. For example, blood in the <b>sputum,</b> significant weight loss and drenching night sweats {{may be due to}} TB.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} supporting some {{deviations from the}} standard regimen when treating pulmonary TB. <b>Sputum</b> culture positive patients who are smear negative {{at the start of}} treatment do well with only 4 months of treatment (this has not been validated for HIV-positive patients); and <b>sputum</b> culture negative patients do well on only 3 months of treatment (possibly because some of these patients never had TB at all). It is unwise to treat patients for only three or four months, but all TB physicians will have patients who stop their treatment early (for whatever reason), and it can be re-assuring to know that sometimes retreatment is unnecessary. Elderly patients who are already taking a large number of tablets may be offered 9HR, omitting PZA which is the bulkiest part of the regimen.|$|E
25|$|Culturing fungi from <b>sputum</b> is a {{supportive}} {{test in the}} diagnosis of ABPA, but is not 100% specific for ABPA as A. fumigatus is ubiquitous and commonly isolated from lung expectorant in other diseases. Nevertheless, between 40–60% of patients do have positive cultures depending {{on the number of}} samples taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{diagnosis is}} {{the recovery of}} adult worms either by coughing them up or removing them with forceps, a bronchoscope, or endoscopic instruments. However, worms might be difficult to remove if firmly attached to the bronchial walls. Finding M. laryngeus eggs in the <b>sputum</b> or feces is another sure sign of infection.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{typically}} {{based on a}} person's signs and symptoms. The color of the <b>sputum</b> does not indicate if the infection is viral or bacterial. Determining the underlying organism {{is typically}} not needed. Other causes of similar symptoms include asthma, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and COPD. A chest X-ray {{may be useful to}} detect pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} {{incapable of}} producing a <b>sputum</b> sample, common alternative sample sources for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis include gastric washings, laryngeal swab, bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings, and/or transbronchial biopsy), and fine needle aspiration (transtracheal or transbronchial). In some cases, a more invasive technique is necessary, including tissue biopsy during mediastinoscopy or thoracoscopy.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial and fungal {{infection}}s {{are common in}} ALF, with one study demonstrating culture-proven infection in 80% of ALF patients. Defective cellular and humoral immunity as well as presence of indwelling catheters, coma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection. Localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and <b>sputum</b> production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. There must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures (blood, urine, and <b>sputum),</b> chest radiographs, and paracentesis. Bacteria that enter through the skin, such as streptococci and staphylococci, tend to predominate. Aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit. Fungal infections, particularly {{in the setting of}} broad-spectrum antibiotics, are also common, and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign.|$|E
25|$|If the {{effusion}} {{is caused}} by infection, microbiological culture may yield the infectious organism responsible for the infection, sometimes before other cultures (e.g. blood cultures and <b>sputum</b> cultures) become positive. A Gram stain may give a rough indication of the causative organism. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain may identify tuberculosis or other mycobacterial diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} diagnostic tools {{will include}} the use of LED microscopes and DNA-based diagnosis. Using LEDs rather than standard phosphorescent lights in microscopes forms a clearer image and improves TB detection rates in patients' <b>sputum</b> from 50 to 65 per cent. And DNA testing, which can determine which strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are present in <b>sputum</b> has 98 per cent accuracy and can be used to detect drug-resistant strains in as little as a day. DNA-based diagnosis is also cost-effective. As well as diagnosis, new management methods such as mobile phone text messaging and medicine kits with built-in reminder alarms will be used to enhance patients' drug compliance. Drug combinations — where different drugs are combined in the same pill — will also be used {{to reduce the number of}} pills a patient has to take from around 13 to three or four a day.|$|E
25|$|Response to {{treatment}} must {{be obtained by}} repeated <b>sputum</b> cultures (monthly if possible). Treatment for MDR-TB must be given {{for a minimum of}} 18 months and cannot be stopped until the patient has been culture-negative for a minimum of nine months. It is not unusual for patients with MDR-TB to be on treatment for two years or more.|$|E
