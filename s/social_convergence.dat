50|$|Greene’s {{best known}} work Pursuits of Happiness (1988) {{constructed}} a vastly influential new synthesis of colonial British American history and proposed {{a framework for}} a developmental narrative of early American history. Employing a broad regional framework and using the concept of social development as its principal analytic device, Pursuits of Happiness focused on the creation and subsequent histories of colonial regions {{as defined by the}} socioeconomic structures and cultural constructs devised and amended by settlers and their descendants to enable them to exploit the economic potentials of their new environments and to express the larger purposes of the societies they were creating. These processes, Greene argues, could not be traced exclusively to either the transfer of civilization from Britain to the Americas or the Americanizing effects of New World conditions. Rather, they were the products of a complex, regionally differentiated interaction between metropolitan inheritance and colonial experience. As a framework for understanding how these social processes worked, Pursuits of Happiness proposed a developmental model that understands the British North American colonial experience as a process of adaptation, institution building, and expansion of human, economic, social, and cultural resources. That model describes and explains the transformations of the simple and inchoate societies of the earliest years of settlement into the ever more complex, differentiated, and articulated societies of the late colonial era. Pursuits of Happiness presents this transformation, which proceeded through a series of phases (social simplification, social elaboration, and social replication) to show the common social processes at work in the regions of colonial British America as well as to direct attention to its variations. In contrast to some of the other attempts at synthesis at that time Pursuits of Happiness argued that overall colonialism did not lead in the direction of cultural divergence from Britain. Rather, it posited a gradual <b>social</b> <b>convergence</b> during the middle decades of the eighteenth century throughout the British Atlantic world. Pursuits of Happiness suggested that the product of this convergence served as a critical precondition for the American Revolution by intensifying demands among colonists for metropolitan recognition of their essential Britishness and thus providing the foundation for the loose political confederation that, after 1775, evolved into the United States.|$|E

By convergence we usually mean harmonisation of the level of incomes across countries. Convergence also means harmonisation of particular economic indicators, equalisation. <b>Social</b> <b>convergence</b> is discussed in the latter meaning. According to the economic theory of convergence, the economic development level of less developed countries should approach the level of more advanced countries with the same economic resources or fundamentals. This paper discusses convergence of social protection expenditure, analyses trends in the economic and socio-demographic situation and respective social policy measures that influence the convergence process in EU countries. Estimates of social protection expenditure in EU countries indicate faster development of countries with lower level of social protection in recent years. Many reforms accomplished there have helped to raise the social protection level in less developed countries. A comparison of social protection expenditure and evaluation of changes there should also characterise the <b>social</b> <b>convergence</b> process between EU countries.

40|$|The {{achievement}} {{of social and}} economic development involves three processes: the increase in gross domestic product per capita, the reduction of unemployment and increase of employment, the reduction of poverty and income inequalities. Directly related to that are the objectives of new EU member states, as well as other European countries that wish to join the Union and thus contribute to their own development - economic and social. Integrating the new Member States and candidate countries represents a great challenge for the EU, and especially for the social systems of individual countries. The reason for this is primarily a variety of social systems and socio-demographic characteristics of these countries. Because of the strong convergence those can adversely affect their economies, but also the entire Internal Market. With the support of financial instruments and measures that encourage convergence at the national and European level, national social policies contribute to overall economic and social development and economic and social cohesion. Economic convergence leads to <b>social</b> <b>convergence,</b> but not necessarily to the harmonization of social systems. The goals of the paper include the proper assessment of different effects and the dynamics of social (and economic) reforms, which enable a greater level of <b>social</b> <b>convergence,</b> the evaluation of the effectiveness of national social policies and the assessment of the ability of individual countries to adapt to the contrasting demands of social security and employment, and economic growth and development. social and economic convergence; European Union; adjustment of social systems...|$|E

Technology diffusion is modeled as the determinant of conditional convergence, while technological progress and economic openness further strengthen the social infrastructure bringing about absolute convergence.
