Research {{of using}} sludge as raw {{material}} for making medium density fibreboard (MDF) was useful to create additional value of sludge. The objective of the research was to evaluate physical properties, mechanical properties, and durability of MDF from acetylated sludge in 4 levels of acetate anhydride (0 %, 3 %, 5 %, and 7 %) with 3 replicates. The MDF was made using dry process. After materials were mixed with adhesives, they were pressed using hotpress under 170 oC temperature and 45 Pa pressure for 25 minutes. The size of the MDF sample was 25 cm x 20 cm x 1 cm with 0. 8 g/cm 3 density. The physical properties (density, moisture content, water absorption, thickness swelling) and mechanical properties (modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, internal bond, <b>screw</b> <b>holding</b> <b>power)</b> was tested based on JIS A 5905 - 2003 standard.

40|$|Screws {{are widely}} used for the {{internal}} fixation of fractures, either alone or with plates. Constant improvement in design and in operative techniques has led to increased <b>holding</b> <b>power,</b> which now exceeds the shear strength of bone. In fact, if one tries to pull out a freshly inserted screw, the bone threads do not strip but the screw pulls out a small cone-shaped button of compact bone (Bechtol 1971). If one considers only the result of such an immediate test, the question of bone formation around the screws {{would seem to be}} of no interest, as a further increase in <b>holding</b> <b>power</b> would have no practical importance. In cases of accidental stripping of screws, however, bone healing certainly is a matter of considerable importance, as shown by Bechtol (1959). In fact, he found that during the first four weeks after insertion of a <b>screw</b> the <b>holding</b> <b>power</b> exceeded the initial stripping torque, though it should be carefully noted that these screws, once in place, were not subjected to any mechanical forces.

The wood species used were J. procera as softwood species collected from Al-Baha region, southwest of the kingdom and six hardwood species viz., A. salicina, C. erectus, F. altissima, L. glauca, P. dulce and T. aphylla collected from different sites of Riyadh city during year 2011. 3 Boards were pressed at target density level of 750 kg m and the resin content for core and surfaces was 8 and 10 %, respectively based on oven dry weight. The press conditions were 150 °C, 3. 5 MPa and 8 min. Mechanical properties in static bending (MOR and MOE), tensile strength perpendicular to board surface (IB) and <b>screw</b> <b>holding</b> <b>power</b> were determined. In addition, water absorption and thickness swelling were also determined after 2 and 24 h water immersion. Chemical constitutents of wood had the highest effects on {{the properties of the}} produced particleboard.

40|$|Although bone plates have {{advantages}} over other fixation methods for certain indications, {{they are still}} uncommonly used in avian fracture repair. One reason are the thin cortices of avian bones. They lead to a reduced <b>screw</b> <b>holding</b> <b>power.</b> Another reason was that until now there was no evaluated plating system appropriate and available {{for the use of}} fracture repair in smaller birds. Therefore a study with three different miniplate systems was carried out. Three groups (A, B and C) of six pigeons (Columba livia) each were used. The left ulna and radius of the pigeons were transected and the ulna was repaired with a bone plate. Three plate systems were used: in group A, a 1. 3 adaption plate; in group B the same plate with washers to achieve a limited contact system; in group C a maxillofacial miniplate. Healing was evaluated with radiographs after two and four weeks, a flight test was performed after 4 weeks, and a necropsy of the wing was carried out. Group A achieved the best flight results (100 % good). In group B no effect of the limited contact concept was visible at necropsy and a high percentage of screws loosened which led to repair failure (33 %). The maxillofacial miniplates of group C were too weak and bent (100 %). In conclusion only the adaption plate 1. 3 met the requirements for avian osteosynthesis. To adapt the system better to the properties of avian bone, further trials using smaller drill bits or screws with a smaller thread pitch should be carried out...|$|E

These assessments of <b>screw</b> <b>hold</b> were compared with measurements from pullout testing. Four operators, encompassing a range of experiences in terms of screw insertion, prepared the pilot holes, and inserted a number of screws, assigning each with a score from 0 to 10 on the basis of how good the hold was felt to be. The pullout strength for each screw was then measured using a tensometer. The results were analysed and correlation coefficients calculated. Significant correlation was observed in all four subjects, with P P > 0. 001 in the other two. The conclusions were that there is a strong correlation between the subjective assessment of <b>screw</b> <b>hold</b> and actual pullout strength within the four subjects analysed.
