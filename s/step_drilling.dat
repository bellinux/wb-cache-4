40|$|The {{results from}} the Phoenix mission led {{scientists}} to believe {{it is possible that}} primitive life exists below the Martian surface. Therefore, drilling in Martian soil in search for organisms is the next logical <b>step.</b> <b>Drilling</b> on Mars is a major engineering challenge due to the drilling depth requirement and extreme environment condition. Mars lacks a thick atmosphere and a continuous magnetic field that shield the planet’s surface from solar radiation and solar flares. As a result, the Martian surface is sterile and if life ever existed, it must be found below the surface. NASA’s Mars Exploration Payload Advisory Group proposed that drilling should be considered as a priority investigation on Mars in an effort of finding evidence of extinct or extant life. The {{results from the}} Curiosity mission suggested drilling six meters deep in the red planet in search for life. Excavation tools deployed to Mars so far have been able to drill to a maximum depth of 6. 5 cm. Thus, the drilling capabilities need to be increased by a factor of approximately 100 to achieve the goal of drilling six meters deep. This requirement puts a demand on developing new and more effective technologies to reach this goal. Previous research shows evidence of a promising drilling mechanism in rotary-ultrasonic for what it offers in terms of high surface quality, faster rate of penetration and higher material removal rate. This research addresses the need to understand the mechanics of the drill bit tip and rock interface in rotary-ultrasonic drilling performance of one drill bit at a time drilling in three types of rocks that vary in strength. A mathematical model identifying all contributing independent parameters, such as drill bit design parameters, drilling process parameters, ultrasonic wave amplitude and rocks’ material properties, that have effect on rate of penetration is developed. Analytical and experimental results under ambient condition are presented to show the effect of the variation of different parameters on rate of penetration performance as a first step of the investigation. It was found that the speed and WOB have significant effect on ROP {{while the rest of the}} parameter have very little or no effect...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, burr removal {{is a very}} important part of the manufacturing process. Stacks of material on sections of an aircraft are assembled and drilled by hand. Due to extensive burr formation the sheets must be destacked so that burrs can be removed and then the stacks are reassembled and fastened together. If burrs are minimized in the drilling process, this would reduce the necessity for the sheets to be destacked and deburred. One approach to minimizing burrs is to lower the thrust force in drilling through suitable modification of the drill geometry such as the use of a step drill. Although prior researchers have analyzed different drill geometries such as step drills and their effect on hole exit burr formation in the drilling process through experimentation, no work has been reported on modeling and analysis of <b>step</b> <b>drilling</b> forces and their relationship to burr formation as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. Consequently, this thesis focuses on the modeling of the thrust force and torque for step drills and analyzes their relationship with burr size as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. In the first step, a mechanistic model for thrust and torque in drilling is implemented for a standard twist drill. This mechanistic model is then adapted to predict the thrust and torque for a step drill. Subsequently, experiments are performed to validate the mechanistic model and to evaluate burr formation with standard and step drills. The influence of thrust and torque on hole exit burr formation is analyzed for different step drill geometries and experimental feeds and speeds. The results show that the predicted thrust and torque values for both drill geometries are in good agreement with measured values, although the torque model consistently underpredicts. For standard drill geometry in the calibration tests, the average error in the thrust prediction is 7. 09 % and the average error in the torque prediction is - 18. 05 %. In validation tests, the average error for predicted thrust is 2. 29 % and the average error for predicted torque is - 18. 46 %. For the step drill model the average error in thrust is 0. 72 % while the average error in torque is - 8. 72 %. In addition, a reduction in the predicted thrust force for a step drill relative to the standard twist drill is found to correlate well with a reduction in the measured burr size. However, further reduction in the thrust force by varying the step angle and diameter ratio do not correlate well with the measured burr size. Likely reasons for these results are presented in this thesis. MSCommittee Chair: Shreyes Melkote; Committee Member: Steven Danyluk; Committee Member: Steven Lian...|$|E

In the present study, regression model were developed to predict surface roughness in drilling MDF panels with carbide <b>step</b> <b>drills.</b> In the development of predictive models, drilling parameters of spindle speed, feed rate and drill diameter were considered as model variables.

40|$|Drilling a stack made {{of carbon}} fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) {{material}} and aluminum or titanium, which is typical in the aircraft industry, is investigated for improved performance and economy. Using the same drill {{under the same}} process parameters to make holes in both materials requires compromising {{the quality of the}} holes and the drilling performance in the CFRP or in the metal layer. One way to overcome this need to compromise is to change the process parameters during drilling and to use the most suitable parameters for each material. This is possible when the thickness of each layer is known. This is not the case with large airplane parts with changing profiles in which the thickness of the different material layers varies along the profile. The current investigation presents a method based on an acoustic emission signal for identifying the transition point between materials and the point of entrance and exit from each material during the drilling process. Find ing those points from the acoustic emission signal in real time was achieved by applying a novel pattern analysis algorithm using real drilling tests results.

Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius end mill, tapered radius end mill, twist <b>drill,</b> and <b>step</b> <b>drill,</b> respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles. Therefore, it is difficult to encode by formal rules.
