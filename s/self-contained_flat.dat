500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

50|$|The second {{structure}} {{consists of}} two arches and was originally designed as a garage/studio but in the mid-1950s was refitted under Kevin Borland's supervision as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> for their two children.|$|E
50|$|The Grade II listed {{building}} became {{the offices of}} the Liverpool Corporation Parks and Gardens department and in the 1940s part of the house was transformed into a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> for the Assistant Head Gardener. The 1940s also saw a neo art-deco open-air theatre was constructed {{at the back of the}} house, designed by Sir Lancelot Keay.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, {{the house}} had been {{abandoned}} due to dry and wet rot rendering it in a poor state of repair. Its dilapidation continued until 1987 when work partially restored the building and created a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> to accommodate the Assistant Ranger of the Country Park. However, thanks to European funding, gained in 1993, the house was renovated to its present condition.|$|E
50|$|The 1920 Act did {{not apply}} to houses erected, or in the course of erection, on 2 April 1919, nor to those that at that date or later were being reconstructed into two or more {{separate}} and <b>self-contained</b> <b>flats</b> or tenements.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few decades two other {{developments}} took place which replaced the old playing fields with the largest student residential centre in Southampton.

50|$|The SMART Board {{interactive}} whiteboard operates {{as part of}} a system that includes the {{interactive whiteboard}}, a computer, a projector and whiteboarding software - either Smart Notebook collaborative learning software for education, or SMART Meeting Pro software for business. The components are connected wirelessly or via USB or serial cables. A projector connected to the computer displays the desktop image on the interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard accepts touch input from a finger, pen or other solid object. Older models rely on an external projector to work but certain projector-based models have an integrated projector built in {{to the top of the}} Board. The newest models can display UHD graphics and are <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> panels which do not need a projector. Some of these <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> panel models are also equipped with a motion sensor on the bottom-right corner of the Board. This sensor can save power by putting the SMART Board to sleep when no movement is detected. The SMART Board will then automatically wake itself up when movement is detected, such as when a teacher, pupil or employee enters the room.|$|E

This single-storeyed, Flemish bond brick {{building}} has a gable and hipped corrugated iron roof and sash windows. The western side has a skillion roof verandah with brick floor, and is enclosed with a variety of materials including lattice, hardboard, chamferboard and glazing. The northern wall is of hardboard. Internally, the building is used as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat,</b> with hardboard lining and partition walls.|$|E

50|$|Langbourne Mansions {{was built}} first and {{provided}} 88 <b>self-contained</b> <b>flats</b> which have changed {{little in the}} intervening years. The mansion blocks on Makepeace Avenue and Oakeshott Avenue though were designed from the outset as bed-sitting rooms, sometimes with bedroom or kitchen alcoves, and offered an acceptable way for single women to live near to London on their own. Only three flats {{in the whole of}} Makepeace Mansions and Holly Lodge Mansions had their own bathroom (one for a particular tenant, one for the caretaker and the remaining one for the stoker for the central boiler). The remainder all had shared bathroom and toilet facilities, which is still the case for seven of the blocks even today. Makepeace Mansions originally provided 269 rooms and Holly Lodge Mansions on Oakeshott Avenue had 408 flats but later conversions have seen this number reduced as bedsits have given way to <b>self-contained</b> <b>flats.</b> New regulations have seen a start on the conversion of the remaining bedsits to self-contained accommodation during 2005.|$|R
50|$|Lok Fu, Wong Tai Sin, Wang Tau Hom, and Tung Tau {{were home}} to {{a large number of}} public housing blocks built in the 1950s and 1960s to provide {{accommodation}} to Hong Kong's burgeoning population of refugee migrants. This type of housing, built in haste with limited resources, was rudimentary. The flats were no more than single rooms and families on each floor shared toilet and bathing facilities. In the 1980s there was a push to redevelop the first generation of estates so that each family was housed in a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat.</b> By the late 1980s much of the area had been rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|In AG Securities v Vaughan (1988) the House of Lords {{decided that}} {{exclusive}} possession {{had not been}} granted, where up to four agreements existed simultaneously for the sharing of a single flat by unrelated occupiers, as there was an actual sharing of occupation. Also, in a joined appeal called Antoniades v Villiers, a case concerning a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat,</b> the agreement expressly denied that the occupier had exclusive possession, and expressly provided for the owner to allow others to share the premises. The House of Lords decided that as the flat was in reality too small to accommodate others, {{so that it was}} incapable of actually being shared, the wording was merely a pretence intended to evade the Rent Act, and that in law the arrangement accordingly amounted to a grant of exclusive possession.|$|E
50|$|These {{usually come}} {{in the shape of}} a <b>self-contained</b> <b>flat</b> {{rectangular}} box that needs to be pointed in the general direction of the satellite—unlike VSAT the alignment need not be very precise and the modems have built in signal strength meters to help the user align the device properly. The modems have commonly used connectors such as Ethernet or Universal Serial Bus (USB). Some also have an integrated Bluetooth transceiver and double as a satellite phone. The modems also tend to have their own batteries so they can be connected to a laptop without draining its battery. The most common such system is INMARSAT's BGAN—these terminals are about the size of a briefcase and have near-symmetric connection speeds of around 350-500 kbit/s. Smaller modems exist like those offered by Thuraya but only connect at 444 kbit/s in a limited coverage area. INMARSAT now offer the IsatHub, a paperback book sized satellite modem working in conjunction with the users mobile phone and other devices. The cost has been reduced to $3 per MB and the device itself is on sale for about $1300.|$|E
50|$|Houses in {{multiple}} occupation (HMOs), {{also known as}} houses of multiple occupancy, is a British English term which refers to residential properties where ‘common areas’ exist and are shared {{by more than one}} household. Common areas may be as significant as bathrooms and kitchens / kitchenettes, but may also be just stairwells or landings. HMOs may be divided up into <b>self-contained</b> <b>flats,</b> bed-sitting rooms or simple lodgings.|$|R
50|$|In September 2007 a {{new science}} block was built and cost an {{estimated}} £4 300 000. The block contains four science labs, two other class rooms with state-of-the-art IT Systems and also two <b>self-contained</b> <b>flats</b> for staff accommodation {{found on the}} third floor. Also a new drama and music block was opened; the drama department consists of two studios. In 2016, the Mcquillen Sixth Form house was converted into Victoria House.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>self-contained,</b> <b>flat,</b> {{quadratic}} global placer that is simpler than existing placers {{and easier to}} integrate into timing-closure flows. It maintains lower-bound and upper-bound placements that converge to a final solution. The upper-bound placement is produced by a novel look-ahead legalization algorithm. Our placer SimPL outperforms mPL 6, FastPlace 3, NTU-Place 3, APlace 2 and Capo simultaneously in runtime and solution quality, running 7. 10 times faster than mPL 6 (when using a single thread) and reducing wirelength by 3 % on the ISPD 2005 benchmark suite. More significant improvements are achieved on larger benchmarks. The new algorithm is amenable to parallelism, and we report empirical studies with SSE 2 instructions and up to eight parallel threads...|$|E
