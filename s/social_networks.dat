Another kind of <b>social</b> <b>network</b> called mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> (MSN) emerges as required and {{is becoming more and}} more popular. The goal of this paper is to compare communication behavior in mobile and online <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> We use the Reality Mining data set as a mobile social net-work sample and Twitter data as an online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> case. We compare communication in three aspects: time, location and topology. Communication in mobile social net-work presents a more significant periodicity than online so-cial network. Besides, both the reply time and conversation duration in mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> are shorter. But the re-ply rate of most users in mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is between 0. 2 to 0. 4, while in online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> a larger portion of users have a high reply rate. We also discover that in both <b>social</b> <b>network,</b> the elapsed time during a conversa-tion decrease. Geographic distance influence mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> and online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> differently. Communica-tion in online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is less location-sensitive than mobile <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> User communication in mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is in better accordance with social theories, whereas in online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> it performs inconsistently.

40|$|As {{the need}} for <b>social</b> <b>network</b> data {{publishing}} continues to increase, how to preserve {{the privacy of the}} <b>social</b> <b>network</b> data before publishing is becoming an important and challenging issue. A common approach to address this issue is through anonymization of the <b>social</b> <b>network</b> structure. The problem with altering the structure of the links relationship in <b>social</b> <b>network</b> data is how to balance between the gain of privacy and the loss of information (data utility). In this paper, we address this problem. We propose a utility-aware <b>social</b> <b>network</b> graph anonymization. The approach is based on a new metric that calculates the utility impact of <b>social</b> <b>network</b> link modification. The metric utilizes the shortest path length and the neighborhood overlap as the utility value. The value is then used as a weight factor in preserving structural integrity in the <b>social</b> <b>network</b> graph anonymization. For any modification made to the <b>social</b> <b>network</b> links, the proposed approach guarantees that the distance between vertices in the modified <b>social</b> <b>network</b> stays as close as the original <b>social</b> <b>network</b> graph prior to the modification.

25|$|Many <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> {{provide an}} online {{environment}} {{for people to}} communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes.

Most of these <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons. This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, {{but at the same}} time people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. <b>Social</b> <b>networks</b> do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.|$|E

30|$|A <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is a <b>social</b> {{structure}} [23 – 27] {{among individuals}} known as actors or organisations. The <b>social</b> <b>network</b> also defines {{a group of}} actors connected {{by a set of}} relationships that are continuously changing. The crucial factor here is relationships among actors that are required for construction of a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> [28]. Hence, as an important research area, developing a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> focuses relationships associated with the actors. Once a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is constructed, it could be used to analyse knowledge discovery, finding access, searching actors, groups, relations, etc. In general, developing a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> [29] covers the area of any network, and metrics used are based on the mathematics of graph theory [30 – 32] regardless of the connections. After constructing a <b>social</b> <b>network,</b> its ultimate goal is sharing knowledge [33 – 36]. In summary, a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> consists of an actor, and its relevant information and association. Thus, an actor model in a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is essential in precisely determining relation among the actors.|$|R
