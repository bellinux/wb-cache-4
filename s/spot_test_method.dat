50|$|NDT methods may {{rely upon}} use of {{electromagnetic}} radiation, sound, and inherent {{properties of materials}} to examine samples. This includes some kinds of microscopy to examine external surfaces in detail, although sample preparation techniques for metallography, optical microscopy and electron microscopy are generally destructive as the surfaces must be made smooth through polishing or the sample must be electron transparent in thickness. The inside of a sample can be examined with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons or terahertz radiation. Sound waves are utilized {{in the case of}} ultrasonic testing. Contrast between a defect and the bulk of the sample may be enhanced for visual examination by the unaided eye by using liquids to penetrate fatigue cracks. One method (liquid penetrant testing) involves using dyes, fluorescent or non-fluorescent, in fluids for non-magnetic materials, usually metals. Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either liquid or dry dust) that are applied to a part while it is in an externally magnetized state (magnetic-particle testing). The particles will be attracted to leakage fields within the test object, and form on the objects surface. Magnetic particle testing can reveal surface & some sub-surface defects within the part.Thermoelectric effect (or use of the Seebeck effect) uses thermal properties of an alloy to quickly and easily characterize many alloys. The chemical test, or chemical <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> <b>method,</b> utilizes application of sensitive chemicals that can indicate the presence of individual alloying elements. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical fatigue crack sensors, utilize the tendency of metal structural material to oxidize readily in order to detect progressive damage.|$|E

Computer-based examination techniques {{are becoming more}} popular among medical educators worldwide. Therefore incorporating the computer interface in practical spot testing is a novel concept that may minimize the shortcomings of traditional methods. Assessing students’ attitudes and perspectives is vital in understanding how students perceive the novel method. Methods: One hundred and sixty medical students were randomly allocated to either a computer-based spot test (n= 80) or a traditional spot test (n= 80). The students rated their attitudes and perspectives regarding the <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> soon after the test. The results were described comparatively. Results: Students had higher positive attitudes towards the computer-based practical spot test compared to the traditional spot test.

40|$|Meehan, ChristopherThe {{objective}} of the study presented in this thesis is to investigate the use of continuous compaction control (CCC) systems within an earthwork compaction specification framework. For this purpose, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) funded a field study to construct a small-scale soil embankment, utilizing CCC technology simultaneously with conventional in situ compaction verification <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> during the construction process. The material {{that was used to}} build the embankment classified as poorly-graded sand with silt. The CCC roller measured machine drive power (MDP) values, compaction meter values (CMV), and corresponding global positioning system (GPS) location values. For conventional in situ compaction verification, numerous density-based quality assurance <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> (e. g., Nuclear Density Gauge and Sand Cone) and modulus-based <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> (e. g., Lightweight Deflectometer and GeoGauge) were performed. A holistic analysis of the data collected from the field study was performed to assess the use of CCC systems in an earthwork compaction specification framework. The first goal {{of this study was to}} examine the possibility of using data recorded by CCC systems to monitor and control the thickness of compacted soil lifts during earthwork operations. During the field study, the compaction roller utilized a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) to determine the three dimensional location of the compactor in real-time. Data collected from the field study was then used to demonstrate how GPS measurements recorded by CCC equipment could be used for field monitoring of lift thickness. The use of simple and sophisticated geospatial interpolation techniques were examined for interpolating measured field elevation data onto a uniform grid for lift thickness evaluation. The approach that is presented can be used to build spatial maps of compacted soil lift thickness, which are a useful decision-making tool for field inspectors. The second goal of this study was to perform statistical regression analyses to compare the results of the in situ <b>spot</b> <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> with the two CCC measurements (MDP and CMV) that were recorded during the compaction process. In order to accurately compare the in situ <b>spot</b> <b>testing</b> measurements and CCC measurements, Nearest Neighbor, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Ordinary Kriging interpolation techniques were utilized to predict CCC measurements at the corresponding in situ <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> locations. In general, regression analyses performed using the CCC predictions from the Ordinary Kriging method showed slightly higher correlations, however, the difference did not appear significant enough to outweigh the complex nature of this geospatial interpolation technique. Univariate regression analysis was performed first for point-by-point comparisons of the data and then on a data set which comprised of average values for each lift and pass. The point-by-point comparisons yielded weak correlations, while the comparison of the average value data sets showed much stronger correlations; this finding agrees well with observations that have been reported by other researchers. As other researchers have also reported that moisture content can drastically affect the compaction process and resulting density of soil, additional analyses using a multivariate regression technique were performed, which introduced the use of in situ measured moisture content as an independent variable. The results from these regression correlations showed generally much stronger correlation between the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements for both the point-by-point and average data sets. This observation provided confirmation of the influence of moisture content on the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements. The final goal of the study was to evaluate the use of CCC technology within an earthwork compaction specification framework. To accomplish this goal, implementation of existing CCC compaction verification acceptance criteria using the data collected from the aforementioned field study was performed. The acceptance criteria that were assessed include: <b>spot</b> <b>testing</b> of roller measured weakest areas, limiting percentage change in roller measured values, and comparison of roller measured values to in situ measured values. Each of the three acceptance criteria show potential for implementation into an earthwork specification; however, since the <b>spot</b> <b>testing</b> of roller measured weakest areas method still utilizes conventional in situ methods, it shows the most promise for immediate adoption and transition into CCC technology.

With a lot of research been carried out on bacteriocins produced by Gram positive bacteria, antagonist to Gram positive food borne pathogens, little is known about bacteriocins produced by Gram negative bacteria which would be active against Gram negative food borne pathogens that predominate in produce. The objective of my research therefore is to screen for antimicrobial antagonist to Gram negative food borne pathogens (Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella Enteritidis) from produce, to determine an appropriate screening method, to carry out a preliminary characterization of antagonist discovered and also to determine antimicrobial spectrum of antagonist found. Lettuce was screened for antimicrobial antagonist against Gram negative pathogen (Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella Enteritidis) which were used as indicator strains With over 5000 colonies screen, 1 colony (Serratia plymuthica) was discovered to be antagonistic against these indicator strain.

40|$|Abstract Background IgA {{nephropathy}} (IgAN) is {{the most}} common glomerulonephritis, which may also coexist with other diseases. We present two patients with an unusual coincidence of IgAN and Fabry disease (FD). Case presentation A 26 year-old man underwent a renal biopsy in February 2001. Histopathology showed very advanced IgAN and vascular changes as a result of hypertension. Because of his progressive renal insufficiency the patient began hemodialysis in August 2001. By means of the blood <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> screening <b>method</b> the diagnosis of FD was suspected. Low activity of alpha-galactosidase A in the patient’s plasma and leukocytes and DNA analysis confirmed the diagnosis of FD. Enzyme replacement therapy started in July 2004. Then the patient underwent kidney transplantation in November 2005. Currently, his actual serum creatinine level is 250 μmol/l. Other organ damages included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, neuropathic pain and febrile crisis. After enzyme replacement therapy, myocardial hypertrophy has stabilized and other symptoms have disappeared. No further progression of the disease has been noted. The other patient, a 30 year-old woman, suffered from long-term hematuria with a good renal function. Recently, proteinuria (2. 6 g/day) appeared and a renal biopsy was performed. Histopathology showed IgAN with remarkably enlarged podocytes. A combination of IgAN and a high suspicion of FD was diagnosed. Electron microscopy revealed dense deposits in paramesangial areas typical for IgAN and podocytes with inclusive zebra bodies and myelin figures characteristic of FD. FD was confirmed by the decreased alpha-galactosidase A activity in plasma and leukocytes and by DNA and RNA analysis. Enzyme replacement therapy and family screening were initiated. Conclusions Our results emphasize the role of complexity in the process of diagnostic evaluation of kidney biopsy samples. Electron microscopy represents an integral part of histopathology, and genetic analysis plays a more and more important role in the final diagnosis, which is followed by causal treatment. </p...|$|R
