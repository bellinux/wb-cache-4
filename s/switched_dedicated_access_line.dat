40|$|The {{decline of}} the world’s fisheries, and the {{inability}} of traditional management frameworks to maintain them, has led managers to adopt new, alternative management frameworks. Alternative management frameworks include marine protected areas (MPA) and <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> privileges (DAP).

In this thesis, commercial fishers’ preference for alternative management frameworks is examined {{in the context of the}} unique multispecies fisheries of the Florida Keys.

Furthermore, fishers who are organized are less likely to support <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> privilege frameworks.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{fisheries management}} objectives of maximizing yield and employment lead to heavily exploited stocks. Many current high-profile disputes arise from conflicting objectives, {{and the proposed}} solutions to "the fisheries problem" are primarily particular stakeholders' efforts to have managers implement their own objectives. I suggest many "failures" are in fact successes for other objectives. Fisheries objectives, as reflected in management actions, are changing. Two current trends are the acceptance of objectives that value less disturbed ecosystems and acceptance of fisheries allocation through <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> to improve the fisheries' economic efficiency. I suggest that increased use of <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> will result in more congruent objectives and less conflict.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of TCP over random and <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> methods {{in the context of}} DVB-RCS 2. Random access methods introduce a lower connection delay compared to dedicated methods. We investigate the poten- tial to improve {{the performance of}} short flows in regards to transmission delay, over random access methods for DVB- RCS 2 that is currently under development. Our simulation experiments show that the transmission of the first ten IP datagrams of each TCP flow can be 500 ms faster with ran- dom <b>access</b> than with <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> making the former of interest to carry Internet traffic. Such methods, however, are less efficient in regards to bandwidth usage than <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> mecanisms and less reliable in overloaded network conditions. Two aspects of channel usage optimization can be distinguished: reducing the duration of ressource utiliza- tion with random access methods, or increasing the spec- trum efficiency with <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> methods. This article argues that service providers may let low-cost users exploit the DVB-RCS 2 to browse the web by introducing different services, which choice is based on the channel access method.

40|$|The {{specifications}} of Digital Video Broadcasting - Return Channel via Satellite(DVB-RCS 2) {{state that}} the satellite gateway could introduce both random and <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> methods to distribute the capacity among the different home users. Before starting an engineering process to design an algorithm allowing to combine both methods, it seems necessary to assess the performance of each. This paper compares random and <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> methods by measuring {{their impact on the}} performance of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions when the home users exploit the DVB-RCS 2 link for regular use (e. g., web browsing or email transmission). In this paper we detail the implementation of an NS- 2 module emulating Physical Channel Access (PCA). This module fills a gap in terms of random and deterministic access methods and allows to model various satellite channel access strategies. Based on NS- 2 simulations using realistic system parameters of the DVB-RCS 2 link, we demonstrate that, compared to <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> methods, which generally result in higher levels of transmitted data, random access methods enable faster transmission for short flows. We propose to combine random and <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> methods, with the selection of a specific method dependent on the dynamic load of the network and the sequence number of the TCP segments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For Internet service {{providers}} (ISPs) the proper dimensioning of Internet <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> is essential. Under-dimensioning generally {{leads to a}} less than acceptable end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the subscribers, and over-dimensioning is generally too expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate empirically that the Generalised Processor Sharing (GPS) model {{can be used to}} accurately describe the flow-level characteristics of the traffic carried by Internet <b>access</b> <b>lines,</b> based on analysis of IP packet-level traces with hundreds of subscribers connected to the Internet over high-speed <b>access</b> <b>lines.</b> Using properties of the GPS-model, we establish simple relations between the <b>access</b> <b>line</b> capacity and the utilisation of the <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> {{on the one hand and}} the download times of Internet objects on the other hand. Subsequently, we study the impact of the TCP slow start algorithm on the download times of objects. We propose simple and fast approximations for the average object download time as a function of the object size, encompassing the effect of the round-trip times, maximum window size and modem speed. Empirical data demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations. ...|$|R

From a historical focus exclusively on financial metrics of performance, the emphasis has shifted recently to a consideration of a portfolio of non-financial performance metrics related to customers, business process and technology. In this paper, we investigate the best practice frontier relationship between a financial performance metric (return on assets - ROA) and three nonfinancial performance metrics (number of <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> per employee, percentage of digital <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> and percentage of business <b>access</b> <b>lines)</b> reported and used in the U.

Analyzing detailed data from over fifty local exchange carriers for a period of five years (from 1993 to 1997), we find that managers must tradeoff contemporaneous ROA when increasing the percentage of business <b>access</b> <b>lines.</b> We also find that managers do not have to trade off ROA with the other two nonfinancial performance metrics because these metrics are contemporaneously congruent...|$|R
