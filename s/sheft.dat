50|$|By {{the second}} {{semester}} of {{his junior year}} Ed Helvey had recruited {{a core group of}} more than 25 students who became the foundation of The Voice of Montclair State. Mr. Tete Tetens, Jr., an Education professor and coincidentally, a broadcast engineer licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) who worked part-time for WPAT at its Clifton, NJ AM transmitter site, became the faculty adviser. Additionally, Mr. Helvey had the support of Miss Emma Fantone, Coordinator, and Mr. Ted <b>Sheft,</b> Associate Coordinator, of the Audio-Visual Center. They provided the initial studio space for the first WVMS studio in College Hall, the college administration building. Mr. Helvey gained the support of Dr. Thomas Richardson, President of the College, Erik Engel, president, John Van Emden, treasurer and the other officers and student representatives of the Student Government Association, Mr. Gary Leo, Director of Student Activities, the College Life Union Board and the Montclarion. The Voice of Montclair State was also the recipient of the funds raised by the 1966 annual MSC Carnival, providing seed money to get the organization launched. The Student Government Association granted The Voice of Montclair State's petition to be chartered as a Class A organization, which meant that it would receive annual funding from the student activity fees paid by every MSC student as did The Montclarion, the campus newspaper. This was the first new Class A chartered organization in over 20 years. Ed Helvey and his team of motivated fellow students accomplished a lot in {{a very short period of}} time.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1958, the Atlanta Public School system's segregationist {{policies}} were successfully challenged in federal court. Pace Academy and other nearby private schools {{such as the}} Lovett School and the Westminster Schools were all-white and refused students of color for their early history while receiving a surge in applications and corresponding growth. It is not listed when Pace Academy desegregated, but it was likely in the late 1960s or early 1970s, many years after the lauded if mixed success of Atlanta Public Schools' integration in 1961, and the same as its peers. Pace Academy is situated on 37 acres in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood. The school's landmark building, the Castle, was constructed as a private residence in 1932 for the Ogden family. Pace Academy was incorporated on June 30, 1958, with an initial enrollment of 178 students, {{for the purpose of}} “training and educating children and operating a school and kindergarten.” Frank Kaley was hired as Pace's first headmaster in 1959. During the period from 1958 to 1962, the Ogden house was renovated to accommodate administrative offices and classrooms, and a playground was developed for the younger children. In 1961, a building was added housing classrooms, a cafeteria, and a library. Athletic fields were established during this time. During this time period, Pace allowed the First Montessori Class of Atlanta (now Springmont) to establish itself in an empty classroom. In 1964, Pace graduated its first class, with 13 students receiving diplomas. Further improvements to Pace’s athletic facilities were made in 1966 when the school constructed a gymnasium and enlarged the athletic field. This facility was dedicated to the memory of William T. Boyd, who had served as an outstanding president of the Pace Parents Club. In 1971, Bridges Hall was constructed and named in honor of Russell Bridges, who had served as chairman of Pace’s Board of Trustees for 10 years. It housed the Lower School, some Upper School classrooms and the present library. Improvements to the athletic facilities included the addition of a swimming pool and tennis courts. In 1972, George G. Kirkpatrick assumed leadership of the school. Further additions to classroom facilities were made in 1973, along with a new driveway system and additional parking. With the help of Anne and Mills Bee Lane, the gardens were restored in that year. Although from its incorporation, Pace was accredited by the Georgia Accreditation Committee for its educational programs, 1973 saw the accreditation of Pace by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1976 the Randall property adjacent to Pace became available and a fundraising drive was launched to purchase the property. First used to house Pace’s Fine Arts programs in art and music, the Randall House offered Pace the possibility of providing separate classroom facilities for the Upper and Lower Schools. With the concurrence of the Atlanta zoning commission and the input of Pace neighbors, a long-range plan for the further development of the Pace campus was approved by the Board of Trustees. This plan called for major facility improvements to be undertaken in three phases: an addition to the Randall House to house the Lower School in one facility, construction of a fine arts center and auditorium, and construction of an additional gymnasium. In 1981-83, the Keep Pace with Progress campaign was conducted to achieve {{the first phase of the}} Pace campus development plan. Almost $3 million was pledged to build the Lower School addition, build a playground adjacent to the Lower School, and to renovate the classrooms vacated by the Lower School program for improved science facilities, computer labs, and an expanded library for Upper School students. With the completion of this project, the Board of Trustees updated its long-range plan and focused on three priorities for the Inspiring the Best campaign: construction of a fine arts center, expansion and improvement of athletic and parking facilities and increased endowment. This campaign was approved by the Board of Trustees in 1987 and raised $7.2 million. The opening of the Fine Arts Center on September 18, 1990 inaugurated a new stage in Pace’s development. Peter Cobb was named headmaster in 1994, the same year the Castle was officially named Kirkpatrick Hall, in honor of George G. Kirkpatrick, who had led Pace through its greatest growth. Following Cobb's resignation in 1996, Michael A. Murphy, who had served as head of Lower School for seven years, served as Interim Headmaster until February 1997 when he was named Headmaster. In spring 1997, following a gift of $2 million by the Hugh M. Inman Foundation, the Educating for Life - Pace 2000 capital campaign was launched, with a goal of $16 million. This goal included $7.8 million for the Inman Center, a student activity center with state of the art athletic facilities, a new cafeteria, faculty offices, and additional parking. The Inman Center was opened in January 2000. In addition, the campaign funded new athletic fields and tennis courts, renovated classroom space in the Upper School, and established an endowment supplement of almost $4 million. During Murphy's tenure, Pace embarked on a campaign to build a new Middle School building, and out of that the Campaign for The Middle School was born. After only 16 months the school had raised the necessary $16 million to build the new facility, which houses grades 6, 7, and 8. Additionally, the Board completed a five-year strategic plan. In fall 2005 Pace welcomed its fifth Head of School, Fred Assaf. He was installed at the opening of school and Mayor Shirley Franklin was the guest speaker. The board of trustees embarked on an ambitious long-range plan and master campus plan. These documents, called for in the Strategic Plan, outlined the commitment of Pace to remain a small, family school which educated the whole child. In 2007 the school resolved longstanding issues with the neighborhood association and entered into an historic agreement which provided for both preserving the small family feel of Pace and expanding the facilities to accommodate a moderate increase in enrollment. As a part of this plan, Pace realized its need to acquire expanded athletic facilities and acquired two parcels, an eight-acre baseball/softball complex on Warren Road and a 23-acre tract on Riverview Road in Cobb County, which will be built into a track & field facility, a new stadium for soccer, lacrosse and football with seating for 2000, an additional soccer/lacrosse/football field, and a new varsity baseball field. The board also authorized SHINE, The Pace Capital Campaign for $32 million that will help build the new athletic facilities, refurbish and add onto the Lower School, and enhance the endowment for faculty. During summer 2012, Pace Academy launched a new capital campaign with a purpose of building a new high school. The campaign was led by Elizabeth Richards and Robert <b>Sheft,</b> and had an objective of raising a little over $32,000,000. The campaign's lead donor was Arthur Blank, who was both the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and a Pace parent. It will be named The Arthur M. Blank Family Upper School.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Most {{existing}} workflow scheduling algorithms only {{consider a}} computing {{environment in which}} the number of compute resources is bounded. Compute resources in such an environment usually cannot be provisioned or released on demand of the size of a workflow, and these resources are not released to the environment until an execution of the workflow completes. To address the problem, we firstly formalize a model of a Cloud environment and a workflow graph representation for such an environment. Then, we propose the <b>SHEFT</b> workflow scheduling algorithm to schedule a workflow elastically on a Cloud computing environment. Our preliminary experiments show that <b>SHEFT</b> not only outperforms several representative workflow scheduling algorithms in optimizing workflow execution time, but also enables resources to scale elastically at runtime.

30|$|Lin and Lu [64] propose an {{algorithm}} named <b>SHEFT,</b> Scalable HEFT (Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time). The authors {{claim that}} resources within one cluster usually {{share the same}} network communication, so {{they have the same}} data transfer rate with each other. While there might be network utilization fluctuations during the execution of a workflow (and even in idle state) that invalidate this assumption, the fact is that even locally (in the same node) there is data access imbalance due to contention – concurrency to access the same resources, in this case I/O. For example, if two containers (or virtual machines) located in the same node attempt to access a file or a network stream, they will naturally compete for resources. There is not clear support to dynamic scheduling to address reliability-related issues or performance fluctuations. The solution supports workflows but there are no details on how workflows are modeled or mapped into execution space.|$|E
40|$|A {{multi-channel}} model, {{describing the}} effects of spectral and temporal integration in amplitude-modulation detection for a stochastic noise carrier, is proposed and validated. The model {{is based on the}} modulation filterbank concept which was established in the accompanying paper [Dau et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 102, 2892 – 2905 (1997) ] for modulation perception in narrow-band conditions (single-channel model). To integrate information across frequency, the detection process of the model linearly combines the channel outputs. To integrate information across time, a kind of 2 ̆ 2 multiple-look 2 ̆ 2 strategy, is realized within the detection stage of the model. Both data from the literature and new data are used to validate the model. The model predictions agree with the results of Eddins [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 93, 470 – 479 (1993) ] that the 2 ̆ 2 time constants 2 ̆ 2 associated with the temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTF) derived for narrow-band stimuli do not vary with carrier frequency region and that they decrease monotonically with increasing stimulus bandwidth. The model is able to predict masking patterns in the modulation-frequency domain, as observed experimentally by Houtgast [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 85, 1676 – 1680 (1989) ]. The model also accounts for the finding by <b>Sheft</b> and Yost [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 88, 796 – 805 (1990) ] that the long 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 integration time constants derived from the data are two orders of magnitude larger than the time constants derived from the cutoff frequency of the TMTF. Finally, the temporal-summation properties of the model allow the prediction of data in a specific temporal paradigm used earlier by Viemeister and Wakefield [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 90, 858 – 865 (1991) ]. The combination of the modulation filterbank concept and the optimal decision algorithm proposed here appears to present a powerful strategy for describing modulation-detection phenomena in narrow-band and broadband conditions...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} scientific advances {{are increasingly}} achieved through complex scientific processes. As the exponential growth in computing technologies and scientific data, a scientific workflow may comprise {{a large number}} of heterogeneous scientific services and applications, provided by different organizations. These services, applications, and their associated data are usually distributed across heterogeneous computing environments. The integration and management of such scientific workflows are pushing the limits of current workflow technology. This dissertation presents an integrated solution to composing, scheduling, executing and developing scientific workflows and scientific workflow management systems. To provide a foundation for workflow composition, scheduling, execution and management, we propose the first reference architecture for scientific workflow management systems. The reference architecture not only provides a high-level organization of subsystems and their interactions in a workflow system, but also provides a basis for comparison between different systems and a guidance for the architectural design of an SWFMS in a specific scientific domain. To integrate heterogeneous services and applications and enable them composed to workflows, we propose a task template model which not only provides an appropriate abstraction of heterogeneous services and applications, but also encapsulates the composition and mapping of shims and functional task components within a task interface. Our proposed task specification language (TSL) not only integrates heterogeneous services and applications into uniform workflow tasks, but also provides a solution to address both TYPE-I and TYPE-II shimming problems in composing scientific workflows. To schedule scientific workflows in emerging services computing environments, we propose two workflow scheduling algorithms, the <b>SHEFT</b> algorithm and the SCPOR algorithm, to prioritize tasks in a workflow, map tasks onto suitable resources and order the execution of tasks on the assigned resources, so that the workflow makespan can be minimized. Our extensive experiments have shown that our proposed algorithms not only outperform other algorithms for large-scale, data-intensive and compute intensive workflows, but also allow the assigned resources elastically change on demand of the size of workflows. To execute workflows on distributed computing environments, we propose a task run model to model the run-time behaviors of tasks. The proposed task run description language (TRDL) enables the execution of task instances constructed from heterogeneous services and applications. We also develop an SOA based task management subsystem to manage all task templates, task instances and task runs for the invocation and execution of various heterogeneous task components. Finally, our developed SOA based workflow management system, the VIEW system, and a VIEW based workflow application system, the FiberFlow system, validate our architectures, models, languages, and algorithms...|$|E
