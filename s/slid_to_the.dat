25|$|On 17 January 2008, a British Airways Boeing 777-236ER, G-YMMM, {{operating}} flight BA038 from Beijing, crash-landed at Heathrow. The aircraft landed on grass {{short of the}} south runway, then <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the runway and stopped on the threshold, leading to eighteen minor injuries. The aircraft was later found to have suffered loss of thrust caused by fuel icing.|$|E

A month later the Predators of the NHL signed Jones to a three-year entry-level contract.|$|E

The aircraft struck the ground nose first and <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of a hill, where the empennage (tail section) broke off. [...] "As the [...] cleared the second hill, it rolled over. The fuselage broke up as the [...] rolled.

2500|$|On September 7, 2007, two Portland-area climbers were {{ascending}} {{a technical}} {{approach to the}} Pearly Gates at early afternoon when one <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the Bergschrund and sustained injuries sufficient for him to call for rescue assistance. [...] His partner decided it was too dangerous to descend the frozen gravel and loose rock face and remained in place. [...] Rescuers arrived about five hours later, assessed the fallen climber, treated minor injuries and belayed him walking down. [...] The other climber required technical climbing equipment and was assisted down the Bergschrund. [...] He walked down and joined his partner about dawn at a Timberline snowcat {{at the top of}} the ski area.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "air drop" [...] {{sequence}} {{was conceived}} by stunt coordinator, Spiro Razatos, who also supervised on the franchise's two previous installments; Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6. Razatos told Business Insider {{that he wanted}} to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to [...] "feel real" [...] and fulfill audience's expectations. The stunt took months of prep-solving problems. Cameras needed to be mounted onto cars {{in a way that they}} would not be destroyed when the cars landed, and the crew had to figure out a safe way to get the cars out of the plane. They performed a dry run with a single car falling out of a plane and did this six times. Cars were dropped from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules high above the Arizona desert, but close up shots that show the cars landing on a mountain road were filmed in Colorado. There were two airplanes, flying at a height of 12,000 feet, each dropping two cars apiece. BRS parachutes enabled with GPS were secured to each of the cars before dropping off the C-130 plane. At about 5,000 feet, the parachutes deployed. Over 10 cameras were used for the sequence. In addition to cameras on the ground, there were cameras remotely operated inside the plane and another three mounted outside each car. Additional cameras were on a helicopter, where Razatos was stationed watching monitors. Three skydivers used in the shoot wore helmet cameras to help shoot the sequence from multiple angles. Sky divers would either jump out before cars or after them. While all the cars landed on their drop zones, 70% landed perfectly and 30% didn't. For the close-up scenes which show the actors inside their cars, a giant gimbal with a 360-degree range of movement were attached to each of the cars and was filmed against a green screen to reproduce their tumble through the sky. The last part of the scene, which shows the cars hitting the road was shot separately. To get that right, the team set up a pulley system that had cars six to ten feet above the ground. When they were dropped from the cranes, the stuntmen who were sitting in the driver's seats raced their engines at about 35 to 40 miles per hour and <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground at full speed. Those cranes were then later removed from the film with computers. Razatos admits that the air drop sequence was [...] "all real" [...] and that it would be [...] "hard to top".|$|E

40|$|Ensuring {{effective}} lubrication between {{sliding surfaces}} {{is one of}} the challenges in the field of tribology. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conventional parameters like speed, load, contact geometry and material parameters, the surface texture also influences the coefficient of friction. In the present investigation, the effect of surface texture on coefficient of friction under boundary lubricated condition was studied by sliding Al- 4 Mg alloy pins against EN 8 steel discs of various surface textures using pin-on-disc machine. Both isotropic and directional textures were generated on the surfaces of the discs. Scanning Electron Microscopy and optical profilometer studies were carried out on the contact surfaces of both the pins and discs before and after the experiments. The result showed that the coefficient of friction varied considerably with surface textures. In addition, maximum value coefficient of friction was observed when pins <b>slid</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uni-directional texture and minimum when pins slid on random texture. Backscattered scanning electron micrographs revealed the transfer of iron from <b>the</b> disc <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pins and it was highest when pins <b>slid</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uni-directional texture and least for the random texture. However, no transfer layer of Al-Mg alloy was observed on the steel disc...|$|R

This paper uses the newly available longitudinal Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (<b>SLID)</b> <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> factors influencing elderly households' residential mobility choices. A dynamic non-linear panel (longitudinal) data dynamic model is employed.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{unidirectional}} grinding marks were attained on the steel plates. Then aluminium (Al) pins were slid at 0. 2 °, 0. 6 °, 1. 0 °, 1. 4 °, 1. 8 °, 2. 2 ° and 2. 6 ° tilt angles {{of the plate}} with the grinding marks perpendicular and parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sliding direction under both dry and lubricated conditions using a pin-on-plate inclined sliding tester <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> influence of tilt angle and grinding marks direction of the plate on coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation. It was observed that the transfer layer formation and the coefficient of friction depend primarily on the grinding marks direction of the harder mating surface. Stick-slip phenomenon was observed only under lubricated conditions. For the case of pins <b>slid</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unidirectional grinding marks stick-slip phenomenon was observed for tilt angles exceeding 0. 6 °, the amplitude of which increases with increasing tilt angles. However, for the case of <b>the</b> pins <b>slid</b> parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unidirectional grinding marks the stick-slip phenomena was observed for angles exceeding 2. 2 °, the amplitude of which also increases with increasing tilt angle. The presence of stick-slip phenomena under lubricated conditions could be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> molecular deformation of the lubricant component confined between asperities...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{unidirectional}} grinding marks were created {{on a set}} of steel plates. Sliding experiments were then conducted with the prepared steel plates using Al-Mg alloy pins and an inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester. The goals of <b>the</b> experiments were <b>to</b> ascertain <b>the</b> influence of inclination angle and grinding mark direction on friction and transfer layer formation during sliding contact. The inclination angle of the plate was held at 0. 2 deg, 0. 6 deg, 1 deg, 1. 4 deg, 1. 8 deg, 2. 2 deg, and 2. 6 deg in the tests. The pins were slid both perpendicular and parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grinding marks direction. The experiments were conducted under both dry and lubricated conditions on each plate in an ambient environment. Results showed that the coefficient of friction and the formation of transfer layer depend on the grinding marks direction and inclination angle of the hard surfaces. For a given inclination angle, under both dry and lubricated conditions, the coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation were found to be greater when <b>the</b> pins <b>slid</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unidirectional grinding marks than when <b>the</b> pins <b>slid</b> parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grinding marks. In addition, a stick-slip phenomenon was observed under lubricated conditions at the highest inclination angle for sliding perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grinding marks direction. This phenomenon could be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent of plane strain conditions taking place at the asperity level during sliding. DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4002604...|$|R
