5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The <b>sloughed</b> skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Under a light microscope, {{the spores}} {{are seen to}} be smooth, {{elliptical}} to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5µm. The gill cystidia are seen to stain blue when cotton blue dye and lactate are applied. The cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100µm thick layer of gelatinous hyphae that are about 2–4µm thick. The gelatinous hyphae are only present on the cap surface, not {{the surface of the}} stem; these local differences in cell structure explain the ease with which the scales are <b>sloughed</b> off the cap, but not the stems of the fruit bodies. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail.|$|E
25|$|Rotating {{biological}} contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film {{secondary treatment}} systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in Germany in 1960 and {{have since been}} developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are <b>sloughed</b> off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the <b>sloughed</b> biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.|$|E

25|$|Leaving the {{mouthparts}} (incorrectly {{referred to}} as 'the head') embedded in the skin is usually of lesser concern. If left embedded the mouthparts cause a foreign body reaction and are usually eventually <b>sloughed</b> like a splinter. It has been noted that when Ixodes holocyclus is forcibly extracted the feeding tube (the hypostome) is usually damaged which suggests that part of its tip remains embedded in the skin.|$|E
25|$|Epidermis {{is divided}} into several layers where cells are formed through mitosis at the {{innermost}} layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with keratin. They eventually reach the top layer called stratum corneum and are <b>sloughed</b> off, or desquamated. This process is called keratinization and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.|$|E
25|$|Crop milk is a thick cheesy substance, {{derived from}} {{squamous}} cells <b>sloughed</b> {{off from the}} crop of {{both male and female}} pigeons which promotes a high growth rate in squabs. There are no studies of the composition of crop milk specific to Ducula. However, in domestic pigeons (Columba livia), the crop milk is found to contain lipids, proteins and enzymes, and also facilitates the transfer of maternal antibodies to squabs, as in mammals. The hypertrophy of crop tissue and production of crop milk is determined by the hormone prolactin, as in mammals.|$|E

25|$|In humans, {{the protein}} is encoded by the RB1 gene located on {{chromosome}} 13—more specifically, 13q14.1-q14.2. If both alleles of this gene are mutated early in life, the protein is inactivated {{and results in}} development of retinoblastoma cancer, hence the name Rb. Retinal cells are not <b>sloughed</b> off or replaced, and are subjected {{to high levels of}} mutagenic UV radiation, and thus most pRB knock-outs occur in retinal tissue (but it's also been documented in certain skin cancers in patients from New Zealand where the amount of UV radiation is significantly higher).|$|E
25|$|Sentinel {{cells in}} Dictyostelium discoideum are {{phagocytic}} cells responsible for removing toxic {{material from the}} slug stage of the social cycle. Generally round in shape, these cells are present within the slug sheath where they {{are found to be}} circulating freely. The detoxification process occurs when these cells engulf toxins and pathogens within the slug through phagocytosis. Then, the cells clump into groups of five to ten cells, which then attach to the inner sheath of the slug. The sheath is <b>sloughed</b> off as the slug migrates to a new site in search of food bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of dissection flourished under Aryan rule during the 7th and 8th century. It was under their rule that medical education was standardized. This created {{a need to}} better understand human anatomy, so as to have educated surgeons. Dissection was limited by the religious taboo on cutting the human body. This changed the approach taken to accomplish the goal. The process involved the loosening of the tissues in streams of water before the outer layers were <b>sloughed</b> off with soft implements to reach the musculature. To perfect the technique of slicing, the prospective students used gourds and squash. These techniques of dissection gave rise to an advanced understanding of the anatomy and the enabled them to complete procedures used today, such as rhino-plasty.|$|E

25|$|These {{intestinal}} lining {{cells can}} then either store the iron as ferritin, which {{is accomplished by}} Fe3+ binding to apoferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is <b>sloughed</b> off into feces), or the cell can release it into the body via the only known iron exporter in mammals, ferroportin. Hephaestin, a ferroxidase that can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps ferroportin transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells. In contrast, ferroportin is post-translationally repressed by hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide hormone. The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, enterocytes synthesize more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to iron deficiency anemia. Iron absorption from diet is enhanced {{in the presence of}} vitamin C and diminished by excess calcium, zinc, or manganese.|$|E
500|$|In the {{organization}} of Rolf Singer, the species is placed in subgenus Pholiota, section Adiposae, [...] Subflammans—a grouping of closely related species that also includes P.subflammans and P.digilioi. The species in stirps Subflammans are characterised by having conspicuous erect tufts or scales on the cap surface that are easily <b>sloughed</b> off by rain and age {{in lieu of the}} gelatinous nature of the underlying cap cuticle. It is commonly known as the yellow Pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap.|$|E
500|$|When {{grown in}} humid conditions, such as might {{typically}} {{be found in}} a temperate deciduous forest, Calostoma species develop a thicker, more gelatinous exoperidium (the outermost peridial layer). As the stalk expands, the exoperidium becomes <b>sloughed</b> off, exposing the endoperidum and a raised peristome—the ridge of tissue around the opening suggestive of the common name, [...] "prettymouth". The exoperidium may help to protect the maturing gleba of late-fruiting species from harmful variations in temperature or humidity, or from insect predation.|$|E

500|$|The cap's {{surface is}} convex to flattened, {{more or less}} uneven and {{sometimes}} slightly depressed in the center. It is usually densely covered with [...] "hairs" [...] that give it a texture similar to felt or velvet; these hairs are <b>sloughed</b> off in age, leaving the caps of mature specimens smooth. Its shape varies from somewhat round to irregular, , or even as much as [...] wide {{as a result of}} confluence. The cap is initially whitish, but later turns slightly brownish, with irregular dark-brown to nearly black blotches where it is bruised. In maturity, the surface is fibrous and tough, scaly and jagged, grayish brown in {{the upper part of the}} cap, and somewhat woody. The flesh is a pale pinkish brown.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{structure}} {{contains some}} typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, {{such as the}} presence of highly cornified outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the <b>sloughed</b> skin. Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis, but {{this is an example of}} convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.|$|E
500|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} bodies is {{initially}} egg-shaped, then conical to convex before flattening out, reaching diameters between [...] It has deep narrow grooves reaching almost {{as far as the}} center of the cap. The surface color is a pale buff, tawny or cinnamon towards the center, but the color loses intensity when the mushroom is dry. The flesh is whitish, thin, fragile and barely deliquescent (auto-digesting). The gills are initially buff, then turn grayish brown. They are either free from attachment to the stem, or adnexed, meaning {{only a small portion of}} the gill is attached. The stem is whitish, very slender, and more or less equal in width throughout its length, or slightly thicker at the base; its dimensions are [...] by [...] thick. The stem surface of young specimens are pruinose—appearing to be coated with a minute layer of fine white particles; this eventually is <b>sloughed</b> off, leaving a smooth or silky surface. The odor and taste {{of the fruit}} bodies are not distinctive. The gills of this species do not autodigest with age, or barely do so; the fruit bodies tend to become more fragile with age.|$|E

500|$|The gills are {{typically}} narrow and crowded together, with a broadly adnate to nearly decurrent {{attachment to the}} stem and convex edges. They are a pallid brown when young, becoming tawny at maturity. Some short gills, called lamellulae, do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the longer gills. The stem ranges from [...] long, [...] thick at the apex, and stays equal in width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward. Initially solid, it becomes hollow {{from the bottom up}} as it matures. The membranous ring is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap, but may be <b>sloughed</b> off and missing in older specimens. Its color is initially whitish or light brown, but usually appears a darker rusty-brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on it. Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish-brown to bistre base. The lower portion of the stem has a thin coating of pallid [...] which eventually disappear and do not leave any scales. The spore print is rusty-brown.|$|E
500|$|The caps {{of young}} {{mushrooms}} are initially egg-shaped to conical, expanding to become [...] bell-shaped {{and up to}} 2cm (0.8in) in diameter. Initially, {{the margin of the}} cap is rolled inwards; it typically assumes a lighter color than the centre of the cap surface. Dark brown in color, the mushroom is distinguished by the presence of white speckles or scales on the cap and stem; these scales may disappear when they become <b>sloughed</b> off or washed away by rain, which can make the species hard to recognise. The thick gills have an adnate attachment to the stem (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem), and are white to light grey in colour, paler toward the edge. There are about 24–28 gills extending completely from the cap margin to the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (shorter gills does do not extend fully from the margin to the stem). The thin stem is up to 4cm (1.6in) high and 0.3cm (0.12in) wide, and does not have a ring. Young specimens will typically have whitish scales at the base; later, these will slough off and a felt-like whitish mycelium may be apparent. The mushroom have no distinctive odour. The spore print is white or cream. The edibility of the mushroom has not been reported.|$|E
500|$|The cap of M.leptocephala is [...] in diameter, and {{initially}} a fat conical shape with the margin pressed {{close to the}} stem. As the cap expands, it becomes broadly conic to convex, sometimes broadly bell-shaped, and sometimes convex with a flaring margin. The cap surface has a whitish sheen because of its [...] coating. The coating gradually sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth and moist. The cap shows radial grooves that outline {{the position of the}} gills underneath. Its color is initially dusky brownish-gray to blackish (after the pruinose coating has <b>sloughed</b> off), soon fading from dark to light gray and finally ashy-gray. The flesh is thin and fragile, grayish, and has a slightly sour (...) taste, and a weakly alkaline odor that strengthens in intensity if the flesh is crushed. The gills are narrow, equal in width throughout, ascending-adnate (the gills attach at much less than a right angle, appearing to curve upward toward stem) and toothed. They are subdistantly spaced, with 18–27 gills reaching the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) interspersed between them. The color of the gills is pallid or cinereous, with pallid and even edges. The stem is [...] long, 1–2mm thick, equal in width throughout, hollow, and very fragile. It is usually bluish-black initially (darker than the cap) but gradually turns sordid brownish-gray, and finally fades to pallid or cinereous. The surface is densely white-pruinose overall, but soon polished and translucent when the pruinose coating wears off. The stem base is nearly smooth to rather densely white-. The species has a distinctive bleach-like odor. Its edibility is currently unknown.|$|E
