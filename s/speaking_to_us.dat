2500|$|One of the stylistically most {{important}} developments of Han poetry {{can be found}} in the Nineteen Old Poems collection. Although extant versions exist only in later collections, particularly the Wen Xuan literary compendium, the 19 poems themselves appear to be from the Han period. They are influential both toward the gushi ("old style") poetic form, but also for their [...] "tone of brooding melancholy....Anonymous voices <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from a shadowy past, they sound a note of sadness that is to dominate the poetry of the centuries that follow." [...] Many versions of these 19 poems thus continued to be reinvented in post-Han times, including a major revival in Tang poetry times. As Nineteen Old Poems literally means [...] "19 gushi, poetry written in inspiration by this style were referred to as being in the gushi style, or simply labeled gushi (also transcribed as ku-shi, in English).|$|E

He was very much alive, and we alternately laughed at his quaint conceits or pondered the implications of his casual remarks. It was precisely as if a rollicking Western, or, rather, Southern, man were <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> over the 'phone. I asked: [...] "Who are you? Is 'Wilbur' your surname?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ARIEL was {{downstairs in}} the shadowy hall, half asleep, half awake, waiting to see the {{visitors}} clear of the house. Without <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> without looking at us, she led {{the way down the}} dark garden walk, and locked the gate behind us. [...] "Good-night, Ariel," [...] I called out to her over the paling. Nothing answered me but the tramp of her heavy footsteps returning to the house, and the dull thump, a moment afterward, of the closing door.|$|E
6000|$|Ere long, however, Mr. Sherwin {{entered the}} room again, and effectually roused me by {{approaching}} and <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> I saw that I had stayed long enough, {{and that we were}} not to be left together again, that night. So I rose and took my leave, having first fixed a time for seeing Margaret on the morrow. Mr. Sherwin accompanied me with great ceremony to the outer door. Just as I was leaving him, he touched me on the arm, and said in his most confidential tones: ...|$|E

"Miss Flite," [...] said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, {{as if he}} were {{appealing}} to her while <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and laying his hand gently on her arm, [...] "Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual accuracy. She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and agitation. She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery, though too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I have compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since and being of some small use to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try {{to speak}} yet," [...] she said, in softer and gentler tones. [...] "Don't {{look at me}} with those doubting eyes. What wrong have I done? When Mr. Pendril wished {{to speak to you}} about Norah and me, his letter gave us our choice to be present at the interview, or to keep away. If my elder sister decided to keep away, how could I come? How could I hear my own story except as I did? My {{listening}} has done no harm.

Intelligent forces were plainly at work {{on the table}}, and writing was going on. So far as I was concerned, I was convinced that the psychic had externalized her power in some occult fashion, and that it was she who was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> It was as if she were able to will the cone to rise and then to project her voice into it, all of which seems impossible the moment it is stated.|$|E

60|$|Yes, my friends, let us lay to heart, even {{upon this}} joyful day, the awful {{warnings}} of the Epistle to the Hebrews,--God, the I Am, {{has spoken to}} us; God, the I Am, is <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> now. See that you refuse not Him that speaketh; for if they escaped not who refused Moses that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven; wherefore follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord, and have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. To those who disobey Him, eternal wrath; to those who love Him, eternal love.|$|E
6000|$|But it is {{said that}} we have the witness Paul <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{directly}} in the Epistles. There is little doubt that we have, and a very singular witness he is. According to his own showing, Paul, in the vigour of his manhood, with every means of becoming acquainted, at first hand, with the evidence of eyewitnesses, not merely refused to credit them, but [...] "persecuted the church of God and made havoc of it." [...] The reasoning of Stephen fell dead upon the acute intellect of this zealot for the traditions of {425} his fathers: his eyes were blind to the ecstatic illumination of the martyr's countenance [...] "as it had been the face of an angel;" [...] and when, at the words [...] "Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God," [...] the murderous mob rushed upon and stoned the rapt disciple of Jesus, Paul ostentatiously made himself their official accomplice.|$|E
60|$|While Ada was {{speaking}} to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say with how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick face, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered iron-grey. I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was upright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his first <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> his voice had connected itself with an association {{in my mind that}} I could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his manner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman in the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to Reading. I was certain it was he. I never was so frightened in my life as when I made the discovery, for he caught my glance, and appearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I thought we had lost him.|$|E

This house doesn't need any talking about--doesn't need a word said about it. Her Ladyship's last words to us were--Lady Idlemay, you know, {{the owner of the}} house--'Mr. Waddington and Mr. Burton,' she said--she was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> both, for the {{governor}} always introduces me to clients as being the one who does most of the letting,--'Mr. Waddington and Mr. Burton,' she said, 'if a tenant comes along whom you think I'd like to have living in my rooms and using my furniture, breathing my air, so to speak, why, go ahead and let the house, rents being shockingly low just now, with agricultural depression and what not, but sooner than not let it to gentlepeople, I'll do without the money,' Her Ladyship declared. Now you're just the sort of tenant she'd like to have here. I'm quite sure of that, Mr. Lynn. I should take a pleasure in bringing you two together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are wells {{at several}} points," [...] he said, [...] "but {{for the most}} part they are too near the French {{position}} for them to be useful to you until you have driven them into the town. There is, however, a well here," [...] and he marked a spot about a mile from the landing-place. [...] "I cannot tell you its exact position. There is a peasant's hut there. He was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> while we were watching the battle, and he told us that he so hated the French that he had filled up his well so that they should not fetch water from it for the garrison of the castle. I have no doubt that I could find the hut, and the man will, I am sure, show you where the well has been, and it will probably take but little trouble to clear it out. The Arabs, however, told me that wherever you find clumps of trees you will be sure to find water at no great depth." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the other}} state of semi-somnolence, while still alert enough {{to watch and}} reason on the phenomena, we occasionally, though less commonly, hear what may be called 'inner voices.' That is to say, we do not suppose that any one from without is <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> but we hear, as it were, a voice within us making some remark, usually disjointed enough, and not {{suggested}} by any traceable train of thought {{of which we are}} conscious at the time. This experience partly enables us to understand the cases of sane persons who, when to all appearance wide awake, occasionally hear voices which appear to be objective and caused by actual vibrations of the atmosphere. I am acquainted with at least four persons, all of them healthy, and normal enough, who have had such experiences. In all four cases, the apparent voice (though the listeners have no superstitious belief on the subject) has communicated intelligence which proved to be correct. But in only one instance, I think, was the information thus communicated beyond the reach of conjecture, based perhaps on some observation unconsciously made or so little attended to when made that it could not be recalled by the ordinary memory.|$|E

60|$|An {{hour after}} dawn another child died, {{and as we}} were in the act of casting the body into the sea, I looked up and saw a vessel far away, that seemed to be sailing in such fashion that she would pass within two miles of where we were. Returning thanks to God for this most blessed sight, we took to the oars, for the wind was now so light that our clumsy sail would no longer draw us through the water, and rowed feebly so as to cut the path of the ship. When we had laboured {{for more than an hour}} the wind fell {{altogether}} and the vessel lay becalmed at a distance of about three miles. So the priest and I rowed on till I thought that we must die in the boat, for the heat of the sun was like that of a flame and there came no wind to temper it; by now, too, our lips were cracked with thirst. Still we struggled on till the shadow of the ship's masts fell athwart us and we saw her sailors watching us from the deck. Now we were alongside and they let down a ladder of rope, <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in Spanish.|$|E
60|$|It {{would not}} be easy for a pen as unskilful as mine, to portray the change, from the gloom of the ravine, the short but bloody assault, the shouts, the rush, and the retreat, of the outer world, {{to the scene of}} {{domestic}} security we found within the Nest, embellished, as was the last, by woman's loveliness and graces, and, in many respects, by woman's elegance. Anneke and her friend received us in a bright, cheerful, comfortable apartment, that was rendered so much the more attractive by their tears and their smiles, neither of which were spared. I could see that both had been dreadfully agitated; but joy restored their colour, and brought back the smiles to their sweet faces. The situation of the place was such, perhaps, as to render cheerfulness neither very lasting nor very lively; but the tenderest female can find her heart suddenly so lightened from its burthen of apprehensions, as to be able to seem momentarily happy, even when environed by the horrors of war. Such, in a measure, was the character of the reception we now received, together with a thousand thanks for having so promptly answered their letters in person. The dear creatures had the ingenuity not to seem to ascribe that prompt obedience to their own requests, which we had manifested, to any care for ourselves, but solely to a wish to oblige and protect them. The reader will understand that all explanations still remained to be made, on both sides. These soon came, however; facts pressing themselves on the attention, at such times, with a weight that is irresistible. The ice was broken by Herman Mordaunt's entering the room, and <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> like one who felt that a great omission had been made.|$|E
6000|$|If {{we heard}} one whom we {{regarded}} {{as at least}} a person of perfect virtue, truthfulness, and earnestness, foretell that the city in which we now stand should be destroyed. If he told us, that when we saw it encompassed with armies, we were to know that its desolation was at hand. If {{he told us that}} then those who were in the surrounding country were to flee to the mountains, and those in the city to come out of it. If he pronounced woe in that day on mothers and weak women who could not escape. If he told us, nevertheless, that when these things came to pass we were to rejoice and lift up our heads, for our redemption was drawing nigh. If he told us to look at the trees in spring; for, as surely as their budding was a sign that summer was nigh, so was the coming to pass of these terrible woes a sign that something was nigh, which he called the Kingdom of God. If he told us, with a solemn asseveration, that this generation should not pass away till all had happened. If he went on to warn us against profligacy, frivolity, worldliness, lest that day should come upon us unaware. If he bade us keep awake always, that we might be found worthy to escape all that was coming, and to stand before Him, The Son of Man. If he used throughout his address the second person, <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> but never mentioning our descendants; giving the signs, the warnings, the counsels to us only, should we not, even if he had not solemnly told us that the present generation should not pass away till all was fulfilled--should we not, I say, suppose naturally that he spoke of events which in his opinion our own eyes would see; which would, in his opinion, occur during our lifetime? ...|$|E
