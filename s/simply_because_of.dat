5|$|In {{chemical}} fields, such as crystallography, space {{groups and}} point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie {{the chemical and}} physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the symmetry of the states involved.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the preference of the builder. A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually {{the home of the}} local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} a good chance that an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the legends}} are {{interconnected}} in the Bhagavata.

The evil behavior of demon king Hiranyakasipu in Book 7, for example, against his own son Prahlada for his Bhakti for Vishnu, is not <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> demonic Tamasic Guṇa but also because Vishnu in his Varaha avatar had killed Hiranyakasipu's brother Hiranyaksa in Book 2.

25|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} a {{description}} of a real scene in Yamaguchi's apartment, while he was frustrated about lyrical writer's block. Yamaguchi created the lyrical motif of spiders in the song, as at that time of the year there were many spiders in his Tokyo apartment. He linked the spiders to Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's short story The Spider's Thread (1918), and developed the song as a modern envisioning of the story. Yamaguchi does not believe that the song directly links to the film's contents or fit its image, however felt that a natural link was made, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> how it was contextually linked to the film by playing during the credits.|$|E

25|$|Three {{kinds of}} forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load {{refers to the}} weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a {{tendency}} to collapse <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{measurements}} on the 50kW Manzanares pilot {{solar updraft tower}} found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although SBP believe {{that this could be}} increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100MW unit. This amounts to about 10% of the theoretical limit for the Carnot cycle. It is important to note {{a significant difference between the}} up-draft and down-draft proposals. The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> similarities in the name.|$|E
