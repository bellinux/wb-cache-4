Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} days, Terry lets {{it be known}} that he knows the ending to The Story. But the tale he tells during the final recess is {{different}} from the one Kennan outlined in his letter: Raul successfully breaks into the Wizard fortress, but half-frozen and overwhelmed by their technology, cannot overcome them. He is forced to escape aboard one of their flying craft. Dobby manages to wrench one arm free, but no more, while Gernisavien is <b>securely</b> <b>fastened.</b> They know their only course of action with Raul's defeat is to have Dobby smash some chemicals together. The resulting explosion levels the mountain. Raul is safely away when it happens, but he knows that the explosion means that the quest is dead, for his friends perished with the key and knowledge necessary to reactivate the farcaster.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{has been discussed}} {{in a variety of}} publications. Hilary Kingsley in her book Soapbox discusses Mavis's reticent and moralistic personality as seen in her drinking habits: Mavis drinks fruit juices, but on special occasions sweet sherry: [...] "two for Mavis is one too many" [...] says Kingsley. In a 1983 issue of New Statesman magazine, Mavis is described as having a face that is [...] "never quite sure of its own shape". The author describes the storyline featuring Mavis facing the prospect of a trial marriage or losing her boyfriend {{as an example of the}} [...] "either-or situations" [...] into which soap opera is [...] "forever ensnaring its characters". An article in the Evening Standard said Mavis was [...] "meek and mild" [...] and [...] "would not say boo to a budgie". In the same newspaper Mark Walton-Cook discusses Mavis's style, stating: [...] "I keep picturing Corrie's Mavis Riley twittering and clutching at the high neck of a <b>securely</b> <b>fastened</b> polyester blouse with a tasteful cameo brooch".|$|E

The Department's Office of Safety Compliance further concluded that the accident would not have occurred if proper procedures had been followed.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design and {{construct}} a clamping system for glass disc used in elastohydrodynamic contact simulator. The clamping system {{must be able to}} center, eject {{and at the same time}} quickly and <b>securely</b> <b>fasten</b> the disc. Increased demands on accuracy and rigidity of the system are stressed as it is a laboratory measuring instrument. The thesis contains an accompanying report, drawings of components and assembly drawings...|$|R

50|$|Well-designed wire-top cages have doors placed {{so that a}} human {{can open}} them as needed and reach into {{any part of the}} pen to access the hamster or clean the space. A {{cantilever}} design for upper levels in wire-top cages may wobble if the cage is not well designed, and if it does, this fault could upset hamsters because they prefer stable ground. Wire-top cages will ideally <b>securely</b> <b>fasten</b> the plastic base to the wire frame so that the entire pen can be transported without risk of the parts separating or the cage structure failing.|$|R

This can cause [...] "strangling" [...] of smaller plants. An individual plant may reach a length (or height) of 2 m with a white taproot, which may extend up to 1 m. The leaves are 3-8 cm long, pinnate, with 8-12 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet 5-10 mm long.|$|R

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and <b>securely</b> <b>fastening</b> their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping.

In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|R

25|$|Line markers are {{generally}} used on permanent guidelines to provide critical information to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided {{are used to}} wrap the line to secure the marker in place.

The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary line markers are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.|$|R

A cabin on Mulberry Row was, for a time, the home of Sally Hemings, the household slave who is widely believed to have had a 38-year relationship with the widower Jefferson and to have borne six children by him, four of whom survived to adulthood.
