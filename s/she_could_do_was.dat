2500|$|Hooper called Wanrow at {{her home}} and {{told her about the}} altercation and her daughter's {{identification}} of the man who had raped her. [...] Wanrow had been home trying to contact someone to repair her car. [...] She pleaded with Hooper to bring all the children by taxi to her home where they would be safe. [...] Hooper said the police told her the worst thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to leave her home and instead asked Wanrow if she could borrow her gun for protection. [...] Concerned about her two children as well as Hooper and her three children, Wanrow took a taxi to Hooper's home. The landlord of the property informed the two mothers that Wesler had attempted to molest another young boy who had previously lived at the same residence, and that he had been committed to the Eastern State Hospital for the mentally ill. [...] Hooper and the landlord said the police suggested that they [...] "conk him over the head" [...] with a baseball bat should he try to return and another advised them to [...] "wait until he gets in the house".|$|E
60|$|So all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to accept}} the hopeless task set her, and make her guesses and abide by the result.|$|E
6000|$|All that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to point}} tearfully at the baby, now wailing piteously in her arms, and repeat over and over, [...] "Fever--fever--fever." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the days}} of her health and strength, she would have set him at defiance. All <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> now <b>was</b> to appeal to his mercy.|$|R
6000|$|When Mr. Schwirtz came {{she cried}} that she couldn't go to a show. She was [...] "clean played out." [...] She didn't know what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> Pemberton's <b>was</b> {{too big a}} threshing-machine for her. She was tired--"absolutely all in." ...|$|R
60|$|Rose {{wondered}} {{again what}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> next. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> here to study art and literature--there was the library! She would read. And there were lectures perhaps; what she <b>was</b> to <b>do</b> {{would come to}} her after awhile.|$|R
6000|$|She {{felt that}} by the mention of his name he {{intended}} to convey to her complete enlightenment, but the best <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to say politely, [...] "Oh, is that so?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{thought came}} to her, and she sprang towards the bulwark; {{but they were}} {{watching}} and held her, so that all that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to throw up her arms in token.|$|E
60|$|But it was {{not long}} before she found that it was {{impossible}} to turn his thoughts from that all-absorbing subject. All <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to endeavor to guide them into quiet channels.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Drane {{was about}} to offer some sort of {{economic}} objection, but before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, Cicely <b>was</b> out of the little front yard, and hurrying toward the station, where there were always vehicles to be hired.|$|R
50|$|All {{preserved}} examples {{apart from}} 1442 are fitted with auto train equipment and 1450 has also operated on the mainline in preservation, {{but due to}} her size was restricted {{in the amount of}} work <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> and <b>was</b> also restricted on mileage as the 1400s only have a max water capacity of 800 imp gal. During the 1990s she worked a number of Dawlish Donkey trips from Exeter St David's to Newton Abbot.|$|R
60|$|The girl almost {{wished that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so. Appearances <b>were</b> badly against him, {{but she felt}} that if he {{declared}} himself innocent <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take his word {{in the face of}} overwhelming testimony to the contrary, Unfortunately, however, it was unthinkable that she should plainly state the charge.|$|R
60|$|He {{did not try}} to talk {{any more}} to her, and when they reached the Pagoda, all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to hurry up stairs, and, {{throwing}} off her bonnet, bury her face in the pillow.|$|E
60|$|Twinkle's heart almost stopped beating {{when she}} heard these awful words. All <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to stand still and look imploringly at the giant. But she held the fairy mud-turtle clasped tight in her hand, so that the monster couldn't see it.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{space of}} suffering, when Mary and Miss Mercy did all that love could do, and kept Mrs. Frost from the sight of what she could neither cheer nor alleviate, and when all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to talk over the past with Lord Ormersfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would be}} a wretch else. I do not deny her attachment, but I only say it is nothing, {{it ought to be}} nothing, it can be nothing, it shall be nothing, {{compared}} to that of the one who first held you in her arms, and who has always held you in her heart. Mamerzelle can sleep such a night as this, which I'm sure <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>were</b> <b>she</b> as much concerned for you as I am." ...|$|R
40|$|Alida Weathers. Early 1980 s. Handwritten note # 1 : Mother in the 1970 s {{and early}} 1980 s pre-Bill. Includes the horrible {{picture of her}} sitting in her chair in Bedford looking {{depressed}} & afraid (her eyes were much worse, her children were still worrying to her, she was extremely lonely). Handwritten note # 2 : "About the only thing <b>she</b> still <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> cook & eat. Then she got diabetes and couldn't do that. " Early 1980 s...|$|R
60|$|Miss Finch herself, {{appealed to}} next:--Had but one reply to give. With all {{possible}} {{respect for her}} father, she ventured to think that neither he nor any one, possessing the sense of vision, could quite enter into her feelings as the circumstances then were. If there really was any chance of her recovering her sight, the least <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to give that chance a fair trial. She entreated Mr. Nugent Dubourg not to lose one unnecessary moment in bringing the German surgeon to Dimchurch.|$|R
60|$|Only {{he could}} work out his own salvation, and until he had light, all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to stand by him, help him, cease to irritate him, watch, wait. Anyhow she could at least mend his socks as well as possible, so that the threads would not chafe him....|$|E
60|$|He {{came to her}} {{and took}} her hand and set it to his lips, and all that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom she had heard so many talk; the {{favorite}} of the Emperor; the wise young Otto of the Silver Hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{hotel was}} not far away, {{and in a few}} minutes my wife {{returned}} with a fishing-pole. She stood on tiptoe, and reached it high in air; but all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to strike my feet and legs with it. My most frantic exertions did not enable me to get my hands low enough to touch it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cliff sighed. It {{was a great}} pity to {{have taken}} so much trouble, {{especially}} when time was so precious, but she had <b>done</b> what <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> It {{would be impossible for}} her to find the members in their temporary places of abode, and the only thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> now <b>was</b> to tell them the change in her plans when they came on board that evening, and then, if they did not care to sail with her, they would {{have plenty of time to}} go on shore again.|$|R
60|$|But how? A message sent by Saucelito and the {{steamboat}} to San Francisco--the usual way--would {{not reach}} them tonight. To go herself, rowing directly across in the dingey, {{would be the}} only security of success. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it? It <b>was</b> a long pull--the sea was getting up--but she would try.|$|R
5000|$|Sutton Mercer - The {{deceased}} {{protagonist of}} the story. While alive, {{she was a}} snobby trouble-maker who believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything. Sutton <b>was</b> adopted by a wealthy family, but took everything she had for granted. She is also the founder of [...] "The Lying Game". Like her twin, she has brown hair and blue eyes.|$|R
60|$|Nana had filmy eyes, but all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> put her paw {{gently on}} her mistress's lap; {{and they were}} sitting {{together}} thus when the kennel was brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.|$|E
60|$|Had she but dared, Mary Tudor {{would have}} {{submitted}} her rival to mental and bodily torture, {{until she had}} extracted a confession from her. All <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to confine her to her own room in the Palace; she would not lose sight of her, although the young girl had begged for permission to quit the Court and retire to a convent, for the silence and peace of which she felt an unutterable longing.|$|E
60|$|So {{the witch}} saw {{there was no}} help to be got from her old servants, and {{that the best thing}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to mount on her broom and set off in pursuit of the {{children}}. And as the children ran they heard the sound of the broom sweeping the ground close behind them, so instantly they threw the handkerchief down over their shoulder, and in a moment a deep, broad river flowed behind them.|$|E
60|$|Sally {{was aware}} of an emotion too complex to analyse. There was pity in it, but {{amusement}} too. The emotion, though she did not recognize it, was maternal. Mothers, listening to their children pleading with engaging absurdity for something wholly out of their power to bestow, feel that same wavering between tears and laughter. Sally wanted to pick Ginger up and kiss him. The one thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to look on him, sorry as she was for him, as a reasonable, grown-up man.|$|R
50|$|Ayako Yoshinodou - The {{third wife}} of Denemon. She married Denemon {{in order to}} use his money to pay off her family's debts, and she is said to be untrustworthy by her stepchildren. Ayako wanted to escape from life in the Yoshinodou mansion but died before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> voiced by Rumiko Varnes in the English version.|$|R
6000|$|... "But her swimming. Physically, she was {{the perfect}} woman--you know what I mean, not in the gross, muscular way of acrobats, but in all the {{delicacy}} of line and fragility of frame and texture. And combined with this, strength. How <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it <b>was</b> the marvel. You know the wonder of a woman's arm--the fore arm, I mean; the sweet fading away from rounded biceps and hint of muscle, down through small elbow and firm soft swell to the wrist, small, unthinkably small and round and strong. This was hers. And yet, to see her swimming the sharp quick English overhand stroke, and getting somewhere with it, too, was--well, I understand anatomy and athletics and such things, {{and yet it was}} a mystery to me how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs Fyne was unflinching in {{her idea}} {{that as much}} truth as could be told was due {{in the way of}} {{kindness}} to the girl, whose fate she feared would be to live exposed to the hardest realities of unprivileged existences. She explained to her that there were in the world evil-minded, selfish people. Unscrupulous people... These two persons had been after her father's money. The best thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to forget all about them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really do}} not know what will become of me," [...] replied the Prince. [...] "I am {{certainly}} no good in this condition. I can not even walk across the room without toppling over. Can not you manage to push me together again?" [...] The giantess tried to do this, but the Prince was so sharp that his edges hurt her hands, and all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to fold him up and carry him into the drawing-room, where she laid him carefully on the center-table.|$|E
60|$|Claire {{tried to}} give him a smile, but the best <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to lend him one. She could not {{associate}} interesting food with Milt and his mud-slobbered, tin-covered, dun-painted Teal bug. He seemed satisfied with her dubious grimace. By his suggestion they drove ahead to a spot where the cars could be parked on firm grass beneath oaks. On the way, Mr. Boltwood lifted his voice in dismay. His touch of nervous prostration had not made him queer or violent; he retained a touching faith in good food.|$|E
60|$|And {{meanwhile}} it grew {{darker and}} colder and damper hour by hour, till {{at last the}} light went out, and left her with nothing to keep her company but the moaning wind, the falling rain, and the wild cries of the sea-birds when something disturbed them from their rest. The child was asleep at last, {{wrapped up in a}} blanket and one of the smaller sails; and Augusta, feeling quite worn out with solitude and the pressure of heavy thoughts, began to think that the best thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would <b>be</b> to try to follow his example, when suddenly there came a knock at the boards which served for a door to the shanty.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} will,' said Nuttie. 'Poor man! He was--I can't help saying it--the evil {{genius of the}} house. Dear mother knew it, {{struggled}} against him, and broke down in the struggle. It seems so strange that what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in such a manner, and at such a price! I wonder whether she knew it when she welcomed her boy!' ...|$|R
50|$|As Rommel {{advanced}} into Egypt in June 1942 {{after the}} fall to Tobruk, to within 100 km of Alexandria, Cairo was evacuated. She was living at the National Hotel. Many of her contemporaries left for Palestine but she refused to leave and carried on working for the Polish Red Cross until everyone else had left {{and there was nothing}} more that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> ordered to leave for Palestine by the Polish Legation. She refused and instead set off defiantly for the front, to Alexandria, to be near the troops within earshot of First Battle of El Alamein. There she stayed in an hotel, as the only guest, all others having fled. As Rommel’s advance was halted, she returned to Cairo in July 1942 to welcome the returning evacuees.|$|R
