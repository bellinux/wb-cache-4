The metadata database contains topics and relationships, called metalinks, about topics. Topics {{in the database}} contain associated importance scores. The topic selection operator TSelection selects, within time T, topics that satisfy a given <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> and having output importance scores above a given threshold value or in the top-k. The <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> contains expensive predicates, {{in the form of}} user-defined functions. To minimize the number of expensive predicate evaluations (probes) in the TSelection algorithm, we introduce and evaluate three heuristics. Also, due to the time constraint T, the TSelection algorithm may terminate without locating all output tuples. In order to maximize the number of output tuples found, we introduce and evaluate three heuristics to locate a tuple to evaluate at a given time. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterized}} problem {{consists of}} a classical problem and an additional component, the so-called parameter. This point of view allows a formal definition of preprocessing: Given a parameterized instance (I,k), a polynomial kernelization computes an equivalent instance (I',k') of size and parameter bounded by a polynomial in k. We give a complete classification of Min Ones Constraint Satisfaction problems, i. e., Min Ones SAT(Γ), with respect to admitting or not admitting a polynomial kernelization (unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly). For this we introduce the notion of mergeability. If all relations of the constraint language Γ are mergeable, then a new variant of sunflower kernelization applies, based on non-zero-closed cores. We obtain a kernel with O(k^d+ 1) variables and polynomial total size, where d is the maximum arity of a constraint in Γ, comparing nicely with the bound of O(k^d- 1) vertices for the less general and arguably simpler d-Hitting Set problem. Otherwise, any relation in Γ that is not mergeable permits us to construct a log-cost <b>selection</b> <b>formula,</b> i. e., an n-ary <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> with O(log n) true local variables. From this we can construct our lower bound using recent results by Bodlaender et al. as well as Fortnow and Santhanam, proving {{that there is no}} polynomial kernelization, unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level...|$|E

To carry out these forming and quenching functions, the hot-stamping dies {{must be able}} to withstand shock and high-temperature friction under harsh working conditions, and hence high-quality die materials are necessary. However, since the material performance requirements of hot-stamping dies have not been standardized, and special die materials have not been developed, the choice of materials is based on improving the safety coefficient, which leads to material waste and increased costs.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} using a heuristic policy to im-prove the value approximation by the Upper Confidence Bound applied in Trees (UCT) algorithm in non-adversarial settings such as planning with large-state space Markov Decision Processes. Current improvements to UCT focus on either changing the action <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> at the in-ternal nodes or the rollout policy at the leaf nodes of the search tree. In this work, we propose to add an auxiliary arm {{to each of the}} internal nodes, and always use the heuristic policy to roll out simulations at the auxiliary arms. The method aims to get fast convergence to optimal val-ues at states where the heuristic policy is optimal, while retaining similar approximation as the original UCT in other states. We show that boot-strapping with the proposed method in the new algorithm, UCT-Aux, performs better compared to the original UCT algorithm and its vari-ants in two benchmark experiment settings. We also examine conditions under which UCT-Aux works well. ...|$|E

Users of software are typically asked to specify a tolerance δ, that indicates in somewhat vague sense, the level of accuracy required. It is clearly {{important to understand the}} precise effect of changing δ, and to derive the strongest possible results about the behaviour of the global error that will not have regular behaviour unless an appropriate stepsize <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> and standard error control policy are used. Faced with this situation sufficient conditions on an algorithm that guarantee such behaviour for the global error to be asym-potatically linear in δ as δ → 0, that were first derived by Stetter. Here we extend the analysis to cover a certain class of ODEs with low-order derivative discontinuities, and the class of ODEs with constant delays. We show that standard error control techniques will be successful if discontinuities are handled correctly and delay terms are calculated with sufficient accurate interpolants. It is perhaps surprising that several delay ODE algo-rithms that have been proposed do not use sufficiently accurate interpolants to guarantee asymptotic proportionality.

Thirty six states and the Federal Capital Territory, of Nigeria constitute the population of the study. Using a sample <b>selection</b> <b>formula,</b> 30 states were randomly selected, (five from each geo-political zone). Documentary data was generated from the annual statistical bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria 2012. Descriptive statistics, correlation and fixed-effects generalized least square regression techniques were used in analyzing the data. The study discloses that Default rate (DR) and implicit price deflator (IPD) affects the value of the loans given by banks and guaranteed by CBN positively and significantly, while the value of the claims settled increased insignificantly. Consequently, the number of the claims settled has a negative and significant effect on the value of the loans guaranteed. The finding implies that there is sub-optimal credit risks management practice in Nigerian banks leading to substantial amount of non-performing loans. In addition, the non-performing loans were mostly the ones involving greater value. On the basis of the findings, the management of the Nigerian Banks should come up with better credit management policies {{in order to reduce the}} non-performing loans to the barest minimum because of its negative effect on the profitability of the banks.

40|$|The urgent {{realisation}} of the {{low carbon}} economy requires the development of cheap, safe and lightweight hydrogen storage, both for commercialisation of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and {{for the use of}} hydrogen as a reservoir of energy from intermittent renewable energy sources. The primary motivation of this PhD project was to investigate (co) electrospinning, a cheap and scalable fibre production technique, for nanostructuring potential solid state hydrogen storage materials. Solid state storage of hydrogen is being extensively investigated worldwide. However, many of the candidate materials are still not able to meet the practical requirements for mobile applications. The principal drawbacks are that these materials either have low capacity for hydrogen storage (physisorption systems), even at cryogenic temperatures, or high release temperatures with slow release rates (chemisorption systems). Because kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be improved by nanoscale processing, nanoengineering of selected materials has {{emerged as one of the}} most effective ways of overcoming their associated performance barriers. In this thesis I present two successful approaches to nanostructuring using electrospinning: firstly, by encapsulating chemical hydrides in polymeric nanofibres, as demonstrated by the development of co-axial ammonia borane-encapsulated polystyrene (AB-PS) fibres, and secondly, by post-processing of single-phase electrospun PAN fibres, resulting in the synthesis of potassium-intercalated graphitic nanofibres (K-GNFs). The results show that the micro and nano-structure imparted through electrospinning, can have the effect of reducing dehydrogenation temperatures in AB-PS fibres (from 110 to ~ 85 °C) and improving the (de) hydrogenation rates by an order of magnitude in both composite fibres (from ~ 50 to < 5 mins in K-GNFs and from ~ 150 minutes to as low as 15 minutes in AB-PS fibres). The details of co-axial electrospinning as a novel approach to nanoengineering chemical hydrogen storage materials and as a way of possibly overcoming issues regarding reversibility, stability and clean hydrogen release from many of these materials is discussed. The solution selection method I have developed for use in the synthesis of co-axial composite fibres can be applied as an efficient solution <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> for multi-phase electrospinning in general...|$|E

40|$|The thesis studies certain {{mathematical}} {{aspects of}} model selection, statistical estimation theory and probability using stochastic process tools. The paper “The copula information criterion” is {{the paper with}} most direct statistical applications and concerns the so-called model selection problem: Suppose you have several seemingly equally good statistical models of a phenomena – which one should you use? This problem can be approached in many ways, and in classical statistical models, the problem is considered {{to a large extent}} solved by the so-called AIC formula. This formula is used also in more non-standard statistical models, and our paper shows that this may lead to misleading results. By generalizing the AIC, we provide a correct model <b>selection</b> <b>formula</b> for multivariate statistical models called copula models, which are commonly used in financial applications. However, the story is somewhat more complex: If we follow the original motivation of the AIC formula, we show that no such formula can exist for the most commonly used copula models. We then generalize another motivation of the AIC formula to our setting, and find a generally applicable formula. The moral of the story is that the AIC formula must be re-derived for non-classical models, and the result may be drastically different: it may even not exist! The paper “On the errors committed by sequences of estimator functionals” is a paper on probability, with applications to confidence intervals and computer simulations. Suppose you have a computer program that approximates the behavior of a statistical system to a higher and higher precision as the computation time increases. When should you stop the computation? We provide an approximate answer to the point when even if you would continue indefinitely further, the resulting gain in precision would not improve significantly. The paper “Estimation and Inference for Jump Regression Models” concerns the estimation of discontinuous phenomena. It exemplifies that in non-standard statistical models (for example those describing discontinuities), the standard tools of classical statistics are sub-optimal, and even from a classical perspective so-called Bayesian estimators are superior. We quantify these statements precisely, and provide an improvement to the computation process for estimating such models...|$|E
