40|$|AbstractContamination of {{groundwater}} by pathogenic viruses from small biological {{wastewater treatment system}} discharges in remote areas is a major concern. To protect drinking water wells against virus contamination, safe setback distances are required between wastewater disposal fields and water supply wells. In this study, setback distances are calculated for alluvial sand and gravel aquifers for different vadose zone and aquifer thicknesses and horizontal groundwater gradients. This study applies to individual households and small settlements (1 – 20 persons) in decentralized locations without access to receiving surface waters but with the legal obligation of biological wastewater treatment. The calculations are based on Monte Carlo simulations using an analytical model that couples vertical unsaturated and horizontal saturated flow with virus transport. Hydraulic conductivities and water retention curves were selected from reported distribution functions {{depending on the type}} of subsurface media. The enteric virus concentration in effluent discharge was calculated based on reported ranges of enteric virus concentration in faeces, virus infectivity, <b>suspension</b> <b>factor,</b> and virus reduction by mechanical-biological wastewater treatment. To meet the risk target of < 10 − 4 infections/person/year, a 12 log 10 reduction was required, using a linear dose-response relationship for the total amount of enteric viruses, at very low exposure concentrations. The results of this study suggest that the horizontal setback distances vary widely ranging 39 to 144 m in sand aquifers, 66 – 289 m in gravel aquifers and 1 – 2. 5 km in coarse gravel aquifers. It also varies for the same aquifers, depending on the thickness of the vadose zones and the groundwater gradient. For vulnerable fast-flow alluvial aquifers like coarse gravels, the calculated setback distances were too large to achieve practically. Therefore, for this category of aquifer, a high level of treatment is recommended before the effluent is discharged to the ground surface...|$|E
40|$|Steering {{performance}} parameters are the measures defined {{in this thesis}} to quantify the steering behavior of vehicles. The parameters are important for the earlier stages of the design process and therefore a good understanding on how these parameters may change when designing the suspension is vital. The objective of this work {{is to establish a}} general frame that describes the relation between the steering {{performance parameters}} and the <b>suspension</b> design <b>factors</b> regardless of the suspension type. The work was done by studying one steering performance parameter, namely forces in the steering rack under a simulated driving condition. A population of different suspension configurations with different design factors was studied. A model of a McPherson suspension, including both kinematics and steering forces, was developed in Matlab to simulate these scenarios and gather all the necessary data for the study. Different suspension configurations with different design factors were simulated in this environment and the output forces and other steering parameters were statistically post processed to find trends and confidence intervals to find the relations. The objective of the statistical analysis was to find a model that isolated the effect of each <b>suspension</b> design <b>factor</b> on the different steering performance parameters. Linear regression models were used to fit the data and variability of the estimators was specially studied. The result of the study evidenced the difficulty of this problem. There is only statistically significant relation between castor trail and castor angle with all the steering performance parameters studied. The statistical study also reveals a close relation of the <b>suspension</b> design <b>factors</b> between themselves and the same for the steering performance parameters...|$|R

The models used were the Nordic collaboration model NORTRIP (NOn-exhaust Road TRaffic Induced Particle emissions) and the Swedish-Finnish FORE model (Forecasting Of Road dust Emissions). These models describe particulate matter generated by the wear of road surface due to traction control methods and processes that control the suspension of road dust particles into the air. An experimental measurement campaign was conducted using a mobile laboratory called SNIFFER, along two selected road segments in central Helsinki in 2007 and 2008. The suspended PM 10 concentration was measured behind the left rear tyre and the street background PM 10 concentration in front of the van. Both models reproduced the measured seasonal variation of <b>suspension</b> emission <b>factors</b> fairly well during both years at both measurement sites.

30|$|Handsheets were {{prepared}} with aluminum sulfate {{under various conditions}} of pulp <b>suspension,</b> and <b>factors</b> influencing retention behavior of aluminum components on the handsheets were studied {{on the basis of}} their aluminum contents. When deionized water was used in the handsheet-making process, aluminum contents in the handsheets had a plateau level of 0.7 mg/g in the range of 1 %– 8 % Al 2 (SO 4) 3 addition levels on dry weight of pulp. On the other hand, when tap water was used aluminum contents increased up to 5.6 mg/g, increasing the Al 2 (SO 4) 3 addition levels to 8 %. The high aluminum contents in the handsheets are explained in terms of pH and the presence of calcium ions from the tap water used. Cationic aluminum species, which are formed from aluminum sulfate added to pulp suspensions, are primarily adsorbed on pulp fibers by electrostatic interactions with carboxyl groups in the pulp, competing with OH− ions in water. These aluminum components, once adsorbed on pulp fibers by ionic interactions, are not removed from the fibers by extending the stirring time of the pulp suspensions.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{was to develop a}} microfabricated technology platform for studying the use of a microscale impedance-based method for the detection of bacterial metabolism. Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes were chosen as model microorganisms for testing the technology. Impedance-based detection of bacterial metabolism relies on measuring changes in the AC impedance of two electrodes immersed in a liquid were the bacteria are cultured, caused by the release of ionic species by metabolizing bacterial cells. Two silicon-based microfluidic biochip prototypes were fabricated, containing a network of microfluidic channels and chambers fitted with interdigitated metallic electrodes. The first biochip was used to demonstrate that the metabolic activity of bacterial cells can be detected in a few hours, and to study methods for extracting metabolism-related information from the impedance data. Bacterial suspensions were injected into the chip and incubated in a nutrient broth in a 5. 3 nl chamber, at a temperature that results in optimal bacterial growth. During incubation the complex impedance of the suspensions was measured over time at several frequencies between 100 Hz and 1 MHz, using electrodes in direct contact with the suspensions. A circuit model of the electrodes was fitted to the measured impedance curves, and some of the parameters extracted from the fit, together with the raw impedance, were used as detection signals. The shape and magnitude of the changes in these parameters over time indicated {{the presence or absence of}} metabolic activity inside the chip. Impedance measurements of suspensions of live L. innocua and L. monocytogenes cells showed a very clear metabolic signal, compared with measurements done on suspensions of dead cells or of sterile media. The second biochip was designed to concentrate and capture cells from dilute suspensions, using dielectrophoresis, into a 0. 4 nl chamber where incubation and impedance measurements were performed after the cells were captured.

While the 2 former tumour models {{have been shown to}} be moderately to highly immunogenic when grown s. c., the KHT sarcoma is apparently non-immunogenic. Using differential staining on single-cell suspensions from enzymatically dissociated solid tumours, all 3 tumour types were found to contain large proportions (30 - 60 %) of non-neoplastic host cells. The actual host-cell component found in the cell suspensions differed both in type and percentage for the 3 tumours studied. These host and neoplastic cells in the cell suspensions prepared from the solid tumours could be readily separated by centrifugal elutriation. After separation the clonogenic potential of the neoplastic cells was assessed, and was found to be higher than the clonogenic capacity of the unseparated cell <b>suspension</b> by a <b>factor</b> directly related to the host/neoplastic cell ratio. Even after the removal of the host cells, the clonogenic capacities of the neoplastic EMT 6 and 9 L tumour cells were lower than that of the corresponding in vitro sublines (approximately 30 vs 75 %). However, in the KHT sarcoma the removal of the host cell component raised the plating efficiency to approximately 60 %, which was similar to the value for the in vitro cell subline of this tumour...|$|R

Effects of different nanoparticles (nano-Al 2 O 3 and nano-TiO 2) on the coagulation process in kaolin suspension (with or without humic acid) were investigated. The results indicated that when the pH was 7. 0 in kaolin <b>suspension,</b> the strength <b>factor</b> with the presence of TiO 2 increased from 28. 79 % to 48. 69 % and when the concentration of TiO 2 was larger than 1. 6 mg/L, the strength factor decreased to 23. 39 %. The removal efficiencies for Al 2 O 3 were 58. 27 %, 62. 73 % and 47. 3 % under pH 6. 0, 7. 0 or 8. 5. The removal efficiencies for TiO 2 were 38. 12 %, 52. 25 % and 27. 19 %. When the concentration of DOC was 2. 5 mg/L under pH 7. 0, the recovery factor increased from 54. 55 % to 62. 65 % with increasing concentration of Al 2 O 3 from 0. 0 mg/L to 2. 0 mg/L, and it increased from 54. 55 % to 67. 74 % for TiO 2. PACl produced larger flocs, and this may be caused by higher charge neutralization ability and the electrostatic patch effect. The removal efficiency for TiO 2 decreased from 52. 25 % to 22. 13 % with increasing concentration of DOC from 0 mg/L to 7. 5 mg/L. The removal efficiency for Al 2 O 3 decreased from 62. 73 % to 32. 12 %. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Bacopa monnieri is {{commonly}} called as Brahmi {{belongs to the}} family Schrophulariaceae. It is found in wet, shady and marshy areas. This plant has high demand in commercial application due to its medicinal properties. It has been extensively explored by researcher due {{to the presence of}} bacoside; a memory enhancer used to treat memory disorder. Due to its high demand in commercial application the natural habitat of this plant depleted continuously and has been already entitled in the list of threatened species by International Union of conservation of nature and national resources. The best way to save this plant from being endangered is to utilize this plant by plant tissue culture to extract the important metabolites. Production of bacoside through plant tissue culture is very low. The aim of this research is to increase the yield of bacoside production through plant tissue culture. To increase the yield of bacoside a central composite design (CCD) was performed to optimized the media in <b>suspension</b> culture. Three <b>factors</b> such as inoculum size, sucrose concentration and phosphate concentration was optimized. The maximum predicted yield for biomass was found to be 3. 65 g/L DW when the media contains 2 g/L inoculum, 30 g/L sucrose and 1. 24 mM phosphate concentration. The maximum predicted yield for bacoside was 0. 49 mg/g DW when the media contains 1. 98 g/L inoculum, 41. 92 g/L sucrose and 0. 22 mM phosphate. Experimental validation of the model predicted optimized media was performed and the correlation between experimental and model predicted value was found to be 99...|$|R
