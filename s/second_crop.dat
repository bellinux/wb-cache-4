5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his <b>second</b> <b>crop</b> of the season. He then saved seeds from his <b>second</b> <b>crop</b> to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his <b>second</b> <b>crop</b> of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the direct and residual effects of two rock phosphate (RP) materials on two contrasting soils previously planted with either the cereal crop or the leguminous crop. The effectiveness of the RP materials as substitute for the conventional P fertilizers was evaluated using single superphosphate as reference at the Department of Agronomy, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. The experiments were 2 × 2 × 4 factorial in completely randomized design. The test crops in the first cropping performed better on the slightly acidic loamy sand than on the strongly acidic sandy clay loam. Performance of each crop was improved by P supply in the first and <b>second</b> <b>cropping.</b> Single superphosphate proved to be more efficient than the RPs in the first cropping but not as effective as MRP in the <b>second</b> <b>cropping.</b> In the <b>second</b> <b>cropping,</b> sorghum performed better on the soil previously cropped to cowpea while Morocco RP had the highest residual effect among the P-fertilizer sources. It is evident that rock phosphates are better substitutes to the conventional phosphorus fertilizers due to their long term residual effect in soils.

25|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} Sangam period, people {{depended}} heavily on rains as {{the primary source of}} water for agriculture. But, increasing demand stemming from a growing population {{led to the development of}} better methods of irrigation. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, the primary goal was to procure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Tanks, lakes and dams were important water storage systems that were developed for this purpose. Sluices and shutters were constructed for regulating water for irrigation. Sometimes, buckets made of reeds were used for watering the lands. In order to control the flooding of rivers, sand mounds were raised so that water could be diverted for irrigation. Direct irrigation from canals was possible on the basins of the Kaveri, the Periyar and the Tamaraparani. Kallanai, a dam built on river Kaveri during this period, is considered the oldest water-regulation structure in the world. Kaveri, Pennai, Palaru, Vaigai and the Tamaraparani were the major rivers spreading their fertilizing water on the fields of Tamilakam. Water stored in tanks and reservoirs was delivered to the fields through channels. There is a considerable amount of spring channel irrigation in the Palar, Kaveri and Vaigai beds. To raise a <b>second</b> <b>crop,</b> well water was very useful. People of this era knew how to divine the spots where there was flow of underground water and dug wells there. Men and oxen were used to irrigate the lands from well water. When water supply was limited and demand was more, it became the duty of the village authorities to distribute the available water in a proper way. Day and night watchmen were employed to guard the tanks and reservoirs and regulate the water supply. Surface irrigation, sprinkler mechanism and drip irrigation methods were followed to prevent wastage of water.|$|E

In the following year, barley, buckwheat, caraway, faba bean, hemp and white lupin were sown, as <b>second</b> <b>crops,</b> in each block and incorporated either at flowering stage (except barley) or after harvest. In the third year, barley was grown in all plots and its yield and grain protein concentration were determined. Mineral N in the plough layer was determined two months after incorporation of crops and again before sowing barley in the following year. The effect of faba bean and turnip rape on improving barley yields and grain protein concentration was still detectable two years after they were grown.

TNG 67) growth and yields were harvested at maturity so as to determine the NDVI-LAI relationships and the optimal timing to use these two parameters for yield prediction. Field experiments were conducted at the experimental farm of Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (Wufeng, Taiwan) in the first and the <b>second</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons of 2001 - 2002. Different levels of nitrogen fertilizer, from 0 to 180 kg ha- 1 with 30 kg ha- 1 intervals, were applied to produce various scales of grain yield and values of LAI and NDVI. Results showed that there were differential weather conditions between two cropping seasons, and plants grown in first crops had a better growth and yield. Both LAI and NDVI were found curvilinearly distributed during the growing periods, with the maximum values occurred before heading in First Crops and near or after heading in <b>Second</b> <b>Crops.</b> These two parameters can be mutually estimated through an exponential function, which linked spectral remote sensing data with plant growth information. Correlation between yield and LAI was best fitted to a nonlinear function, from about 50 days after transplanting (DAT) with the determining factor (R 2) higher than 0. 73 (P< 0. 01). By further analyzing the relations of the cumulative and the mean values of LAI to yield, it indicated that both the accumulated and the mean values of LAI from 15 days before heading (DBH) to 15 days after heading (DAH) can well predict rice yield for the first cropping seasons, while values calculated from 15 DBH to 10 DAH can predict yield for the <b>second</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons.

40|$|Abstract. Changes in soil {{fertility}} were evaluated on young (6 year) and old (20 year) jhum fields in Mizoram, north-eastern India {{in response to}} various operations involved injhum such as slashing and burning of vegetation, cropping period, and intervening fallow period between first and <b>second</b> year <b>cropping.</b> The results demonstrate that the soil is richer in nutrients in old than young field {{prior to the start}} of jhum cultivation. Slash burning depletes soil acidity, carbon and nitrogen but elevates phosphorus and cations. Soil fertility declined during first cropping phase, and further declined during <b>second</b> <b>cropping</b> phase. After two cropping years, {{soil fertility}} of old field was almost at par with that of young field, signifying that the loss of soil fertility was more in old than young field. A short intervening fallow period between first and <b>second</b> year of <b>cropping</b> did not show any pronounced improvement in soil fertility, though it provided some biomass for second burning. Tilling caused maximum loss to soil fertility. The fertilizer treatments ended with comparable or better soil fertility in comparison to no-treatment plot. There seems to be none of the fertilizer treatments superior over others from the standpoint of ending soil fertility. The unifying conclusions of this series of investigations support the hypothesis that the <b>second</b> year <b>cropping</b> holds promise to reduce the demand for forested land for jhum, and lengthen the jhum cycle substantially...|$|R

Furthermore, low K treated plants had higher Zeatin (Z) content in the root than either low P or high PK treated plants. However, the two cotton varieties expressed different hormones content in the leaves, stem and root.

The difference in feedstock origin, surface oxidation and CEC of biochar seem to cause varied direct and residual effects on growth and yield of crops (Liang et al. 2006). Consequently, such a significant residual yield increment could partly be associated with a likely marked increase of important plant macronutrients such as P, K and Mg and to lesser extent possible N mineralization in the soils. Moreover, having low CEC value for soil 2, the biochar could possibly enhance ability of this soil to retain cations.|$|R
