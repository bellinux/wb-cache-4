25|$|Smithson's {{research}} work was eclectic. He studied subjects ranging from coffee making {{to the use}} of calamine, eventually renamed <b>smithsonite,</b> in making brass. He also studied the chemistry of human tears, snake venom and other natural occurrences. Smithson would publish twenty-seven papers. He was nominated to the Royal Society of London by Henry Cavendish and was made a fellow on 26 April 1787. Smithson socialised and worked with scientists Joseph Priestley, Sir Joseph Banks, Antoine Lavoisier, and Richard Kirwan.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smithsonite,</b> or zinc spar, is zinc {{carbonate}} (ZnCO3), a mineral ore of zinc. Historically, <b>smithsonite</b> was identified with hemimorphite {{before it was}} realised that they were two distinct minerals. The two minerals are very similar in appearance and the term calamine {{has been used for}} both, leading to some confusion. The distinct mineral <b>smithsonite</b> was named in 1832 by François Sulpice Beudant in honor of English chemist and mineralogist James Smithson (c.1765-1829), whose bequest established the Smithsonian Institution and who first identified the mineral in 1802.|$|E

The Kelly Church still stands and is the site of periodic festivities.|$|E
50|$|It is {{composed}} of two symbols. The left (heraldic: right) half shows a miner digging with a pickaxe for <b>smithsonite.</b> It {{is based on a}} 14th-century town (aldermen) seal, referring to the centuries-long tradition as a mining area.

50|$|<b>Smithsonite</b> {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the weathering or oxidation zone of zinc-bearing ore deposits.
