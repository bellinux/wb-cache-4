5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to <b>show</b> <b>some</b> metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to <b>show</b> <b>some</b> cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E
40|$|The {{screening}} of 86 marine bacterial strains associated with marine invertebrates, algae, sediment, artificial sponges and sea {{water from the}} coastal waters of the Iriomote Islands (Japan) has been carried out. The {{purpose of this study}} was to get various strains of marine bacteria that are beneficial to the production of bioactive compounds. The {{screening of}} antibacterial activity produced by strains of marine bacteria was carried out using the paper disk method. Antibacterial activity test results showed that one strain of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Bacillus subtilis and Cautobacter halobacteroides, two strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Staphylococcus aureus, four strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Cytophaga marinoflava, 63 strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Vibrio harveyi and 14 strains of bacteria <b>showed</b> <b>some</b> activity against Pseudovibrio sp., while Salinivibrio costicola showed no antibacterial activity. This indicates that about 78 % of all the bacterial strains isolated have the potential to produce bioactive compounds...|$|R

5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also <b>show</b> <b>some</b> {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol La and atomic number 57. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that tarnishes rapidly {{when exposed to}} air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table, of which lanthanum is {{the first and the}} prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements. The usual oxidation state is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but does <b>show</b> <b>some</b> antimicrobial activity.|$|E
5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all <b>show</b> <b>some</b> indication of modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact}} that some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, <b>show</b> <b>some</b> incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they <b>show</b> <b>some</b> red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they do <b>show</b> <b>some</b> of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E

The remains of several small oval houses with thick stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures <b>show</b> <b>some</b> similarity to Skara Brae on Mainland, Orkney, but are smaller and of a later date. These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character. Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they <b>show</b> <b>some</b> similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} these reforms {{was to provide a}} sizable, well-trained force in the British Isles, which could be sent {{overseas}} in time of crisis, with a system of reservists and home-service volunteers to support it. However, with the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899, the system immediately began to <b>show</b> <b>some</b> strain; {{by the end of the}} first year of fighting, the reserves had been entirely exhausted. Various novel measures, including the extensive use of auxiliary forces, were experimented with for the remainder of the war; the Militia provided garrison units to free up regulars, the Volunteers sent service companies to be attached to regular battalions, and the Imperial Yeomanry was created to supply much-needed mounted infantry.|$|E
