During our 5 -day DRC- 1339 dietary test; in which birds were fed only 2 % DRC-l 339 -treated brown rice diluted 1. 25 with untreated brown rice, no mortality occurred to Canada geese or snow geese, and 1 mortality occurred to savannah sparrows. Nine of 10 mourning doves, 8 of 9 meadow larks and 8 of 10 American tree sparrows died during the same test. Most test species exhibited some degree of aversion to the DRC- 1339 bait, indicating that in free-feeding situations such as DRC- 1339 air sites most non-target birds might ingest sublethal doses and subsequently avoid treated baits. Rapid degradation and discoloration of DRC- 1339 baits reduce the risk for non-target species at DRC- 1339 bait sites...|$|R
