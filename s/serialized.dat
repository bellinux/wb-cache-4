40|$|In the {{typology}} of motion lexicalization, {{two types of}} languages have traditionally been distinguished: satellite-framed and verb-framed. <b>Serializing</b> languages are difficult to fit into this typology and have been claimed {{to belong to a}} third type: equipollently framed. In this paper I use grammatical criteria to show that Avatime, a <b>serializing</b> language, should indeed be classified as equipollently framed. I also study motion descriptions in narratives. Avatime is similar to other <b>serializing</b> languages with respect to path elaboration, but unlike other <b>serializing</b> languages it has low manner saliency. Equipollently framed languages thus do not behave as a single type...|$|R

40|$|Sharing {{resources}} {{leads to}} contention in multithreaded programs. In order to safely access shared resources, such as queues, threads must <b>serialize</b> access to them. One common way to <b>serialize</b> resource access {{is to use}} programming language-supported locks. However, <b>serializing</b> threads on highly contended resources commonly leads to poor performance due to excessive context switching or busy-waiting. Specifically in multithreaded servers, where a dispatcher thread dispatches jobs to a worker thread, <b>serializing</b> access to a shared work queue leads to performance bottlenecks. This paper discusses the problem caused by thread synchronization on shared queues, related work addressing this problem, a new per-thread batch queue algorithm, experimental results comparing batch and non-batch queues, and {{an analysis of the}} results...|$|R
