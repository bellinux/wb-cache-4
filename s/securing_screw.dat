30|$|The Wagner SL stem is {{available}} in four sizes and is conically shaped in the distal part, with eight longitudinal antirotational ribs. Three different head lengths are available; a 32 -mm-diameter femoral head was used in all cases. Profemur R is a modular prosthesis that consists of a tapered diaphyseal stem with cutting flutes and a rough surface, and a metaphyseal double-cone body, connected via a Morse taper and a <b>securing</b> <b>screw.</b> The modularity is completed by the availability of three different length heads and interchangeable necks with different length and version, which allow different offset and version to be obtained; in all cases a 28 -mm-diameter femoral head was implanted.|$|E
5000|$|The First Model 26.5 was a larger-bore {{version of}} the 12-gauge shotgun, using the same two <b>securing</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

50|$|An inkwell {{is a small}} jar or container, {{often made}} of glass, porcelain, silver, brass, or pewter, used for holding ink in a place {{convenient}} {{for the person who}} is writing. The artist or writer dips the brush, quill, or dip pen into the inkwell as needed or uses the inkwell as the source for filling the reservoir of a fountain pen. An inkwell usually has a lid to prevent contamination, evaporation, accidental spillage, and excessive exposure to air. A type known as the travelling inkwell was fitted with a <b>secure,</b> <b>screw</b> lid so a traveller could carry a supply of ink in their luggage without the risk of leakage.|$|R

50|$|The grip panels came in two types: plastic {{with the}} TOZ logo, or wooden. Wooden grips came in two versions: {{checkered}} or with larger vertical grooves. Until the early 1930s grips were <b>secured</b> with <b>screws,</b> later with spring latches.|$|R
50|$|Vertebroplasty {{had been}} {{performed}} as an open procedure {{for many decades}} to <b>secure</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> and fill tumorous voids. However, the results were not always worth the risk involved with an open procedure, which {{was the reason for}} the development of percutaneous vertebroplasty.|$|R
25|$|Fuses for {{low voltage}} power {{circuits}} may have bolted blade or tag terminals which are <b>secured</b> by <b>screws</b> to a fuseholder. Some blade-type terminals {{are held by}} spring clips. Blade type fuses often {{require the use of}} a special purpose extractor tool to remove them from the fuse holder.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{face masks}} {{fall into two}} broad categories, the 'traditional', <b>secured</b> by <b>screws</b> and plastic loops or thin wire ties and a {{combination}} of screws and T-nuts, and the 'innovative' using some additional type of proprietary 'quick release' hardware. However, it should be recognized that helmet and face mask design {{is an area of}} active development and change.|$|R
50|$|Shackle - a small, U shape, {{stainless}} steel or galvanized steel <b>secured</b> with a <b>screw</b> type pin {{at the open}} end of the U. Some types have spring-loaded pins that snap shut.|$|R
50|$|Fuseholders may be <b>secured</b> by <b>screws</b> to a panel, {{attached}} to bus bars, or mounted on DIN rails. For the Neozed fuses, {{there are also}} fuse bases with integrated disconnecting switches. Changing fuses with the circuit off increases {{the safety of the}} user. With new versions of these load disconnecting switches, the fuse cartridges are no longer screwed, but are held by spring clips.|$|R
50|$|The jaws {{that hold}} the pyrites inside medieval guns were <b>secured</b> with <b>screws,</b> {{and the need to}} {{constantly}} replace the pyrites resulted in considerable refinement of the screwdriver. The tool is more documented in France, and took on many shapes and sizes, though all for slotted screws. There were large, heavy-duty screwdrivers for building and repairing large machines, and smaller screwdrivers for refined cabinet work.|$|R
50|$|A {{cone point}} (as pictured {{in the top}} and bottom files at left) allows a file to center itself in its mount. Files with flat {{mounting}} surfaces must be <b>secured</b> with set <b>screws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many early {{examples}} of the 'All-American Five' posed a shock hazard to users. Lacking a mains transformer, the chassis of the AA5 radio was directly connected {{to one side of}} the mains electric supply. The hazard was made worse because the on/off switch was often in the wire of the mains supply which was connected to the chassis, meaning that the chassis could be [...] "hot" [...] when the set was either 'on' or 'off', depending on which way the plug was inserted in the power outlet. Many power plugs had two identical pins, and could be plugged in either way round. The metal chassis <b>securing</b> <b>screws</b> were sometimes accessible from the outside of the Bakelite or wood case, and there were many {{examples of}} owners receiving a shock by making contact with these screws while handling a set. Ventilation holes could be large enough to allow children to poke their fingers, or metal objects, through. The same type of hazard was present in European AC/DC sets, at twice the voltage.|$|R
50|$|The model 302 {{is built}} upon a {{rectangular}} steel base plate on which are mounted the ringer unit, the induction coil, a metal can containing two capacitors, and a connector terminal plate. The base {{was supported by}} four felt- or leather-covered triangular feet attached under each corner. The housing sat {{on top of the}} base, <b>secured</b> with <b>screws,</b> and contained the rotary dial and the hook switch, which was activated with two plunger rods in the handset cradle by removing or replacing the handset.|$|R
25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{installation}} of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner back plate over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner front plate. The spinner dome is then mounted over this assembly and <b>secured</b> with <b>screws</b> to the back and front plates. Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller {{to fill in the}} spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the backplate again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the front plate, although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{is placed}} between the air chambers {{of the instrument}} and the player's mouth. This can be integral with the comb (the diatonic harmonicas; the Hohner Chrometta); part of the cover (as in Hohner's CX-12); or may be a separate unit, <b>secured</b> by <b>screws,</b> which is typical of chromatics. In many harmonicas, the mouthpiece is purely an ergonomic aid designed to make playing more comfortable. However, in the traditional slider-based chromatic harmonica, {{it is essential to}} the functioning of the instrument because it provides a groove for the slide.|$|R
5000|$|The Guitar Mike, FHC, and Rhythm Chiefs {{was also}} {{available}} with a shorter, 6" [...] pressure rod that {{fixed to the}} end of the necks bass side and extended over the body to hold the pickup that was <b>secured</b> using 2 <b>screws</b> through 2 holes in the rod attached just below the fretboard.|$|R
50|$|The body is {{assembled}} {{from numerous}} glued parts. The main body tube is divided in six sections lengthwise, the bow, bell and neck consist of two mirrored halves each. The mechanic consists of smaller plastic parts which are mounted on hexagonal aluminium rods. The individual keys are <b>secured</b> with <b>screws</b> onto the body. Coil springs are used throughout. The pads {{are made from}} Silicone and are mounted glue-free with the mechanics for easy replacement and are self-leveling. They move on a pivot to better cover the entire tone hole with less finger pressure required by the player.|$|R
50|$|The Kine Exakta {{is made of}} {{two major}} {{aluminium}} alloy castings, the outer body shell and the internal frame for the mirror box, the shutter mechanism and the film transport. The latter is inserted into the shell from the top and <b>secured</b> by <b>screws.</b> A fixed finder hood and a separate detachable back cover complete the general layout. The Exakta bayonet lens mount was developed for this camera. The shutter is of the horizontal cloth focal plane type providing exposure times from 12 seconds to 1/1000 second with bipolar flash synchronising contacts on the right-hand camera front.|$|R
5000|$|A sixth {{version is}} very similar to the fifth, but the stamped model number is changed to 2194002-XX-XXX. Its vintage is late 1995 to mid 1996, with the most recent model having [...] "MAXI SWITCH 06-27-06" [...] printed on the label. This version has a PS/2 style plug like [...] "version 3" [...] and also has <b>screws</b> <b>securing</b> the internals.|$|R
50|$|Warehouse Fortification: The {{immediate}} {{project is}} securing the warehouse with better defenses. Joey fixes {{the hole in}} the back wall that was previously breached by putting trash on the stairs. He also puts chainlink on the wall where they were previously attacked to prevent any openings in the wall and puts wooden board <b>secured</b> with metal <b>screws</b> to keep the front door shut.|$|R
5000|$|Old work {{boxes are}} {{designed}} to attach to already-installed wall material (usually drywall). The boxes will almost always have two or more parsellas (from Latin: [...] "small wing or part). The parsellas flip out when the box <b>screws</b> are <b>screwed,</b> <b>securing</b> the box to the wall {{with the help of}} the four or more tabs on the front of the box.|$|R
50|$|The CKS-1 turret holds 2 lenses. Both {{positions}} {{secure a}} mounting bracket {{to connect to}} lenses. One position is the Cine Kodak mount, with a fixed 25mm lens. The other position is the Kodak S-Mount distinguished by an alignment pin and <b>secured</b> by a <b>screw</b> collar. The latter allows for insertion of interchangeable lenses. The mounting brackets have tilt-up viewfinders with masks according to the focal length.|$|R
50|$|The Latitude D600 used a PA-10/PA-12 charger {{and came}} with a DVD drive, 2 x USB, 1 x TV, 1 x network, 1 x parallel, 1 x serial and 1 monitor output. The hard drive is {{accessible}} through a cover on the left hand front side of the lower case and is <b>secured</b> by 1 <b>screw.</b> After removing the screw, the hard drive can then slide out.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 610 socket {{was provided}} with two mounting holes, one behind the receptacle for the plug spigot, and both for countersunk screws. This arrangement allowed the socket to be <b>secured</b> using two <b>screws,</b> with no plug inserted, or alternatively with the plug inserted, {{using the same}} two mounting holes but {{with one of the}} screws passing through the spigot to secure the plug as well.|$|R
50|$|A dustcap {{is a small}} cover used on {{the valve}} stem of a bicycle or car tire to prevent dust or other small {{particles}} from entering the valve and damaging it. The dustcap also forms a pressure seal, helping to prevent deflation of the tire due to slight gas seepage past the tire valve. Dustcaps are usually made from plastic but may occasionally be made of metal. The dustcap is internally threaded and is <b>secured</b> by <b>screwing</b> it onto {{the end of the}} stem. To prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS and avoid costly repairs, metal valve caps without insulating plastic linings should not be used on direct-TPMS-equipped tire valve stems.|$|R
50|$|The torch {{is usually}} {{constructed}} around a wooden dowel {{which runs the}} length of the torch from the knob (base) to the top. The lower 8-10 inch section is fitted with a handle, and is the section the juggler uses to catch and throw the torch. The handle can be covered in spiral wound plastic, cloth or leather. The middle of the torch is often larger in diameter than the handle and this section helps to balance the torch and makes it easier to juggle. The upper portion of the dowel is often covered in metal (usually aluminium) with the uppermost section covered in a wick. The wick is wrapped around the top of the shaft several times and <b>secured</b> with <b>screws</b> into the wooden core.|$|R
50|$|Boss compact pedals were {{originally}} produced in Japan, until circa 1990 when production moved to Taiwan. Earlier units {{came with a}} metal <b>screw</b> <b>securing</b> the battery compartment; later models retained the metal screw, adding a plastic knob for tool-less battery removal. The labels {{on the bottom of}} the pedals come in several different colours including black, silver, green, pink and blue. Apart from this the basic design has remained unchanged for over 25 years.|$|R
50|$|A ‘platform construction’ {{configuration}} is {{used throughout}} this structure. Each floor {{is set on}} the walls below, and then another storey of walls is raised and so on up the building. Joints are <b>secured</b> with <b>screws</b> and angle plates. Stresses are generally very low throughout the structure and at points where cross-grain pressures are high, screws {{have been added to}} reinforce the timber locally. Progressive collapse is avoided by providing sufficient redundancy so that any single elements can be removed. Designing a building constructed from load bearing panels creates a number of opportunities. Any internal wall can become a party wall and have a significant portion removed from the surface area as openings. This simple flexibility allowed for different plan types up and down the building and an animated façade where windows were placed according to the best advantage.|$|R
5000|$|Wall Safes: The contestants are {{introduced}} to the judges, who {{teach them how to}} install a wall safe by locating two studs and cutting out part of the wall between them. Dez and Casey, having a common wall, choose the same spot, and Casey was forced to relocate, but not without accidentally hitting Dez in the helmet with his hammer. The two and Tex (who did not use a stud finder at all) eventually fail due to cutting too big of a hole vertically (though they were more lenient on Casey). Joe also relocates, not knowing how to use a stud finder and having abandoned his first choice of location. However, he eventually manages to brute-force his safe in with a mallet (but the safe is not <b>secured</b> with <b>screws).</b> Charmaine gave up on her wall safe.|$|R
25|$|For {{very large}} heat sinks, {{there is no}} {{substitute}} for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method. A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is <b>secured</b> with a <b>screw</b> through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, the {{switches}} {{are placed}} behind {{a door that}} is <b>secured</b> with a <b>screw</b> but not locked with a key; {{they are out of}} sight and thus less likely to be interfered with. Screw-on door-covered switches are used on public address equipment that is intended to be rented out to non-professional users. The switches for some settings, such as the on-off switch for the speaker-protection limiter or a low-pitch [...] "rumble filter" [...] (designed to protect speakers from very low sounds), may be hidden behind a screwed-on door or metal plate.|$|R
5000|$|MCX-MR (Mid Range): Semi-automatic {{sniper rifle}} {{chambered}} in 7.62×51mm NATO. It features a 16 in, fluted, 416 stainless steel barrel, with a 1:10 inch twist, manufactured by Bartlein Barrels. The handguard is <b>secured</b> via two <b>screws,</b> {{and the gas}} system has settings for suppressed or unsuppressed use. It weighs 8.9 lb, and features both an M16/AR-15-type charging handle and a left side charging handle, uses SR-25 box magazines, and is compatible with SR-25 lower receivers. It was SIG Sauer's unsuccessful submission for the United States Army's Compact Semi-Automatic Sniper System (CSASS) program.|$|R
60|$|The harness-cask, also, {{a sort of}} sea side-board, {{or rather}} meat-safe, in which a week's {{allowance}} of salt pork and beef is kept, deserves being chronicled. It formed part of the standing furniture of the quarter-deck. Of an oval shape, it was banded round with hoops all silver-gilt, with gilded bands <b>secured</b> with gilded <b>screws,</b> and a gilded padlock, richly chased. This formed the captain's smoking-seat, where he would perch himself of an afternoon, a tasseled Chinese cap upon his head, and a fragrant Havanna between his white and canine-looking teeth. He took much solid comfort, Captain Riga.|$|R
