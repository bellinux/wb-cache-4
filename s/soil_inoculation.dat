50|$|Mycorrhizae are “fungus roots”, a mutualistic {{association}} between a fungus (Myco) such as Aspergillus oryzae and plant roots (rhiza). This provides an interface between plants and soil. The fungus grows into {{the roots of}} crops {{and out into the}} soil, increasing the root system many thousand-fold. The fungus use their enzymes to convert soil nutrients into a form that crops can use and turn plant carbohydrates into soil amendments, “sequestering” carbon. Miles of mycorrhizae {{can be found in a}} single ounce of soil. Mycorrhizal <b>soil</b> <b>inoculation</b> increases soil carbon accumulation by depositing glomalin, which increases soil structure by binding organic matter to mineral particles. Glomalin gives soil its tilth (texture), buoyancy and water absorption ability. Biochar (charcoal) shelters mycorrhizae in myriad, tiny holes. Other mycorrhizaeal impacts include enhanced water uptake, reduced water needs (increased drought resistance), increased pathogen resistance and overall increased plant vigor.|$|E

In arid and semiarid ecosystems where physiological constraints prevent most {{vascular plant}} establishment, the biological soil crust (biocrust) community is ecologically critical. The {{key to the}} survival of biocrust is the versatility and adaptability of cyanobacteria and green algae. The organismal construct of the biocrust community is especially vulnerable to compressional forces, and is slow to recover without assistance. Given the importance of biocrusts to so many aspects of healthy ecosytem function, it would be advantageous if land managers prioritized restoring damaged biocrusts. Coastal sage scrub (CSS) is a unique and imperiled valuable habitat and is nearly unmatched in the biodiversity of unique plants and animals. Recent work in biocrust restoration finds that assisted restoration speeds recovery of functionality in biocrusts. At present, studies of biocrust restoration in CSS habitat do not exist. This study examines the feasibility of isolating and culturing a mix of endemic CSS cyanobacteria and green algae to inoculate native CSS soil, thereby facilitating recovery of disturbed biological soil crusts. It further looks at markers for culture growth, chlorophyll a, extractable polysaccharides, and stability, to gauge whether inoculation and growth of the culture have increased soil function. Growth of the mixed culture and increases in functionality are compared between autoclaved <b>soil</b> <b>inoculations</b> and native <b>soil</b> <b>inoculations</b> to determine the extent that native crust organisms can regrow without inoculation, and how the inoculum interacts with the native microbial community. A putative novel genus and species of cyanobacteria related to Leptolyngbya was isolated and tentatively included in the genus, Trichotorquatus. The mixed culture included a green algae, possibly a species of Trebouxia. Mixed inoculum added to native soil significantly increased chorophyll a levels and soil stability, and increased extractable polysaccharides after just two months, demonstrating recovery of function. Autoclaving soil reduced increases in functionality indicating the importance of the intact soil community for growth. It may be possible in the future to restore biocrust in CSS using mixed culture inoculation...|$|R

30|$|The {{utilization}} of inoculants containing Azospirillum {{is becoming more}} popular due to increasing reports of expressive gains in grain yields. However, incompatibility with pesticides used in seed treatments represents a main limitation for a successful inoculation. Therefore, {{in this study we}} searched for alternatives methods for seed inoculation of maize and wheat, aiming to avoid the direct contact of bacteria with pesticides. Different doses of inoculants containing Azospirillum brasilense were employed to perform <b>inoculation</b> in-furrow, via <b>soil</b> spray at sowing and via leaf spray after seedlings had emerged, in comparison to seed inoculation. Experiments were conducted first under greenhouse controlled conditions and then confirmed in the field at different locations in Brazil. In the greenhouse, most parameters measured responded positively to the largest inoculant dose used in foliar sprays, but benefits could also be observed from both in-furrow and <b>soil</b> spray <b>inoculation.</b> However, our results present evidence that field inoculation with plant-growth promoting bacteria must consider inoculant doses, and point to the need of fine adjustments to avoid crossing the threshold of growth stimulation and inhibition. All inoculation techniques increased the abundance of diazotrophic bacteria in plant tissues, and foliar spray improved colonization of leaves, while <b>soil</b> <b>inoculations</b> favored root and rhizosphere colonization. In field experiments, inoculation with A. brasilense allowed for a 25  % reduction in the need for N fertilizers. Our results have identified alternative methods of inoculation that were as effective as the standard seed inoculation that may represent an important strategy to avoid the incompatibility between inoculant bacteria and pesticides employed for seed treatment.|$|R

30|$|The {{enhanced}} SMZ mineralization, measured {{after the}} first 14 C-SMZ application, as well as after the second application is exclusively due to the inoculated microbial community, since the “adaptation” experiments have clearly excluded adaptation processes {{as a reason for}} accelerated SMZ degradation. In a third phase, the carrier particles were separated from the bulk soil, before SMZ was applied for a third time (Additional file 7 : Fig S 6; Additional file 8 : Fig S 7). In the bulk soil without carrier particles, 56  % of the applied SMZ was degraded after 62  days. These results reveal that microbes were able to proliferate in the soil matrix and continue the SMZ degradation there, which is a very important factor to ensure the success of this application approach. There is no need to apply the carrier particles again, after the microbes have established in the bulk soil.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that soil biotic {{communities}} from organically managed fields are more diverse and exhibit higher activity levels compared to conventionally managed fields. The impact of these different soil communities on plant productivity and the provision of soil ecosystem services are, however, still unclear. Here, we test the effects of <b>soil</b> <b>inoculation</b> from each of three organic and three conventional maize fields on maize productivity and nutrient loss during leaching events induced by simulated rain. In particular, we examine whether differences in productivity and nutrient loss are related to the abundance and species composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We hypothesized that soil biota from organically managed fields would improve maize growth and reduce nutrient leaching significantly more than those from conventionally managed fields. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that plant productivity was negatively affected by <b>soil</b> <b>inoculation,</b> and this effect was stronger with inoculum from organic fields. Plant productivity was inversely correlated with AMF abundance, suggesting that enhanced carbon allocation to AMF is at least in part responsible for plant growth reduction under our experimental conditions. However, <b>soil</b> <b>inoculation</b> did alter the ecological functioning of the system by reducing phosphorus leaching losses after simulated rain. Moreover, these leaching losses were lower with increased hyphal density and were related with abundance of particular AMF types, suggesting that abundance of AMF and their community composition may be useful indicators of phosphorus leaching losses. The results demonstrate that soil communities from different agricultural fields vary in their impact on plant productivity and nutrient leaching losses. The results further indicate that there is a potential tradeoff between positive effects of soil communities on sustainability and negative effects on crop productivity. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|E
