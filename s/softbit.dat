Motivated by the principle of exploiting the source redundancy at the receiver, in this treatise we study the application of iterative Error Concealment (EC) for low-complexity uplink video communications, where the video signal is modelled by a first-order Markov process. Firstly, we derive reduced-complexity formulas for the first-order Markov modelling aided source decoding. Then we propose a bit-based iterative EC algorithm, where a horizontal and a vertical source decoder are employed for exchanging their information using the iterative decoding philosophy. This scheme may be combined with low-complexity video codecs, provided that they retain some of the redundancy residing in the video signals and are capable of estimating the <b>softbit</b> information representing each bit of the video pixels. As application examples, we test our proposed two-dimensional iterative EC in both Wyner-Ziv video coded and uncompressed video transmission scenarios. Finally, we benchmark the attainable system performance against the existing first-order Markov process based <b>softbit</b> source decoding scheme, where the <b>softbit</b> decoding is performed by a one-dimensional Markov model aided decoder, {{as well as by}} the existing pixel-domain Wyner-Ziv video scheme. Our simulation results show that Eb/N 0 improvements in excess of 6 dB are attainable by the proposed technique in uncompressed video home-networking applications. Furthermore, up to 21. 5 % bitrate reduction is achieved by employing our proposed iterative error concealment technique in a Wyner-Ziv video coding scheme...|$|E

The receiver structures of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID), iterative sourcechannel decoding (ISCD), and iterative source coded modulation (ISCM) are merged to one novel Turbo system, in which in two iterative loops reliability information is exchanged between the three single components, demodulator, channel decoder, and (<b>softbit)</b> source decoder.

Motivated by the principle of exploiting the source redundancy at the receiver, in this treatise we study the application of iterative source channel decoding (ISCD) aided video communications, where the video signal is modelled by a first-order Markov process. Firstly, we derive reduced-complexity formulas for the first-order Markov modelling (FOMM) aided source decoding. Then we propose a bit-based iterative horizontal vertical scanline model (IHVSM) aided source decoding algorithm, where a horizontal and a vertical source decoder are employed for exchanging their extrinsic information using the iterative decoding philosophy. The iterative IHVSM aided decoder is then employed in a forward error correction (FEC) encoded uncompressed video transmission scenario, where the IHVSM and the FEC decoder exchange softbit-information for performing turbo-like ISCD {{for the sake of}} improving the reconstructed video quality. Finally, we benchmark the attainable system performance against a near-lossless H. 264 /AVC video communication system and the existing FOMM based <b>softbit</b> source decoding scheme, where The financial support of the RC-UK {{under the auspices of the}} India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC) and that of the EU under the CONCERTO project as well as that of the European Research Council’s Advanced Fellow Grant is gratefully acknowledged.

40|$|Abstract The {{performance}} of an OFDM-based transmis-sion system according to IEEE 802. 11 g can severely suffer from interfering Bluetooth packets. Therefore, we propose two new approaches for narrow-band interference suppression as countermeasure. At rst, {{the presence and}} frequency position of interference is blindly estimated by evaluating either the magnitude variance of the received symbols or the noise power on each subchannel. For that purpose, we present one algorithm based on differentiation in frequency direction, and another one making use of the median lter. After detection, an interference suppression by modifying the <b>softbit</b> magnitudes at the input of the channel decoder leads to a signicant improvement of the system performance, as we will show by simulations.

40|$|Abstract- A {{well known}} {{technique}} to protect bits with different sensitivities against channel errors is {{unequal error protection}} (UEP) by selective channel coding. However, some transmission systems such as Bluetooth and DECT include only weak or no channel coding. For those systems modulation with unequal power allocation (MUPA) is an appropriate technique to realize UEP without channel coding. MUPA allocates different transmission power to the modulation symbols according to the individual bit error sensitivities. In this paper we apply the MUPA concept to systems with <b>softbit</b> source decoding and soft demodulation, and enhance the MUPA approach by taking a 1 st order Markov model in terms of lst order a priori knowledge (AKI) into account (MUPA-AK 1).

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{iterative}} decoding of distributed channel encoded fixed-length codes for power-efficient cooperative transmissions. By exploiting {{the technique of}} iterative source channel decoding (ISCD), the iterative decoding for cooperative transmissions exploits two types of the redundant information: the residual redundancy inherently remaining in the source codes, and the artificial redundant {{information provided by the}} distributed channel coder. To avoid the information loss on the bit-to-symbol conversion, we adopt symbol-level ISCD scheme consisting of the symbol-level channel decoder and the symbol-level source decoder. Our proposed iterative decoding can improve parameter signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performances by iteratively refining the extrinsic information for the source and the distributed channel decoders. Furthermore, the proposed source decoding algorithm based on the symbol-level BCJR algorithm enables the iterative decoding to efficiently exploit the extrinsic information conveyed by relay and source nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative decoding scheme with the proposed source decoder and the symbol-level BCJR channel decoder delivers the robust power-efficient performance, and outperforms conventional decoding schemes.

40|$|The {{quality of}} digital {{transmission}} of speech, {{audio and video}} sig-nals over a noisy channel can be improved in many cases by er-ror concealment, specifically by <b>softbit</b> source decoding (SBSD). It applies parameter estimation exploiting a priori knowledge on parameter level and reliability information on bit level. In this con-tribution we present a novel soft demodulation (SDM) method for higher order digital modulation schemes based on SBSD. The soft demodulator makes a soft decision on signal point level using a mean square (MS) estimator and can also exploit a priori knowl-edge about the source. Furthermore, we present a novel concept for unequal error protection (UEP) by higher order modulation with unequal power allocation (MUPA). Usually, the bits repre-senting the quantized source codec parameters are protected by channel coding with UEP according to the individual bit error sen-sitivities. For communication systems where channel coding is not applicable, we propose the MUPA method with periodically time-varying power allocation. The average transmitted energy per bit remains unaffected. The significant SNR gains of the SDM com-bined with MUPA in comparison to systems with hard decision and a fixed signal constellation are demonstrated by simulation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstra t | In digital mobile {{communication}} usu-ally speech decoding algorithms are closely combined with error concealment techniques {{to reduce the}} sub-jective effects of residual bit errors. In general these error concealment techniques require reliability in-formation which {{is provided by the}} channel decoder. The amount of additional information may vary from 1 bit per received frame, e. g. in GSM a BFI (bad frame indicator) for a speech frame of 260 bits (Full Rate (FR) codec) or for a frame of 244 bits (Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) codec), up to several bits per re-ceived bit for <b>Softbit</b> Speech Decoding. In applica-tions such as the GSM infrastructure where the chan-nel decoder and the speech decoder are placed at spa-tially distant locations, the additional data rate re-quired to transmit the reliability information might not be available. Therefore, we break up the close connection between error concealment and speech decoding and move the error concealment unit to the base transceiver station where the channel decoder is lo-cated. As the error concealment algorithm pro-duces estimated speech parameters with high ampli-tude resolution a re-quantization of these estimated speech parameters is required which implies a loss in estimation quality. In this paper it is shown that this loss in quality is negligible in most practical cases. In addition, methods for a reduction of the re-quantization loss are discussed. I...|$|E
