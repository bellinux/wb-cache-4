When undertaking a journey through several canals with different lock-gear spindle sizes {{it was necessary to}} carry several different windlasses. A modern windlass usually has two sockets for use on different canals: the smaller is for the British Waterways standard spindle, fitted in the early 1990s almost everywhere, the larger for the gear on the Grand Union Canal north of Napton Junction, which they were unable/unwilling to convert.|$|E
25|$|The Magny Cours and Lisbon server {{parts were}} {{released}} in 2010. The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12cores and the Lisbon part in 4 and 6core parts. Magny Cours {{is focused on}} performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (multi-chip module) with two hexa-core “Istanbul” Opteron parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or <b>single</b> <b>socket</b> use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45 nm SOI process.|$|E
25|$|Multisocket {{adaptors}} {{allow the}} connection {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one <b>single</b> <b>socket</b> and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality adaptors are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non fire resistant ABS), and these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E

2500|$|Zen {{is a new}} {{architecture}} for x86-64 based Ryzen series CPUs and APUs, {{introduced in}} 2017 by AMD and built {{from the ground up}} by a team led by Jim Keller, beginning with his arrival in 2012, and taping out before his departure in September 2015. One of AMD's primary goals with Zen was an IPC increase of at least 40%, however in February 2017 AMD announced that they had actually achieved a 52% increase. Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the 14nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and HSA compatibility. Previous processors from AMD were either built in the 32nm process ("Bulldozer" [...] and [...] "Piledriver" [...] CPUs) or the 28nm process ("Steamroller" [...] and [...] "Excavator" [...] APUs). Because of this, Zen is much more energy efficient. The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a <b>single</b> <b>socket</b> (Socket AM4). Also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology, something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary Hyper-Threading implementation of SMT. This is a departure from the [...] "Clustered MultiThreading" [...] design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture. Zen also has support for DDR4 memory. AMD released the Zen-based high-end Ryzen 7 [...] "Summit Ridge" [...] series CPUs on March 2, 2017, mid-range Ryzen 5 series CPUs on April 11, 2017, and entry level Ryzen 3 series CPUs on July 27, 2017. AMD later released the Epyc line of Zen derived server processors for 1P and 2P systems. In October 2017, AMD released Zen based APUs as Ryzen Mobile, incorporating Vega graphics cores.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the most}} {{creative}} usages appeared in analogue satellite receivers. The function of decoding hybrid, time-compressed analogue-digital MAC transmissions into RGB and analogue audio was akin to making a digital receiver out of an analogue one. The D²B pins (10 and 12) were used for communicating with satellite dish positioners and for driving magnetic polarisers, before these became incorporated into LNBs. The daisy-chaining features were used to connect both a Pay TV decoder and a dish positioner/polariser to a <b>single</b> Decoder <b>socket</b> on the receiver.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spirit}} of Adrienne Mayor's {{ground-breaking}} studies of 2000 and 2005, the documentary explores how fossils may have influenced the mythologies of different cultures, including the Native Americans and the ancient Greeks. Mayor speculated that fossils could have led to mythological depictions of the thunderbird, the giant bird of Native American mythology, and the Cyclopes, the one-eyed giants of Greek and Roman mythology. The concept of the Cyclopes may have been derived from Greek encounters with elephant skulls. The Greeks, unfamiliar with living elephants, could have misinterpreted the skull's nose cavity as a <b>single</b> eye <b>socket.</b>|$|R

50|$|With {{third-party}} software, it {{is possible}} to use an alternate Kickstart to the version stored in the embedded ROM chip. Such software allows a Kickstart version to be loaded from file into RAM for example Kickstart 1.3 may be loaded in order to run old software incompatible with Kickstart 2.0 or later. Several third-party vendors produced hardware Kickstart switchers (dual-boot systems) in the form of socket doublers in order to allow two ROM chips to plug into a <b>single</b> motherboard <b>socket</b> with some mechanism to switch between them. These became popular with users who had problems with later Kickstart versions causing incompatibility with earlier software titles.|$|R
5000|$|... ::ffff:0:0/96 — This prefix is {{designated}} as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. With a few exceptions, this address type allows the transparent {{use of the}} Transport Layer protocols over IPv4 through the IPv6 networking application programming interface. Server applications only need to open a <b>single</b> listening <b>socket</b> to handle connections from clients using IPv6 or IPv4 protocols. IPv6 clients will be handled natively by default, and IPv4 clients appear as IPv6 clients at their IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. Transmission is handled similarly; established sockets {{may be used to}} transmit IPv4 or IPv6 datagram, based on the binding to an IPv6 address, or an IPv4-mapped address.

50|$|The server’s {{front panel}} offered two 3.5 inch drive bays. The hard disks were mounted in {{removable}} carriers, {{despite the fact}} that the server only supported cold swap. A <b>single</b> <b>socket</b> server, the processor on offer was the 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor. An intense cooling system was incorporated, with a large heatsink and an array of pipes, with three small fans addressing cooling needs. Despite the presence of three fans, the server’s noise levels were low. Power utilization was also low, with the server drawing 65W when idle and 94W at peak performance.|$|E

30|$|Relevancy {{evaluation}} {{was based}} on word cosine distance-measure, which {{is used by the}} Word 2 Vec-implementation. Word 2 Vec model had to be loaded initially into memory, which takes ~ 4.5  min on a cloud node. Due to the slowness of loading, and large memory consumption, relevancy evaluation was performed in a separate Eucalyptus instance. The experiments indicated that relevancy evaluation was slower, when compared to evaluation of timeliness/popularity (Fig.  13). Word 2 Vec service in the Relevancy node (Fig.  4) read words of a tweet one line at a time from a <b>single</b> TCP <b>socket.</b> Performance of relevancy evaluation may be improved, if multiple sockets would be utilized for the communication.|$|R
50|$|When IP-based virtual hosting is used, {{each site}} (either a DNS host name {{or a group}} of DNS host names that act the same) points to a unique IP address.

AMD Athlon 64 FX (1207), Opteron use {{up to three}} 16-bit HyperTransport links. Common clock rates for these {{processor}} links are 800 MHz to 1 GHz (older single and multi socket systems on 754/939/940 links) and 1.6 GHz to 2.0 GHz (newer <b>single</b> <b>socket</b> systems on AM2+/AM3 links—most newer cpus using 2.0 GHz). While HyperTransport itself is capable of 32-bit width links, that width is not currently utilized by any AMD processors. Some chipsets though do not even utilize the 16-bit width used by the processors. Those include the Nvidia nForce3 150, nForce3 Pro 150, and the ULi M1689—which use a 16-bit HyperTransport downstream link but limit the HyperTransport upstream link to 8 bits.|$|E
50|$|On {{a typical}} laptop {{there are several}} USB ports, an {{external}} monitor port (VGA, DVI, HDMI or Mini DisplayPort), an audio in/out port (often in form of a <b>single</b> <b>socket)</b> is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing multi-stream transport technology. Apple, in a 2015 version of its MacBook, transitioned {{from a number of}} different I/O ports to a single USB Type-C port. This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of aftermarket adapters. Google, with its updated version of Chromebook Pixel, shows a similar transition trend towards USB Type-C, although keeping older USB Type-A ports for a better compatibility with older devices. Although being common {{until the end of the}} 2000s decade, Ethernet network port are rarely found on modern laptops, due to widespread use of wireless networking, such as Wi-Fi. Legacy ports such as a PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, serial port, parallel port, or Firewire are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On Apple's systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also Thunderbolt ports, but Thunderbolt 3 uses USB Type-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.|$|E
