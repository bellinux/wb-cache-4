40|$|Immersion is an oft-quoted but {{ill-defined}} {{term used}} to describe a viewer or participant's sense of engagement with a visual display system or participatory media. Traditionally, advances in immersive quality came at {{the high price of}} ever-escalating hardware requirements and computational budgets. But what if one could increase a participant's sense of immersion, instead, by taking advantage of perceptual cues, neuroprocessing, and emotional engagement while adding only a small, yet distinctly targeted, set of advancements to the display hardware? This thesis describes three systems that introduce small amounts of computation to the visual display of information in order to increase the viewer's sense of immersion and participation. It also describes the types of content used to evaluate the systems, as well as the results and conclusions gained from small user studies. The first system, Infinity-by-Nine, takes advantage of the dropoff in peripheral visual acuity to surround the viewer with an extended lightfield generated in realtime from existing video content. The system analyzes an input video stream and outpaints a low-resolution, pattern-matched lightfield that simulates a fully immersive environment in a computationally efficient way. The second system, the Narratarium, is a context-aware projector that applies pattern recognition and natural language processing to an input such as an audio stream or electronic text to generate images, colors, and textures appropriate to the narrative or emotional content. The system outputs interactive illustrations and audio projected into spaces such as children's rooms, retail settings, or entertainment venues. The final system, the 3 D Telepresence Chair, combines a 19 th-century stage illusion known as Pepper's Ghost with an array of micro projectors and a holographic diffuser to create an autostereoscopic representation of a remote subject with full horizontal parallax. The 3 D Telepresence Chair is a portable, <b>self-contained</b> <b>apparatus</b> meant to enhance the experience of teleconferencing. by Daniel E. Novy. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audiencePurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{implement}} Virtual Phantom Magnetic Resonance Imaging (ViP MRI), a technique that allows for generating reference signals in MR images using radiofrequency (RF) signals, on a clinical MR system and to test newly designed virtual phantoms. Methods: MRI experiments were conducted on a 1. 5 T MRI scanner. Electromagnetic modelling of the ViP system was done using the principle of reciprocity. The ViP RF signals were generated using a compact waveform generator (dimensions of 26 cm × 18 cm × 16 cm), connected to a homebuilt 25 mm-diameter RF coil. The ViP RF signals were transmitted to the MRI scanner bore, simultaneously with the acquisition of the signal from the object of interest. Different types of MRI data acquisition (2 D and 3 D gradient-echo) as well as different phantoms, including the Shepp–Logan phantom, were tested. Furthermore, a uniquely designed virtual phantom — in the shape of a grid — was generated; this newly proposed phantom allows for the investigations of the vendor distortion correction field. Results: High quality MR images of virtual phantoms were obtained. An excellent agreement was found between the experimental data and the inverse cube law, which was the expected functional dependence obtained from the electromagnetic modelling of the ViP system. Short-term time stability measurements yielded a coefficient of variation in the signal intensity over time equal to 0. 23 % and 0. 13 % for virtual and physical phantom, respectively. MR images of the virtual grid-shaped phantom were reconstructed with the vendor distortion correction; this allowed for a direct visualization of the vendor distortion correction field. Furthermore, as expected from the electromagnetic modelling of the ViP system, a very compact coil (diameter ~ cm) and very small currents (intensity ~ mA) were sufficient to generate a signal comparable to that of physical phantoms in MRI experiments. Conclusions: The ViP MRI technique was successfully implemented on a clinical MR system. One of the major advantages of ViP MRI over previous approaches is that the generation and transmission of RF signals can be achieved with a <b>self-contained</b> <b>apparatus.</b> As such, the ViP MRI technique is transposable to different platforms (preclinical and clinical) of different vendors. It is also shown here that ViP MRI could be used to generate signals whose characteristics cannot be reproduced by physical objects. This could be exploited to assess MRI system properties, such as the vendor distortion correction field...|$|E
