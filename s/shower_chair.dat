50|$|Occupational {{therapy and}} special {{equipment}} such as assistive technology can also enhance people's independence and safety {{throughout the course of}} ALS. Gentle, low-impact aerobic exercise such as performing activities of daily living, walking, swimming, and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help people fight fatigue and depression. Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles. Physical and occupational therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles. They can suggest devices such as ramps, braces, walkers, bathroom equipment (<b>shower</b> <b>chairs,</b> toilet risers, etc.), and wheelchairs that help people remain mobile. Occupational therapists can provide or recommend equipment and adaptations to enable ALS people to retain as much safety and independence in activities of daily living as possible.|$|R
50|$|The same {{principles}} of access {{that apply to}} public buildings also apply to private homes and may be required as part of local building regulations. Important adaptations include external access, providing sufficient space for a wheelchair user to move around the home, doorways that are wide enough for convenient use, access to upper floors, where they exist, which can be provided either by dedicated wheelchair lifts, {{or in some cases}} by using a stairlift to transfer between wheelchairs on different floors, and by providing accessible bathrooms with showers and/or bathtubs that are designed for accessibility. Accessible bathrooms can permit the use of mobile shower chairs or transfer benches to facilitate bathing for people with disabilities. Wet rooms are bathrooms where the shower floor and bathroom floor are one continuous waterproof surface. Such floor designs allow a wheelchair user using a dedicated <b>shower</b> <b>chair,</b> or transferring onto a shower seat, to enter the shower without needing to overcome a barrier or lip.|$|E
40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2010 Showering in {{a bathtub}} {{is a key}} barrier for the rapidly growing {{geriatric}} generation. Based on previous ME 450 projects of designing a <b>shower</b> <b>chair</b> our team will improve the chair to prepare it for commercial use. This project is sponsored by Albert Shih, Naomi Gilbert, and Susan Murphy. The new <b>shower</b> <b>chair</b> should allow independence for an elderly person to get {{into and out of}} the bath safely. It will also be able to fold up in the shower to allow others to use the shower as well. The device will help geriatric patients safely bathe while maintaining privacy and stability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this coming}} ageing society worldly, a {{wheelchair}} {{is very important}} technical aid for an independent life with aids of elderly people and impaired persons. However, the number of accidents reported by a wheelchair was the worst among all the technical aids (e. g., walking frame, bed, <b>shower</b> <b>chair,</b> etc.) in 2012 in Japan. We propose “Aware Wheelchair” with sensor networks that detect dangers within “Two meters” and distribute awareness and suggest suitable actions to both user and caregivers. The system could also accumulate sensor data in mobility knowledgebase servers. We found that quick warning methods and assist functions that could correspond to various personal types with different physical abilities. We also show the results of wheelchair user assist simulation by the aware wheelchair...|$|E

The mob had broken through on one side the line of waggons, and was advancing, each segregated policeman the centre of a fighting group. The scabs were torn from their seats, the traces of the horses cut, and the frightened animals put in flight. Many policemen crawled under the coal waggon for safety, while the loose horses, with {{here and there a}} policeman on their backs or struggling at their heads to hold them, surged across the sidewalk opposite the jam and broke into Market Street.|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project has}} been carried out by Oscar Adolfsson and Marcus Blomqvist, during the spring of 2010, both {{studying}} to become Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Design Engineering, at Karlstad University. The degree project includes 22, 5 credits. The work is done on behalf of Etac Supply Center AB in Anderstorp. Etac is a company developing and manufacturing home health care products, with operation in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England and Germany, and with sales worldwide. Bo Lindqvist, R & D manager has been the contact person at Etac. During the project the students has had a workplace at Semcon Caran AB in Karlstad. Semcon has also been helpful as a sounding board. The objective of the work has been developing a new, wall mounted <b>shower</b> <b>chair,</b> assigned for persons with difficulty to stand up while showering. Etacs requirement of the <b>shower</b> <b>chair</b> is that it should be able to support a user with a weight of 100 kg, the chair shouldn’t have any outrigger, optional should be armrests and backrest. The seat should be mountable in existing bathrooms, and act as a complement for the current shower seats sold by Etac. It’s very important that the result is good looking, and appealing to new target groups. In the start of this project, the students have been carrying through a benchmarking, mainly at the NordBygg fair in Stockholm. The students have been agreeing about the lack of products with both functionality and aesthetic appealing qualities. The result is adjusted to fit the most common wall constructions in Sweden. Four concepts have been developed, and among these four, one is the final result. The final result consists of two aluminium wall rails and a plastic seat. A plastic backrest, and armrest in both plastic and stainless steel are optional. During the work, the specifications on products like these, from the Swedish institute of assistive technology, concerning strength and risks of pinching has been observed. The project has resulted in CAD-files and a model in scale 1 : 3, manufactured by Etac...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore {{evidence}} concerning clinical assessment, design and performance testing of mobile shower commodes used by adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). Method: Searches of electronic databases, conference proceedings and key journals were undertaken with no restriction on language or study design. Keywords included spinal cord injury, lesion, sanichair, sanitary chair, <b>shower</b> <b>chair,</b> bowel chair and commode. Results: A total of 20 publications were included in this review. Common approaches to clinical assessments were questionnaires and observational analysis to assess bowel care routines, function and skin integrity. Design features addressed access for bowel care, postural support, transfers, stability, use in wet environments and skin integrity. Objective performance measures addressed requirements for static stability, backward-sloping seat angles, arm supports and seat materials. Conclusions: Evidence reviewed was of low methodological quality and lacking in validated instruments to guide clinical practice. Further high-quality research is needed to identify bathing, showering and personal hygiene tasks affecting mobile shower commodes use and to develop validated clinical assessment tools. Performance testing to published standards is also needed. Implications for Rehabilitation Adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) use mobile shower commodes for functional activities including transferring, propelling, bowel care and showering, and the interactions between an adult with SCI, their mobile shower commode, and the physical environment are not well understood. Current mobile shower commode designs may not facilitate functional activities and may contribute to falls and development of pressure ulcers. Standardised and validated clinical assessment tools are needed to guide clinical practice, and should include questionnaires and observational analysis of functional activities performed in mobile shower commodes across all environments of use...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Mechanical load during patient {{handling}} activities {{is an important}} risk factor for low back pain among nursing personnel. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe required and actual use of ergonomic devices during {{patient handling}} activities and to assess the influence of these ergonomic devices on mechanical load during patient handling activities. METHODS: For each patient, based on national guidelines, it was recorded which specific ergonomic devices were required during distinct patient handling activities, defined by transferring a patient, providing personal care, repositioning patients in the bed, and putting on and taking off anti-embolism stockings. During real-time observations over ~ 60 h among 186 nurses on 735 separate patient handling activities in 17 nursing homes, it was established whether ergonomic devices were actually used. Mechanical load was assessed through observations of frequency and duration of a flexed or rotated trunk > 30 ° and frequency of pushing, pulling, lifting or carrying requiring forces 230 N from start to end of each separate patient handling activity. The number of patients and nurses per ward and the ratio of nurses per patient were used as ward characteristics with potential influence on mechanical load. A mixed-effect model for repeated measurements was used to determine the influence of ergonomic devices and ward characteristics on mechanical load. RESULTS: Use of ergonomic devices was required according to national guidelines in 520 of 735 (71 %) separate patient handling activities, and actual use was observed in 357 of 520 (69 %) patient handling activities. A favourable ratio of nurses per patient was associated with a decreased duration of time spent in awkward back postures during handling anti-embolism stocking (43 %), patient transfers (33 %), and personal care of patients (24 %) and also frequency of manually lifting patients (33 %). Use of lifting devices was associated with a lower frequency of forces exerted (64 %), adjustable bed and <b>shower</b> <b>chairs</b> with a shorter duration of awkward back postures (38 %), and an anti-embolism stockings slide with a lower frequency of forces exerted (95 %). CONCLUSIONS: In wards in nursing homes with a higher number of staff less awkward back postures as well as forceful lifting were observed during patient handling activities. The use of ergonomic devices was high and associated with less forceful movements and awkward back postures. Both aspects will most likely contribute to the prevention of low back pain among nurses...|$|R
