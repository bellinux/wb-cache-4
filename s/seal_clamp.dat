40|$|Abstract: The injecting online {{leak sealing}} {{technology}} {{is an emergency}} repair technique widely applied in process industry, which can remove the leakages of the devices, flanges, pipes and valves, with safe, reliable, economic and efficient. In a variety of online leak sealing operations, the work to handle flange leakages accounts for about 90 % of the entire workload. This is because most of flanges in actual production have the installing and machining defects, such as uneven clearance, eccentric, reducing, etc. Aimed at those flanges with defects, to ensure the seal effect, the online leak <b>sealing</b> <b>clamp</b> must be machined and installed precisely, which will increase the difficulty of operation. Thus, {{on the basis of}} comparing advantages and disadvantages of the existing enhanced <b>seal</b> <b>clamps,</b> a new design has proposed {{to solve the problem of}} flange leakage, especially for the flange with defects, which can reduce the difficulties of operation while ensuring the sealing effect...|$|R

40|$|Joint leakage {{from low}} {{pressure}} natural gas distribution mains (typical value: 0. 25 ft[superscript 3] at 6 inwg gas pressure) is a persistent source of maintenance problems for utitlites. External encapsulation {{is the usual}} choice for repairing leaking joints. It is reliable and expensive, about $ 1000 per joint (80 % of which is for excavation and resurfacing). Consolidated Edison of New York is sponsoring a project to develop a cheap and reliable joint seal. No current sealing methods {{were found to be}} acceptable in Phase I. Adhesion failures between the seal and pipe were a major cause of seal failure. Preliminary Phase II research recommended the development of an internal mechanical seal. Such a seal would minimize excavation and eliminate adhesion failures. To complete Phase II, an internal mechanical seal was developed. The initial research indicated that cleaning of the pipe interior had to be minimized or eliminated. Testing demonstrated that a sealant, either asphalt or vulcanizing silicone, greatly enhanced the sealing of uncleaned pipes, while permitting low stress levels. This {{led to the development of}} a new internal mechanical seal concept for sealing uncleaned gas main joints. Joint tests of 2 injected silicone seal concepts were run. The Type 1 seal, which filled the joint recess, completely sealed an uncleaned pipe joint. The Type 2 seal, which spanned the joint recess with an elastomeric bridge, had a leak rate of 0. 000038 ft[superscript 3]/hr at 6 inwg gas pressure from an uncleaned joint. The leakage was caused by permiability of the silicone bridge.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{kinetics}} of 9 -aminoacridine (9 -AA) {{block of}} single Na channels in neuroblastoma N 1 E- 115 cells were studied using the gigohm <b>seal,</b> patch <b>clamp</b> technique, under the {{condition in which}} the Na current inactivation had been eliminated by treatment with N-bromoacetamide (NBA).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which external Ca ions block sodium channels were studied by a gigaohm <b>seal</b> patch <b>clamp</b> method using membranes excised from N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma cells. Tetramethrin was used to prolong the open time of single channels so that the current-voltage relationship could be readily determined {{over a wide range}} of membrane potentials. Comparable experiments were performed in the absence of tetramethrin. Increasing external Ca ions from 0. 18 to 9. 0 mM reduced the single channel conductance without causing flickering. From the dose-response relation the dissociation constant for Ca block at 0 mV was estimated to be 32. 4 +/- 1. 05 mM. The block was intensified by hyperpolarization. The voltage dependence indicates that Ca ions bind to sodium channels at a site located 37 +/- 2 % of the electrical distance from the outside. The current increased with increasing external Na concentrations but showed a saturation; the concentration for half-maximal saturation was estimated to be 185 mM at - 50 mV and 204 mM at 0 mV. A model consisting of a one-ion pore with four barriers and three wells can account for the observations that deviate from the independence principle, namely, the saturation of current, block by Ca ions, and rectification in current-voltage relationship. The results suggest that the Ca-induced decrease of the macroscopic sodium current results from a reduced single sodium channel conductance...|$|R

40|$|A {{device is}} {{disclosed}} for <b>sealing</b> and <b>clamping</b> a cylindrical element {{which is to}} be attached to an object such as a wall, a pressurized vessel or another cylindrical element. The device includes a gland having an inner cylindrical wall, which is threaded at one end and is attached at a bendable end to a deformable portion, which in turn is attached to one end of a conical cantilever structure. The other end of the cantilever structure connects at a bendable area to one end of an outer cylindrical wall. The opposite end of cylindrical wall terminates in a thickened portion, the radially outer surface of which is adapted to accommodate a tool for rotating the gland. The terminal end of cylindrical wall also includes an abutment surface, which is adapted to engage a seal, which in turn engages a surface of a receiver. The receiver further includes a threaded portion for engagement with the threaded portion of gland whereby a tightening rotation of gland relative to receiver will cause relative movement between cylindrical walls and of gland. This movement causes a rotation of the conical structure and thus a bending action at bending area and at the bending end of the upper end of inner cylindrical wall. These rotational and bending actions result in a forcing of the deformable portion radially inwardly so as to contact and deform a pipe. This forcible contact creates a seal between gland and pipe, and simultaneously clamps the pipe in position...|$|R

40|$|Background:Suture hole {{bleeding}} from synthetic grafts presents a hemostatic challenge. The designs of many vascular sealants are not optimal (non-adherence to wet surfaces, excessive swelling, inflexible). PreveLeak™ (formerly ArterX) is a polyaldehyde-bovine serum albumin-based sealant whose efficacy, safety, and performance were evaluated in this first-in-human study. Methods:A prospective, single-arm, multicenter study {{was performed in}} patients undergoing open vascular reconstructions with prosthetic grafts. Sealant {{was applied to the}} suture line after completion of the anastomosis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of immediate sealing (without clinically significant bleeding) upon clamp release. Secondary endpoints were time to sealing, safety, and assessment of product performance. Results:Fifty-six anastomoses were performed in 32 patients. Grafts were Dacron (66 % of sites), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; 32 %) or both Dacron and PTFE (2 %). The femoral artery was the most common site of anastomosis (41 % of sites). Immediate <b>sealing</b> after <b>clamp</b> release was achieved at all anastomoses (100 %); 93 % had no bleeding and 7 % had oozing. No rebleeding occurred during 10 minutes of observation. The 3 most common adverse events were graft or bypass occlusion (n= 5 patients), infection (n= 4), and seroma (n= 3); none were device-related. The sealant was considered easy to apply, quickly forming a soft gel and adhering to tissue and grafts. Conclusions:PreveLeak effectively sealed anastomotic suture lines during vascular reconstruction procedures and was considered easy to use.

40|$|Sodium {{currents}} in cultured rat muscle cells converted to myoballs by treatment with colchicine were recorded using a giga-ohm <b>seal</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> procedure {{in the whole}} cell configuration. The mean peak Na+ conductance of the myoballs was 90 pS/pm * of surface membrane. Half-maximal activation of Na+ currents was observed for test pulses to- 31 mV and half-maximal inactivation was observed for prepulses to- 74 mV. Titration of the inhibition of Na+ currents by tetrodotoxin (TTX) yielded a biphasic inhibition curve consistent {{with the presence of}} two classes of Na+ channels differing in affinity for TTX. The TTX-sensitive channels carried 28 % of the Na+ current and had an apparent KD for lTX of 13 nM at 20 °C. The TTX-insensitive Na+ channels had an apparent K. for TTX of 3. 2 PM. Inhibition of TTX-insensitive Na+ channels by TTX was enhanced by repetitive stimulation of the myoballs at 2 Hz, whereas the inhibition of lTXsensitive Na+ channels by TTX was not frequency dependent. We conclude that rat muscle cells developing in vitro synthesize physiologically functional, T-TX-sensitive Na+ channels in the absence of innervation. These channels, which are characteristic of adult skeletal muscle, function in parallel with TTX-insensitive Na+ channels that are present in embryonic muscle. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels mediate the rapid sodium influx during the depolarizing phase of the action potential in vertebrate skeletal muscle.

40|$|AbstractAnnexin V, VI and VII-core (Δ 1 – 107) {{are members}} of the annexin protein family and bind to acidic {{phospholipid}} membranes in a calcium dependent manner. They also show ion channel activity under certain conditions. As annexins bind peripherally to lipid membranes, ion channel formation must consist of at least two steps: An adsorption reaction regulating the binding of annexin to the membrane surface and the opening and closing of the active species controlling the channel activity. By using the baseline current through the patch <b>clamp</b> <b>seal</b> as a probe for unoccupied binding sites at the membrane, we show that the adsorption of annexins to membranes is not only calcium dependent but also strongly voltage dependent. Whereas the free transfer energies at low calcium concentrations are similar for all three annexins, the binding of annexin V becomes much tighter with higher calcium levels, compared to annexin VI and VII-core. This correlates with the finding that annexin VI and VII-core display channel activity much more often than annexin V if one assumes that a high coverage of the membrane surface with annexins stabilizes the bilayer. At higher protein concentrations weaker binding is observed in agreement with the previously reported anti-cooperativity of membrane binding...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent work}} we {{introduced}} fractional Nernst–Planck equations and related fractional cable equations to model electrodiffusion of ions in nerve cells with anomalous subdiffusion along {{and across the}} nerve cells. This work was motivated by many computational and experimental studies showing that anomalous diffusion is ubiquitous in biological systems with binding, crowding, or trapping. For example, recent experiments have shown that anomalous subdiffusion occurs along the axial direction in spiny dendrites due to trapping by the spines. We modeled the subdiffusion in two ways leading to two fractional cable equations and presented fundamental solutions on infinite and semi-infinite domains. Here we present solutions on finite domains for mixed Robin boundary conditions. The finite domain solutions model passive electrotonic properties of spiny dendritic branch segments with ends that are voltage <b>clamped,</b> <b>sealed,</b> or killed. The behavior of the finite domain solutions is similar for both fractional cable equations. With uniform subdiffusion along and across the nerve cells, the solution approaches the standard nonzero steady state, but the approach is slowed by the anomalous subdiffusion. If the subdiffusion is more anomalous along the axial direction, then (boundary conditions permitting) the solution converges to a zero steady state, whereas if the subdiffusion is less anomalous along the axial direction, then the solution approaches a spatially linear steady state. These solutions could be compared with realistic electrophysiological experiments on actual dendrites...|$|R

Following NBA treatment, the current flowing through individual Na channels was manifested by square-wave open events lasting from several to tens of milliseconds. When 9 -AA {{was applied to the}} cytoplasmic face of Na channels at concentrations ranging from 30 to 100 microM, it caused repetitive rapid transitions (flickering) between open and blocked states within single openings of Na channels, without affecting the amplitude of the single channel current. The histograms for the duration of blocked states and the histograms for the duration of open states could be fitted with a single-exponential function. The mean open time (tau o) became shorter as the drug concentration was increased, while the mean blocked time (tau b) was concentration independent. The association (blocking) rate constant, kappa, calculated from the slope of the curve relating the reciprocal mean open time to 9 -AA concentration, showed little voltage dependence, the rate constant being on the order of 1 X 10 (7) M- 1 s- 1. The dissociation (unblocking) rate constant, l, calculated from the mean blocked time, was strongly voltage dependent, the mean rate constant being 214 s- 1 at 0 mV and becoming larger as the membrane being hyperpolarized. The voltage dependence suggests that a first-order blocking site is located at least 63 % of the way through the membrane field from the cytoplasmic surface. The equilibrium dissociation constant for 9 -AA to block the Na channel, defined by the relation of l/kappa, was calculated to be 21 microM at 0 mV. Both tau - 1 o and tau - 1 b had a Q 10 of 1. 3, which suggests that binding reaction was diffusion controlled. The burst time in the presence of 9 -AA, which is the sum of open times and blocked times, was longer than the lifetime of open channels in the absence of drug. All of the features of 9 -AA block of single Na channels are compatible with the sequential model in which 9 -AA molecules block open Na channels, and the blocked channels could not close until 9 -AA molecules had left the blocking site in the channels...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Blood {{loss and}} bile leakage are {{well-known}} {{risk factors for}} morbidity and mortality during liver resection. Bleeding usually occurs during parenchymal transection, and surgical technique should be considered {{an important factor in}} preventing intraoperative and postoperative complications. Objective. Many approaches and devices have been developed to limit bleeding and bile leakage. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether a bipolar vessel sealing device allows a safe and careful liver transection without routine inflow occlusion, achieving a satisfactory hemostasis and bile stasis, thus reducing blood loss and bile leak and related complications. Patients and methods. A total of 50 consecutive patients (24 males, 26 females, with a mean age of 57 years) underwent major and minor hepatic resections using a bipolar vessel <b>sealing</b> device. A <b>clamp</b> crushing technique followed by energy application was used to perform the parenchymal transection. Inflow occlusion was used when necessary to control blood loss but not as a routine. No other devices were applied to achieve hemostasis. Results. The instrument was effective in 45 patients and failed to achieve hemostasis in 5 cases, all of whom had a cirrhotic liver. Median blood loss was 490 ml (range 100 – 2500 ml) and intraoperative blood transfusions were required in eight cases (16 %). Mean operative time was 178 min (range 50 – 315 min). Inflow occlusion was necessary in 16 (32 %) patients. The postoperative complication rate was 24 %, with a postoperative hemorrhage in a cirrhotic patient. There was no clinical evidence of bile leak or procedure-related abdominal abscess. Conclusion. We conclude that the device is a useful tool in standard liver resection, achieving good hemostasis and bile stasis in patients with normal liver parenchyma, but its use should be avoided in cirrhotic patients...|$|R

Electrosurgical bipolar vessel <b>sealing</b> versus {{conventional}} <b>clamping</b> and suturing for vaginal hysterectomy: a randomised controlled trial. BJOG 2012; 119 : 14731482. Objective To compare {{the effects of}} electrical bipolar vessel sealing and conventional suturing on postoperative pain, recovery, costs and micturition symptoms in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Eight teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Population One hundred women scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy for benign conditions excluding pelvic organ prolapse. Methods Women were randomised to vessel sealing or conventional surgery. The quality of life related to pelvic floor function was assessed using validated questionnaires before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Pain scores and recovery were assessed using a diary, including daily visual analogue scale scores, starting from the day before surgery until 6 weeks after surgery. Main outcome measures Visual analogue scale pain scores, surgery time, blood loss, complications, quality of life related to pelvic floor function and costs. Results The evening after surgery, women in the vessel-sealing group reported significantly less pain (5. 7 versus 4. 5 {{on a scale of}} 010, P = 0. 03), but after that pain scores were similar. Operation duration was shorter for vessel sealing (60 versus 71 minutes, P = 0. 05). Blood loss and hospital stay did not differ. We observed no major difference in costs between the two interventions (2903 versus 3102 pound, P = 0. 26). Changes in micturition and defecation symptoms were not affected by the surgical technique used. Conclusion Using vessel sealing during vaginal hysterectomy resulted in less pain on the first postoperative day, shorter operating time, similar morbidity and similar pelvic floor function. No major differences in costs were found between the two intervention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroduction. Blood {{loss and}} bile leakage are {{well-known}} {{risk factors for}} morbidity and mortality during liver resection. Bleeding usually occurs during parenchymal transection, and surgical technique should be considered {{an important factor in}} preventing intraoperative and postoperative complications. Objective. Many approaches and devices have been developed to limit bleeding and bile leakage. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether a bipolar vessel sealing device allows a safe and careful liver transection without routine inflow occlusion, achieving a satisfactory hemostasis and bile stasis, thus reducing blood loss and bile leak and related complications. Patients and methods. A total of 50 consecutive patients (24 males, 26 females, with a mean age of 57 years) underwent major and minor hepatic resections using a bipolar vessel <b>sealing</b> device. A <b>clamp</b> crushing technique followed by energy application was used to perform the parenchymal transection. Inflow occlusion was used when necessary to control blood loss but not as a routine. No other devices were applied to achieve hemostasis. Results. The instrument was effective in 45 patients and failed to achieve hemostasis in 5 cases, all of whom had a cirrhotic liver. Median blood loss was 490 ml (range 100 – 2500 ml) and intraoperative blood transfusions were required in eight cases (16 %). Mean operative time was 178 min (range 50 – 315 min). Inflow occlusion was necessary in 16 (32 %) patients. The postoperative complication rate was 24 %, with a postoperative hemorrhage in a cirrhotic patient. There was no clinical evidence of bile leak or procedure-related abdominal abscess. Conclusion. We conclude that the device is a useful tool in standard liver resection, achieving good hemostasis and bile stasis in patients with normal liver parenchyma, but its use should be avoided in cirrhotic patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Taste buds were {{isolated}} from the fungiform papilla of the rat tongue and the receptor cells (TRCs) were patch <b>clamped.</b> <b>Seals</b> were obtained on the basolateral membrane of 281 TRCs, protruding from the intact taste buds or isolated by micro-dissection. In whole-cell configuration 72 % of the cells had a TTX blockable transient Na inward current (mean peak amplitude 0. 74 hA). All cells had outward K currents. Their activation was slower than for the Na current and a slow inactivation was also noticeable. The K currents were blocked by tetraethylammonium, Ba, and 4 -aminopyridine, and were absent when the pipette contained Cs instead of K. With 100 mM Ba or 100 mM Ca in the bath, two types of inward current were observed. An L-type Ca current (ICaL) activated at- 20 mV had a mean peak amplitude of 440 pA and inactivated very slowly. At 3 mM Ca the activation threshold of ICa L was near- 40 mV. A transient T-type current (/CAT) activated at- 50 mV had an average peak amplitude of 53 pA and inactivated with a time constant of 36 ms at- 30 inV. ICR L was blocked more efficiently by Cd and D 600 than/Ca T. ICa T was blocked by 0. 2 mM Ni and half blocked by 200 #M amiloride. In whole-cell voltage clamp, Na-saccharin caused (in 34 % of 55 cells tested) a decrease in outward K currents by 21 %, which {{may be expected to}} depolarize the TRCs. Also, Na-saccharin caused some taste cells to fire action potentials (on-ceLl, 7 out of 24 cells; whole-ceLl, 2 out of 38 cells responding to saccharin) of amplitudes sufficient to activate/CAL. ThUS the action potentials will cause Ca inflow, which may trigger release of transmitter...|$|R
