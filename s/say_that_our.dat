Some of us find it advisable to rise slowly after lying down, as due to malnutrition, any rapid movement is apt to cause dizziness or even a black-out ... one morning recently I awoke and discovered to my horror that my sight had become very dim.

2500|$|The cave {{attracted}} {{considerable attention}} in December 2010 when reports suggested Israeli and Spanish archaeologists {{had found the}} earliest evidence yet of modern humans.

Science blogger Carl Zimmer wrote: [...] "Nowhere in this conclusion do the authors say that these teeth belong to Homo sapiens. Nowhere do they say they have just doubled the age of our species.

"One strong objection, I know, will be {{made against}} my whole design, by people of weak consciences; which is, that every rule I shall lay down will be exactly {{opposite}} to the doctrine of Christianity. Greatly, indeed, in a Christian country, should I fear the forces of such an objection, could I perceive, that any one vice was refrained from on that account only.

Some great critics <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> aboriginal music {{is the same as}} played by all primitive people world over. Chinese music itself is built on the same principle and I am planning out the composition called the evolution of music. I hope to show the growth of harmony. First, so many musicians will come out in Indian costume, play some primitive melody. Others will follow playing something more advanced, and so on until the whole band is on stage and we are rendering the best grand opera." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Shōwa period, there was an outbreak of controversy over which onibaba legend from was the original: the one from Adachigahara in Fukushima or the one from Adachigahara in Saitama. Here, the folkloricist Masayoshi Nishitsunoi stepped in and argued [...] "to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> lands was where the onibaba originated is pretty much to advertise our land as an undeveloped, savage land, so it'd be better to give up our claims" [...] towards those on the Saitama side to convince them to give up on it, ending the debate. The Tōkō-ji that was once at Kurozuka was then moved to Ōmiya-ku in Saitama, and the place that was Kurozuka was later developed as residential lands, so there is no sight left behind to see.|$|E

2500|$|The President must [...] "take {{care that}} the laws be {{faithfully}} executed." [...] This clause in the Constitution imposes a duty on the President to enforce {{the laws of the}} United States and is called the Take Care Clause, also known as the Faithful Execution Clause or Faithfully Executed Clause. This clause is meant to ensure that a law is faithfully executed by the President [...] even if he disagrees with the purpose of that law. Addressing the North Carolina ratifying convention, William Maclaine declared that the Faithful Execution Clause was [...] "one of the [...] best provisions." [...] If the President [...] "takes care to see the laws faithfully executed, it will be more than is done in any government on the continent; for I will venture to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> government, and those of the other states, are, with respect to the execution of the laws, in many respects mere ciphers."
