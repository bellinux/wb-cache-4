5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on <b>Sunday</b> <b>mornings</b> after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
