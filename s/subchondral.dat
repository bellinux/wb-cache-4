5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the <b>subchondral</b> bone. This loss of blood flow causes the <b>subchondral</b> bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying <b>subchondral</b> bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can {{be performed}} to show necrosis of <b>subchondral</b> bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is {{used to assess the}} degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E
5|$|Candidates for non-operative {{treatment}} {{are limited to}} skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion {{and the absence of}} loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the <b>subchondral</b> bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in <b>subchondral</b> avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|The {{articular}} cartilage's {{capacity for}} repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate <b>subchondral</b> bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the <b>subchondral</b> bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the <b>subchondral</b> region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying <b>subchondral</b> bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying <b>subchondral</b> bone.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{made with}} {{reasonable}} certainty based on history and clinical examination. X-rays may confirm the diagnosis. The typical changes seen on X-ray include: joint space narrowing, <b>subchondral</b> sclerosis (increased bone formation around the joint), <b>subchondral</b> cyst formation, and osteophytes. Plain films may not correlate with the findings on physical examination or with the degree of pain. Usually other imaging techniques are not necessary to clinically diagnose osteoarthritis.|$|E

500|$|KÃ¶nig {{named the}} disease [...] "osteochondritis dissecans", {{describing}} it as a <b>subchondral</b> inflammatory {{process of the}} knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint. On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the talus, Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). The term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and metatarsophalangeal joints.|$|E
500|$|Despite much research, {{the causes}} remain unclear but include {{repetitive}} physical trauma, ischemia (restriction of blood flow), hereditary and endocrine factors, avascular necrosis (loss of blood flow), rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in {{the ratio of}} calcium to phosphorus, and problems of bone formation. Although the name [...] "osteochondritis" [...] implies inflammation, the lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive microtrauma, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the <b>subchondral</b> bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{structures}} {{within the}} joint {{can also be}} affected. The ligaments within the joint become thickened and fibrotic and the menisci can become damaged and wear away. Menisci can be completely absent {{by the time a}} person undergoes a joint replacement. New bone outgrowths, called [...] "spurs" [...] or osteophytes, can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the articular cartilage surfaces {{in the absence of the}} menisci. The <b>subchondral</b> bone volume increases and becomes less mineralized (hypomineralization). All these changes can cause problems functioning. The pain in an osteoarthritic joint has been related to thickened synovium and <b>subchondral</b> bone lesions.|$|E
2500|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} {{which is the}} western world's leading cause of pain and disability. [...] It {{is characterized by the}} progressive loss of normal structure and function of articular cartilage, the smooth tissue covering the end of the moving bones. This chronic disease not only affects the articular cartilage but the <b>subchondral</b> bone, the synovium and periarticular tissues are other candidates. People with OA can experience severe pain and limited motion. OA is mostly the result of natural aging of the joint due to biochemical changes in the cartilage extracellular matrix.|$|E

The quality of the repair tissue after these [...] "bone marrow stimulating techniques" [...] depends on various factors including the species and age of the individual, the size and localization of the {{articular cartilage}} defect, the surgical technique, e.g., how the <b>subchondral</b> bone plate is treated, and the postoperative rehabilitation protocol.|$|E
