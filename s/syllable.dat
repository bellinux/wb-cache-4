5|$|Intonation in {{indicative}} clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate <b>syllable,</b> {{falls on}} the penult and rises on the last <b>syllable.</b> Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and {{falls on the}} last <b>syllable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stress {{movement}} from light <b>syllable</b> to following heavy <b>syllable</b> {{when not in}} pausa, with newly unstressed light <b>syllable</b> reducing the schwa.|$|E
5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across <b>syllable</b> boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman {{as they do}} in many other languages. This means that a nasal in a <b>syllable</b> coda will not move to the position of the following <b>syllable</b> onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E
50|$|In moraic theory, heavy <b>syllables</b> are {{analyzed}} as containing two morae, light <b>syllables</b> one, and superheavy <b>syllables</b> three.|$|R
5000|$|The sounds {{represented}} by [...] and [...] are allophonic. [...] appears mainly in <b>syllables</b> before the stress accent and optionally in open unstressed <b>syllables</b> otherwise. [...] appears in stressed <b>syllables</b> and in unstressed closed <b>syllables.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Syllables</b> {{ending in}} a vowel are called open <b>syllables,</b> and those {{ending in a}} {{consonant}} are called closed <b>syllables.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a <b>syllable</b> is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by <b>syllable</b> weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first <b>syllable.</b> In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate <b>syllable</b> if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate <b>syllable,</b> i.e. the third-to-last <b>syllable.</b> In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long <b>syllable.</b> Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first <b>syllable</b> are stressed on the second <b>syllable.</b> But if their first <b>syllable</b> is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first <b>syllable</b> is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second <b>syllable</b> that is stressed.|$|E
5000|$|ŚBM 10.3.1. {{describes}} {{that the}} altar is symbolically built with gayatri (godess of sound) (24 <b>syllables),</b> usnih (breath, 28 <b>syllables),</b> pankti (mind, 40 <b>syllables),</b> tristubh (ear, 44 <b>syllables),</b> jagati (awakening) (48 <b>syllables)</b> and generative breath. The gayatri altar's height is to the knees, the tristubh's to the navel and the jagati's to a man's height.|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} rhythm, English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning {{that the amount of}} time between stressed <b>syllables</b> tends to be equal. Stressed <b>syllables</b> are pronounced longer, but unstressed <b>syllables</b> (<b>syllables</b> between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed <b>syllables</b> are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|R
500|$|... {{reduction}} {{occurs in}} the open <b>syllables</b> two <b>syllables</b> away from the stress and sometimes also in pretonic and stressed open <b>syllables</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects have {{stress on}} the {{penultimate}} <b>syllable</b> of a word. In Mexicanero from Durango, many unstressed syllables have disappeared from words, and the placement of <b>syllable</b> stress has become phonemic.|$|E
5|$|Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not {{distinguish}} different meanings) {{and thus is}} considered to depend entirely on <b>syllable</b> structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first <b>syllable.</b> Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy <b>syllable</b> gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.|$|E
5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final <b>syllable,</b> with secondary stress on every second <b>syllable</b> from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first <b>syllable</b> has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second <b>syllable</b> has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Syllables</b> can be {{classified}} as full (or strong), and weak. Weak <b>syllables</b> are usually grammatical markers such as 了 le, or the second <b>syllables</b> of some compound words (although many other compounds consist {{of two or more}} full <b>syllables).</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the acoustic correlates of relative prominence in connected Mandarin speech, particularly those acoustic manifestations that reveal {{an interaction between}} stressed and unstressed <b>syllables.</b> The acoustic measurements are primarily concerned with segment duration, intensity, and F 0. This study shows that: (1) stressed CV <b>syllables</b> have significantly longer consonant and vowel durations and greater intensity when preceding unstressed <b>syllables</b> than stressed syllables; (2) vowel intensity and duration of stressed <b>syllables</b> are significantly affected by the stressed status of preceding and succeeding <b>syllables,</b> and anticipatory effects are greater on vowel duration but carryover ones are greater on vowel intensity; (3) apart from their lexical stress status, the relative prominence of consecutive <b>syllables</b> is mainly determined by interaction [...] -i. e., unstressed <b>syllables</b> render neighboring <b>syllables</b> more prominent, while stressed <b>syllables</b> cause neighboring <b>syllables</b> to become weak, engendering a pattern of alternating strong and weak <b>syllables.</b> This study also provides insights into the metrical structure of Mandarin and how stress functions in Mandarin speech, where stress and accent interact with lexical tones...|$|R
5|$|Exclamatory phrases {{follow the}} typical {{steadily}} rising pattern, but rise sharply {{on the last}} <b>syllable</b> instead of falling.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by <b>syllable</b> weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last <b>syllable</b> is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate <b>syllable</b> is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
5|$|In modern Turkish, {{the name}} is written as İstanbul, with a dotted İ, as the Turkish {{alphabet}} distinguishes between a dotted and dotless I. In English the stress is on the last <b>syllable</b> (bul), but in Turkish {{it is on the}} second <b>syllable</b> (tan). A person from the city is an İstanbullu (plural: İstanbullular), although Istanbulite is used in English.|$|E
50|$|Languages {{with simple}} tone systems or pitch accent may {{have one or}} two <b>syllables</b> {{specified}} for tone, {{with the rest of the}} word taking a default tone. Such languages differ in which tone is marked and which is the default. In Navajo, for example, <b>syllables</b> have a low tone by default, whereas marked <b>syllables</b> have high tone. In the related language Sekani, however, the default is high tone, and marked <b>syllables</b> have low tone. There are parallels with stress: English stressed <b>syllables</b> have a higher pitch than unstressed <b>syllables,</b> whereas in Russian, stressed <b>syllables</b> have a lower pitch.|$|R
5000|$|The khlong si suphap ( [...] , [...] ) is {{the most}} common form still {{currently}} employed. It has four bat per stanza (si translates as four). The first wak of each bat has five <b>syllables.</b> The second wak has two or four <b>syllables</b> in the first and third bat, two <b>syllables</b> in the second, and four <b>syllables</b> in the fourth. Mai ek is required for seven <b>syllables</b> and Mai tho is required for four, as shown below. [...] "Dead word" [...] <b>syllables</b> are allowed in place of <b>syllables</b> which require mai ek, and changing the spelling of words to satisfy the criteria is usually acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Anceps <b>syllables</b> can {{be found}} in a variety of {{metrical}} forms. Anceps <b>syllables</b> in the middle or beginning of a line are characteristic of Aeolic meters, such as the Sapphic meter. These initial anceps <b>syllables</b> may reflect earlier Indo-European meters where only the last few <b>syllables</b> of a line were regulated. Anceps <b>syllables</b> are also found in the iambic trimeter of Greek drama.|$|R
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final <b>syllable,</b> hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed <b>syllable</b> preceded by a minor <b>syllable.</b> The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Some library catalogs write Chinese {{language}} titles {{with each}} <b>syllable</b> separate, even syllables {{belonging to a}} single word.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four <b>syllable</b> metric foot with a {{stressed}} <b>syllable</b> followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed <b>syllable.</b> The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.|$|E
25|$|Development of tone: Stressed acute <b>syllables,</b> and all final open <b>syllables,</b> were {{pronounced}} {{with rising}} tone. Other stressed <b>syllables</b> were pronounced with falling tone.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{languages}} {{have fewer}} vowels in unstressed <b>syllables</b> than stressed <b>syllables.</b> This again reflects the Italo-Western Romance parent language, {{which had a}} seven-vowel system in stressed <b>syllables</b> (as described above) but only [...] (with no low-mid vowels) in unstressed <b>syllables.</b> Some languages have seen further reductions: e.g. Standard Catalan has only [...] in unstressed <b>syllables.</b> In French, on the other hand, any vowel may take prosodic stress.|$|R
5|$|A {{legitimate}} <b>syllable</b> in Hokkien {{takes the}} form (initial) + (medial vowel) + nucleus + (stop) + tone, where items in parenthesis indicate optional components.|$|E
5|$|Although , {{a variant}} of sporangium, is an eye rhyme for orange, {{it is not a}} true rhyme as its second <b>syllable</b> is {{pronounced}} with an unreduced vowel , and often stressed.|$|E
