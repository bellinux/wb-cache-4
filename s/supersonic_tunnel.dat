50|$|The {{history of}} the {{laboratory}} goes back to 1922 when, on farmland purchased by the Belgian Government, the first building was erected to house the STAé (Service Technique de lAéronautique), i.e. the technical services of the Civil Aviation Authority then under the Ministry of Defence. The building was designed to accommodate a large low speed wind tunnel of the Eiffel type with an open return circuit and open-jet test section of 2 m diameter, as well as offices and shops. It still exists and has been refurbished internally after removal of the low speed tunnel {{to make room for}} modern turbomachinery and high speed facilities. A second building was added in 1935 to house offices and laboratories. It is now the Institutes administrative building. The last addition was made after the war, in 1949, with the construction of a large building specially designed to house a <b>supersonic</b> <b>tunnel</b> and a multi-configuration low speed facility.|$|E

Another way of achieving the huge power output is {{with the use of a}} vacuum storage tank. These tunnels are called indraft <b>supersonic</b> wind <b>tunnels,</b> and are seldom used because they are restricted to low Reynolds numbers.

40|$|Szcrnmavy. -The {{available}} {{theoretical and}} experimental information on condensation of water vapour in the supersonic flow of air is reviewed {{and the influence}} of condensation on operation of <b>supersonic</b> <b>tunnels</b> is considered. The mechanism of condensation in supersonic flow is of molecular nature and does not depend on the presence of solid condensation nuclei in the air. As estimated by Oswatitsch and confirmed by experimental results, the condensation in supersonic flow of air is primarily a function of the adiabatic supercooling A T,, to ad (defined in Fig. l), which determines the conditions at which the condensation shock occurs. For medium-sized <b>supersonic</b> <b>tunnels</b> (say I-ft square working section) the adiabatic supercooling is of the order of 50 deg C. For most test purposes it is essential to eliminate the detrimental effects of condensation, on flow distribution in the tunnel working section. The usual method is to use highly dried air, and the question of the required dryness is considered. Other methods, which do not rely on the dryness of air, are discussed. It is shown that by increasing stagnation temperature condensation can be avoided usually only at Mach numbers smaller than 1. 5. Alternatively, condensation can be eliminated from the tunnel nozzle by pre-expansion in an auxiliary nozzle, as verified experimentally.

50|$|A <b>supersonic</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> is a wind <b>tunnel</b> that {{produces}} <b>supersonic</b> speeds (1.2<M<5)The Mach number and flow {{are determined by}} the nozzle geometry. The Reynolds number is varied by changing the density level (pressure in the settling chamber). Therefore, a high pressure ratio is required (for a supersonic regime at M=4, this ratio is of the order of 10). Apart from that, condensation of moisture or even gas liquefaction can occur if the static temperature becomes cold enough.

40|$|Measurement {{of average}} skin-friction {{coefficients}} {{have been made}} on six rocket-powered free-flight models by using the boundary-layer rake technique. The model configuration was the NACA RM- 10, a 12. 2 -fineness-ratio parabolic body of revolution with a flat base. Measurements were made over a Mach number range from 1 to 3. 7, a Reynolds number range 40 x 10 (exp 6) to 170 x 10 (exp 6) based on length to the measurement station, and with aerodynamic heating conditions varying from strong skin heating to strong skin cooling. The measurements show the same trends over the test ranges as Van Driest's theory for turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate.
