5|$|New {{features}} included 128KB RAM, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an RS-232 <b>serial</b> <b>port,</b> an RGB monitor port, 32KB of ROM {{including an}} improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Interface 1 add-on module {{included}} 8KB of ROM, an RS-232 <b>serial</b> <b>port,</b> {{a proprietary}} LAN interface (called ZX Net), and an interface for {{the connection of}} up to eight ZX Microdrives– somewhat unreliable but speedy tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983. These were used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL, whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum's. Sinclair also released the ZX Interface 2 which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second <b>serial</b> <b>port,</b> which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
50|$|H.100 and H.110 are legacy {{telephony}} {{equipment standard}} {{published by the}} ECTF that allow the transport of up to 4096 simplex channels of voice or data on one connector or ribbon cable. H.100 is implemented using Multi-Channeled Buffered <b>Serial</b> <b>Ports</b> (McBSP), typically included as a DSP peripheral. McBSP, also known as TDM <b>Serial</b> <b>ports</b> are special <b>serial</b> <b>ports</b> that support multiple channels by using Time-division multiplexing (TDM).|$|R
50|$|Terminal Servers: Used {{to connect}} any device with <b>serial</b> <b>ports</b> over Ethernet {{for access to}} network server applications.

50|$|Versions of the Wordcraft dongle {{were later}} {{produced}} for Centronics parallel <b>ports,</b> 25 pin <b>serial</b> <b>ports</b> and 9 pin <b>serial</b> <b>ports.</b> Among the computers supported, {{before the arrival}} of the IBM PC, were Chuck Peddle's Sirius Systems Technology Victor 9000, the ACT Apricot Computers and the DEC Rainbow 100.|$|R
5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} <b>serial</b> <b>port,</b> {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E
5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or <b>serial</b> <b>port.</b> A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E

As a result, the A600 {{is compatible with}} many peripherals available for earlier Amiga models, such as MIDI, sound samplers and video-capture devices.|$|E
25|$|Often, meters {{designed}} for semi-automated reading have a <b>serial</b> <b>port</b> on that communicates by infrared LED through the faceplate of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, {{but in a}} wired bus using a serial current loop to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point.|$|E
25|$|SPI {{controllers}} {{from different}} vendors support different feature sets; such DMA queues are not uncommon, {{although they may}} be associated with separate DMA engines rather than the SPI controller itself, such as used by multichannel buffered <b>serial</b> <b>port</b> (MCBSP). Most SPI master controllers integrate support for up to four chip selects, although some require chip selects to be managed separately through GPIO lines.|$|E

25|$|A PC-based OBD {{analysis}} {{tool that}} converts the OBD-II signals to serial data (USB or <b>serial</b> <b>port)</b> standard to PCs or Macs. The software then decodes the received data to a visual display. Many popular interfaces {{are based on}} the ELM or STN11x0 OBD Interpreter ICs, both of which read all five generic OBD-II protocols. Some adapters now use the J2534 API allowing them to access OBD-II Protocols for both cars and trucks.|$|E
25|$|The Apple Pippin {{platform}} {{was based}} on the PowerPC Platform, a platform designed and supported by IBM and Apple. The PowerPC 603 processor is based on RISC design, thereby allowing peripherals to rely on the Pippin CPU. For example, instead of relying on a fully featured analog modem, the Pippin has a GeoPort <b>serial</b> <b>port.</b> Various dialup Internet service providers (ISP)—including Prodigy, America On-Line, and eWorld—were supported by the Pippin platform, as well as generic ISPs.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{infrared}} {{remote controls}} {{can be used}} to control PC applications. Any application that supports shortcut keys can be controlled via IR remote controls from other home devices (TV, VCR, AC). This is widely used with multimedia applications for PC based home theatre systems. For this to work, one needs a device that decodes IR remote control data signals and a PC application that communicates to this device connected to PC. Connection can be made via <b>serial</b> <b>port,</b> USB port or motherboard IrDA connector. Such devices are commercially available but can be homemade using low-cost micro controllers. LIRC (Linux IR Remote control) and WinLIRC (for Windows) are software packages developed for the purpose of controlling PC using TV remote and can be also used for homebrew remote with lesser modification.|$|E

50|$|It has up to nine IO lines, two <b>serial</b> <b>ports,</b> and phone/audio connectors.|$|R
25|$|When a key of the {{teleprinter}} keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 data bits, finishing with a stop bit (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer <b>serial</b> <b>port</b> peripherals.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{required}} because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use {{different types of}} UART chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's <b>serial</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a <b>serial</b> <b>port,</b> USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E

25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The <b>Serial</b> <b>Port</b> is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{trend in}} modern shortwave listening {{is the use}} of [...] "PC radios", or radios that are designed to be controlled by a standard personal computer. These radios as the name suggests are controlled by specialized PC software using a <b>serial</b> <b>port</b> connected to the radio. A PC radio may not have a front-panel at all, and may be designed exclusively for computer control, which reduces cost. In pure software defined radios, all filtering, modulation and signal manipulation is done in software, usually by a PC soundcard or by a dedicated piece of DSP hardware.|$|E
500|$|The PSP-2000 (also {{known as}} the Slim & Lite in PAL territories) {{was the first major}} {{hardware}} revision of the PlayStation Portable, released in September [...] The 2000 series was 33% lighter and 19% slimmer than the original PlayStation Portable. The capacity of the battery was also reduced by ⅓ but the run time remained the same as the previous model due to lower power consumption. Older model batteries will still work and they extend the amount of playing time. The PSP Slim & Lite has a new gloss finish. Its <b>serial</b> <b>port</b> was also modified in order to accommodate a new video-out feature (while rendering older PSP remote controls incompatible). On a PSP-2000, PSP games will only output to external monitors or TVs in progressive scan mode, so that televisions incapable of supporting progressive scan will not display PSP games; non-game video will output in either progressive or interlaced mode. USB charging was also made possible. Buttons are also reportedly more responsive on the PSP-2000. In , Sony released a second hardware revision called the PSP-3000 which included several features that were not present in the PSP-2000, such as a built-in microphone and upgraded screen, as well as the ability to output PSP games in interlaced mode.|$|E
