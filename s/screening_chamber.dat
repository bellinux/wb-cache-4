40|$|In the {{development}} of high- throughput phenotyping platforms for non-invasive measurements of plants {{we have to consider}} the experimental designs because complete homogeneity of the factors like temperature, light, water and airflow is usually neither in greenhouse nor in climate chamber phenotyping systems the case (Brien et al. 2013). Furthermore, an optimal experimental design is especially relevant in a heterogeneous field environment. The limiting factors like time and space have {{to be taken into account}} for every system. Thus, to optimize reproducible data and to use the facilities to full capacity it is necessary to use a specialized and adjusted experimental design for different experimental setups. Therefore, the minimizations of the variability of space and time as well as the number of replicates which are necessary for each trait have to be considered. Furthermore, the error and environmental effects have to be minimized and monitored. The use of multiple genotypes in high throughput phenotyping can be at the cost of replication which is especially relevant in a heterogeneous field environment. A resampling strategy, with 10, 000 replicates and sample or block sizes ranged between 2 and 30, was used to determine the optimal number of measured plants and blocks (replicates) in a field experiment. The results indicated that based on the examined destructive shoot traits about 5 blocks (replicates) and 10 - 15 plants would be required for this field experiment. In addition, 13 frequently used experimental designs, including complete randomized design (CRD), complete/incomplete block designs, was implemented in the automated <b>screen</b> <b>chambers</b> of the IBG- 2 with the 80 genotypes from Arabidopsis 1001 genome project. The results indicated that even in the <b>screen</b> <b>chamber</b> the environment cannot be considered as homogeneous and have to be taken into account by the experimental design to increase the statistical power in future experiments. To improve this, randomized complete block design (RCBD) can efficiently reduce the experimental error and increase the statistical power. Furthermore, in a case where a few genotypes were tested, the Latin-Square design (LSD) could well control the row and column variation and reduce the experimental error. In a case where a large amount of genotypes were tested, the augmented design with controls within each row will also improve this situation. Furthermore, there is significant interaction between the treatments (for example drought stress) and the position where the trays located and whether the trays were randomly moved or not. Moreover, the analysis for time-serials data from the high throughput phenotyping helps to monitor the plant growth and detect significant changes during the growth...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of ChemistryChristopher T. CulbertsonThe {{study of}} aphid salivary secretome has {{practical}} importance on understanding interactions of aphids and their host plants. Around 250 species of aphids {{out of the}} identified 4000 aphid species are considered as serious pests. The experiments were performed with pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) that were feeding on bean plants (Vivia fabe). Pea aphids feed on plant phloem sap by probing their stylet into the sieve elements of the plant and secreting saliva for external digestion. In order to collect aphid salivary proteins from the secreted saliva, small scale and large scale sample collection methods were carried out. The small scale sample method was performed in microfluidic devices using 10 - 25 aphids. Aphids were able to feed on the artificial diet by probing through a stretched ParafilmTM and survived for 2 - 3 days in the microfluidic devices. The experiments proved that the aphid survival and feeding rate could be improved with the factors such as ventilation, light intensity and increasing diet volume. However {{it was difficult to}} collect sufficient amounts of aphid saliva for detection using small scale devices. The large scale sample collection method was performed by feeding 8000 aphids in large <b>screened</b> <b>chamber</b> for 24 / 48 h.

40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) {{is one of}} {{the main}} neuromodulators in the {{mammalian}} central nervous system (CNS). This chemical messenger has been implicated in the underlying physiology of many distinct cognitive functions. However, the exact role that ACh plays in regulating information processing in the brain is still not fully understood. The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is required for the storage of ACh into synaptic vesicles, and therefore it presents a means to modulate release. Diminished VAChT levels cause a decrease in cholinergic tone, whereas increased VAChT expression has been shown to augment ACh release. Previously published data have shown that elimination of VAChT in the basal forebrain in genetically-modified mice impairs learning and memory. For our studies we have used different mouse lines in which the expression of the VAChT gene is changed, both increased and decreased. We are therefore able to study the consequences of altered cholinergic tone in vivo. Our hypothesis is that changes in cholinergic tone produce specific molecular signatures in target brain areas that underlie alterations in cognitive function. Our studies aimed to elucidate the behavioural and molecular consequences of cholinergic dysfunction. Behavioral testing included classical learning and memory tests as well as sophisticated tasks using novel touch <b>screens</b> <b>chambers</b> to measure attention, learning and memory as well as cognitive flexibility. At the molecular level, the goal was to examine how long-term changes in cholinergic tone impact mechanisms regulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal health. Finally, by aging mouse models of cholinergic dysfunction we were able to elucidate the role that cholinergic tone plays in the classical pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, by establishing the molecular signature of increased and decreased cholinergic tone in targeted brain regions (cortex and hippocampus) it may become possible to find novel targets for therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive deficits due to altered cholinergic tone...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{phenotyping}} includes {{monitoring of}} rather complex plant processes which {{are linked to}} environmental factors. As complete homogeneity of the factors like temperature, light, water and airflow is usually impossible, it is of importance to optimize experiment design to exclude {{the impact of these}} compound factors. Furthermore, an optimization of cost, throughput and reliability of the data for high-throughput (HTP) phenotyping depends largely on the experimental design. To do this, an existing R package “agricolae” in statistical software R (de Mendiburu, 2009) was modified to generate 13 frequently used experimental designs (completely randomized design, randomized complete block design, Latin squared design, split-plot design, Graece-Latin design, augmented design, Youden design, Balance incomplete design, cyclic design, lattice design, alpha design, strip-plot design, and factorial design). The modified R package has been applied in generating different experimental designs for our common experiment with maize, barley, rapeseed, wheat, and sugar beet in the field and Arabidopsis 1001 genome phenotyping experiment in the <b>screen</b> <b>chamber</b> in 2015. A semi-automated pipeline for statistical analysis with these experimental designs and the data from high-throughput phenotyping experiments has been developed. The statistical functions include: descriptive statistics, frequency and correlation analysis, imputation of missing data with consideration of distribution of the sample data, detection of outlier data, determination of optimal replicates, verifying the assumptions of the linear model, data transformation, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate statistical models, interaction of different factors, multiple comparisons with different methods, time-serials or repeated measured data analysis, and so on. Graphic user interfaces (GUI) are under development for all statistical analysis procedures so that non-experienced R users can easily automate the selection of a suitable experimental design and the data analysis afterwards by using a step-by-step selection workflow as well as make it possible to monitor and analyze these experiments even during the run.

40|$|Stormwater run-off from {{industrial}} sources can impact the receiving environment by {{the discharge of}} toxic substances, nutrients, sediments or fresh water (in marine environments). The Port of Tauranga is New Zealand’s largest by cargo volume with untreated logs {{being one of the}} major exports. The port stores logs totalling up to 300, 000 m 3 with an average residency time of 18 days. Runoff from log storage areas can cause toxicity to aquatic life due to low pH, high organic solids content and associated BOD, and chemicals leached from timber such as resin acids. Metals and PAH’s from heavy vehicles and other machinery can also be present. At the port, stormwater collects from the storage areas into slot drains and is screened for larger particulates in <b>screening</b> <b>chambers</b> before discharging into Tauranga Harbour. Large rainfall events produce a visible, highly coloured plume extending across the main harbour channel. This study looks at compounds within the stormwater runoff and associated marine water samples and the toxicology of the effluent. It then focusses on the gradients of compounds found in sediments and biota in relation to the main discharge sources. This is followed with a more specific investigation of the bioaccumulation of resin acids in resident and transplanted mussels. It concludes with a comparison of low intertidal species assemblages within and outside the influence of the stormwater plume. Findings indicate that there are high levels of wood derived chemicals in the stormwater runoff and a gradient of quantities of these can be detected in nearby sediments, decreasing with distance from the discharge point of the effluent. Those compounds, such as metals, able to be quantified against national and international guidelines were well within acceptable levels. Others, such as resin acids, were found in lower quantities than in a previous study. A correlation between organics related to leachate from the logs, inorganic compounds found in the effluent and sediment grain size, indicates that some elements of the runoff may reach further into the harbour. The influence of dredging and disturbance of the seabed by shipping movements is considered in relation to this. Levels of organic compounds, related to the log storage in transplanted mussel populations, were not detected spatially or temporally and no evidence of bio-accumulation of resin acids was found. Based on the combined findings there are very low detectable effects on the marine environment from the runoff of the Port of Tauranga log storage areas. These {{come in the form of}} a gradient in chemical compounds related to the runoff and are well within the ANZECC (2000) Interim Guideline Levels.

The films {{formed on}} the {{internal}} surface of the T- 10 tokamak vacuum chamber and on the stainless steel mirror-specimens located inside the T- 10 tokamak upper port during 2002 and 2003 experimental campaigns have been studied using X-ray diffraction analysis, Rutherford backscattering, scanning electron microscopy and elastic recoil detection method. Before the 2003 experimental campaign the graphite ring diaphragm {{was removed from the}} tokamak and a new movable limiter made of RGT- 91 graphite was installed. Mirror surfaces could be <b>screened</b> during <b>chamber</b> conditioning and exposed to plasma only during working discharges. The films formed on the chamber walls in both campaigns were “soft”, reddish-brown and had a multilayer structure. Few hundreds of thin (< 100 nm) layers were detected in cross sections of such films. X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that these films have amorphous structure and contain up to 10 % C- 60 (fullerens) with lattice constant of 12, 086 - 14, 055. D/C atomic ratio in the films increased from 0. 66 in 2002 to 1. 7 in 2003. The “soft ” film formation was caused by the plasma–wall interaction during the vacuum chamber conditioning. The films on mirrors were thinner than those on the vacuum chamber walls and, as a rule, semitransparent. They consisted of 10 - 12 layers formed during a campaign. Layer thickness depended on the total film thickness (on the exposition site). The surface structure of these films was homogeneous and smooth, without any signs of physical sputtering.

40|$|Defining a {{link between}} wind-tunnel {{settling}} <b>chamber</b> <b>screens,</b> flow quality and test section boundary-layer spanwise variation is necessary for accurate transition prediction. The aim of this work is to begin establishing this link. The computed, steady, laminar wake of a zither (screen model) with imperfect wire spacing is tracked through a contraction and into a model test section. The contraction converts the zither wake into streamwise vorticity which then creates spanwise variation (streaks) in the test-section boundary layer. The magnitude of the spanwise variation is sensitive to the zither open-area ratio and imperfections, but the observed wavelength is relatively insensitive to the zither wire spacing. Increased spanwise variation is attributed to large wavelength variation of drag across the zither, and not the coalescence of jets phenomena. The linear stability of the streaks is predicted using the parabolized stability equations with the eN method.

In this study, several basic features of a low subsonic wind tunnel, i. e. a centrifugal blower with 3 -phase inverter, a settling <b>chamber,</b> <b>screens</b> and a contraction cone, are designed and developed for a turning diffuser application {{in order to improve}} the flow quality. The flow profiles are examined using Pitot static probe at five measurement points within the range of inflow Reynolds number, Rein= 5. 786 E+ 04 - 1. 775 E+ 05. The steady, uniform and fully developed turbulent flow profiles with an average deviation with theory of about 3. 5 % are obtained. This proves that a good flow quality could be produced by means of incorporating some basic features of a low subsonic wind tunnel to the system...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} use of super-resolution {{algorithms}} for precision localisation and long-term tracking of small subjects, like rodents. An overview is given {{of a variety of}} techniques for positioning in use today, namely received signal strength, time of arrival, time difference of arrival and direction of arrival (DoA). Based on the analysis, it is concluded that the direction finding signal subspace based techniques are most appropriate for the purposes of our system. The details of the software defined radio (SDR) antenna array testbed development, build, characterisation and performance evaluation are presented. The results of direction finding experiments in the <b>screened</b> anechoic <b>chamber</b> emulating open-space propagation are discussed. It is shown that such testbed is capable of locating sources {{in the vicinity of the}} array with high precision. It can estimate the DoAs of more simultaneously working transmitters than antennas in the array, by employing spread spectrum techniques, and readily accommodates very low power sources. Overall constraints on the system are such that the operational range must be around 50 – 100 m. The transmitter must be small both volumetrically and in terms of weight. It also has to be operational over an extended period of around 1 year. The implications of these are that very small antennas and batteries must be used, which are usually accompanied by very low transmission efficiencies and tiny capacities, respectively. Based on the above, {{the use of}} ultra-low power oscillator transmitters, as first cut prototypes of the tag, is proposed. It is shown that the Clapp, Colpitts, Pierce and Cross-coupled architectures are adequate. A thorough analysis of these topologies is provided with full details of tag and antenna co-design. Finally the performance of these architectures is evaluated through simulations with respect to power output, overall efficiency and phase noise. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Ascochyta blight (AB) {{caused by}} Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labr. and Botrytis grey mould (BGM) caused by Botrytis cinerea (Pers. ex Fr.) are {{important}} {{diseases of the}} aerial plant parts of chickpea in most chickpea growing areas of the world. Although conventional approaches have contributed to reducing disease, the use of new technologies is expected to further reduce losses through these biotic stresses. Reliable screening techniques were developed: ‘field screening technique’ for adult plant <b>screening,</b> ‘cloth <b>chamber</b> technique’ and ‘growth chamber technique’ {{for the study of}} races of the pathogen and for segregating generations. Furthermore, the ‘cut twig technique’ for interspecific population for AB and BGM resistance was developed. For introgression of high levels of AB and BGM resistance in cultivated chickpea from wild relatives, accessions of seven annual wild Cicer spp. were evaluated and identified: C. judaicum accessions 185, ILWC 95 and ILWC 61, C. pinnatifidum accessions 188, 199 and ILWC 212 as potential donors. C. pinnatifidum accession 188 was crossed with ICCV 96030 and 62 F 9 lines resistant to AB and BGM were derived. Of the derived lines, several are being evaluated for agronomic traits and yield parameters while four lines, GL 29029, GL 29206, GL 29212, GL 29081 possessing high degree of resistance were crossed with susceptible high yielding cultivars BG 256 to improve resistance and to undertake molecular studies. Genotyping of F 2 populations with SSR markers from the chickpea genome was done to identify markers potentially linked with AB and BGM resistance genes. In preliminary studies, of 120 SSR markers used, six (Ta 2, Ta 110, Ta 139, CaSTMS 7, CaSTMS 24 and Tr 29) were identified with polymorphic bands between resistant derivative lines and the susceptible parent. The study shows that wild species of Cicer are the valuable gene pools of resistance to AB and BGM. The resistant derivative lines generated here can serve as good pre-breeding material and markers identified can assist in marker assisted selection for resistance breeding...|$|R
40|$|Invasion {{through the}} {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{is important for}} wound healing, immunological responses and metastasis. We established an invasion-based cell motility <b>screen</b> using Boyden <b>chambers</b> overlaid with Matrigel to select for proinvasive genes. By this method we identified antisense to MARCKS related protein (MRP), whose family member MARCKS is a target of miR- 21, a microRNA involved in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in multiple human cancers. We confirmed that targeted knockdown of MRP, in both EpRas mammary epithelial cells and PC 3 prostate cancer cells, promoted in vitro cell migration that was blocked by trifluoperazine. Additionally, we observed increased immunofluoresence of E-cadherin, b-catenin and APC at sites of cell-cell contact in EpRas cells with MRP knockdown suggesting formation of adherens junctions. By wound healing assay we observed that reduced MRP supported collective cell migration, a type of cell movement where adherens junctions are maintained. However, destabilized adherens junctions, like those seen in EpRas cells, are frequently important for oncogenic signaling. Consequently, knockdown of MRP in EpRas caused loss of tumorigenesis in vivo, and reduced Wnt 3 a induced TCF reporter signaling in vitro. Together our data suggest that reducing MRP expression promotes formation of adherens junctions in EpRas cells, allowing collective cell migration, but interfere...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of prenatal screening {{for the detection of}} congenital heart disease (CHD) was assessed by prospective analysis of 428 consecutive infant admissions to a supraregional centre; 28 (6. 5 %) did not have CHD and were excluded from analysis. Of the 400 cases with CDH, 396 (99 %) underwent fetal ultrasonography but scanning was performed only before 18 weeks' gestation in 200 (50 %). One hundred and forty nine (37 %) of all cardiac abnormalities and 149 / 283 (53 %) of severe abnormalities were considered to be detectable prenatally in a <b>screening</b> echocardiographic four <b>chamber</b> view had this technique been used. Prenatal diagnosis of severe CHD actually occurred in only eight (2 %) cases and was after 30 weeks' gestation in all. There were 181 / 347 (52 %) of all mothers and 177 / 253 (70 %) of the subgroup with severe abnormalities who expressed an opinion volunteered their preference for termination of pregnancy if mid-trimester diagnosis had been available. Mid-trimester detection of congenital heart disease rarely occurs at present despite fetal ultrasound scanning in almost all pregnancies. More than half of all severe congenital heart defects seen in infancy are potentially detectable by screening. Major training at primary scan level and modification of the timing of existing fetal anomaly scanning would be required for a screening programme to be effective...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} a practical application observed at {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) manufacturing facility. After assembly, the PCBs (or jobs) are tested in environmental stress <b>screening</b> (ESS) <b>chambers</b> (or batch processing machines) to detect early failures. Several PCBs can be simultaneously tested as long as the total size of all the PCBs in the batch does not violate the chamber capacity. PCBs from different production lines arrive dynamically to a queue in front of a set of identical ESS chambers, where they are grouped into batches for testing. Each line delivers PCBs that vary in size and require different testing (or processing) times. Once a batch is formed, its processing time is the longest processing time among the PCBs in the batch, and its ready time is given by the PCB arriving last to the batch. ESS chambers are expensive and a bottleneck. Consequently, its makespan has to be minimized. ^ A mixed-integer formulation is proposed for the problem under study and compared to a formulation recently published. The proposed formulation is better {{in terms of the number}} of decision variables, linear constraints and run time. A procedure to compute the lower bound is proposed. For sparse problems (i. e. when job ready times are dispersed widely), the lower bounds are close to optimum. ^ The problem under study is NP-hard. Consequently, five heuristics, two metaheuristics (i. e. simulated annealing (SA) and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP)), and a decomposition approach (i. e. column generation) are proposed—especially to solve problem instances which require prohibitively long run times when a commercial solver is used. Extensive experimental study was conducted to evaluate the different solution approaches based on the solution quality and run time. ^ The decomposition approach improved the lower bounds (or linear relaxation solution) of the mixed-integer formulation. At least one of the proposed heuristic outperforms the Modified Delay heuristic from the literature. For sparse problems, almost all the heuristics report a solution close to optimum. GRASP outperforms SA at a higher computational cost. The proposed approaches are viable to implement as the run time is very short. ...|$|R
