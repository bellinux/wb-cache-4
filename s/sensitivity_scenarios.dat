A total of twelve <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> which can be grouped into four thematic categories were performed. These four categories consist of simulations with different chemical mechanisms, different assumptions concerning the deposition characteristics of intermediate products, assumptions concerning the nitrates from the oxidation of isoprene and variations of the source strengths. The largest differences in ozone compared to the reference simulation occured when a different isoprene oxidation scheme was used (up to 30 – 60 % or about 10 nmol/mol). The largest differences in the abundance of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) were found when the isoprene emission strength was reduce...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of the ocean’s meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to increased greenhouse gas forcing is examined using a coupled model of intermediate complexity, including a dynamic 3 D ocean subcomponent. Parameters are the increase in CO 2 forcing (with stabilization after a specified time interval) and the model’s climate sensitivity. In this model, the cessation of deep sinking in the north “Atlantic” (hereinafter, a “collapse”), as indicated by changes in the MOC, behaves like a simple bifurcation. The final surface air temperature (SAT) change, which is closely predicted by {{the product of the}} radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity, determines whether a collapse occurs. The initial transient response in SAT is largely a function of the forcing increase, with higher sensitivity runs exhibiting delayed behavior; accordingly, high CO 2 -low <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> can be assessed as a recovering or collapsing circulation shortly after stabilization, whereas low CO 2 -high <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> require several hundred additional years to make such a determination. We also systemically examine how the rate of forcing, for a given CO 2 stabilization, affects the ocean response. In contrast with previous studies based on results using simpler ocean models, we find that except for a narrow range of marginally stable to marginally unstable scenarios, the forcing rate has little impact on whether the run collapses or recovers. In this narrow range, however, forcing increases on a time scale of slow ocean advective processes results in weaker declines in overturning strength and can permit a run to recover that would otherwise collapse.

This study compared ten life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of disposable cups with the aim to evaluate the robustness of their results. The selected studies have only one impact category in common, namely climate change with global warming potential (GWP) as its category indicator. Quantitative GWP results of the studies were closer examined. GWPs within and across each study show none of the cup materials to be consistently better than the others. Comparison of the absolute GWPs (after correction for the cup volume) also shows no consistent better or worse cup material. An evaluation of the methodological choices and the data sets used in the studies revealed their influence on the GWP. The differences in GWP can be attributed to a multitude of factors, i. e., cup material and weight, production processes, waste processes, allocation options, and data used. These factors basically represent different types of uncertainty. <b>Sensitivity</b> and <b>scenario</b> analyses provided only the influence of one factor at once.

It is not currently known what chemical composition such a battery would have nor what the production processes involved would be. The same lithium–manganese composition as used in the base case will, therefore, be assumed.

The battery would only need to have a capacity of 2.06  GWh (instead of 9.6  GWh) in this scenario. The example installation in Schwerin only needs to be scaled up by 413, rather than 2133. It has to be stated though that in this case, the maximum power available from the battery store in case of grid emergencies would be significantly lower than in the base case. In this way, the scenario is to be seen as representative for unknown future developments in battery technology.|$|R

40|$|Any {{attempt to}} {{introduce}} more ecological realism into ecological risk assessment of chemicals faces the major challenge of integrating {{different aspects of}} the chemicals and species of concern, for example, spatial scales of emissions, chemical exposure patterns in space and time, and population dynamics and dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes. Although these aspects are not considered in current risk assessment schemes, risk assessors and managers are expressing increasing interest in learning more about both the exposure to and the effects of chemicals at landscape level. In this study, we combined the CASCADE-TOXSWA fate model, which predicts the fate of pesticides in an interconnected system of water bodies with variable hydrological characteristics, with the MASTEP mechanistic effect model, which simulates population dynamics and effects of pesticides on aquatic species at the scale of individual water bodies. To this end, we extrapolated MASTEP to the scale of realistic landscapes and linked it to dynamic exposure patterns. We explored the effects of an insecticide on the water louse Asellus aquaticus for a typical Dutch landscape covering an area of about 10 km 2 containing 137 water bodies (drainage ditches) with a total length of about 65 km and different degrees of connectivity. Pesticide treatments used in potato crop were assumed to result in a spray-drift input of 5 % (non-mitigated) and 1 % (mitigated) of the amount of pesticide applied into parts of the water body network. These treatments resulted in highly variable exposure patterns both in space and time. The effects of the pesticide on the species were investigated by comparing two scenarios with low and high individual-level sensitivity. We found that downstream transport of the pesticide led to exposure of water bodies that did not receive direct spray-drift input, even though this particular pesticide was assumed to dissipate rapidly from water. The observed differences in population-level effects and recovery patterns ranged from no observable effects in the low spray-drift and low <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenario</b> to severe reduction of abundances in the high spray-drift and high <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenario.</b> These results illustrate the sensitivity of our modelling approach, but also show the need for precise calculations of pesticide inputs and model parameterisation. Our study demonstrates the potential of coupled fate-and-effect to explore realistic scenarios at the scale of heterogeneous landscapes. Such scenarios could include the application of multiple pesticides to one or more crop types. Spatial realism of the landscape represented in the model ensures realistic consideration of population growth and dispersal as the two main recovery mechanisms. Future options for the landscape-scale fate-and-effect simulation approach include exploring the effects of mitigation measures on the risk estimates at landscape scale and hence represent a step towards risk management...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{models can}} be {{valuable}} to investigate potential {{effects of climate}} change on greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. DNDC (the DeNitrification-DeComposition model) was tested against observed soil respiration data from adjacent pasture and arable fields in the Irish midlands. The arable field was converted from grassland approximately 50 years ago and managed since 2003 under two different tillage systems; conventional and reduced tillage. Both fields were located on the same soil type, classified as a free draining sandy loam soil derived from fluvial glacial gravels with low soil moisture holding capacity. Soil respiration measurements were made from January 2003 to August 2005. Three climate scenarios were investigated, a baseline of measured climatic data from a weather station at the field site, and high and low temperature <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> predicted by the Community Climate Change Consortium for Ireland (C 4 I) based on the Hadley Centre Global Climate Model (HadCM 3) and the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A 1 B emission scenario. The aims of this study were to use measured soil respiration rates to validate the DNDC model for estimating CO 2 efflux from these key Irish soils, investigate the effects of future climate change on CO 2 efflux and estimate the efflux uncertainties due to using different future climate projections. The results indicate that the DNDC model can reliably estimate soil respiration from the two fields examined. The model underestimated annual measured CO 2 efflux from the pasture by only 13 % (model efficiency: ME = 0. 6; root mean square error: RMSE = 1. 9 and mean absolute error: MAE = 6. 3) and that from the arable conventional and reduced tillage by 9 % (ME = 0. 6; RMSE = 1. 6 and MAE = 2. 4) and 8 % (ME = 0. 23; RMSE = 1. 8 and MAE = 2. 9), respectively. Short-term land use change had no significant effects on CO 2 effluxes from soil. Using the high temperature sensitive scenario, future C effluxes would increase by 15 % for the pasture and 14 and 16 % for the arable conventional and reduced tillage systems, respectively. However, under the low temperature sensitive scenario, lower increases in the C efflux of 6 % for the pasture and 5 % for the arable field were predicted. The calculated annual CO 2 efflux uncertainties for using the high and low temperature <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> were 9 % for the pasture and 8 % for the arable field...|$|E

Previous simulation studies of CO 2 injection into the Captain Sandstone aquifer suggest storage capacities in the range 358 to 2495 Mt over a range of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Storage at this scale will introduce the risk of fault reactivation {{as a consequence of}} elevated reservoir pressures. The transmissibility of previously stable faults may be enhanced due to reactivation, increasing the risk of CO 2 migration from the storage reservoir. By studying both the geometry of faults and the contemporary stress field affecting the basin, it is possible to resolve the shear and normal stresses acting on faults which cut the reservoir formation and extend into the overburden towards the seabed, and to determine which faults (or parts of faults) are most susceptible to becoming reactivated under elevated pressure conditions. In order to do so, detailed knowledge of the pore pressure conditions at depth and the magnitude and orientations of the principal stresses are required, as are the properties of the faults themselves. Such an analysis is presented here at the basin-scale, focusing on the Captain Sandstone of the Inner Moray Firth Basin. ...|$|E

This study aims to identify key cost drivers and derive quantitative estimates of Hong Kong's LTC expenditure to 2036. Methods We parameterised a macro actuarial simulation with data from official demographic projections, Thematic Household Survey 2004, Hong Kong's Domestic Health Accounts and other routine data from relevant government departments, Hospital Authority and other LTC service providers. Base case results were tested against a wide range of sensitivity assumptions. Results Total projected LTC expenditure as a proportion of GDP reflected secular trends in the elderly dependency ratio, showing a shallow dip between 2004 and 2011, but thereafter yielding a monotonic rise to reach 3. 0 % by 2036. Demographic changes would have a larger impact than changes in unit costs on overall spending. Different <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> resulted {{in a wide range of}} spending estimates from 2. 2 % to 4. 9 % of GDP.

We developed a single country Computable General Equilibrium model to estimate {{the economic impact of}} pandemic influenza (PI) and associated policies. While the context for this development was the United Kingdom, there are lessons to be drawn for application of this methodology, as well as indicative results, to other contexts. Disease scenarios were constructed from an epidemiological model which estimated case fatality rates (mild, moderate and severe) as 0. 06 %, 0. 18 % and 0. 35 %. A clinical attack rate of 35 % was also used to produce influenza scenarios, together with preparedness policies, including antivirals and school closure, and the possible prophylactic absence of workers. UK cost estimates (in Sterling) are presented, together with relative percentage impacts applicable to similar large economies. Percentage/cost estimates suggest PI would reduce GDP by 0. 3 % (Â£ 3. 5 bn), 0. 4 % (Â£ 5 bn) and 0. 6 % (Â£ 7. 4 bn) respectively for the three disease scenarios. However, the impact of PI itself is smaller than disease mitigation policies: combining school closure with prophylactic absenteeism yields percentage/cost effects of 1. 1 % (Â£ 14. 7 bn), 1. 3 % (Â£ 16. 3 bn) and 1. 4 % (Â£ 18. 5 bn) respectively for the three <b>scenarios.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis shows little variability with changes in disease parameters but notable changes with variations in school closure and prophylactic absenteeism. The most severe <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenario</b> results in a 2. 9 % (Â£ 37. 4 bn), 3. 2 % (Â£ 41. 4 bn) and 3. 7 % (Â£ 47. 5 bn) loss to GDP respectively for the three scenarios.

40|$|Specific methodologies that {{consider}} a more comprehensive/diverse {{set of parameters}} must be explored by the LCA community. This study utilises the Group Model-Building (GMB) method to identify, and Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) technique to make explicit, variables which are not typically considered in LCA studies, but may have significant influence upon environmental impacts through cause-effect links and feedback loops in product systems. A literature review on LCAs concerning household washing machines and conventional passenger cars product systems is performed to investigate what are the commonly used functional unit, life cycle stages and system boundaries. Two parallel GMB sessions were organised to elicit relevant variables and relations in the product systems and build in a first version of CLDs. Individual interviews with the participants were undertaken to refine and validate the system models. Final versions of the system models were built. GMB and CLD {{can serve as a}} basis for (i) delimitating appropriated system boundaries for LCA and (ii) identifying variables/areas to be included in <b>sensitivity</b> and <b>scenario</b> analysis. <b>Sensitivity</b> and <b>scenario</b> analysis examine the influence that those variables/areas have on the environmental impacts of the product and describe both different contexts and profiles of users. GMB and CLD have the potential to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative variables, for more robust understanding of the causes and mechanisms of environmental impacts and improving conclusions and recommendations in LCA.

40|$|Simulation {{models are}} one of the {{approaches}} used to investigate greenhouse gas emissions and potential effects of global warming on terrestrial ecosystems. DayCent which is the daily time-step version of the CENTURY biogeochemical model, and DNDC (the DeNitrification-DeComposition model) were tested against observed nitrous oxide flux data from a field experiment on cut and extensively grazed pasture located at the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre, Co. Carlow, Ireland. The soil was classified as a free draining sandy clay loam soil with a pH of 7. 3 and a mean organic carbon and nitrogen content at 0 - 20 cm of 38 and 4. 4 g kg? 1 dry soil, respectively. The aims of this study were to validate DayCent and DNDC models for estimating N 2 O emissions from fertilized humid pasture, and to investigate the impacts of future climate change on N 2 O fluxes and biomass production. Measurements of N 2 O flux were carried out from November 2003 to November 2004 using static chambers. Three climate scenarios, a baseline of measured climatic data from the weather station at Carlow, and high and low temperature <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> predicted by the Community Climate Change Consortium For Ireland (C 4 I) based on the Hadley Centre Global Climate Model (HadCM 3) and the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A 1 B emission scenario were investigated.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{mitigation}} and adaptation on coastal flood impacts. We focus on a scenario that stabilizes concentrations at 450 ppm-CO 2 -eq leading to 42 cm of global mean sea-level rise in 1995 – 2100 (GMSLR) and an unmitigated one leading to 63 cm of GMSLR. We also consider <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> reflecting increased tropical cyclone activity and a GMSLR of 126 cm. The only adaptation considered is upgrading and maintaining dikes. Under the unmitigated scenario and without adaptation, {{the number of people}} flooded reaches 168 million per year in 2100. Mitigation reduces this number by factor 1. 4, adaptation by factor 461 and both options together by factor 540. The global annual flood cost (including dike upgrade cost, maintenance cost and residual damage cost) reaches US$ 210 billion per year in 2100 under the unmitigated scenario without adaptation. Mitigation reduces this number by factor 1. 3, adaptation by factor 5. 2 and both options together by factor 7. 8. When assuming adaptation, the global annual flood cost relative to GDP falls throughout the century from about 0. 06 % to 0. 01 – 0. 03 % under all scenarios including the sensitivity ones. From this perspective, adaptation to coastal flood impacts is meaningful to be widely applied irrespective of the level of mitigation. From the perspective of a some less-wealthy and small island countries, however, annual flood cost can amount to several percent of national GDP and mitigation can lower these costs significantly. We conclude that adaptation and mitigation are complimentary policies in coastal area...|$|E
40|$|This thesis determines a {{cost-efficient}} {{expansion of}} electricity generated by {{renewable energy sources}} (RES-E) in the European power generation system. It is an integrated modelling approach with a particular emphasis on diurnal and seasonal patterns of renewable energy sources (RES). An integrated modelling approach optimizes the overall European electricity system while comprising fossil, nuclear, and renewable generation as well as storage capacities. The integrated model approach corresponds to {{a situation in which}} renewable generation is subject to electricity price signals. In <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenarios</b> cases of the integrated model approach are compared to situations in which renewable generation is granted priority feed-in and is decoupled from electricity price signals. In addition, the role of different flexibility options, which can be provided by storage capacities and grid expansion are scrutinized. The methodology of the thesis consists of two parts. First, it develops an integrative model approach by extending an existing European electricity model only comprising conventional power generating technologies. Second, an appropriate representation of intermittent RES for electricity market models is established by the determination of corresponding typedays. The typeday modelling takes the spatial correlation of RES and the correlation between wind and solar power into account. Moreover, the typeday modelling captures average dispatch-relevant, diurnal and seasonal RES characteristics such as the level, the variance, and the gradient. The scenario analysis shows that separate developments of renewable and conventional technologies imply several inefficiencies. These increase with higher RES-E penetration. Inefficiencies such as an increased wind power curtailment, an augmented capital turnover, or a higher cumulative installed power generating capacity are revealed and quantified. ...|$|E

40|$|Wetlands are {{sustaining}} large {{communities of}} people in Rwanda where 10 % of its land surface consists of many local wetlands. Sustainable future management of these numerous wetlands requires a reliable inventory of their location and a dynamic quantitative characterization that allows assessment of their climate change sensitivity. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the importance of climatic factors for determining wetland location at different regional scales. Wetland locations were analyzed and statistically modeled using their location factors with logistic regression. Wetland location probability was determined using topographic (elevation, slope), hydrological (contributing area) and climatic (temperature and rainfall) location factors. A wetland location probability map was made that demonstrated a calibration accuracy of 87. 9 % correct at national level compared to an existing inventory, displaying even better fits at subnational level (reaching up to 98 % correct). A validation accuracy of 86. 2 % was obtained using an independently collected dataset. A sensitivity analysis was applied to the threshold values used as cutoff value between wetland/non-wetland, demonstrating a robust performance. The developed models were used in a <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scenario</b> analysis to assess future wetland location probability to changes in temperature and rainfall. In particular, wetlands in the central regions of Rwanda demonstrate a high sensitivity to changes in temperature (1 % increase causes a net probable wetland area decline by 12. 4 %) and rainfall (+ 1 % causes a net increase by 1. 6 %). This potentially significant impact on wetland number and location probability indicates that climate-sensitive future planning of wetland use is required in Rwanda...|$|R
