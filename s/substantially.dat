5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on 23 January 1943, and was <b>substantially</b> {{completed on}} 22 October. Stages of the P-9 distillation plant became operational between 17 June and 18 September 1943. Total cost was $7,493,157, including DuPont's fee of $152,472, which was voluntarily reduced from $272,776 because {{the plant was}} constructed for <b>substantially</b> less than the allocated $13,665,000.|$|E
5|$|A. v. gracilipes {{inhabited}} Culebra Island {{and is now}} extinct. It {{is unclear}} whether it was <b>substantially</b> different from the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|ADS {{has also}} been used {{to show that the}} {{fraction}} of single-author astronomy papers has decreased <b>substantially</b> since 1975 and that astronomical papers with more than 50 authors have become more common since 1990.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{study in}} Dublin demonstrates that eradicating H. pylori <b>substantially</b> reduces recurrence of ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Automobile {{production}} {{exploded in}} the U.S. and in other nations during the 1920s. This, and {{the increasing use of}} petroleum derivatives to power factories and industrial equipment, <b>substantially</b> increased worldwide demand for oil.|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are <b>substantially</b> fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are <b>substantially</b> weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|By June {{however, the}} Real had fallen <b>substantially</b> from its peak against the Dollar, and Mantega {{had been able}} to begin {{relaxing}} his anti-appreciation measures.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{a general}} {{thinning}} of a squall line will occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts <b>substantially</b> and clouds losing their thickness.|$|E
5|$|Harlan also dissented {{from this}} ground for reversal, arguing that Burton was not <b>substantially</b> prejudiced.|$|E
5|$|However, the Cultural Revolution of 1959 saw {{almost total}} {{destruction}} of the hermitage. Since 1984, with approval of the local government, a reconstruction face was begun and the hermitage has been <b>substantially</b> restored now to its past glory.|$|E
5|$|In {{magnetized}} plasmas, a gyrokinetic {{approach can}} <b>substantially</b> reduce the computational {{expense of a}} fully kinetic simulation.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest, {{wild salmon}} stocks, a main {{resident}} food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On {{the west coast}} of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also <b>substantially</b> declined.|$|E
5|$|June–July 2010: Twitter had a {{very high}} service {{rejection}} rate (10–20%) during the 2010 FIFA World Cup period, also, the response latency increased <b>substantially.</b>|$|E
5|$|Official {{emancipation}} did not <b>substantially</b> {{alter the}} economic situation of most blacks who remained in the south.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} decade, vehicle usage {{increased}} <b>substantially,</b> and by 1920 Lakeshore Road was again congested, particularly during weekends.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{liberalization}} of United States immigration laws in 1965, {{the number of people}} in the United States having Filipino ancestry has grown <b>substantially.</b> In 2007 there were an estimated 12million Filipinos living overseas.|$|E
5|$|The Sixth Amendment public trial {{right is}} held by the defendant, and the {{excluded}} public have no ability to assert it. Independently, however, {{the public has a}} <b>substantially</b> similar First Amendment right to attend.|$|E
5|$|The creek flooded <b>substantially</b> after Tropical Storm Nicole on September 30, 2010. A {{majority}} of households surveyed {{after the storm}} reported flooding in their basements. As a result, several watershed drainage recommendations were proposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed <b>substantially</b> equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not <b>substantially</b> equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E
5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated for launch in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a <b>substantially</b> revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the carry-over door skins. Interiors, too, were <b>substantially</b> revised, while mechanically, a new independent rear suspension setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E
5|$|While all {{recorded}} {{crime was}} below the Leeds' average, criminal damage was <b>substantially</b> higher and {{nearly twice the}} England average. Most crimes committed {{in the area are}} violent or sexual offences, anti-social behaviour, criminal damage or arson.|$|E
5|$|Worcester College, Oxford, 1864–69– redecoration of the Chapel and 1873–79– redecoration of the Hall. The {{latter is}} <b>substantially</b> altered with little of Burges's work remaining, the former complete.|$|E
5|$|A new {{government}} center {{was to be}} built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were <b>substantially</b> altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg is North Jutland's major {{industrial}} and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement, and spirits. Heavy industry {{was behind the}} city's prosperity until fairly recently. Many of the factories have now closed, {{to be replaced by}} developments in the knowledge-based and green-energy sectors. Mobile and wireless communications industries have grown <b>substantially</b> since the 1990s, as has rotor production for wind turbines.|$|E
5|$|According to a SWOT {{analysis}} by MarketLine, Nestlé Purina Petcare's pet food brands that contribute <b>substantially</b> to revenue include Purina, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Purina Beneful and Purina ONE. Some brands, such as Alpo {{are intended for}} budget shoppers, while others like Purina ONE and Beneful cost more and are for health or ingredient conscious consumers. Purina ONE has been its fastest-growing brand.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, <b>substantially</b> written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of {{instructions}} and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was <b>substantially</b> plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Ubisoft and {{developer}} Torus Games {{produced a}} <b>substantially</b> different Planet of the Apes game for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color. It is a side-scroller following {{the first two}} films; the player controls astronaut Ben on the Planet of the Apes. The Game Boy versions received average reviews.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers <b>substantially</b> increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it. Baggage is seldom inspected, and cash customers {{do not require}} identification. Greyhound says that security wands have been deployed on buses, {{but they do not}} appear to be routinely used.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened <b>substantially</b> after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined <b>substantially.</b> However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E
5|$|Although {{twice as}} {{powerful}} as the Alpine, the Tiger is only about twenty per cent heavier, but the extra weight of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications. Nevertheless, the Tiger's front-to-back weight ratio is <b>substantially</b> similar to the Alpine's, at 51.7/48.3 front/rear.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and <b>substantially</b> decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|E
5|$|Because the law grants a {{municipality}} significant regulatory latitude, 35 of the state's 565 municipalities {{are currently}} dry. Conversely, {{because of the}} grandfathering of licenses, several municipalities have a <b>substantially</b> higher ratio of licenses. For instance, the resort town of Wildwood has a permanent population of 5,300, but 61 active liquor licenses.|$|E
5|$|Citizens of Virginia Beach also elect five {{constitutional}} officers, {{and candidates}} for these offices {{are permitted to}} run with an affiliated political party. Three of these offices deal <b>substantially</b> with public safety and justice: the sheriff, commonwealth's attorney, and the clerk of the circuit court. The two other offices are concerned with fiscal policy: the city treasurer and the commissioner of the revenue.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on 11 February 1943, and {{was completed}} on 15 November. Stages of the P-9 distillation plant became operational between 29 May and 4 September 1943. Total cost was $3,466,171, including DuPont's fee of $70,368, which was voluntarily reduced from $184,680 because {{the plant was}} constructed for <b>substantially</b> less than the allocated $8,285,000.|$|E
5|$|Damage from Hypera postica, the alfalfa weevil, {{a serious}} {{introduced}} pest of forage, was <b>substantially</b> {{reduced by the}} introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.|$|E
5|$|Due to CITES, this zoo harvest has {{decreased}} <b>substantially</b> in recent years, but poaching continues, and red pandas are often sold to private collectors at exorbitant prices. In {{some parts of}} Nepal and India, red pandas are kept as pets.|$|E
