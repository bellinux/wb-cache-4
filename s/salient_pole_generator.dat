40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the modified and improved, time-stepping, dynamic reluctance mesh (DRM) modelling technique for machines and {{its application to}} multiple machine systems with their control algorithms. Improvements are suggested which enable the stable solution of the resulting complex non-linear equations. The concept of finite element (FE) derived, overlap-curves has been introduced to facilitate {{the evaluation of the}} air-gap reluctances linking the teeth on the rotor to those on the stator providing good model accuracy and efficient computation. Motivated industrially, the aim of the work is to develop a fast and effective simulation tool principally for evaluating <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> <b>generator</b> system designs including the generator, exciter and the automatic voltage regulator (AVR). The objective is to provide a modelling system capable of examining the detail of machine operation including saturation of main and leakage flux paths, slotting and space harmonics of the windings. Solutions are obtained in a sufficiently short computational time to facilitate efficient iterative design procedures in an industrial design office. The DRM modelling technique for electrical machines has been shown in this thesis to be a fast and efficient tool for electrical machine simulation. Predicted results for specific machine and system designs have been compared with FE solutions and with experimental results showing, that for engineering purposes, the technique yields excellent accuracy. The DRM method has a great advantage in multiple machine simulations. This is because magnetic field calculations are limited to evaluating only the most important information so saving computation time. A brushless generating system including the excitation system and control scheme has been modelled. Additionally a cascaded, doubly fed induction generator for wind generator applications has also been modelled. These different applications for the dynamic reluctance mesh method have proved that this approach yields an excellent machine and machine-system evaluation and design tool.

40|$|Hydropower {{research}} is often {{perceived to be}} an old and exhausted field of study but with ageing equipment and the need for more intermittent operation caused by an increased share of other renewable energy sources new challenges lie ahead. The main focus of this dissertation are the electromagnetic forces resulting from nonuniform air gap flux, whether it be caused by rotor eccentricity or a faulty field winding. Results are predominantly obtained from measurements on an experimental generator and numerical simulations. With the computational capacity available today it is possible to numerically analyse physical phenomena that previously could only be studied with analytical tools. Numerical models can also be expanded to encompass more than one aspect of generator operation in coupled field-circuit models without model complexity surpassing computer capability. Three studies of unbalanced magnetic pull, UMP, in synchronous <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> <b>generators</b> constitute the main part of this thesis. The first is a study of how parallel stator circuits affect the unbalanced magnetic pull caused by rotor eccentricity. Depending on the relationship between the geometry of the separate circuits and the direction of the eccentricity it was found that parallel circuits could reduce the UMP substantially. Secondly, an investigation of the effect of damper winding configuration on UMP was performed. The results showed that damper winding resistivity and the distance between the damper bars in a pole determine the effectiveness of the damper winding in reducing the UMP. Simulations of a production machine indicate that the reduction can be substantial from damper windings with low resistivity. The third study analyses the consequences of field winding interturn short circuits. Apart from a resulting rotating unbalanced magnetic pull it is found that the unaffected poles with the same polarity as the affected pole experience an increase in flux density. In a fourth article a new stand still frequency response, SSFR, test method including measurements of damper winding voltage and current is presented.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} stator leakage inductances is presently an open {{issue in the}} analysis and testing of multi- phase electric machines. Calculation methods are available, which involve complicated and often poorly precise three-dimensional (3 -D) analyses. Experimental determination techniques, using measurements on the wound stator with the rotor removed, are also possible, but quite impractical, as {{they need to be}} performed during machine manufacturing or require rotor withdrawal.

40|$|<b>Salient</b> <b>pole</b> {{synchronous}} <b>generators</b> as {{the main}} component of an electricity generation station should be carefully maintained and their operation has to be monitored such that any damage on them is avoided. Otherwise, the generating station might experience frequent shut downs which results in electricity generation interruptions and high costs associated with repairing and compensation of lack of energy. In this sense, many protective schemes focusing on a variety of synchronous generator faults have already been proposed and are still modified and developed to further enhance the quality of protection. In this thesis, synchronous generator stator windings to ground fault is studied {{as one of the most}} common and crucial faults in these machines. Numerous methods of stator winding to ground fault protection schemes are also reported in the literature. Third harmonic differential voltage and sub-harmonic schemes are studied in this research. A novel adaptive scheme for both methods is modelled and implemented in a comprehensive lab scale set-up where a real generation unit is scaled down including all different components and apparatus. The simulation model is also established based on simultaneous finite element analysis (FEA) and coupled magnetic circuit to assist with system configuration design and parameter selections. The adaptive scheme is proved to be capable of detecting stator windings to ground faults based on actual experimental data. Finally, the proposed adaptive scheme is compared against other available non-adaptive protection schemes currently used in industrial relays. Several important performance evaluation criteria in protection schemes such as sensitivity and security of operation referred to as reliability are considered. It is shown that the adaptive scheme offers higher reliability than other schemes which emphasizes its credibility and applicability...|$|R
40|$|For the {{synchronous}} generator simulation and analysis {{and for the}} power system stabilizer design and synthesis a mathematical model of {{synchronous generator}} is needed. The model has to accurately describe dynamics of oscillations, {{while at the same}} time has to be transparent enough for an analysis and sufficiently simplified for design of control system. To study the oscillations of the synchronous generator against to the rest of the power system, the model of the synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus through a transmission line having resistance and inductance is needed. In this paper, the linearized reduced order dynamic model of the synchronous generator connected to the infinite bus is presented and analysed in details. This model accurately describes dynamics of the synchronous generator only in a small vicinity of an equilibrium state. With the digression from the selected equilibrium point the accuracy of this model is decreasing considerably. In this paper, the equations’ descriptions and the parameters’ determinations for the linearized reduced order mathematical model of the synchronous generator are explained and summarized and represent the useful origin for works in the areas of synchronous generators’ dynamic behaviour analysis and synchronous generator’s control systems design and synthesis.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Electric and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{critical}} evaluation of the torque performance of the optimum designed reluctance DC machine (RDCM). The thesis focuses on multi-phase RDCM drives with normal laminated <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotors allowing for high power and high-speed applications. An RDCM is a normal reluctance synchronous machine (RSM) but with direct control of flux and torque just as in brush DC machines. Flux and torque of the RDCM are controlled directly {{by the use of}} special phase current waveforms. Specific attention is given in the thesis for the selection of the best current waveform for the RDCM allowing for smooth rotating airgap MMF and less ripple torque. The absolute optimum designed RDCM can best be obtained by the use of the finite element (FE) method in the design optimisation process. In this thesis a multi-dimensional FE based design optimisation method for the optimum design of the current controlled RDCM is implemented. To compare the torque performance of the RDCM with other RSMs the torque performances of optimum designed 3 -phase, 5 -phase and 5 -phase with the injection of third harmonic current RSMs are performed under the same copper losses and stack volume. The torque performances of RSMs are done with both <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor and the round rotor with internal flux barriers. The armature reaction effect of 6 -phase RDCMs is also investigated in detail by considering three different rotor structures. These rotor structures are the standard <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor, the <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor with slitted <b>poles</b> and the <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor with chamfered poles. It was shown that the RDCM with the <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor has a severe armature reaction effect, which can be reduced by slitted or chamfered <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotors. A per-phase equivalent circuit model of the 6 -phase RDCM is also proposed in this thesis. The torque of the machine is calculated based on the per-phase equivalent model and compared with the torque calculated by the FE Maxwell stress tensor method. There is a good agreement between these calculated torques. This thesis shows that the implemented FE based optimisation method can be applied with success to optimally design current controlled RDCMs. It was found, amongst other things, that the torque performance of the optimum designed 6 -phase RDCM is slightly higher than that of the optimum designed 5 -phase RSM with the injection of 3 rd harmonic currents and with the same copper losses and stack volume. The analytical and FE calculated results are confirmed by measured results on a 35 kW 6 -phase RDCM drive...|$|R

The {{model for a}} <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> WFSM in any general rotating reference frame is developed {{which can be used}} to derive models along known rotor (dq) and stator flux (MT) reference frames. Based on these models, the principle of sensor-less stator flux oriented field-oriented control (FOC) for <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> WFSM is developed. So far in the literature, control of cylindrical rotor machine only has been addressed and the effects of saliency have generally been neglected. The performance of the proposed sensor-less FOC has been demonstrated by experimentally operating a 15. 8 HP <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> WFSM using a three-level IGBT based voltage source inverter (VSI). The principle of FOC has been later extended to the control of current source load commutated inverter (LCI) fed <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> WFSM drives, where the drawbacks present in conventional self-control method such as rigorous off-line calculation for generation of look up tables, coupling between flux and torque control etc. are eliminated. This thesis also proposes the combination of a VSI with the LCI power circuit to overcome the different disadvantages that are present in the existing LCI topology. Firstly, a novel starting scheme is proposed, where the LCI fed WFSM is started {{with the aid of a}} low power auxiliary VSI converter in a smooth manner with sinusoidal motor currents and voltages. This overcomes the difficulties of the present complex dc link current pulsing technique that has drawbacks such as pulsating torque, long starting time etc. In a second mode of operation, it is shown that the VSI can be connected to the existing LCI fed WFSM drive as a harmonic compensator in On-The-Fly mode; this will make the terminal stator current and voltage sinusoidal apart from cancellation of torque pulsations thus improving the drive performance. The above two schemes have potential as retrofit for existing drives. It is possible to combine both the advantages, mentioned above, by permanently connecting the VSI with the LCI power circuit to feed the WFSM. This proposed hybrid LCI/VSI drive can be regarded as a universal solution for high power synchronous motor drives at all power and speed ranges...|$|R
