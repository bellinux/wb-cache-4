5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary <b>saccule,</b> which will eventually become the <b>saccule</b> and cochlea. Part of the <b>saccule</b> will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the <b>saccule</b> through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the utricle and <b>saccule,</b> and organ of Corti). The nerve begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the <b>saccule.</b> Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{electron}} microscopic {{examinations of}} outer segments of photoreceptors suggest that many flattened <b>saccules</b> of cones are continuous with the cell membrane {{and that their}} lumina connect with the extracellular compartment but that most <b>saccules</b> in rods appear to lack these connections. The <b>saccules</b> probably contain photolabile pigment, and certain potentials appear to result from dipole formation during pigment bleaching. The detection of dipoles from rod <b>saccules</b> may require that the lumina of rod <b>saccules</b> connect with extracellular space, and {{questions have been raised}} whether the interpretation of micrographs is correct or the isolation of rod <b>saccules</b> is the result of artifact. Accordingly, lanthanum and barium precipitates were produced near fixed and unfixed frog photoreceptors. Lanthanum precipitates appeared to infiltrate the <b>saccules</b> of fixed cones and the few surviving cones exposed prior to fixation, but no rod <b>saccules</b> were infiltrated except occasional, most basal <b>saccules</b> or <b>saccules</b> within narrow zones of probable damage. Barium precipitates did not infiltrate <b>saccules</b> of either variety of unfixed photoreceptor, but they did occasionally infiltrate around the <b>saccules</b> at points of damage in rod outer segments.

5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and <b>saccule.</b> These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and <b>saccule,</b> and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct.

Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates.

40|$|The vasopressin-producing neurons of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial {{system are}} a {{particularly}} good model with which to consider {{the relationship between the}} Golgi apparatus nd GERL and their roles in secretory granule production because these neurons increase their synthesis and secretion of vasopressin in response to hyperosmotic stress. Enzyme cytochemical techniques for acid phosphatase (AcPase) and thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) activities were used to distinguish GERL from the Golgi apparatus in cell bodies of the supraoptic nucleus from normal mice, mice hyperosmotically stressed by drinking 2 % salt water, and mice allowed to recover for 5 - 10 d from hyperosmotic stress. In nonincubated preparations of control supraoptic perikarya, immature secretory granules at the trans face of the Golgi apparatus were frequently attached to a narrow, smooth membrane cisterna identified as GERL. Secretory granules were occasionally seen attached to Golgi <b>saccules.</b> TPPase activity was present in {{one or two of the}} trans Golgi saccules; AcPase activity appeared in GERL and attached immature secretory granules, rarely in the trans Golgi <b>saccules,</b> and in secondary lysosomes. As a result of hyperosmotic stress, the Golgi apparatus hypertrophied, and secretory granules formed from all Golgi <b>saccules</b> and GERL. Little or no AcPase activity could be demonstrated in GERL, whereas all Golgi <b>saccules</b> and GERL-like cisternae were TPPase positive. During recovery, AcPase activity in GERL returned to normal; however, the elevated TPPase activity and secretory granule formation seen in GERL-like cisternae and all Golgi <b>saccules</b> during hyperosmotic stress persisted. These results suggest that under normal conditions GERL is the predominant site for the secretory granule formation, but during hyperosmotic stress, the Golgi <b>saccules</b> assume increased importance in this function. The observed cytochemical modulations in Golgi <b>saccules</b> and GERL suggest that GERL is structurally and functionally related to the Golgi <b>saccules...</b>|$|R

25|$|An endolymphatic duct {{runs from}} the <b>saccule</b> up through the head, and ending close to the brain.

In many reptiles, fish, and amphibians this sac may reach considerable size. In amphibians the sacs from either side may fuse into a single structure, which often extends {{down the length of the}} body, parallel with the spinal canal.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many fish}} {{are capable of}} hearing, the lagena is, at best, a short {{diverticulum}} of the <b>saccule,</b> and appears to have no role in sensation of sound. Various clusters of hair cells within the inner ear may instead be responsible; for example, bony fish contain a sensory cluster called the macula neglecta in the utricle that may have this function. Although fish have neither an outer nor a middle ear, sound may still be transmitted to the inner ear through {{the bones of the}} skull, or by the swim bladder, parts of which often lie close by in the body.|$|E

Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph.

25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and <b>saccule.</b> These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the vestibular system of mammals has retained some of its ancestral acoustic sensitivity and that this sensitivity is mediated by the otolithic organs (most likely the sacculus, due to its anatomical location). In mice lacking the otoconia of the utricle and <b>saccule,</b> this retained acoustic sensitivity is lost. In humans vestibular evoked myogenic potentials occur in response to loud, low frequency acoustic stimulation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Vestibular sensitivity to ultrasonic sounds has also been hypothesised {{to be involved in the}} perception of speech presented at artificially high frequencies, above the range of the human cochlea (~18kHz). In mice sensation of acoustic information via the vestibular system has been demonstrated to have a behaviourally relevant effect; response to an elicited acoustic startle reflex is larger in the presence of loud, low frequency sounds that are below the threshold for the mouse cochlea (~4Hz), raising the possibility that the acoustic sensitivity of the vestibular system may extend the hearing range of small mammals.|$|E
500|$|The ear is {{the organ}} of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually {{described}} as having three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word [...] "ear" [...] often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and <b>saccule,</b> which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically {{on either side of}} the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.|$|E

Isoosmotic incubations of rat retinas in solutions containing potassium as the only cation also produced swelling of the outer segments when chloride or acetate was present; but swelling was less when the cation was sodium and it was not seen with either cation when the anion was methylsulfate. The effects of various metabolic and membrane poisons are also reported. The behavior of the <b>saccules</b> within the outer segments was equivocal.

Endogenous glycopeptides of rat hepatic Golgi fragments were radiolabeled in vitro with [3 H]sialic acid using detergent-free conditions. The Golgi fragments consisting of dispersed vesicles and tubules with intraluminal lipoprotein-like particles were then microinjected into Xenopus oocytes and their fate studied by light (LM) and electron microscope (EM) radioautography. 3 h after microinjection, radiolabel was observed by LM radioautography over yolk platelet-free cytoplasmic regions near the injection site. EM radioautography revealed label over Golgi stacked <b>saccules</b> containing the hepatic marker of intraluminal lipoprotein-like particles. At 14 h after injection, LM radioautographs revealed label in the superficial cortex of the oocytes between the yolk platelets and at the oocyte surface. EM radioautography identified the labeled structures as the stacked <b>saccules</b> of the Golgi apparatus, the oocyte cortical granules, and the plasmalemma, indicating that a proportion of microinjected material {{was transferred to the}} surface via the secretion pathway of the oocyte. The efficiency of transport was low, however, as biochemical studies failed to show extensive secretion of radiolabel into the extracellular medium by 14 h with approximately half the microinjected radiolabeled constituents degraded.

Although microinjected Golgi fragments were able to effect the formation of stacked <b>saccules</b> in vinblastine-treated oocytes, negligible transfer of heterologous material to the oocyte surface could be detected by radioautography.
