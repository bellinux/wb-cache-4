40|$|Introduction: Rainfall has {{the highest}} {{variability}} at time and place scale. Rainfall fluctuation in different geographical areas reveals the necessity of investigating this climate element and suitable models to forecast the rate of precipitation for regional planning. Ardabil province has always faced rainfall fluctuations and shortage of water supply. Precipitation {{is one of the}} most important features of the environment. The amount of precipitation over time and in different places is subject to large fluctuations which may be periodical. Studies show that, due to the certain complexities of rainfall, the models which used to predict future values will also need greater accuracy and less error. Among the forecasting models, Arima has more applications and it has replaced with other models. Materials and Methods: In this research, through order 2 Autoregrressive, Winters, and Arima models, monthly rainfalls of Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> (representing Ardabil province) for a 31 -year period (1977 - 2007) were investigated. To assess the presence or absence of significant changes in mean precipitation of Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station,</b> rainfall of this station was divided into two periods: 1977 - 1993 and 1994 - 2010. T-test was used to statistically examine the difference between the two periods. After adjusting the data, descriptive statistics were applied. In order to model the total monthly precipitation of Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station,</b> Winters, Autoregressive, and Arima models were used. Among different models, the best options were chosen to predict the time series including the mean absolute deviation (MAD), the mean squared errors (MSE), root mean square errors (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE). In order to select the best model among the available options under investigation, the predicted value of the deviation of the actual value was utilized for the months of 2006 - 2010. Results and Discussion: Statistical characteristics of the total monthly precipitation in Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> indicates that in May, the highest and in August, the lowest monthly total rainfall accounted in this station. Standard deviation of rainfall reached to the lowest level in August and its peak in November. Coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of total rainfall in all seasons, indicates a lack of compliance with normal distribution. From the view of the range of total monthly rainfall, October and August have highest and the lowest tolerance in these parameters, respectively. The results showed that the percentage of the mean absolute error for Arima, Winters and Autoregressive models was 61. 82, 148. 39 and 81. 54 respectively and its R square came to be 88. 28, 61. 07 and 85. 12 respectively. The comparison of the parameters is an indication of the fact that Arima {{has the highest}} R square and the lowest mean absolute error of 88. 28 and 61. 82 respectively than Winters and Autoregressive models.

Climate data provides on overview of normal and extreme weather conditions at a given location. This information can be used in risk analysis, for the evaluation of past avalanche events, and for every day forecasting services. The data can be analyzed for the return period of extreme events with focus on hazard zoning and design standards. A database was designed to serve as a practical tool for everyday avalanche work at NGI. The database includes weather observations from over 100 Norwegian <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> with three to four observations a day. The focus is on stations in avalanche prone areas, such as fjords on the west coast and the coastal areas in northern Norway. Since <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> in the Norwegian mountains are sparse, the analyzer still has to use experience in judging the avalanche situation in the mountains from observations near the coast.

For calculating PET indices we used measurements of Siófok <b>synoptic</b> <b>station.</b> According to our results, PET is applicable to examine climate change. Our most important results were that at winter bioclimate did not change significantly while in summer the frequency of days with strong and extreme heat stress increased widely during the last 40 years...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated {{soil erosion}} is an {{undesirable}} process that adversely affects water and soil resources. Rainfall erosivity {{is an important}} factor in water erosion models. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to estimate the rainfall erosivity throughout Iran based on the latest available detailed rainfall data while considering its temporal and spatial variations. To accomplish this, the data from 18 <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> of the Iranian Meteorological Organization, known to have reliable data and hyetographs with a 23 year common period, were accordingly analyzed. The kinetic energy of rain for each storm event was calculated based on Wischmeier and Smith’s original model, i. e. the USLE, and many of its modifications. Later, the rainfall erosivity factor was calculated on a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis using the calculated kinetic energy. The results revealed tha...|$|R
40|$|In this study, daily, monthly {{and annual}} weather data of <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> in Ardebi region was {{gathered}} from Iran Meteorological Organization and then, the homogeneity of data were examined by run test method. To study agro-climatic features of viticulture, deviation from optimal {{conditions and the}} degree of active days index (GDD) methods are used. Based on the analysis of deviations from optimal conditions at different altitudes in the study area, Meshkinshahr station has optimal conditions for planting, among the stations. This is important in terms of development of cultivation areas and commercial production of crops. Based on the agro-climatic analysis, western and central regions (Meshkinshahr and Khalkhal stations) are most suitable areas of viticulture in the region. While eastern, northwestern and southern (Parsabad, Ardebi stations) areas are next in this ranking...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} space {{distribution of}} accumulated precipitation is highly required as input for both hydrological and agro-meteorological models. Relatively precision but sparse ground measurement network is frequently not adequate even using interpolation methods. The rainfall estimations {{based only on}} IR or IR/VIS satellite data give more detailed structure of rainfall distribution but absolute error is large sometimes. To solve this problem, the method for merged satellite and conventional information use, was developed. Polish network of <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations,</b> climate posts and raingauges with addition of rainfall estimation based on METEOSAT satellite data were used. The 24 hours accumulated rainfall product was tested. First tests based on 20012002 cases showed interesting results, especially for convective precipitation. Description of the method and discussion on obtained results are presented in the paper...|$|R
