40|$|Hypertension (HTN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{sequelae}} of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children. Dialysis-related HTN is predominantly caused by chronic volume overload, and as such the blood pressure (BP) can be reduced and/or brought down to normal in a sizable number of patients with improved salt and fluid balance. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of HTN among children on hemodialysis (HD) and to evaluate the correlation of HTN with some demographic data. This is a prospective study performed on forty pediatric patients with CKD receiving maintenance HD in three centers in Baghdad. HTN was defined as BP ≥ 95 th percentile for age, height, and sex or use of antihypertensive medications. HTN was recorded in 27 patients on HD (67. 5 %), while the BP was normal in the other 13 patients (32. 5 %). There was no significant correlation between HTN and gender, age, or etiology of CKD. Duration of the HD <b>session,</b> <b>number</b> of <b>sessions</b> <b>per</b> week, total duration on HD, and blood flow rate also had no statistical correlation with HTN.

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{different}} plant density on seed yield and yield components of three spring rapeseed cultivars a factorial experiment based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and 9 treatments was carried out during 2011 in Qazvin, Iran. Each plot consisted of 4 rows, 6 m long with 60 cm between rows. Seed were sown by hand (without pre planting irrigation) on February 2. Application of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and irrigation regime in this experiment were processed as they are usually done in the region. Three rapeseed cultivars Hayola 401 ، RGS 003 and Sarigol with three plant density levels (60, 80 and 100 plant/m 2) were studied. At the end of growing period, traits like silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique and 1000 seed weight, seed yield and seed oil percent were measured. The results showed that plant density and cultivars affected silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield significantly. The effects of plant density by interaction on silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique and seed yield were also significant. Hayola 401 produced the highest silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield.

An understanding of the interrelationships between important agronomic traits and yield of winter wheat could help to improve breeding results. The objectives of this paper were to examine correlations between several winter wheat traits and their direct and indirect effects on kernel yield. Research work was conducted during two growing seasons in East Croatia (2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07) on 11 winter wheat genotypes. Nine genotypes were advanced breeding lines and two registrated Croatian cultivars Žitarka and Srpanjka. Six traits were included in investigation: ear <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, plant height, <b>number</b> of spikelets <b>per</b> ear, <b>number</b> of kernels <b>per</b> ear, 1000 kernel weight and kernel yield.

The first factor consisted of four levels of diaminozied, as plant growth regulator, (0, 40, 80 and 120 mg. L- 1) and the second factor of five cultivars of virus-free potato (Satina, Savalan, Marfona, Agria and Cesear). Virus-free plantlets were transferred to isolated greenhouse and planted in 20 × 20 × 15 cm in plastic pots beds made by 1 : 1 volume of Biolan peat moss and perlite. During growth period traits like plant height, leaf and stem <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, mini-tuber weight and <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant and square meter, and mini-tuber size were average measured. The analysis of variance showed significant differences among different levels of diaminozied for leaf <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, mini-tuber weight and its <b>number</b> <b>per</b> square meter, tuber average size in all cultivars under study. The interaction of diaminozied by cultivars showed significant difference as to leaf <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, mini-tuber weight, its <b>number</b> <b>per</b> square meter and average tuber size.
