An ethics officer for the Chicago Board of Ethics {{concluded}} that Foxgrover did not violate the district's ethics ordinance and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> keep her $90,000-a-year job as the Park District's director of development. By 2008, Foxgrover had left the Park District to work for O'Malley's restaurant management company.|$|E
5|$|In London, an anti-Trump rally {{was held}} outside the Houses of Parliament as House of Commons debated whether Trump <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> visit the United Kingdom.

5|$|On 21 February 2016, a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} the question of whether Morales <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> run for a fourth term when his third term would expire in 2020 which he narrowly lost. His approval rating had been damaged by the allegations concerning his relationship with Gabriela Zapata Montaño. In December 2016 the MAS nominated Morales as their candidate for the 2019 presidential election regardless, stating that they would seek various avenues to ensure that this would be legal.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Locke finds Walt's lost dog Vincent (Madison) using a {{makeshift}} dog whistle, {{and gives him}} to Michael, saying that he thinks Walt's father {{should be the one}} to return the dog. Kate offers to tell Jack what her crime was. However, he declines, stating that their past lives are not important right now and all of the survivors <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> start, again.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

5|$|In February 313, Constantine {{met with}} Licinius in Milan, where they {{developed}} the Edict of Milan. The edict stated that Christians <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> follow the faith without oppression. This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which many had been martyred previously, and returned confiscated Church property. The edict protected from religious persecution not only Christians but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by Galerius, then senior emperor of the Tetrarchy; Galerius' edict granted Christians {{the right to}} practise their religion but did not restore any property to them. The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned {{as well as other}} provisions for previously persecuted Christians.|$|E

It is the first episode to feature a 'Previously on Lost' segment, a clip shown {{at the beginning of}} each episode summarizing the recent events of the show. The episode receives its name from the philosophical idea of tabula rasa, meaning blank slate, a concept which is brought in one of the episode's final lines, when Jack tells Kate that all of the Flight 815 survivors <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> restart with a new life.|$|E
5|$|The pagoda raids {{provoked}} widespread disquiet {{among the}} Saigonese. At midnight on 22 August, Generals Đôn, Đính and Khiêm informed Nhu that student demonstrations were planned for three consecutive days. They recommended that schools be closed, but when Nhu {{took them to}} see Diệm, the president refused to close the educational institutions. Diệm decided the students, not usually known for political activism, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> voice their opinions. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which was met with arrests, imprisonment, and {{the closure of the}} campus.

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany used {{violence}} and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave Germany {{of their own}} volition; around 250,000 of the country's 437,000 Jews emigrated between 1933 and 1939. Eichmann travelled to British Mandatory Palestine with his superior Herbert Hagen in 1937 to assess the possibility of Germany's Jews voluntarily emigrating to that country, disembarking with forged press credentials at Haifa, whence they travelled to Cairo in Egypt. There they met Feival Polkes, {{an agent of the}} Haganah, with whom they were unable to strike a deal. Polkes suggested that more Jews <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but Hagen refused, surmising that a strong Jewish presence in Palestine might lead to their founding an independent state, which would run contrary to Reich policy. Eichmann and Hagen attempted to return to Palestine a few days later, but were denied entry after the British authorities refused them the required visas. They prepared a report on their visit, which was published in 1982.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue that people <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E
5|$|The matter {{ended in}} court, {{with a case}} to {{determine}} whether Autolink <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> take control of four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal {{in regard to the}} contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership of the radios to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. There was agreement that Autolink, on 13February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK12 million, of which NOK9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt.|$|E
