25|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, directed by Gen Natsume. It {{is set in}} a forest at night, and features Ochi singing the song on the steps of a wooden hut. Other musicisna surround her in the forest and perform the song alongside her, including a man performing on an upright piano. Additional scenes featured Ochi riding on a white horse, and Ochi <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> full moon.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Anger {{moved to}} Paris, France, where he {{initially}} stayed with {{friends of his}} (who themselves {{had been forced to}} leave Hollywood after being blacklisted for formerly having belonged to trade union organisations). He would later remark that he travelled to the country after receiving a letter from the French director Jean Cocteau in which he told Anger of his admiration for Fireworks (shown in 1949 at Festival du Film Maudit in Biarritz, France). Upon arrival, Anger and Cocteau became friends, with the Frenchman giving the young protege his permission to make a movie of his ballet The Young Man and Death, although at the time there were no financial backers for the project. While in Paris he continued producing short films; in 1950 he started filming on Rabbit's Moon, which was also known as La Lune des Lapins and revolved around a clown who was <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon, in which a rabbit lived, something found within Japanese mythology. Anger produced 20 minutes of footage at the Films du Pantheon Studio in the city before he was rushed out of the studio, leaving the film uncompleted. He stored the footage in the disorganized archives of the Cinémathèque Française, and only collected it again in 1970, when he finally finished and released Rabbit's Moon. It was at the Cinémathèque Française that he was given by the head, Henri Langlois, prints of Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico!, which he attempted to put into Eisenstein's original order.|$|E
500|$|As Prince Gian Gastone disliked his father's hyper-pious character, he {{elected to}} stay away from him and the royal court. The closed court that Gian Gastone did keep was {{dominated}} by his favourite, Dami. Meanwhile, the Grand Prince Ferdinando was slowly dying from syphilis, making Gian Gastone's immediate succession more likely. Ferdinando, nonetheless, was not alone in his suffering: Guyot de Merville, a French adventurer, took note of Gian Gastone's mental decline: [...] "He carries [...] so far that it is said he never opens a letter, to avoid having to answer." [...] Additionally, Gian Gastone's fragile temperament required long periods of isolation; he spent several hours alone each night, drinking and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon.|$|E

"Sweet Love" [...] {{was written}} by Chris Brown, Cory Marks, Greg Curtis, Jamal [...] "Polow da Don" [...] Jones, Jason [...] "JP" [...] Perry and Tommy Doyle Jr., while the {{production}} was handled by Polow da Don and Perry. The audio mixing was completed by Jaycen Joshua, with assistance by Trehy Harris. Curtis played keyboards on the song. On March 28, 2012, Brown announced via his official Twitter account {{that he would be}} releasing [...] "Sweet Love" [...] and [...] "Till I Die" [...] as the next two singles from Fortune, after the lead single [...] "Turn Up the Music". Later that same day, he posted a link to a stream of [...] "Sweet Love". The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, and debuted online on March 30, 2012. It displays Brown sitting on the floor, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> legs of one of the three women. Rap-Up magazine described the artwork as [...] "grown and sexy". [...] "Sweet Love" [...] was officially sent to urban contemporary playlists in the United States on April 10, 2012.

60|$|Dennin's {{hands were}} {{released}} {{long enough for}} him to sign the document. Then a silence fell in the room. Hans was restless, and Edith felt uncomfortable. Dennin lay on his back, <b>staring</b> straight <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moss- chinked roof.|$|R
60|$|Dea Flavia {{had thrown}} {{herself on the}} couch on her back; her arms were folded behind her head, her fair hair lay in heavy masses on the {{embroidered}} coverlet.

60|$|The {{body was}} brought and laid upon the platform, its wide eyes <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon. Then {{soldiers}} who had gathered thrust forward the weeping girl.|$|E

60|$|Erös Béla {{had been}} found--out in the open--murdered {{by an unknown}} hand. Fehér Károly and his brother, who lived down the Fekete Road, had taken a cut across the last maize-field--the one {{situated}} immediately behind the inn kept by Ignácz Goldstein, and they had come across Béla's body, lying in the yard, with face upturned and eyes <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> sightlessly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> brilliant blue sky overhead.|$|R

60|$|Klara {{was quite}} close to that dark and inert thing at last; she put out her hand and touched it. The man was lying on his face; {{just as he had}} fallen, no doubt; with a superhuman effort she {{gathered}} up all her strength and lifted those hunched-up shoulders from the ground. Then she gave a smothered cry; the pallid face of Erös Béla was <b>staring</b> sightlessly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon.|$|R
50|$|Rapunzel woke up {{hours before}} dawn. She heard heaving sobs {{even though she}} was not crying. She {{discovered}} a round green face <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. <b>The</b> creature introduced himself as Steven. Steven was in debt to the witch for saving his son when he suddenly could not breathe. The witch was the only person around, and she mumbled an incantation. A large bug flew out of Steven’s son’s throat. Steven asked what he could do to repay the witch, and the witch told him she needed a cook and guard. Therefore, Steven was stuck in the tower forever. If he leaves, his son would die.|$|R
6000|$|These words, for an instant, {{seemed to}} check the beating of Newman's heart. He {{leaned back in his}} chair, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old woman. [...] "They have tried to see her, and she wouldn't--she couldn't?" ...|$|E

50|$|The most {{dangerous}} pilot-induced oscillations can occur during landing. Too much up elevator during the flare {{can result in}} the plane getting dangerously slow and threatening to stall.

An even larger amount of up elevator starts the cycle over again.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bennett {{began to}} forget his remorse {{in a sense}} of injury. He felt like a man with a good story to tell who can get nobody to listen to him.

60|$|But {{he was not}} {{thinking}} that far ahead. Cole stood by the fire, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{his hands on his}} hips. He squinted, suddenly tense. Something was moving. Something in the sky, drifting slowly through the grayness. A black dot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Though unsatisfactory, my {{research}} {{has not been}} entirely barren," [...] he observed, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.

60|$|The old {{man stood}} there like some great force, {{darker than the}} darkness, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, as though stupefied. We had not a word to say. He seemed {{unconscious}} of our presence. He turned round, and left us standing there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I waked out {{of sleep}} with {{the light of the}} morning sun on my face. I sat up and looked around me. The fire was out, and the camp was desolate; save for one figure which lay prone close to me. It was that of the Arab chief, who lay on his back, dead. His face was almost black; and his eyes were open, and <b>staring</b> horribly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, as though he saw there some dreadful vision. He had evidently been strangled; for on looking, I found on his throat the red marks where fingers had pressed. There seemed so many of these marks that I counted them. There were seven; and all parallel, except the thumb mark, as though made with one hand. This thrilled me as I thought of the mummy hand with the seven fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uggug, indeed!" [...] I exclaimed, in a {{burst of}} indignation I could no longer control.
