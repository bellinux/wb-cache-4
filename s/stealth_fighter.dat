25|$|The Super Hornet employs {{reportedly}} {{the most}} extensive radar cross section reduction measures of any contemporary fighter, other than the F-22 and F-35 as of 2004. While the F/A-18E/F is not a <b>stealth</b> <b>fighter</b> like the F-22, {{it will have a}} frontal radar cross-section an order of magnitude smaller than prior generation fighters. Additional changes for reducing RCS can be installed on an as-needed basis.|$|E

Interior and exterior styling were inspired by <b>stealth</b> <b>fighter</b> design, taking cues from aircraft such as the F-22 Raptor. Only 21 units were built, of which one was retained by the factory to be exhibited in the Lamborghini museum. Lamborghini also produced 15 units of a roadster version.|$|E

25|$|The C-5 {{has been}} used for several unusual functions. During the {{development}} of the secretive <b>stealth</b> <b>fighter,</b> the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Galaxies were often used to carry partly disassembled aircraft, leaving no exterior signs as to their cargo. The C-5 remains the largest aircraft to operate in the Antarctic, capable of operating from Williams Field near McMurdo Station. The C-5 Galaxy was a major supply asset in the international coalition operations in 1990-91 against Iraq in the Gulf War. C-5s have routinely delivered relief aid and humanitarian supplies to areas afflicted with natural disasters or crisis; multiple flights were made over Rwanda in 1994.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Directorate {{announced}} a new manufacturing method for use producing the turbine exhaust casing for the F119 jet engine used on the F-22 Raptor <b>stealth</b> <b>fighter</b> which will result in an estimated savings of 35% of the cost while also improving the durability. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, the Directorate helped develop a new laser-based ultrasonic scanner to inspect composite parts also for use on the F-22. The Directorate also developed an advanced thermoplastic composite material {{for use in the}} landing gear doors on the F-22. In 2008, the Air Force announced that the Directorate had developed a method of using fabric made of fiber optic material in a friend or foe identification system.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{designated}} a <b>stealth</b> <b>fighter,</b> measures {{were taken to}} reduce the Typhoon's radar cross section (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect. An example of these measures is that the Typhoon has jet inlets that conceal {{the front of the}} jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept, so will reflect radar energy well away from the front sector. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing leading edges, the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and strakes.|$|E
50|$|Super Wing Commander was {{a drastic}} {{new look at}} {{the events of the}} {{original}} Wing Commander.

50|$|In 1992, the 49th FW {{underwent}} {{a number of}} transitions. As {{a result of the}} end of the Cold War, reduced defense budgets were the order of the day.
