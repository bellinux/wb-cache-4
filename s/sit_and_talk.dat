25|$|Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, {{will not}} be persuaded by Liu Bei to launch an attack on Xu City, since Liu Biao {{is a person who}} does nothing but <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b> Liu Biao also does not trust Liu Bei as Liu Bei is a more {{competent}} man than he is — if he gives Liu Bei an important post he must be concerned that Liu Bei will become too powerful, but if he gives him a lesser position Liu Bei will be reluctant to serve him.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006, {{the man in}} the photographs, Malcolm McCauley, told Adelaide Now that he {{had visited}} Corby in Bali twice in 2005 – but only as a tourist {{offering}} support during her drugs trial. McCauley said he first met Corby at her court hearing in May 2005. He said Corby's mother invited him to visit Corby at Kerobokan Prison the following day. Despite claims that the photos had been taken prior to Corby's arrest, McCauley said the photos were taken at an empty fish pond at the prison where the two were permitted by prison guards to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} a good {{perspective on the}} episode, considering it {{to have been the}} best episode of the season. Deeming the episode an [...] "eye-opening experience", West described Ellis' surprising personality as having worse repercussions on her daughter than the control issues and the intense disapproval that had previously been noted on the character: [...] "You would think after Ellis had a few hours to digest the news that she has essentially lost her mind, she would take advantage of the gift that is her brief lucidity to patch things up with Meredith. Meredith was hesitant to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> with her mother about the last five years but finally she decides this could be her only chance." [...] Comparing Ellis' previous appearances in the series with the version presented in the episode, West stated she is [...] "far worse" [...] as a lucid person, noting how frustration and confusion are her main characteristics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sit</b> Down <b>and</b> <b>Talk</b> to Me is a 1980 album by American R&B singer Lou Rawls, {{released}} on the Philadelphia International Records label. All of PIR's major production names {{contributed to the}} album, resulting in a diverse set of tracks from dance to urban blues. Although <b>Sit</b> Down <b>and</b> <b>Talk</b> to Me did not produce any major hit singles, its commercial performance was adequate, peaking at #19 R&B and #81 pop.|$|R

500|$|Willis {{described}} the production {{for the film}} as [...] "relatively easy." [...] He shot in varying styles; [...] "hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for... dream sequences," [...] {{most of which were}} cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: [...] "Few viewers probably notice how much of Annie Hall consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship." [...] He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of Annie Hall to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that [...] "Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces, so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained." [...] Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation {{in the use of the}} split screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.|$|E
2500|$|Fendall's {{house was}} {{located on the}} west side of the Wicomico River, near Allens Fresh, Charles Co., Maryland. (Wicomico came from the Indian words Wicko, for house, and Mekee, for building.) [...] It had a field in front of it, which was large enough for a troop of 36 mounted horses in a two-file formation. [...] Nearby was Fendall's cow pen. [...] He kept horses and cows. [...] His mark for hogs and cattle was a [...] "cropt on the left ear, and under keeled on the right ear", entered into the Charles Co., court record June 3, 1658. [...] The house was at least two stories high, and large enough to hold court, which it did several times. [...] It had a fireside where people could <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b> [...] He had several {{servants}} that lived on his plantation. [...] In 1681 Josias sold a boat that was at least large enough to carry a man, wife, and four children.|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao was {{preparing}} for another campaign against Yuan Shang (who had fled to join his second brother Yuan Xi and the Wuhuan tribes), many of his followers were worried that Liu Biao might send Liu Bei (who had become a vassal under Liu Biao) to attack Cao Cao's base, the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). However, Guo Jia said to Cao Cao, [...] "Your military might may be very well known now, but the Wuhuan will definitely not set up defences because they are deluded by {{a false sense of}} security since they are far away from you. As such, if you seize this opportunity to launch a surprise attack on them, you can eliminate them. Besides, Yuan Shao treated the ethnic minorities well and the Yuan brothers are still alive. Now, the people of northern China submit to you because they fear your military might, and you've yet to pacify them through benevolent governance. If you abandon the campaign and head south instead, the Wuhuan and Yuan Shao's former followers might rally the support of the people in northern China, who are likely to respond to their call. When that happens, the attention of Tadun (a Wuhuan chieftain) will be aroused and he may think of attacking you, and by then we would have lost Qing and Ji provinces. Liu Biao is a person who does nothing but <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b> He also does not trust Liu Bei as the latter is more capable than him – if he entrusts Liu Bei with important responsibilities, he will be worried that the latter will no longer submit to him; if he gives Liu Bei trivial tasks to do, the latter will be reluctant to serve him. Even if you empty your territories to campaign far away, you have no worries." [...] Cao Cao proceeded with his campaign against the Yuan brothers and the Wuhuan.|$|E
