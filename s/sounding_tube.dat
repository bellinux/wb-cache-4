5000|$|Before valves {{were invented}} in the 19th century, horns and {{trumpets}} (except for slide-bearing versions {{such as the}} sackbut and its classical and modern descendant, the trombone, and finger-hole horns like the cornett and serpent) could play only the notes of the overtone series from a single fundamental pitch. Starting in the early 18th century, a system of crooks was devised in Germany, enabling this fundamental to be changed by inserting one {{of a set of}} crooks between the mouthpiece and the lead pipe of the instrument, increasing the total length of its <b>sounding</b> <b>tube.</b> As a result, all horn music was written as if for a fundamental pitch of C, but the crooks could make a single instrument a transposing instrument into almost any key.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the Solid State amps of this 'Red Knob' era, {{there were}} two that {{utilized}} the same circuit board and wattage, the Fender Eighty-Five and the Studio 10. The schematics you will find on the 'Eighty-Five' amp will be labeled 'Studio 85' which can be confusing to those trying to find an accurate schematic. This mislabeling we can assume happened because the amp was intended in the design phase to be released as the Studio 85, {{but for some reason}} this changed when it went into production. Paul Wentling is credited as the designer. He (Paul) has stated, years after the fact, that he created some fairly bad <b>sounding</b> <b>tube</b> amps during this time frame, owing to the cost limits given him by Fender management at the time. The SS Eighty-Five and the Studio 10 are the same 65 (RMS) watt amp except for the use of a 12" [...] speaker in one, and a 10" [...] in the other. The 12" [...] version, the Fender Eighty-Five, was notably used by Steve Miller (Steve Miller Band) and Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead) over the years on many recordings. They were made in Lake Oswego, Oregon at the old Sunn factory, a brand/company that Fender had purchased in 1985-86.|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{corrections}} for the Aquatrak acoustic {{tide gauge}} are derived. These account for variable temperature (and hence sound velocity) along the <b>sounding</b> <b>tube,</b> thermal {{expansion of the}} calibration tube and the thermal response of the transducer/controller combination. When averaged over long (e. g. seasonal) periods, the corrections are typically several millimeters in magnitude, with short (e. g. diurnal) period variations as large as several centimeters. The correction associated with thermal expansion of the calibration tube is of the same order as the correction for variable sound velocity, which is already applied at some Aquatrak installations. The corrections derived here relate to the situation where an initial adjustment has {{been made by the}} manufacturer (making the calibration tube a fixed known length under factory conditions), and a subsequent calibration is performed to define a single zero offset for the instrument. ...|$|E

5000|$|Tanks may be sounded {{manually}} or {{with electronic}} or mechanical automated equipment. Manual sounding is undertaken with a sounding line- a rope with a {{weight on the}} end. Per the Code of Federal Regulations, most steel vessels with integral tanks are required to have <b>sounding</b> <b>tubes</b> and reinforcing plates under the tubes which the weight strikes when it reaches {{the bottom of the}} tank. Sounding tubes are steel pipes which lead upwards from the ships' tanks to a place on deck.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two <b>sounding</b> <b>tubes</b> that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|R
50|$|From 1976 to 1979, the Hawkins was {{assigned}} as a Naval Reserve training ship in Philadelphia. By {{that time she}} was {{nearing the end of}} her designed lifespan. Science fiction writer James D. Macdonald, then a ensign in the United States Naval Reserve, {{was assigned}} to her during this period, and reported to the captain one morning that the sounding tape used to check the water level in the ship's tanks had punched through the striking plate in one of the <b>sounding</b> <b>tubes</b> and the hull plate beyond it, indicating the hull was becoming unsound.|$|R

500|$|The ship entered {{service in}} 1866 with the Baltic Fleet. She accidentally {{collided}} with and sank the wooden steam frigate [...] on 15 August 1869, killing 16 men from Oleg, but Kreml {{was only slightly}} damaged. She {{was assigned to the}} Gunnery Training Detachment in March 1870 and remained with it for the bulk of her career. In November 1881, the steam-powered steering gear taken from the ironclad [...] was installed which required the installation of a high-pressure donkey boiler in the cramped boiler room. This proved to be more trouble than it was worth and was removed two years later. Kreml was caught by a storm on 10 June 1885 while sailing for Reval (Tallinn) and began taking on so much water that her captain decided to make for shallow water; she reached Kunda Bay, on the Estonian coast, under sail alone after her engine bearings overheated and forced the engine to be stopped. Once there, the progressive flooding continued through the ventilation shafts, <b>sounding</b> <b>tubes,</b> and defective valves in the internal bulkheads, and the ship sank in [...] of water. Kreml was refloated on five days later and repaired in Kronstadt. She was reclassified as coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and placed in reserve on 24 December 1904. Kreml was disarmed and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 15 September 1905. She was stricken from the Navy List on 12 October and sold for scrap on 8 September 1908.|$|R
5000|$|Popularized by guitarists such as Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Rory Gallagher, Brian May, and Marc Bolan, treble {{boosters}} {{were used}} to overdrive amplifiers (mostly dark <b>sounding,</b> British <b>tube</b> models such as Marshall Bluesbreakers and Vox AC30s) {{in order to create}} a more distorted yet focused sound. They came up in the mid-1960s. By the 1980s they had fallen out of use. Guitarists used overdrive pedals instead, in a similar fashion. But the circuit and its derivatives have experienced a great revival in the 21st century, thanks to the many boutique builders who have rediscovered the circuit. While IC-based overdrive pedals remain far more popular than treble boosters, some players prefer the less compressed and more dynamic response of Rangemaster-family boosters.|$|R
50|$|Lang {{founded a}} pickup {{with all the}} {{advantages}} of a low impedance pickup, being higher fidelity and low noise. However, the output of The Ultimate Lo pickups was that high that a separate buffer amp was needed. Lang used this occasion to develop a small PC board with a buffer amp and an integrated <b>tube</b> <b>sounding</b> overdrive sound, which he called the Ultradrive. All Langcaster guitars are equipped with these pickups and corresponding battery powered circuitry, incorporating clean overdrive switch and an overdrive intensity control pot.|$|R
