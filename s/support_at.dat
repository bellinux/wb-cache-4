5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' <b>support.</b> <b>At</b> some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that he had enough <b>support</b> <b>at</b> the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} is to study the property of the assumptions in the yield line theory and to give practical design method to be used in design. This work is meant to cover an investigation of six slabs. The support condition of these slabs were simply supported, simply and fixed supported, and fixed. The reinforcement arrangement used is isotropic reinforcement. The yield line theory was used as the method of solution to obtain the ultimate load. To verify the analytical results, experimentally the six rectangular two- way slabs subjected to uniformly distributed load are simulated by 16 point loads with various combinations of the possible boundary conditions (simply <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> all edges, fixed <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> one short edge and simply <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> the remaining edges, fixed <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> one long edge and simply <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> the remaining edges, fixed <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> two short edges and simply <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> the other edges, fixed <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> two long edges and simply <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> the two short edges, and the last slab was fixed <b>supported</b> <b>at</b> all edges. Data of the experimental work including deflection readings, and yield line patterns are presented.) Experimental results are discussed and comparisons are made between the theoretical and experimental result. Finally conclusions are drawn and recommendations are presented. It can be concluded that the difference between the experimental and theoretical failure loads were small and mainly on the conservative side. Significant increase in load carrying capacity of isotropically reinforced fixed supported slabs is due to compressive membrane action imposed by horizontal restraints. Also similar yield line patterns for theoretical and experimental cases were observed...|$|R

The 2014 Cowdenbeath by-election was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie.

5|$|PHP has {{received}} criticism due to lacking native Unicode <b>support</b> <b>at</b> the core language level, instead only supporting byte strings.

Since this would cause major changes {{both to the}} internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development.|$|E
5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity.

Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E

5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting Formula One {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to <b>support</b> <b>at</b> least one car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March {{to be built}} as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's <b>support</b> <b>at</b> home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: {{to increase}} his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up <b>support</b> <b>at</b> the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.|$|E
