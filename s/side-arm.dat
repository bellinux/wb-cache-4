5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the <b>side-arm,</b> which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a <b>side-arm,</b> but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E

The Eastern division included the Chicago Colleens, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Muskegon Lassies and South Bend Blue Sox teams, while the Kenosha Comets, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and Springfield Sallies played in the Western Division. At the same time, the league made the switch from <b>side-arm</b> to overhand pitching.|$|E

The shooting occurred as she was walking past a wicket gate guarded by Satwant and Beant. She was to have been interviewed by the British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television. Beant Singh shot her three times using his <b>side-arm</b> and Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh dropped their weapons and surrendered. Afterwards they were taken away by other guards into a closed room where Beant Singh was shot dead. Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the attack. Both Satwant and Kehar were sentenced to death and hanged in Delhi's Tihar Jail.|$|E
2500|$|Usually {{described}} as a submarine pitcher, Kim is a <b>side-arm</b> and under-arm hard thrower who uses {{a great variety of}} deliveries. Kim possesses a four-seam fastball with tailing movement frequently hitting the low 90s, a Frisbee slider with sweeping motion across the plate, an up-shoot slider with a rising motion, and a circle-changeup which he usually uses to strike out left-handed hitters. Nevertheless, during the three seasons between [...] and , his main problem had been the loss of right pitching balance which caused difficulty in ball control and reduced ball velocity. During that time, he also struggled against left-handed batsmen. In 2014, perennially award-winning third baseman Adrián Beltré named Kim as the toughest pitcher he had ever faced, {{due in large part to}} his pitching motion.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1913 season, Love signed with the Selma Centralites of the Cotton States League. [...] Love {{appeared}} in 28 games for Selma, including a no-hitter, and a five-game streak in which he allowed no runs and 19 hits. At the end of July 1913, Love was acquired by the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association. [...] On August 22, 1913, he pitched a shutout against the Billikens, facing only 22 batters in seven innings—one more than the minimum of 21. The Atlanta Constitution, referring to Love as [...] "the human office building", noted that Love smiled throughout the game and [...] "mixed his overhand drop with a <b>side-arm</b> slow ball that baffled the best of the Billikens." [...] In eight games for the Crackers, Love compiled a 2-3 record.|$|E
2500|$|The AAGPBL {{made the}} {{transition}} from underhand to full <b>side-arm</b> pitching in 1947. Before starting the season, Faut married Karl Winsch, a former Philadelphia Phillies pitching prospect from East Greenville, near her hometown. The couple established residence in South Bend, Indiana, where she worked in the off-season for Ball-Band, a local division of the United States Rubber Company. Pitching in 44 games, Faut came through with a 1.15 ERA {{to go with her}} 19–13 record, allowing 56 runs (38 earned) on just 179 hits in a career-high 298 innings.

She also posted a [...]236 average in 56 games, ranking 19th in the league behind Kamenshek, who won her second consecutive title with a [...]306 mark. Her most durable performance came on July 31, when she defeated Eleanor Dapkus and the Belles in 22 innings by a 4–3 score. Faut spaced 16 hits, walked five, struck out eleven, and contributed two hits to her own cause ...|$|E

6000|$|And unconsciously Mr. Kipling {{has proved}} this, and proved it admirably. For {{in so far}} as his work is earnestly {{understood}} the military trade does not by any means emerge as the most important or attractive. He has not written so well about soldiers as he has about railway men or bridge builders, or even journalists. The fact is that what attracts Mr. Kipling to militarism is not the idea of courage, but the idea of discipline. There was far more courage to the square mile in the Middle Ages, when no king had a standing army, but every man had a bow or sword. But the fascination of the standing army upon Mr. Kipling is not courage, which scarcely interests him, but discipline, which is, {{when all is said and}} done, his primary theme. The modern army is not a miracle of courage; it has not enough opportunities, owing to the cowardice of everybody else. But it is really a miracle of organization, and that is the truly Kiplingite ideal. Kipling's subject is not that valour which properly belongs to war, but that interdependence and efficiency which belongs quite as much to engineers, or sailors, or mules, or railway engines. And thus it is that when he writes of engineers, or sailors, or mules, or steam-engines, he writes at his best. The real poetry, the [...] "true romance" [...] which Mr. Kipling has taught, is the romance of the division of labour and the discipline of all the trades. He sings the arts of peace much more accurately than the arts of war. And his main contention is vital and valuable. Every thing is military in the sense that everything depends upon obedience. There is no perfectly epicurean corner; there is no perfectly irresponsible place. Everywhere men have made the way for us with sweat and submission. We may fling ourselves into a hammock in a fit of divine carelessness. But we are glad that the net-maker did not make the hammock in a fit of divine carelessness. We may jump upon a child's rocking-horse for a joke. But we are glad that the carpenter did not leave the legs of it unglued for a joke. So far from having merely preached that a soldier cleaning his <b>side-arm</b> is to be adored because he is military, Kipling at his best and clearest has preached that the baker baking loaves and the tailor cutting coats is as military as anybody.|$|E
50|$|The Dean-Stark {{apparatus}} typically {{consists of}} vertical cylindrical glass tube, {{often with a}} volumetric graduation along its full length and a precision stopcock at its lower end, {{very much like a}} burette.

50|$|The {{reaction}} flask is heated. Boiling chips within it {{assist with the}} calm formation of bubbles of vapor containing the reaction solvent and the component to be removed.

Here, the immiscible liquids separate into layers (water below and solvent above it). When their combined volume reaches {{the level of the}} <b>side-arm,</b> the upper, less-dense layer will begin to flow back to the reactor while the water layer will remain in the trap.

The process of evaporation/ condensation/ collection may be continued until it ceases to produce additional amounts of water.|$|E
