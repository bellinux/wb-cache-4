25|$|Recombinant alphavirus-based vectors {{have been}} used to improve DNA {{vaccination}} efficiency. The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus replicon, replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural replicase genes intact. The <b>Sindbis</b> <b>virus</b> and Semliki Forest virus {{have been used}} to build recombinant alphavirus replicons. Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells and are only transiently expressed. Alphavirus replicase genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it {{may be due to the}} high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.|$|E
2500|$|Alphaviruses are of {{interest}} to gene therapy researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, <b>Sindbis</b> <b>virus,</b> Semliki Forest virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses. [...] Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to integrate the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations {{to the use of}} alphaviruses in the field of gene therapy due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of <b>Sindbis</b> <b>virus</b> envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by <b>Sindbis</b> <b>virus</b> envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death. [...] The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create replicon vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> are enveloped {{particles}} with an icosahedral capsid. Its genome is {{a single}} stranded RNA approximately 11.7kb long. It has a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail therefore serves directly as messenger RNA (mRNA) in a host cell. The genome encodes four non-structural proteins at the 5' end and the capsid and two envelope proteins at the 3' end. This is characteristic of all Togaviruses. Replication is cytoplasmic and rapid. The genomic RNA is partially translated at the 5’ end to produce the non-structural proteins which are then involved in genome replication {{and the production of}} new genomic RNA and a shorter sub-genomic RNA strand. This sub-genomic strand is translated into the structural proteins. The viruses assemble at the host cell surfaces and acquire their envelope through budding.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Wild {{populations of}} nonhuman {{primates}} live in regions of sylvatic arbovirus transmission. To assess {{the status of}} arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans, semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue- 2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan {{groups as well as}} local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and <b>sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> in North Borneo.

Although thalamocortical axons of single VP neurons are well known to innervate layer (L) 4 of the S 1 cortex with distinct columnar organization, those of POm neurons have not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we investigated complete axonal and dendritic arborizations of single POm neurons in rats by visualizing the processes with <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> expressing membrane-targeted fluorescent protein. When we divided the POm into anterior and posterior parts according to calbindin immunoreactivity, dendrites of posterior POm neurons were wider but less numerous than those of anterior neurons.

40|$|Nine {{different}} arboviruses {{are known}} to be transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes in Europe, and several (West Nile, <b>Sindbis</b> and Tahyna <b>viruses)</b> are reported to cause outbreaks of human disease. Although there have been no reported human cases in Great Britain (GB), there have been no published in-depth serological surveys for evidence of human infection. This paper investigates the ecological and entomological factors that could influence or restrict transmission of these viruses in GB, suggesting that in addition to West Nile <b>virus,</b> <b>Sindbis</b> and Tahyna <b>viruses</b> could exist in enzootic cycles, and that certain ecological factors could facilitate transmission to humans. However, the level of transmission is likely to be lower than in endemic foci elsewhere in Europe due to key ecological differences related to spatial and temporal dynamics of putative mosquito vectors and presence of key reservoir hosts. Knowledge of the potential GB-specific disease ecology can aid assessments of risk from mosquito-borne arboviruses...|$|R

40|$|Infection of {{vertebrate}} {{cells with}} alphaviruses normally leads to prodigious expression of virus-encoded genes and a dramatic inhibition of host protein synthesis. Recombinant <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> and replicons have been useful as vectors for high level foreign gene expression, but the cytopathic effects of viral replication have limited their use to transient studies. We recently selected Sindbis replicons capable of persistent, noncytopathic growth in BHK cells and describe here {{a new generation}} of Sindbis vectors useful for long-term foreign gene expression based on such replicons. Foreign genes of interest as well as the dominant selectable marker puromycin N-acteyltransferase, which confers resistance to the drug puromycin, were expressed as subgenomic transcripts of noncytopathic replicons or defective-interfering genomes complemented in trans by a replicon. Based on these strategies, we developed vectors that can be initiated via either RNA or DNA transfection and analyzed them for their level and stability of foreign gene expression. Noncytopathic Sindbis vectors express reasonably high levels of protein in nearly every cell. These vectors should prove to be flexible tools for the rapid expression of heterologous genes under conditions in which cellular metabolism is not perturbed, and we illustrate their utility with a number of foreign proteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSome viruses display {{enhanced}} infection for Fc receptor (FcR) -positive cell types when complexed with virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig). This {{process has}} been termed antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection (ADE). We reasoned that the mechanism of ADE could be exploited and adapted to target alphavirus-based vectors to FcR-positive cell types. Towards this goal, recombinant <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> were constructed that express 1 to 4 immunoglobulin-binding domains of protein L (PpL) as N-terminal extensions of the E 2 glycoprotein. PpL is a bacterial protein that binds the variable region of antibody kappa light chains {{from a range of}} mammalian species. The recombinant viruses incorporated PpL/E 2 fusion proteins into the virion structure and recapitulated the species-specific Ig-binding phenotypes of native PpL. Virions reacted with non-immune serum or purified IgG displayed enhanced binding and ADE for several species-matched FcR-positive murine and human cell lines. ADE required virus expression of a functional PpL Ig-binding domain, and appeared to be FcγR-mediated. Specifically, ADE did not occur with FcγR-negative cells, did not require active complement proteins, and did not occur on FcγR-positive murine cell lines when virions were bound by murine IgG-derived F(ab′) 2 fragments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have been}} widely used as tools to study gene {{function}} in cells. Despite the utility of these systems, the construction and production of alphavirus replicons is time consuming and inefficient due to potential additional restriction sites within the insert region and lack of directionality for insert ligation. In this report, we present a system useful for producing recombinant Sindbis replicons that uses lambda phage recombination technology to rapidly and specifically construct replicon expression plasmids that contain insert regions in the desired orientation. Results Recombination of the gene of interest with the replicon plasmid resulted in nearly 100 % recombinants, each of which contained a correctly orientated insert. Replicons were easily produced in cell culture and packaged into pseudo-infectious viral particles. Insect and mammalian cells infected with pseudo-infectious viral particles expressed various transgenes at high levels. Finally, inserts from persistently replicating replicon RNA were easily isolated and recombined back into entry plasmids for sequencing and subsequent analysis. Conclusion Replication-ready replicon expression plasmids make the use of alphavirus replicons fast and easy as compared to traditional replicon production methods. This system represents a significant step forward in the utility and ease of use of alphavirus replicons in the study of gene function. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPostsynaptic {{molecules}} with PDZ domains (PDZ proteins) {{interact with}} various glutamate receptors and regulate their subcellular trafficking and stability. In rat neocortical development, the protein expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluR 1 lagged behind its mRNA expression and rather paralleled {{an increase in}} PDZ protein levels. One of the neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), appeared to contribute to this process, regulating the PDZ protein expression. In neocortical cultures, BDNF treatment upregulated SAP 97, GRIP 1, and Pick 1 PDZ proteins. Conversely, BDNF gene targeting downregulated these same PDZ molecules. The BDNF-triggered increases in PDZ proteins resulted in the elevation of their total association with the AMPA receptors GluR 1 and GluR 2 / 3, {{which led to the}} increase in AMPA receptor proteins. When <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> carrying GluR 1 or GluR 2 C-terminal decoys disrupted their interactions, GluR 2 C-terminal decoys inhibited both BDNF-triggered GluR 1 and GluR 2 / 3 increases, whereas GluR 1 C-terminal decoys blocked only the BDNF-triggered GluR 1 increase. In agreement, coexpression of SAP 97 and GluR 1 in nonneuronal HEK 293 cells increased both proteins compared with their single transfection, implying mutual stabilization. This work reveals a novel function of BDNF in postsynaptic development by regulating the PDZ protein expression...|$|R
40|$|The RNase T 1 maps of 80 {{isolates}} of Ross River {{virus from}} {{different regions of}} mainland Australia and the Pacific Islands were compared. Four different clusters of isolates with greater than an estimated 5 to 6 % diversity at the nucleotide level were found. There was a pattern of differences between eastern and western Australian strains; however, the pattern was disturbed by overlaps and incursants. Pacific Islands isolates belonged to the eastern Australian topotype. Our findings suggest that certain genetic types of Ross River virus predominate in different geographical regions. In contrast, populations of other important Australian arboviruses (Murray Valley encephalitis, Kunjin, and <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses)</b> are distributed across the Australian continent as minor variants of one strain. Our data also show that in one region, strains of Ross River virus with identical RNase T 1 maps circulate during both years when epidemics occur and years when they do not. This finding suggests that Ross River virus epidemics are not dependent on the introduction or evolution of new strains of the virus. Two strains, belonging to the eastern Australian topotype, were isolated in Western Australia.

40|$|Sindbis and {{vesicular}} stomatitis viruses were grown {{in a line}} (termed 15 B) of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that is deficient in a specific UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. Both viruses replicated normally in the cell line, but the glycoproteins of the released virus migrated faster on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels than did glycoproteins of virus grown in parent CHO cells. Digestion of the viral glycoproteins with Pronase followed by gel filtration demonstrated that the glycopeptides of Sindbis- 15 B virus were {{much smaller than the}} glycopeptides of Sindbis-CHO virus. In addition, Sindbis- 15 B viral glycopeptides but not Sindbis-CHO viral glycopeptides contained terminal α-mannose residues as shown by their susceptibility to α-mannosidase digestion. These findings demonstrate that the oligosaccharide units of the glycoproteins of {{vesicular stomatitis}} and <b>Sindbis</b> <b>viruses</b> are altered when the viruses are grown in 15 B cells. We conclude that the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that is missing in 15 B cells normally participates in the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide units of the viral glycoproteins, {{and in the absence of}} this enzyme incomplete oligosaccharide chains are produced. Viruses released from 15 B cells appear to retain full infectivity; Sindbis- 15 B virus, however, showed a significant decrease in hemagglutination titer compared with that of Sindbis-CHO virus...|$|R
