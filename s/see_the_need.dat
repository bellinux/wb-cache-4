5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E

The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student’s welfare.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to full admiral on 20 June 1891, Hoskins became First Naval Lord in September 1891.

Two were stationed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and two at Copenhagen Airport. SAS chose not to launch the service in Norway. It considered the newly formed SAS Braathens to be a lost-cost carried and did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a differentiation in the Norwegian market. Snowflake launched ticket prices starting at 279 Swedish krona (SEK) and 295 Danish kroner (DKK) plus taxes. About ten seats per departure were sold at this level, and there were additional pricing levels.|$|E
25|$|The American command did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for {{long-range}} {{fighters in}} 1942, and like Bomber Command {{in the early}} war period, believed the bomber would always get through. On that understanding, there was no rush to develop fighter aircraft of this type. The twin-engined mid-range Lockheed P-38 Lightning had been designed as a high-altitude interceptor and was adequate in the escort role. Production had not yet reached the output needed and losses in the Mediterranean had diverted the P-38 strength there. As an interim solution the Americans were given the British Spitfire, but it lacked the range to reach beyond the coastal areas of western Europe.|$|E

The first shot hit McDonald, who spun {{and fell to the}} ground. As McDonald lay on the ground, still holding the knife, Van Dyke fired more shots into him. In total, Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times in 14–15 seconds, expending the maximum capacity of his 9mm semi-automatic firearm. Van Dyke was on the scene for less than 30 seconds before opening fire and began shooting approximately six seconds after exiting his car. The first responding officer said that he did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to use force, and none of the at least eight other officers on the scene fired their weapons.|$|E

25|$|This was, however, just {{political}} posturing on William's part, cynically exploiting certain prejudices in {{an attempt}} to gain ascendancy over the regents. More important as a matter of principle was the conflict over the reduction of the standing army that arose during 1649 and 1650. The regents understandably did not quite <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for an expensive, large, mercenary standing army in peacetime. Holland demanded a reduction of the army to 26,000 (from a level of 35,000 in 1648), whereas William argued that the personnel needs were now appreciably larger, because the territory to be protected by garrisoned fortresses was now a great deal larger. Though the parties came close to an agreement on a total of about 29,000 men, the final difference of a few hundred men proved to be insurmountable.|$|E
25|$|An {{economic}} transition {{occurred during}} this period, {{due to the}} diversity of the service sector being far greater than any other previous or contemporary society, and the high degree of economic integration between the labour force and the economy. Islamic society also experienced a change in attitude towards manual labour. In previous civilizations such as ancient Greece and in contemporary civilizations such as early medieval Europe, intellectuals saw manual labour in a negative light and looked down on them with contempt. This resulted in technological stagnation as they did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for machinery to replace manual labour. In the Islamic world, however, manual labour was seen in a far more positive light, as intellectuals such as the Brethren of Purity likened them to a participant in the act of creation, while Ibn Khaldun alluded to the benefits of manual labour to the progress of society.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued the {{attitude}} of the East towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to David Landes, after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement {{on the basis of their}} indigenous traditions and achievements. The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.|$|E

25|$|Lair had {{reservations}} about {{increased use of}} US air power in Laos, fearing that the Hmong and other Lao forces would become too dependent upon it. However, {{in the wake of}} the Battle of Nam Bac, he could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for organized forward air control for close air support. His proposal to place Lao interpreters with US fighter pilots in light aircraft to direct air strikes became the Raven Forward Air Controllers. Moreover, he could see the utility of pilots and infantry sharing a common language. Vang Pao had already requested training slots for Hmong cadets at Project Waterpump at Udorn, and had been refused. Lair quietly scrounged a couple of Piper Cubs and began training Hmong pilots at Nong Khai. A PARU pilot, Somboun Sithoon, served as the first instructor. The instructional staff would come to include two pilots on loan from the Royal Thai Air Force and six more from Continental Air Services, Inc. Three classes of Hmong pilots would graduate by mid-1967, including the pilot who would become the star of the RLAF, Lee Lue.|$|E
25|$|Bexley Hall is an Episcopal Church U.S.A. {{theological}} seminary {{founded in}} 1823 by Philander Chase, the Bishop of Ohio. Most of the East Coast Episcopal leadership did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for another seminary, and denied {{financial support to}} Bishop Chase. So he went to England and appealed to his Anglican / Church of England colleagues, and won their overwhelming support. A victorious Chase returned to Gambier, Ohio, and founded Kenyon College, an Episcopal liberal arts college. In conjunction with Kenyon, he opened the seminary on the same campus. Still in Gambier, Bexley Hall was eventually identified as a separate institution and named after one of Kenyon College's biggest benefactors, the retired English Chancellor of the Exchequer, coincidentally known as Lord Bexley. Bexley Hall remained affiliated with Kenyon College until 1968, when it broke ties with Kenyon and relocated to Rochester, New York, forming a new association with the Baptist seminary Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School. In 1998, Bexley Hall returned to its native Ohio, sharing a campus with Trinity Lutheran Seminary, also coincidentally located in Bexley. The aptly named seminary remains {{a part of the}} Episcopal Church USA.|$|E
25|$|Failures in {{scaling-up}} HIV prevention programmes {{have not}} been caused by an absence of policy, but rather, as with other countries, by there being no policy enforcement and timely scale-up. Although China has a strong central government, provincial {{and lower levels of}} government enjoy a great deal of autonomy, which has resulted in a mixed response and inconsistent enforcement of HIV/AIDS policy. For example, Yunnan province has shown strong support for implementation and advocacy of harm-reduction strategies that reduce HIV transmission in its many drug users, whereas Henan province had been slower to respond to the needs of former plasma donors {{in the early stages of}} the epidemic. Moreover, the distribution of HIV in China is not even, and is concentrated in areas with high drug use (e.g., Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Sichuan) and in areas where people were infected through unsafe blood or plasma donation (e.g., Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, and Hubei). The number of cases ranges dramatically between provinces, with, for example, just 20 cases reported from Tibet but well over 40,000 in neighboring Yunnan. In provinces with an extremely low prevalence, it can be difficult for officials to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for HIV prevention and control.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong {{attended}} the day's meetings. The Program of Seminars ends {{on this day}} and delegates discussed {{about the future of}} global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers {{of the members of the}} International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the threat}} for flooding, local flood {{warnings}} were issued for much of Arizona. Starting at 0100UTC on September30 and lasting until 0600UTC on October6, the Tucson National Weather Service office issued 20warnings and statements including 13 radar-generated updates. In the same time period, the Phoenix National Weather Service office issued 28warnings, watches, and statements, nine of which were flood warnings generated by the Joint Federal-State Flood Warning Office. Although several flood warnings from the Phoenix National Weather Service Office were requested to be broadcast via the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), which is a national program that provides public warning for such disasters, no warnings were implemented.
