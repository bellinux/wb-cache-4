40|$|Fossil {{hydrocarbons}} are indispensables commodities that motorize {{the global}} economy, {{and oil and}} gas are two of those conventional fuels that have been extracted and processed for over a century. During last decade, operators face challenges discovering and developing reservoirs commonly found up to several kilometers underground, for which advanced technologies are developed through different research programs. In order to optimize the current processes to drill and construct oil/gas wells, {{a large number of}} mechanical technologies discovered centuries ago by diverse sectors are implemented by well engineers. In petroleum industry, the ancient tube forming manufacturing process founds an application once well engineers intend to produce from reservoirs that cannot be reached unless previous and shallower troublesome formations are isolated. Solid expandable tubular is, for instance, one of those technologies developed to mitigate drilling problems and optimize the well delivery process. It consists of in-situ expansion of a steel-based tube that is attained by pushing/pulling a <b>solid</b> <b>mandrel,</b> which permanently enlarge its diameters. This non-linear expansion process is strongly affected by the material properties of the tubular, its geometry, and the pipe/mandrel contact surface. The anticipated force required to deform long sections of the pipe in an uncontrollable expansion environment, might jeopardize mechanical properties of the pipe and the well structural integrity. Scientific-based solutions, that depend on sound theoretical formulation and are validated through experiments, will help to understand possible tubular failure mechanisms during its operational life. This work is aimed to study the effect of different loading/boundary conditions on mechanical/physical properties of the pipe after expansion. First, full-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the geometrical and behavioral changes. Second, simulation of deformation process was done using finite element method and validated against experimental results to assess the effects on the post-expansion tubular properties. Finally, the authors bring a comparison study where in a semi-analytical model is used to predict the force required for expansion...|$|E
40|$|Macrophages (MФ) and {{mast cells}} are {{important}} cell {{types in the}} context of tissue remodeling and regeneration. Mast cells participate {{in the early stages of}} wound healing and modulate the acute inflammatory responses to biomaterials. Mast cells can secrete a myriad of different cytokines by the process of degranulation; the process of regulated secretion in which preformed contents stored in their granules are rapidly released by exocytosis. Some of these cytokines such as IL- 4, IL- 13 and TNF-α can modulate the MФ phenotype. Macrophages (MΦ) are innate immune cells, crucial for tissue homeostasis, presentation of foreign and self-antigens following infection/injury, pathogen clearance, inflammation resolution, angiogenesis, and wound healing. MΦ display plasticity and can acquire pro-inflammatory (M 1) or angiogenic/wound healing (M 2) phenotypes depending upon the environmental stimuli. The phenotypic profile of MФ as M 1 or M 2 following exposure to the biomaterial can dictate the downstream processes of tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. An analysis of how these two cell types interact with electrospun biomaterials and how different properties of an electrospun biomaterial impacts the MΦ phenotype is the focus of this thesis. Mast cells synthesize several potent angiogenic factors and can also stimulate fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages. An understanding of how they participate in wound healing and angiogenesis is important to further our knowledge about in situ vascular prosthetic regeneration. The adhesion, proliferation and cytokine secretion of bone marrow derived murine mast cells (BMMC) on electrospun polydioxanone (PDO), polycaprolactone (PCL) and silk scaffolds, as well as tissue culture plastic (TCP) has been investigated in the presence or absence of IL- 3, SCF, IgE and IgE with a crosslinking antigen, dinitrophenol-conjugated albumin (DNP). It was previously believed that only activated BMMCs exhibit adhesion and cytokine secretion. However, this study shows non-activated BMMC adhesion to electrospun scaffolds. Silk scaffold was not found to be conducive for mast cell adhesion and cytokine secretion. Activation by IgE and DNP significantly enhanced mast cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and secretion of TNF-α, MIP- 1 α and IL- 13. This indicates that mast cells might play a role in MФ polarization (M 1 /M 2), biomaterial integration into the host tissue, regeneration, and possibly angiogenesis. In the next study, bone marrow derived murine macrophages (BMMΦs, 106 cells) were seeded on TCP (24 well plate) and PDO scaffolds (15 mm discs) electrospun from varying polymer concentrations (60, 100, and 140 mg/ml). Scaffold evaluation showed that large polymer concentrations led to larger fiber diameters, which in turn led to larger pore-sizes and porosity but a smaller surface area to volume ratio. After 24 hrs of culture, the cell lysates were analyzed for Arginase (Arg 1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression by western blot and cell culture supernatants were analyzed for Nitric oxide (NO 2 -), Tumor Necrosis Factor – alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Transforming Growth Factor – beta 1 (TGF-β 1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels. The results indicated a correlation between Arg 1 expression and increasing fiber/pore-size, indicating that the larger fiber/pore-sizes polarize towards a M 2 phenotype. Also, the expression of iNOS was downregulated on the larger fiber/pore-size. The levels of NO 2 - were significantly higher on the lower fiber/pore-sizes indicating an M 1 phenotype. The levels of VEGF, TGF-β 1 and bFGF increased with increasing fiber/pore-sizes. The results showed higher Arg 1 expression in M 2 s on the 60 mg/ml scaffold created by the air-flow impedance method compared to the 60 mg/ml scaffold created on the <b>solid</b> <b>mandrel</b> created by traditional electrospinning. The Arg 1 expression was reduced on the compressed 140 mg/ml PDO scaffold compared to the normal 140 mg/ml scaffold. This result indicates that pore-size might be playing a greater role compared to fiber diameter in BMMФ phenotype modulation. In order to assess the angiogenic potential of BMMΦs cultured on PDO scaffolds, a 3 D angiogenesis bead assay was performed using conditioned media from the BMMΦ:PDO interaction. The results of the 3 D angiogenesis bead assay showed that the conditioned media from BMMΦs of M 0 and M 2 phenotypes cultured on the 140 mg/ml PDO scaffold induced larger sprouting and higher percentage density of sprouts when compared to the 60 mg/ml PDO scaffold and TCP. To investigate the signaling mechanism involved in this phenotypic switch, BMMΦs were isolated from the bone marrow of MyD 88 knockout (KO) mice (Jackson Laboratories) and cultured on PDO (60 and 140 mg/ml) scaffolds (106 /disc) and TCP for 24 hrs and their Arg 1 and iNOS expression was analyzed by western blot. The expression of Arg 1 and iNOS was severely impaired on the BMMΦs from MyD 88 -/- mice cultured on the 140 mg/ml scaffold when compared to the 60 mg/ml PDO scaffold and TCP. This result indicates that scaffolds with different fiber/pore-sizes signal differently. A subcutaneous mouse model (described in Chapter 6) was used to evaluate the angiogenic and regenerative potential of PDO scaffolds in vivo. The DIVAA assay showed statistically higher FITC-dextran signal intensity for the 140 mg/ml scaffold compared to the 60 mg/ml scaffold indicating greater angiogenic response in the 140 mg/ml tube. However, problems of high background were observed in this assay with the use of electrospun PDO. The observed high background was probably due to the formation of complexes between dextran and adsorbed plasma proteins on the surface of the PDO. More studies are needed to optimize this assay for use with biomaterials such as PDO. H 2 ̆ 6 E staining of the harvested PDO tubes (60 mg/ml and 140 mg/ml) was also performed. The cross-sections of these tubes showed greater cell recruitment and infiltration into the fibrous structures of the 140 mg/ml tube compared to the 60 mg/ml tube. This result corroborates the in vitro result of BMMФ infiltrating deeper into the structures of the 140 mg/ml scaffold compared to the 60 mg/ml scaffold. The scaffolds were also analyzed by immunostaining for iNOS (indicative of M 1 phenotype of MФs). The results showed statistically higher ratios of iNOS positive:negative areas on the 60 mg/ml scaffold compared to the 140 mg/ml scaffold. Overall, these studies indicate that 140 mg/ml scaffold supports greater cell recruitment and cell infiltration in vivo but a smaller ratio of iNOS positive:negative areas compared to the 60 mg/ml scaffold, which supports a predominately M 1 MФ phenotype. The studies indicate that varying properties of PDO can alter both the phenotype and function of BMMΦs in vitro and in vivo. We have also shown that the 140 mg/ml scaffold signal BMMΦs through MyD 88 -dependent mechanisms. A complete understanding of the way materials signal would allow us to control or modulate undesirable immune reactions to biomaterials in vivo. These studies would also help engineer biomaterials that promote angiogenesis and regeneration...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} way to {{make the}} slide tubes was to roll a flat piece of metal around a <b>solid</b> cylinder <b>mandrel,</b> and the joining edges soldered together. Modern manufacturers now draw the tubes. They also tend to have stockings, which were only invented around 1850. In addition, modern made slides are usually made of nickel silver with chrome plating, giving a smoother finish and quieter action than simply the brass that would have originally been used.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{fundamental}} technological investigations, alternative joining strategies using electromagnetic forming (EMF) for {{the flexible}} production of lightweight frame structures are {{developed in the}} collaborative research project SFB/TR 10. The results of these investigations will {{also be used to}} create general design principles for the joining process itself {{as well as for the}} joining zone. The focus of this article will be on dominating form-fit joints of aluminum frame structures and the parameters which have a significant influence on the strength of those joints. For the development of design principles regarding the joining zone, the groove geometry of the connection elements was varied in terms of size and shape, and the influence of those variations was analyzed. In terms of the joining process itself the effect on the joint strength of different forming pressures for a given groove geometry was also investigated. In the first step these experiments were performed on <b>solid</b> <b>mandrels.</b> In order to reduce the weight of the structure, experiments were then performed with hollow connection elements and similar groove geometries to analyze how the reduced stiffness of those elements affected the strength of the joints...|$|R

These tooling concepts {{include the use of}} <b>solid</b> rubber <b>mandrels,</b> foam mandrels, and formed elastometric bladders. A simplification of the root end design of the cover hat stiffeners was accomplished in order to facilitate fabrication. The conversion of the 3 D NASTRAN model from level 15 to level 16 was completed and a successful check run accomplished. A detailed analysis of the thermal load requirement for the environmental chambers was carried out.

40|$|Coldworking {{fastener}} holes is {{a mechanical}} method of strengthening materials by retarding crack growth around the holes. It expands the hole diameter {{by creating a}} radial plastic flow of material, thereby producing a large residual compressive stress zone around the hole. This zone, depending upon variables such as material and applied expansion levels, will extend approximately one radius {{from the edge of}} the hole. This zone acts as a barrier, retarding crack growth, thereby increasing the fatigue life of the part. In this paper the benefits of coldworking are discussed. Currently there are two fastener hole coldworking methods used widely, the split sleeve, and split mandrel processes. The split sleeve process utilizes a <b>solid,</b> tapered <b>mandrel</b> and an internally lubricated split sleeve. The sleeveless split mandrel process utilizes a hollow, tapered mandrel that is longitudinally slotted into quarters (making it collapsible). Details of each process are discussed. Coldworking research to date has been focused on either fatigue life enhancement, or stress zone measurements (both actual and computer simulated). Research of the differences between the split sleeve and split mandrel process has been very limited. West Coast Industries (WCI) has theorized that these differences are important in determining the correct process for a specific application. An example of the need for this process-application matching can be seen in the problems encountere...|$|R
