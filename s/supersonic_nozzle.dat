50|$|Upon departing {{the spray}} gun, the {{graphene}} flake’s tendency to aggregate is reduced {{due to its}} quick evaporation and dispersion. Much to the researchers’ surprise, this spray method produces flakes that contain substantially less defects that would commonly occur. Common graphene defects including holes and lumps in the layer, and the Stone-Wales defect were absent upon surface impact. The large amount of kinetic energy delivered by the <b>supersonic</b> <b>nozzle</b> creates the healing of these defects, as the graphene flakes stretches upon impact.

The graphene layers would commonly contain defecting clumps and spaces, which troubled scientists ever since the discovery of graphene. The graphene spray gun is also regarded as inexpensive when compared to the other methods of large-scale graphene applications. One main factor for its inexpensiveness is that the graphene layers require no post-processing treatment, which was common in the other methods. The other factor is that the spray gun is remarkably simple in both its production and utilization.|$|E
50|$|At low flight speeds the DASS engine relies {{solely on}} the {{on-board}} turbojet that runs on a conventional hydrocarbon fuel. The variable geometry intake (PCT patent pending) allows large gaps to form between the heat exchanger (which is not operating at this stage), minimizing intake pressure losses. During this mode, the bypass is closed and all air is processed through the turbojet core. The exhaust nozzle (PCT patent pending) contracts in the subsonic mode for optimal specific thrust. As the engine accelerates to supersonic velocities, the articulated portions of the intake direct flow into the heat exchanger (PCT patent pending). Liquid hydrogen fuel is passed through the heat exchanger, decreasing {{the temperature of the}} air prior to engine compression. Some of the air bypass the turbojet core, and is mixed with the hydrogen exiting the heat exchanger in the afterburner section. Note that the magnitude of heat transfer is coupled to the amount of hydrogen available for combustion in the afterburner. The combustion products are then expanded through a <b>supersonic</b> <b>nozzle,</b> variable geometry nozzle. The engine will be designed to completely consume the air to optimize for thrust. The level of bypass changes throughout the supersonic flight regime. The engine can operate at Mach 4 and provide thrust in excess of a conventional ramjet. At high Mach numbers (~4.88) air cannot be cooled below the turbojet limit (1200K). As a result, no combustion can occur in the core turbojet and the engine must transition into a pure ramjet mode. The variable inlet continues to articulate (PCT patent pending) to completely block air access to the turbojet, while optimizing intake to exit area ratios for ramjet combustion using hydrogen. The engine still realizes an efficiency boost from the cooling effects of the heat exchanger (albeit much less in this mode). The terminal flight speed is limited to that of a hydrogen fueled ramjet.|$|E
