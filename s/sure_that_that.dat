Artani explained, [...] "He was getting personal. Here, she had a different type of image, and he was really exposing some stuff that she probably didn't want out there, and in front of her little sister... I remember her sister being mortified and her being mortified. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> really hurt her." [...] The song was also speculated to be a reply to Timberlake's [...] "Never Again", a ballad which appeared on his debut solo album Justified.

500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said that}} the idea of basing a film on [...] "Civil War" [...] had [...] "been on and off the table for a while" [...] at Marvel Studios, explaining, [...] "it's a {{challenge}} to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in [...] "Civil War", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [...] There isn't a Robert Downey, Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character so we need to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> template gets adjusted". Joe Russo added that the [...] "essence" [...] of [...] "Civil War" [...] was used, such as [...] "the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary" [...] being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, [...] "in a lot of ways [...] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other." [...] Executive producer Nate Moore added that [...] "it felt like it was kind of the right time" [...] to adapt [...] "Civil War" [...] given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films ( [...] , The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with [...] "world-ending experiences. We felt like we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?" ...|$|E

2500|$|When Bartelme {{took over}} as {{athletic}} director, Michigan had withdrawn from the Western Conference. One of his principle accomplishments was the return of Michigan to the conference.

2500|$|In July 1909, Michigan hired Philip Bartelme as the school's second {{athletic}} director following {{the resignation of}} Charles A. Baird. [...] The change in {{athletic director}}s led to speculation that Michigan might be prepared {{to return to the}} Western Conference. [...] In September 1909, Barthelme stated his intention to return Michigan to the conference, though he did not think the time was yet right. [...] He told the press, [...] "I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, it would be the only thing for us to do.

[...] "It's the first real time you get to see—apart from —this is a scene where she makes a really strong choice, {{but you can see}} that it's hard for her to do, and she does care," [...] Debnam-Carey stated. She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt [...] " [...] always knew [...] was going to [...] Now those cards are back on the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2008 BBC Radio 4 made a {{programme}} titled The Human Button, providing {{new information}} on {{the manner in which}} the United Kingdom could launch its nuclear weapons, particularly relating to safeguards against a rogue launch. [...] Former Chief of the Defence Staff (most senior officer of all British armed forces) and Chief of the General Staff (most senior officer in the British Army), General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a prime minister ordering a launch without due cause: [...] Lord Guthrie stated that the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the formal commander-in-chief is the Monarch (to whom they swear allegiance to and indeed, is called the [...] "Royal" [...] Navy/Air Force), to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal: [...] "the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> order was not obeyed... You have to remember that actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic.
