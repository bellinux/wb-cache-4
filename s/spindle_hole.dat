2500|$|The A Something's Extra 7" [...] 33 RPM EP (Tamla T 340EP) was {{included}} with the special-edition version of the original LP. Surprisingly, the EP (at least as released in the U.S.) uses the larger <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> typical of 45 RPM records. These tracks are also on most CD versions of the album, {{as well as the}} Blu-ray Audio, either split between both discs or appended {{to the end of the}} second disc.|$|E

50|$|Audiophiles {{eventually}} disdained record changers {{because of}} the perceived compromise in fidelity resulting from changes in tone arm angle with {{the height of the}} stack, and concerns about changers' seemingly rough treatment of discs, particularly due to slight but cumulative damage to the <b>spindle</b> <b>holes</b> as the records were dropped from a height of a few inches onto the record or stack below or the turntable platter, as well as some sliding and rubbing of the discs together, scratching the record labels in the process, because the dropped disc didn't immediately accelerate to the rotational speed of the spindle or discs below it. Most of these fears were unfounded in changers made after 1953. More advanced changers, such as the TD-224 model from Thorens and the ADC Accutrac+6, partially addressed these problems.|$|R
50|$|During the Iron Age, an extensive, pre-Roman native {{settlement}} {{occupied the}} eastern headland of the bay, {{on what has}} come to be known as the East Bay Site, or Roman Villa Site. Beneath the remains of the Romano-British villa was probably an Iron Age oppidum. Remains beneath the Roman villa suggest that querns, or stones used to grind cereal crops into flour, were produced here during the Iron Age on an almost industrial scale. Over 60 quern-stones have been recovered from the site of the villa and the lower cliff area. The querns are made of the local greensand stone, most likely collected or cut from nearby Copt Point and taken to the headland to be worked. The majority of the found querns are unfinished, with partially worked surfaces, or incomplete hoppers and <b>spindle</b> <b>holes.</b> In many cases, the querns appear to have been damages and discarded, many seeming to have fractured during the hole boring stage. In addition to the numerous broken or unfinished querns, a layer of the excavation strata at the Villa/opidum site is entirely composed of greensand dust, which is almost certainly stone-working debris, suggesting that this was the location of the Iron Age quern workshop.|$|R
2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and tonearm design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.|$|E

The millstone is from Castlefields corn mill near Bingley; it is a bedstone carved from local millstone grit. A spindle passes through this and a similar upper runner stone; the grain enters via the <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> and is ground by the scissor-action of the grooves when the runner stone rotates against the bedstone. The grain is forced out at the outer edges as flour, then flows into a sack.

There is a display explaining the history of steam power.|$|E
2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{a number}} of many recent studies is to assess the {{potential}} of cryogenic cooling in improving the sustainability of manufacturing processes. One prime interest is the enhancement of surface integrity properties of newly machined surfaces. In this paper, we study the effect of liquid nitrogen cryogenic cooling on the surface integrity of drilled holes in magnesium AZ 31 b using an indexable drill. Utilized are both experimental techniques and numerical (FEM) simulations. Specifically, liquid nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures was pumped through the drill's built-in through <b>spindle</b> coolant <b>holes.</b> HV micro-hardness measurements were performed on the newly machined holes surfaces. Furthermore, the process was modelled in FEM via an appropriate convective cooling approximation superimposed on the drilling process. Outputs of the numerical model such as strains, strain rates, and temperatures were used to predict the grain size at the surface of the holes and, consequently, hardness. Hardness values (determined from both experiments and FEM analyses) with different feed rates for dry drilled holes were compared against those from cryogenically cooled holes with the latter being found to have higher hardness values when compared to non-cooled ones...|$|R

5000|$|Aretino {{was started}} by Arthur J. Oâ€™Neill, who was linked to several Chicago-area record and {{phonograph}} operations. Oâ€™Neill named this company in honor of Guido Aretino, an 11th-century Italian monk because he was an originator of the musical scale [...] Aretino is an oddity distinguished by its records' <b>spindle</b> <b>hole,</b> the largest ever produced for commercial purposes. It was a premium scheme, similar to many of Oâ€™Neillâ€™s operations, in that a phonograph machine was offered cheaply; however, this phonograph could only play Aretino records because it came with a 3-inch spindle. [...] The design was intended such that an Aretino record could be played on any disc phonograph of the time. [...] As such, Oâ€™Neill also offered adapters for Aretino discs {{that allowed them to}} be played on phonographs with a standard spindle, or even on a Busy Bee machine (another Oâ€™Neill operation) with its extra <b>spindle</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

50|$|United Records {{operated}} {{in the years}} before World War I. The label was owned by the United Talking Machine Company of Chicago, Illinois, which produced the double-sided lateral cut disc records with an unusually large <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> (just slightly smaller than that used by the 45rpm records that appeared after World War II), and wind-up phonographs with large spindles for playing the records.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in the 1940s, {{flexible}} records {{began to}} be used in the form of [...] "book records"-spiral bound paper publications and four or five flexible record sheets bound in. A <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> went through the entire assembly.

5000|$|The Standard Talking Machine Company was an American {{record label}} {{that was created}} in October 1901 and {{operated}} until March 1918. The Chicago, Illinois based company produced several models of phonographs from Columbia Records parts and issued single-sided and double-sided disc records from Columbia Records masters. Despite the label name, the discs were not quite [...] "Standard"; the <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> {{at the center of}} the discs was 9/16 inch, larger than the industry standard. This made the discs difficult to play on phonographs other than those marketed by the company.|$|E
5000|$|The {{backside}} of each LP was very simple and all followed {{exactly the same}} design, obviously influenced by mid-century modernism: a circle, positioned near the bottom left side, similar in style to a vinyl LP itself, including the <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> in the middle, with [...] "SONAM" [...] {{on the left and}} [...] "BIENT" [...] on the right (hence [...] "SONAMBIENT") in a black background band, and [...] "Side 1" [...] above with the title of that side below, and [...] "Side 2" [...] below with the title of that side.|$|E
50|$|A {{cardboard}} {{record was}} {{a type of}} cheaply made phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard. These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell. Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> to add weight and stability. These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and {{from many of the}} old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose.|$|E
50|$|The FileWare {{diskette}} has {{the same}} overall jacket dimensions of a normal 5Â¼ inch diskette, {{but because of the}} head arrangement, the jacket has non-standard cutouts for the heads, with two sets of cutouts {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>spindle</b> <b>hole.</b> The write enable sensor is also in a non-standard location, though most FileWare diskettes were produced without a write protect slot. The jacket had a corner cutout that keyed the diskette to prevent insertion in an incorrect orientation, and a rectangular hole that the drive could use to latch the diskette in place, preventing removal until the software allowed it.|$|E
50|$|One of the LP sets was the 100 Greatest Recordings Of All Time, a {{collection}} of classical recordings selected {{by a panel of}} performers and conductors and pressed on translucent 180 gram deep red vinyl and packaged two LPs to an each album. Each LP was set into a plastic carrier that touched only the center <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> and the rim. There were two rereleases of this set. The second used ordinary paper sleeves inside a foldout compartment to house the LPs. The third used a side-open box and paper sleeves. In all three sets the vinyl quality was the same.|$|E

5000|$|In March 1949, as RCA {{released}} the 45, Columbia released several hundred 7 inch [...] rpm small <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> singles. This format was soon dropped {{as it became}} clear that the RCA 45 was the single of choice and the Columbia 12 inch LP would be the [...] "album" [...] of choice. The first release of the 45 came in seven colors: black 47-xxxx popular series, yellow 47-xxxx juvenile series, green (teal) 48-xxxx country series, deep red 49-xxxx classical series, bright red (cerise) 50-xxxx blues/spiritual series, light blue 51-xxxx international series, dark blue 52-xxxx light classics. All colors were soon dropped in favor of black because of production problems. However, yellow and deep red were continued until about 1952.The first 45 rpm record created for sale was [...] "PeeWee the Piccolo" [...] RCA 47-0147 pressed in yellow translucent vinyl at the Sherman Avenue plant, Indianapolis on December 7, 1948, by R.

5000|$|Red Raven Movie Records, {{introduced}} in 1956, {{were a very}} unusual type of children's picture disc. They featured a sequence of sixteen interwoven animation frames arrayed around the center and were to be played at 78 rpm on a turntable with a short spindle, on which a small sixteen-mirrored device, a variety of the praxinoscope, was placed. Gazing into this as the record played, the user saw an endlessly repeating high-quality animated cartoon scene appropriate to the song. Only the earliest Red Raven discs, which were of the coated cardboard type but reinforced with a metal rim and <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> grommet, were true picture discs. The more common later issues were larger [...] "picture label discs" [...] made of solid colored opaque, translucent or transparent plastic, with the recording in a band surrounding a very large label that carried the animation graphics. In the 1960s similar products were {{introduced in}} several countries under various brand namesâ€”Teddy in France and the Netherlands, Mamil Moviton in Italy, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of records used a standard small <b>spindle</b> <b>hole</b> slightly more than [...] " [...] in diameter. The only common exception to this is the 7-inch 45 RPM record, which was designed with a center hole slightly more than 1.5" [...] in diameter both for convenience in handling and to accommodate a very fast record-changing mechanism contained inside a correspondingly large spindle, as implemented in RCA Victor's early stand-alone [...] "45" [...] players. The spindle and any records stacked on it rotated with the turntable, so that each waiting disc was already up to speed before it dropped. Large mechanized spindle adaptors were supplied with most multi-speed automatic record changers sold in the 1950s and 1960s, {{but they were not}} as fast and efficient. The large hole also facilitates use in jukeboxes, which mechanically place the [...] "45" [...] onto a turntable with a conical spindle having a matching diameter at its base, making the placement operation easier, safer, and surer than it was with the small-diameter holes and spindles in 78 RPM jukeboxes. Most 7-inch records in the USA continue to be pressed with a large hole, requiring an adaptor to be used on standard turntables. In other territories such as Europe, 7-inch records intended for home use have standard-sized holes. Many such 7-inch records had a center which could be easily snapped out, yielding a record with a larger hole to be used in jukeboxes or certain record-stacking players; this approach was common in the United Kingdom from the 1950s until the early 1980s, with standard, solid centres becoming gradually more common. Some 7-inch singles in the early-mid-1990s had large holes also, but this was a rarity.|$|E
5000|$|Although once {{produced}} {{in a wide}} range of sizes (from less than 7 in to more than 16 in in diameter) and sometimes with glass core discs, the examples most commonly encountered today are 10 , 12 or 14 in in diameter and consist of an aluminium core disc coated with black nitrocellulose lacquer, commonly but incorrectly called [...] "acetate". The term [...] "acetate" [...] derives from the material used in examples cut before 1934, when the substrate was in fact cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate was only in use for a short while, but the name [...] "acetate" [...] for these discs persisted. Blank discs were traditionally {{produced in}} several different grades, with the best and costliest grade featuring the sturdiest core, the thickest coating and the most perfectly flawless mirror-like surfaces. These top-quality blanks were intended for cutting the master discs that, once silver-coated, would be electrodeposited with nickel in order to electroform parts used in making stampers (negative profile metal moulds) for pressing ordinary records. Lower-quality blanks were considered adequate for non-critical uses such as tests and demo discs. Lower-grade blanks were formerly made for home use by amateurs and may be very thin and flexible, may have a cardboard rather than a metal or glass base, and may have noticeably dull or slightly orange-peel-textured surfaces. In addition to the usual central <b>spindle</b> <b>hole,</b> there is traditionally at least one drive hole in the label area, meant to be engaged by a special pin that prevents the disc from slipping on the turntable during the recording process if the lathe does not have a vacuum turntable. Drive holes are often hidden by labels applied after the recording was cut, but they can usually be detected by careful inspection of the label or by holding the disc up to a light bright enough to penetrate the labels. Drive holes are no longer standard on lacquer masters, only on [...] "dubs", because the additional holes can interfere with the electroforming process and professional mastering lathes use vacuum turntables that hold the workpiece (lacquer disc) in place with suction. One pump usually provides suction for both the turntable and the chip tube that pulls away the fine string of nitrocellulose lacquer removed by the groove-cutting stylus.|$|E
