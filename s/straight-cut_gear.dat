50|$|A {{hypoid gear}} {{incorporates}} some sliding {{and can be}} considered halfway between a <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gear</b> and a worm gear. Special gear oils are required for hypoid gears because the sliding action requires effective lubrication under extreme pressure between the teeth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine of}} the VF1000R was the same cast block as in the VF1000F, {{displacing}} the same 998 cc's as the standard model, but modifications were required to mount the gear train in each head, used for driving the cams. The crankshaft was also altered, in order to accept a <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gear</b> which would drive the gear train instead of the chain system, used in the [...] "F" [...] model. Each head had 2 gears held by a carrier, which was then bolted into the respective head, driving {{each of the two}} camshafts arranged in a dual overhead camshaft arrangement for each head. Total, there were 9 gears required to transmit power from the crankshaft to all 4 camshafts. The camshafts were altered in relation to the ones found on the [...] "F" [...] model in order to provide more power. This arrangement added 7 pounds to the weight of the engine when compared to the chain driven arrangement present in the [...] "F" [...] model.|$|E
50|$|Separate four {{forward and}} one reverse speed gearbox with <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears.</b> Ratio 1 1.165, 1.725 2.5 to 1.|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} intended for engines of 750 cc to 1300 cc (45-80ci) with a Renault 4 speed transaxle, {{but had a}} 5 speed Hewland Mk.III in production, which used the entire Volkswagen magnesium alloy transaxle case in upside-down configuration, housing bespoke <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears</b> with dog-rings, and the Volkswagen differential gear set. Unlike the later Mk.IV, the Mk.III had the shifter rod {{at the end of}} the VW nose casing, so the shifting rod (pipe) from the centre shifter knob location extended to the tail end of the chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} bicycle {{drivetrain}} systems is {{closely linked to}} the history of the bicycle. Major changes in bicycle form have often been initiated or accompanied by advances in drivetrain systems. Several early drivetrains used <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears</b> that meshed directly with each other outside of the hub. Some bicycles have used a double-sided rear wheel, with different-sized sprockets on each side. To change gears, the rider would stop and dismount, remove the rear wheel and reinstall it in the reverse direction. Derailleur systems were first developed in the late 19th century, but the modern cable-operated parallelogram derailleur was invented in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Spur <b>gears</b> or <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears</b> are the {{simplest}} type of gear. They {{consist of a}} cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially. Though the teeth are not straight-sided (but usually of special form to achieve a constant drive ratio, mainly involute but less commonly cycloidal), the edge of each tooth is straight and aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. These gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts. [...] No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds.|$|R
5000|$|A {{simple but}} rugged sliding-mesh or un{{synchronized}}/non-synchronous system, where <b>straight-cut</b> spur <b>gear</b> sets spin freely, {{and must be}} synchronized by the operator matching engine revs to road speed, to avoid noisy and damaging clashing of the gears ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Jack Brabham, who {{personally}} visited the ERSA foundry in Paris to discuss a possibility to strengthen the case, the transaxle became known as [...] "ERSA Knight" [...] with an additional spur-gear set mounted in the bellhousing spacer (engine to transaxle adapter) suggested by Ron Tauranac, named for Jack Knight who designed the modification and made the <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears.</b> The height offset created by the spur gear set enabled the engine to sit lower, and became the reason why Cooper T53 was called the 'Lowline', which not only made Brabham the World Champion in 1960 but also became the precursor {{to the establishment of}} Brabham as a Formula One constructor.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{designer}} was theoretically {{free to choose}} any ratio for the gearbox and final drive, there is one additional consideration which meant that the top gear of most gearboxes was 1:1 or [...] "direct drive". This is chosen for efficiency, as {{it does not require}} any gears to transmit power and so reduces the power lost by them. This was particularly important {{in the early days of}} cars, as their <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears</b> were poorly finished, noisy and inefficient. The final drive then took this output and adjusted it in a fixed-ratio transmission arrangement that was much simpler to build. Final drive ratios of 4:1 were common, meaning that the wheels would turn at one fourth the rate they would if directly connected to the engine.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{available}} as a 4146 cc four-cylinder engine, but the engine was also {{available as a}} 5942 cc or 6218 cc six-cylinder engine. The Dover 5.9 {{is referred to as}} a 6.0 sometimes, even by Ford themselves who referred to the turbocharged 5.9 as the 660T, compared to the naturally aspirated [...] "659" [...] - while they do share dimensions, the Dover 660T was built to closer clearances which may have led to minute differences in displacement. As for the four-cylinder engines, the Dover and Dorset variations share a displacement. They can be told by the Dover's higher specifications, with an aluminium rather than a pressed steel manifold, <b>straight-cut</b> <b>gears,</b> and larger ports in the head. The engine code is also different, 2711 for the Dorset and 2722E for the Dover.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the THM400 known as a THM375 is a THM400 with a long output shaft that mates to the smaller THM350 drive shaft yoke. It can be {{identified}} by [...] "375-THM" [...] cast into the tailhousing. Internally the clutch packs originally had fewer friction plates. THM375s were found in some 1971-76 Buicks. Some [...] "Heavy Duty" [...] THM350s were also designated THM375-B. Another variant is the 3L80HD, {{often referred to as}} a Turbo 475. The 3L80HD has a <b>straight-cut</b> planetary <b>gear</b> set. There is no externally visible way to determine whether the transmission contains the <b>straight-cut</b> planetary <b>gear</b> set. The THM425 front wheel drive transmission shares almost all its internal parts with the THM400. Checker Motors Corporation Motor Company used the Chevrolet version of the THM400 for its [...] "A" [...] series taxi and Marathon models until the end of production in 1982.|$|R
5000|$|When Nash {{retired from}} drag racing, he Doug Nash Equipment & Engineering. At first, he would develop engine {{prototype}} engines for major U.S. carmakers. He later designed and manufactured {{a series of}} four- and five-speed racing transmissions, known for <b>straight-cut</b> spur <b>gears</b> and crash shifts, and {{for which he is}} now best known. These were so successful, he was approached by Chevrolet to provide his [...] "4+3" [...] transmission—a four-speed manual with automatic overdrive on the top with three gears—on the 1984 through 1988 Corvettes.|$|R
50|$|The Clyde {{was a long}} engine {{with the}} axial LP {{compressor}} in front of what was, in effect, a scaled-down Derwent engine. Accessories were grouped around the axial compressor which conveniently narrowed towards the rear. Cooling for turbines and turbine bearings came from a small diffuser on the main shaft as well as tappings from the axial and centrifugal compressors. Testing of the development engines exceeded expectations with the engine soon being rated at 4,030 eshp. One problem un-earthed during testing was that damaging resonances emanated from the <b>straight-cut</b> spur <b>gears</b> in the reduction gearbox.|$|R
50|$|A {{spiral bevel}} gear is a bevel gear with helical teeth. The main {{application}} of this is in a vehicle differential, where the direction of drive from the drive shaft must be turned 90 degrees to drive the wheels. The helical design produces less vibration and noise than conventional <b>straight-cut</b> or spur-cut <b>gear</b> with straight teeth.|$|R
50|$|All MGBs from 1962 to 1967 used a four-speed {{manual gearbox}} with a non-synchromesh, <b>straight-cut</b> first <b>gear.</b> Optional {{overdrive}} was available. This gearbox {{was based on}} that used in the MGA with some minor upgrades {{to cope with the}} additional output of the larger MGB engine. In 1968 the early gearbox was replaced by a full synchromesh unit based on the MGC gearbox. This unit was designed to handle the 150net bhp of the three-litre engine of the MGC and was thus over-engineered when mated with the standard MGB B-Series engine. The same transmission was used in the 3.5-litre V8 version of the MGB-GT-V8. An automatic three-speed transmission was also offered as a factory option, but was unpopular.|$|R
5000|$|The now {{ubiquitous}} constant-mesh gearboxes, {{which can}} include non-synchronised, or synchronized/synchromesh systems, where typically diagonal cut helical (or sometimes either <b>straight-cut,</b> or double-helical) <b>gear</b> sets are constantly [...] "meshed" [...] together, {{and a dog}} clutch is used for changing gears. On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or [...] "synchro-rings" [...] are used {{in addition to the}} dog clutch to closely match the rotational speeds of {{the two sides of the}} (declutched) transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.|$|R
50|$|On October 13, 2015 Toyota {{made public}} {{details of the}} Fourth Generation Hybrid Synergy Drive to be {{introduced}} in the 2016 model year. The transaxle and traction motor have been redesigned, delivering a reduction in their combined weight. The traction motor itself is considerably more compact and gains a better power-to-weight ratio. Notably there is a 20 percent reduction in mechanical losses due to friction compared to the previous model. The Motor Speed Reduction Device (a second planetary gear set found only in the Third Generation P410 and P510 transaxles), and which connects the traction motor directly to the Power Split Device, and thereafter to the wheels, has been replaced with parallel gears on the Fourth Generation P610 transaxle. The 2012- Prius c retains the P510 transaxle. The P610 transaxle employs helical gears rather than the <b>straight-cut</b> spur <b>gears</b> employed in the earlier transaxles, and which run more smoothly and quietly, while also accommodating higher mechanical loads.|$|R
