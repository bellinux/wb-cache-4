5|$|Filming {{had begun}} by August1926, when several scenes were {{shot in a}} cave that had been {{excavated}} for the production on Karang Hill. Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen to stage directions. Afterwards they began rehearsing each scene at least twice, with Kartabrata <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> cameraman and giving directions.|$|E
5|$|The gandingan {{is usually}} played while <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> {{instrument}} with the gandingan player holding two wooden mallets. The mallets, called balu, are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber {{at one end}} and are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung. The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound.|$|E

25|$|During the play-the-ball it is {{customary}} for {{a player}} from the defending team to stand {{directly in front of}} the player playing the ball, called the marker. If no marker is present, the tackled player may tap the ball on his boot to start the next play, instead of the normally required play-the-ball. As the tap is faster to perform than the play-the-ball, giving great advantage to the attack, there is almost always a marker. Usually the person who tackled the player becomes a marker because he is the closest to the tackled player. There may be a maximum of two markers for each play-the-ball, the second <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> first.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Cushing {{was cast}} in Star Wars in the {{supporting}} part of Grand Moff Tarkin. Like {{all of the other}} actors portraying Galactic Imperial officers, he was presented with ill-fitting riding boots, which pinched his feet so much that he was given permission by director George Lucas to play the role wearing his slippers. As a result, the camera operators filmed him throughout the film only from the knees up, or else <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> table of the Death Star conference room set. This costuming discomfort aside, Cushing contrasted sharply with co-star Alec Guinness in that he enjoyed his experience on the film, appreciated the renewed interest in his work from young fans and only regretted that he could not appear in the sequels.|$|E
25|$|Another legend {{is about}} the mysterious {{disappearance}} of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (an incarnation of Krishna according to the Bhavishya Purana). He established Gaudiya Vaishnavism and also known to have composed the Jagannath Astakam. He lived in Puri {{for many years and}} sang bhajans (devotional songs) and led sankirtan processions in front of Jagannath during his Chandan Yatra and Ratha Yatra, along with many devotees. It is also said that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used to go into a rapturous mood watching the god's love play and dance with joy and also fainted many times due to emotion. Daily, he prayed to Jagannath, <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> garudastamba (Pillar of Garuda) with tears flowing down his eyes. With permission of the king, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu once undertook the task of cleaning the Gundicha temple premises a day before the Ratha yatra (this tradition is followed even to this day by the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism). It is mentioned that once Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, unnoticed by his attendants, walked towards the Gundicha Temple and was last seen entering the Manikotha, thereafter he was never seen again. This disappearance has remained an unexplained mystery as none of the books written on him have recorded this event. It is believed that he merged with Jagannath at the temple.|$|E

500|$|Adolph George [...] "Germany" [...] Schulz (April 19, 1883 – April 14, 1951) was an All-American American {{football}} {{center for}} the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1904 to 1905 and from 1907 to 1908. While playing at Michigan, Schulz is credited with having invented the spiral snap and with developing the practice of <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> defensive line. [...] As the first lineman to play {{in back of the}} line on defense, he is credited as football's first linebacker.|$|E
500|$|Wigan again {{dominated}} {{play after}} the half-time interval and equalised in the 53rdminute. [...] Wigan's de Zeeuw crossed {{the ball from}} a wide position and Simon Haworth flicked it up and then hit a shot from six yards out past Bartram and into the net, to score what The Independent described as [...] "one of Wembley's great goals". [...] In the 65thminute, de Zeeuw's header was cleared off the line by Gillingham's Nicky Southall, {{who appeared to be}} <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> goal line. [...] Wigan's supporters believed that the ball had in fact crossed the line and entered the goal, but the assistant referee ruled otherwise. [...] Gillingham had several chances on goal in the latter stages of the game, but Wigan goalkeeper Derek Stillie prevented any further goalscoring. [...] Shortly {{before the end of the}} game Wigan defender Kevin Sharp, who had earlier been cautioned for dissent, was sent off for a foul on Southall, reducing his team to ten men. [...] The match remained deadlocked at 1–1 after 90minutes and therefore went into a 30-minute period of extra time.|$|E
500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E
500|$|Desperate for a break, the overworked band {{began to}} argue and {{tensions}} formed. Raynor, {{who was at}} the center of this drama, had been commenting of his desire to attend college for years, and had been taking homework out with him on tour to try and complete his high school diploma. The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore, described as [...] "a winter version of the Warped Tour." [...] Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion. Raynor would depart following SnoCore, and the ensemble recruited Travis Barker, drummer for the opening ska punk group The Aquabats, to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who had not had time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. [...] "I remember Travis rehearsing backstage for an hour or two, then playing with them during sound-check," [...] said Adam Deibert of the Aquabats. [...] "A few of us were <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> stage and vividly remember the feeling of this is the new Blink. We should have looked for a new drummer right then because it was obvious what band he belonged in." [...] Shortly thereafter, the band embarked on a short minitour along the western coast, most notably Southern California, the band's favorite place to play. The tour ended with the band headlining a sold-out show at the Palladium in Hollywood, California, where the band had dreamed of performing at for years. [...] Raynor returned for the band's Palladium performance, but the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues and a [...] "tragic loss," [...] Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances.|$|E

2500|$|Legends Suite {{seats are}} also {{separate}} from the other lower bowl seating and are vigorously patrolled by stadium security, with the divider being described as a [...] "concrete moat." [...] Fans {{who do not have}} tickets within this premium section in the front rows are not allowed in the section. This includes <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> dugouts during batting practice and to seek autographs. The least expensive seats, the bleachers, initially left many fans disappointed, as the indoor club seating area in center field obstructed the views from bleacher seats on both sides in sections 201 and 239. These severely obstructed sections would ultimately be removed during the 2016-2017 off-season in favor of outdoor bars and patio areas complete with standing terraces accessible to all ticket holders, in addition to replacing the seating on top of the center field club with standing terraces, drastically reducing the number of obstructed views from center field in the process.|$|E
2500|$|Smart {{worked as}} a miner before {{becoming}} a professional county cricketer. [...] He played Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire from 1910 to 1912, and made his first-class cricket debut for Warwickshire in 1919, playing alongside his brother Cyril from 1920 to 1922. [...] He became a regular fixture in the Warwickshire side from 1920, playing 238 games in all. [...] He began as an attacking batsman and occasional off break bowler, but became the team's wicket-keeper after the retirement of Tiger Smith in 1930, catching 317 victims while <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> stumps and stumping 105 (in addition to 77 catches as an outfielder). [...] He made 79 dismissals in 1932, a then county record which was bettered by Geoff Humpage in 1985. [...] He scored a total of 3,425 runs in 340 innings, at the relatively low batting average of 11.53, including 9 half-centuries (four in 1923), and a high score of 68 not out against Worcestershire in 1922. [...] He took 22 wickets at a bowling average of 57.36, with best bowling of 3/31 against Northamptonshire in 1922.|$|E
2500|$|The umbraculum (Latin {{form for}} little {{umbrella}}) is a canopy or umbrella (consisting of alternating {{red and gold}} stripes, the traditional colours {{of the city of}} Rome and so, until 1808, of the papacy) whose original function was quite simply to provide shade. As it was traditionally a royal prerogative to walk beneath a canopy, Pope Alexander VI began using the umbraculum to symbolise the temporal powers of the Papacy; it was formerly carried by a man <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Pope. [...] It featured in the former arms of the Papal States. The practice of walking with the umbraculum has been discontinued, although it continues to feature in ecclesiastical heraldry and remains the insigne of a basilica, usually displayed {{to the right of the}} main altar. It is sometimes carried in processions as a sign of a basilica's dignity. [...] It also currently features in the Coat of arms of the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church: because the Camerlengo administers the property of the Holy See during a sede vacante, there isn't any papal insignia when there is not a Pope in office, and the umbraculum represents the powers of Holy See, which did not cease with Pope's death, since they are entrusted to the Church itself.

A Derek Grant goal in the first period for the Predators was overturned on review, despite such a play not being reviewable by NHL rules, after the NHL declared that game referee Ghislain Hebert, who was <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> net when the goal was scored, [...] "was in the process of blowing his whistle to stop play when Miller covered the puck with his blocker before the puck crossed the goal line." [...] Continuing their swing through Canada on January 19 in Calgary, the Predators jumped to a 4–0 lead – thanks to Ellis (two goals), Forsberg and Neal – {{at the beginning of the}} third period. Saros made 32 saves and held off a three-goal rally in the final four minutes of the game to beat the Flames 4–3. The next night in Edmonton, Ardvisson and Ellis scored for the Predators, while goals by Matt Hendricks and Milan Lucic of the Oilers sent the contest into overtime. Ellis and Neal scored in shootout to give the Predators a 3–2 victory over the Oilers. Back in the United States on January 22 to conclude their five-game road trip, the Predators scored four unanswered goals – thanks to Forsberg (two), Johansen and Neal – to overcome a two-goal deficit, defeat the Minnesota Wild 4–2 and give head coach Peter Laviolette his 500th career victory.|$|E
2500|$|Six {{scenes from}} the life of Jesus {{continue}} on the Feasts tier to the right from the central axis of the iconostasis. These icons are the most eventful paintings of the whole icon screen. The first image, following the chronology, is the Nativity of Jesus, celebrated {{on the first day of}} Christmas, on [...] December 25. In the center of the painting the infant Jesus is resting in a manger. He holds a blue orb in his right hand. Joseph and Mary are <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> baby. There are seven shepherds around the manger, each of them coming to express their veneration for the divine baby. Three angels praise the infant Redeemer on the top of the icon. The next image depicts the baptism of Christ, celebrated on January 6 as Epiphany. Jesus is standing in the River Jordan in front of John the Baptist. John pours water upon Christ's head from a shell, while he prays to his Father. The Holy Spirit as a white dove appears in the background of the painting, above three ladies who are watching the baptism. The third icon illustrates the transfiguration of Jesus, celebrated on August 6. Christ is metamorphosed and becomes radiant upon a mountain in front of three of his disciples: Peter, James and John. On the icon Moses appears on Jesus' right, while Elijah is on his left. The three frightened apostles are lying in front of them. The next icon shows the entry into Jerusalem, which is celebrated on Palm Sunday, a week before Easter Sunday. Jesus arrives in Jerusalem on a donkey, which symbolizes his coming in peace rather than as a triumphal king arriving on a horse. The crowd scatters flowers in front of Christ. The next icon is the Ascension of Christ, which also appears on the central axis of the iconostasis between the third and fourth tiers. The last painting on the tier depicts the descent of the Holy Spirit, the feast of Pentecost. The Holy Spirit is rendered as a white dove on the icon, and flames appear above each apostle to encourage them. Mary is in the center of the composition, surrounded by 11 apostles - Judas is not present.|$|E
