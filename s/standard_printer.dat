50|$|Single-strike and Multi-strike ribbons were {{an attempt}} to address issues in the ribbon's ink quality. <b>Standard</b> <b>printer</b> ribbons used the same {{principles}} as typewriter ribbons. The printer would be at its darkest with a newly installed ribbon cartridge, but would gradually grow fainter with each successive printout. The variation in darkness over the ribbon cartridge's lifetime prompted the introduction of alternative ribbon formulations. Single-strike ribbons used a carbon-like substance in typewriter ribbons transfer. As the ribbon was only usable for a single loop (rated in terms of 'character count'), the blackness was of consistent, outstanding darkness.

They often could not detect the file format that was being sent to the printer and thus could not automatically and correctly convert the data stream. Additionally, data conversion was performed on individual workstations rather than a central server.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{research}} aims at developing electrical interconnection {{technologies for}} the microelectronics industry. On the one hand, a substrate is needed with a conductive pattern. Currently, this is mostly done by an etching technology, {{which means a}} lot of expensive metal is wasted. In this sense an additive alternative would be attractive, which is why I’m looking into the possibilities of printing techniques, including inkjet-, flexographic, gravure and offsetprinting. It would be convenient to use <b>standard</b> <b>printers,</b> considering the widespread use and therefore the available expertise in the conventional printing industry. On the other hand, components need to be interconnected to the patterned substrate. This assembly is usually done by soldering, but for various reasons it would be beneficial to use conductive adhesives. Several techniques are to be considered, including a technique patented at the research lab. The focus is on fine-pitch interconnection {{and the use of}} flexible substrates.

40|$|Soft {{proofing}} is {{a solution}} for print buyers and printers who want to decrease production cost and cycle time. When print buyers are increasingly specifying brightened papers, {{the use of the}} <b>standard</b> <b>printer</b> ICC profile, e. g., SWOP 3 and GRACoL 2006, as the source color space in the ICC-based color proofing workflow, no longer suffice. This is because the proof looks yellowish in comparison to the brightened print with a bluish white point that print buyers desire. To overcome the mismatch between the soft proof and the brightened print, this research builds a number of source ICC profiles, including profiles built using the substrate-corrected colorimetric aims (SCCA), and profiles built using full dataset. By conducting psychometric tests in a soft proofing environment, the results indicate that (1) the soft proof to brightened print match depends on the source ICC profile; (2) source ICC profiles, built from a fully characterized dataset or the substrate-corrected dataset, improve color match between the soft proof and the brightened print; and (3) the degree of color match between the soft proof and the print is image-dependent...|$|E
40|$|Sketching, {{although}} {{deceptively simple}} and seemingly primitive, {{is a powerful}} paradigm for designing and understanding many types of engineering systems. Many problem domains, such as designing electrical circuits, developing flow charts, and modeling simple mechanical devices, rely heavily {{on the ability to}} produce sketches efficiently in order to bring out the most salient features. Engineers working in these domains usually rely on pen and paper to generate their design sketches. They do this because more advanced technologies (such as notebook computers) are often unavailable, hard to learn, or cumbersome. It is important for engineers to collaborate with their colleagues while working on their sketches. Unfortunately, collaboration on sketches that exist only as pen and paper often proves to be tedious, requiring a minimum of a fax machine and scanner. Engineers could benefit from a more efficient means of collaboration when dealing with pen and paper sketches. The technology exists to improve the current situation and make pen and paper sketches a more effective medium for collaborative design. This thesis presents an implementation of a system that achieves three goals. First, the system allows two users to collaborate on the production of a sketch {{in much the same way}} they would collaborate when composing a document (with one user composing a sketch, then accepting or rejecting the changes of his collaborator). (cont.) Second, it allows users to watch a collaborator's additions play in real time, like watching a movie. And finally, it links the sketch recognition and simulation software developed by the Design Rationale Group at MIT with a simple pen and paper interface, allowing engineers to run simulations of their design sketches. These goals are achieved by using a commercial pen produced by the Anoto Group that is capable of storing the strokes it draws. In essence, the user creates both a hard and soft copy of the sketch simultaneously, and can share the soft copy with any collaborator. Using this model of production, sketches can be collaboratively generated, edited, and reviewed quickly and easily, all using only a pen, paper, and a <b>standard</b> <b>printer.</b> by Jesse Michael Smithnosky.

40|$|Ubiquitous systems {{imagined}} by Mark Weiser {{are emerging}} {{thanks to the}} development of embedded systems and plug-n-play protocols like the Universal Plug aNd Play (UPnP), the Intelligent Grouping and Resource Sharing (IGRS), the Device Pro le for Web Services (DPWS) and Apple Bonjour. Such protocols follow the service oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm and allow an automatic device and service discovery in a home network. Once devices are connected to the local network, applications deployed for example on a smart phone, a PC or a home gateway, discover the plug-n-play devices and act as control points. The aim of such applications is to orchestrate the interactions between the devices such as lights, TVs and printers, and their corresponding hosted services to accomplish a specific human daily task like printing a document or dimming a light. Devices supporting a plug-n-play protocol announce their hosted services each in its own description format and data content. Even similar devices supporting the same services represent their capabilities in a different representation format and content. Such heterogeneity along with the protocols layers diversity, prevent applications to use any available equivalent device on the network to accomplish a specific task. For instance, a UPnP printing application cannot interacts with an available DPWS printer on the network to print a document. Designing applications to support multiple protocols is time consuming since developers must implement the interaction with each device pro le and its own data description. Additionally, the deployed application must use multiple protocols stacks to interact with the device. More over, application vendors and telecoms operators need to orchestrate devices through a common application layer, independently from the protocol layers and the device description. To accomplish interoperability between plug-n-play devices and applications, we propose a generic approach which consists in automatically generating proxies based on an ontology alignment. The alignment contains the correspondences between two equivalent devices descriptions. Such correspondences actually represent the proxy behaviour which is used to provide interoperability between an application and a plug and play device. For instance, the generated proxy will announce itself on the network as a UPnP <b>standard</b> <b>printer</b> and will control the DPWS printer. Consequently, the UPnP printing application will interact transparently with the generated proxy which adapts and transfers the invocations to the real DPWS printer. We implemented a prototype as a proof of concept that we evaluated on several real UPnP and DPWS equivalent devices. Les protocoles plug-and-play couplés avec les architectures logicielles rendent nos maisons ubiquitaires. Les équipements domestiques qui supportent ces protocoles peuvent être détectés automatiquement, configurés et invoqués pour une tâche donnée. Actuellement, plusieurs protocoles coexistent dans la maison, mais les interactions entre les dispositifs ne peuvent pas être mises en action à moins que les appareils supportent le même protocole. En plus, les applications qui orchestrent ces dispositifs doivent connaître à l'avance les noms des services et dispositifs. Or, chaque protocole définit un profil standard par type d'appareil. Par conséquent, deux appareils ayant le même type et les mêmes fonctions mais qui supportent un protocole différent publient des interfaces qui sont souvent sémantiquement équivalentes mais syntaxiquement différentes. Ceci limite alors les applications à interagir avec un service similaire. Dans ce travail, nous présentons une méthode qui se base sur l'alignement d'ontologie et la génération automatique de mandataire pour parvenir à une adaptation dynamique de services...|$|E
