5|$|Munir Sheikh, Canada's Chief <b>Statistician</b> {{appointed}} on Harper's advice, resigned on July 21, 2010, {{in protest}} of the government's change in policy. Ivan Fellegi, the former Chief <b>Statistician</b> of Canada, criticized the government's decision, saying {{that those who are}} most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are least likely to respond to a voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.|$|E
5|$|Association with Koren – in America, Speyer was {{friendly}} with John Koren, an American <b>statistician</b> {{who represented the}} United States on the International Prisons Commission. In 1916, Speyer had funded a fact-finding trip by Koren to Europe, during which Koren visited Germany and met Speyer's sister and friends. Although the committee considered the trip strange, they drew no inference of disloyalty from the events.|$|E

40|$|In {{this text}} we analyze the {{situation}} of <b>statisticians</b> vis-à-vis other university degree holders with respect to some characteristics in the labor market, using indicators such as salary, formal labor market links, economic sector of employment, position in the occupation and spatial distribution among the Brazilian states. Female <b>statisticians</b> seem to fare better than their male counterpart {{when compared to other}} graduates with respect to salaries. The gender gap is smaller for <b>statisticians</b> than for all graduates considered together. But in general when considering the insertion in the labor market, Brazilian <b>statisticians</b> of both sexes fare better than other university graduates: the proportion of <b>Statisticians</b> in informal jobs is proportionally smaller. On the other hand, the proportion of <b>statisticians</b> holding positions that do not require a university degree is slightly higher than that of all graduates...|$|R

5|$|Carlsen won the {{category}} 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world's highest-rated player at the time. He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, {{this was one}} of the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002. Chess <b>statistician</b> Jeff Sonas has declared it one of the 20 best tournament performances of all time, and the best chess performance of all time by a teenager.|$|E
5|$|Coveleski had 216 {{wins and}} 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 {{complete}} games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, {{and it was}} not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball <b>statistician</b> Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Friedman {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II. Friedman believed the United States should enter the war. In 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University (headed by W. Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he {{spent the rest of}} World War II working as a mathematical <b>statistician,</b> focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments.|$|E
50|$|Mathematicians and <b>statisticians</b> {{often work}} in a {{department}} of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).

40|$|The new {{economic}} era {{we live in}} {{has resulted in a}} variety of new work situations for <b>statisticians.</b> Many are asked {{to be a member of}} a team that involves several different functions of the organization. <b>Statisticians</b> are also asked to work with groups in nontechnical areas. These groups tend to have less experience with data-based problem solving methods but, nonetheless, are working on problems critical to the success of the organization. Many <b>statisticians</b> have the opportunity to work with mid-and upper-level managers. All of these opportunities that require new skills and methods that can help <b>statisticians</b> become more effective are discussed. It is also shown how these new skills have much in common with statistical thinking...|$|R

5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but {{the evidence}} was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of meta-analysis, <b>statistician</b> Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of the}} medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The {{large number}} of goals created a {{confusion}} over the correct scoreline. At {{the end of the}} match, the scoreboard at the stadium showed 32–0 and Thompson was credited with 14 goals. After the <b>statistician</b> did a recount, the 31–0 scoreline was announced, and Thompson's total goals count was reduced to 13. After the match, FIFA went on to release the official statistics after receiving the official report from the referee and match officials, which confirmed the 31–0 scoreline and Thompson's 13 goals.|$|E
40|$|Graphs {{have long}} been of {{interest}} in telecommunications and social network analysis, and they are now receiving increasing attention from <b>statisticians</b> working in other areas, particularly in biostatistics. Most of the visualization software available for working with graphs has come from outside statistics and has not included the kind of interaction that <b>statisticians</b> have come to expect. At the same time, most of the exploratory visualization software available to <b>statisticians</b> has made no provision for the special structure of graphs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Modern {{agricultural}} research {{requires a lot}} of statistics. Unfortunately, most up-todate statistical methods need advanced knowledge, often out of reach for {{agricultural research}}ers. Thus, efficient communication between researchers and <b>statisticians</b> is important for the development of agricultural knowledge. Many agricultural researchers claim that communication with <b>statisticians</b> is difficult. On the other hand, many <b>statisticians</b> claim that communication with agricultural researchers is not easy either. This being true, such poor communication can be a barrier to efficient agricultural research. The aim of this research is to study this phenomenon. Do agricultural researchers and <b>statisticians</b> see problems in their communication? What kinds of problems are they? I will try to answer these questions based on a study among scientists representing both groups...|$|R

5|$|Using MVP voting results, {{historical}} {{surveys and}} sabermetric analysis, historian Bill Deane projected in 1989 that Pierce {{would have won}} the American League Cy Young Award in 1953 and 1956 {{if it had been}} given at the time; the award was not created until 1956 (when the National League's Don Newcombe won the award by unanimous vote), and awards were not given for both leagues until 1967. In 1988, baseball historian and <b>statistician</b> Bill James chose Pierce as having had the tenth greatest career value among left-handers, ahead of six Hall of Famers.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Rutgers, Friedman was offered two {{scholarships}} to do graduate work—one in mathematics at Brown University {{and the other}} in economics at the University of Chicago. Friedman chose the latter, thus earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, and Henry Simons. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had a fellowship at Columbia University, where he studied statistics with renowned <b>statistician</b> and economist Harold Hotelling. He was back in Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz, who was then working on Theory and Measurement of Demand. That year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W. Allen Wallis.|$|E

5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial <b>statistician</b> at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Statistician</b> Jeff Sonas, in {{examining}} data from 266,000games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's Elo rating advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 {{if it is}} better than +390, or −460 if it is worse than −460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in rapid games than in games at a slower ("classical") time control. In the 462 games played at the 2009 World Blitz Chess Championship, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L 34.63).|$|E
