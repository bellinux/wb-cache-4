40|$|ABSTRACT: Of special {{interest}} {{within the field}} of avalanche research and avalanche warning are properties related to <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> type and <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size at the surface. In continental and intermountain avalanche climates weak layers or interfaces are the main cause of avalanches. Knowledge about such weak layers helps to increase the precision of avalanche forecasting. Some of these potential weak layers form on the snow surface and are preserved until burial. Optical satellite sensors measure reflected sunlight at different wavelengths. The near-infrared region is sensitive to the optical grain size of the snow. Due to the distinct size and shape characteristics of potential weak layers such as, for example, surface hoar, their reflectance is quite different from new snow in general. If the weather permits optical observations it should, therefore, be possible to detect such layers by remote sensing. We present the results of a pilot study where in situ measured surface <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> characteristics are compared to <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> characteristics as derived from multispectral data from the MODIS satellite sensor. The pilot study showed that parallel in situ snow measurements and snow analyses exploiting data from MODIS are possible for the selected test sites in Norway. The study aims at establishing a relationship between the satellite-observed <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size index (SGS) variable and the <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size and shape as measured in the field.

40|$|In July 2012, extreme surface melt events {{occurred}} on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Generally, surface melt is physically controlled by the surface energy balance, where net shortwave radiant flux is {{the main energy source}} for melt during summer. Although (optically equivalent) <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile affects near-infrared albedo and in turn net shortwave radiant flux, its qualitative impacts on the surface melt events is unclear. In the present study we investigated effects of <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile on the surface melt event observed at the site SIGMA-A (78 ° 03 ’N, 67 ° 38 ’W, 1, 490 m a. s. l.), which locates on northwest part of GrIS, during 30 June to 10 July 2012 through numerical studies with a physically based 1 -D snowpack model SMAP. Observed snow physical state at SIGMA-A during 30 June to 13 July is indicated in Figure 1 in terms of <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> shape profile. As shown in this figure, top melt form layers (depicted with red color) were expanded day by day as a result of surface melt during the period. First of all, we simulated temporal evolution of physical states of near-surface snowpack at SIGMA-A during 30 June to 10 July 2012 by forcing in-situ meteorological data obtained at SIGMA-A. The depth of simulated snow layer, which was characterized by a thick bottom ice formation, was 88 cm on 30 June. The initial states of snowpack were given from the snow pit observation counducted on 30 June 2012, 16 : 45 UTC. It was found that the simulated shortwave albedo (ctrl in Figure 2) agreed well with measurements (R 2 = 0. 820, root mean square error = 0. 019, and mean error = 0. 008). Next, we performed two sensitivity tests with SMAP, where initial <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile was modulated in order to assess its impacts on the surface energy balance. In these tests we replaced the original <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile for the top 21 cm melt form layers depicted in Figure 1 (average <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size was 0. 6 mm) with smaller (test 1) and larger profiles (test 2). In test 1 top 21 cm <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size was equally set to be 0. 02 mm, which is almost the minimum value for new snow. On the other hand, in test 2, 1. 0 mm, which is the typical maximum value for melt form observed in seasonal snowpack in Japan, was arranged in the top 21 cm layers. Figure 2 illustrates simulated shortwave albedos for test 1 and test 2 cases comparing against ctrl case. Obviously, simulated shortwave albedo for test 1 is higher than that for ctrl continuously, while that for test 2 was kept smaller than that for ctrl. Comparing simulated results for test 1 and test 2 we could know how surface energy balance could be varied with <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size profile. Obtained average differences in simulated shortwave albedo and net shortwave radiant flux between test 1 and test 2 were 0. 06 and 21. 8 W/m 2, respectively.

However, the conversion from microwave emission to snow temperature is not simple and strongly depends on the emissivity through snow properties. This difficulty in predicting the snow property profile for Antarctic conditions is the main bottleneck in the retrieval of accurate climate information from microwave radiometers. We attempt to explain the vertically polarized emissivity at 19. 3 and 37 GHz derived from brightness temperatures acquired by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and physical temperature from the ERA- 40 re-analysis. In Antarctica the snow emissivities at 19. 3 and 37 GHz are nearly equal, although a decrease with frequency is expected.

50|$|A {{powder snow}} {{avalanche}} {{is a type}} of avalanche where the <b>snow</b> <b>grains</b> are largely or wholly suspended by fluid turbulence. They are particle-laden gravity currents and closely related to turbidity currents, pyroclastic flows from volcanoes and dust storms in the desert. The turbulence is typically generated by the forward motion of the current along the lower boundary of the domain, the motion being in turn driven by the action of gravity on the density difference between the particle-fluid mixture and the ambient fluid. The ambient fluid is generally of similar composition to (and miscible with) the interstitial fluid, and is water for turbidity currents and air for avalanches. These flows are non-conservative in that they may exchange particles at the lower boundary by deposition or suspension, and may exchange fluid with the ambient by entrainment or detrainment. Such flows dissipate when the turbulence can no longer hold the particles in suspension and they are deposited on the lower boundary. When the turbulence is strong enough to suspend new material from the bed or the underlying dense flow then current is said to be auto-suspending. Particle concentrations in the suspension cloud are usually sufficiently low (0.1--7\,\% by volume) that particle-particle interactions play a small or negligible role in maintaining the suspension. In powder snow avalanches, even at these low concentrations, the extra density of the suspended particles is large relative to that of air, so the Boussinesq approximation, where density differences are considered negligible in inertia terms, is invalid, so that the <b>snow</b> <b>grains</b> carry most of the flows momentum. This is in contrast to turbidity currents and laboratory experiments in water where the extra inertia of the particles can usually be neglected. Nonetheless, due to the extreme difficulty in estimating particle concentrations in natural flows there remains considerable uncertainty --- and debate --- concerning the particle loading in large submarine turbidity currents and the validity of the Boussinesq approximation.|$|E

The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time.

Photomacrography was used to show both the surface hoar crystal and the substrate <b>snow</b> <b>grains.</b> These results encourage continued observation and further studies to better understand processes on and within the snowpack. This project continues to suggest that the snow substrate may have an influence on surface hoar morphology...|$|E
40|$|An {{ultimate}} goal of the climate change, snow science, and hydrology communities is to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) from satellite measurements. Seasonal SWE is highly sensitive to climate change and provides fresh water {{for much of the}} world population. Snowmelt from mountainous regions represents the dominant water source for 60 million people in the United States and over one billion people globally. Determination of <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> sizes comprising mountain snowpack is critical for predicting snow meltwater runoff, understanding physical properties and radiation balance, and providing necessary input for interpreting satellite measurements. Both microwave emission and radar backscatter from the snow are dominated by the <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size stratigraphy. As a result, retrieval algorithms for measuring snow water equivalents from orbiting satellites is largely hindered by inadequate knowledge of grain size...|$|R
40|$|The {{passive solar}} remote sensing of cloud {{properties}} over highly reflecting ground is challenging, mostly {{due to the}} low contrast between the cloud reflectivity {{and that of the}} underlying surfaces (sea ice and snow). Uncertainties in the retrieved cloud optical thickness τ and cloud droplet effective radius r eff,[*]C may arise from uncertainties in the assumed spectral surface albedo, which is mainly determined by the generally unknown effective <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size r eff,[*]S. Therefore, in a first step the effects of the assumed <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size are systematically quantified for the conventional bispectral retrieval technique of τ and r eff,[*]C for liquid water clouds. In general, the impact of uncertainties of r eff,[*]S is largest for small <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> sizes. While the uncertainties of retrieved τ are independent of the cloud optical thickness and solar zenith angle, the bias of retrieved r eff,[*]C increases for optically thin clouds and high Sun. The largest deviations between the retrieved and true original values are found with 83  % for τ and 62  % for r eff,[*]C. In {{the second part of the}} paper a retrieval method is presented that simultaneously derives all three parameters (τ, r eff,[*]C, r eff,[*]S) and therefore accounts for changes in the <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size. Ratios of spectral cloud reflectivity measurements at the three wavelengths λ 1 [*]=[*] 1040  nm (sensitive to r eff,[*]S), λ 2 [*]=[*] 1650  nm (sensitive to τ), and λ 3 [*]=[*] 2100  nm (sensitive to r eff,[*]C) are combined in a trispectral retrieval algorithm. In a feasibility study, spectral cloud reflectivity measurements collected by the Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation measurement sysTem (SMART) during the research campaign Vertical Distribution of Ice in Arctic Mixed-Phase Clouds (VERDI, April/May 2012) were used to test the retrieval procedure. Two cases of observations above the Canadian Beaufort Sea, one with dense snow-covered sea ice and another with a distinct snow-covered sea ice edge are analysed. The retrieved values of τ, r eff,[*]C, and r eff,[*]S show a continuous transition of cloud properties across snow-covered sea ice and open water and are consistent with estimates based on satellite data. It is shown that the uncertainties of the trispectral retrieval increase for high values of τ, and low r eff,[*]S but nevertheless allow the effective <b>snow</b> <b>grain</b> size in cloud-covered areas to be estimated...|$|R
