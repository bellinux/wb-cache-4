5|$|Development {{started in}} 2007 after Lundgren read a news report {{about a group}} of girls being smuggled into the United States from Mexico. The girls were left in a vehicle along the border and, trapped inside, they all died of heat stroke and <b>suffocation.</b> Skin Trade had a $9 million {{production}} budget, and was shot over 50 days in Canada and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only {{speaking}} to Olivia, warning {{that she is the}} only one that can stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from <b>suffocation</b> after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} tour in December 2005, Martin could not perform {{with the band}} due to military conscription issues and was shortly substituted by Richard Gulczynski, but joined again in February 2006. During the year, Decapitated toured with American bands <b>Suffocation,</b> Six Feet Under, Fear Factory, and others. In June and July 2007, Decapitated played with Cephalic Carnage {{and others in the}} Summer Slaughter trek across the US. Once the tour ended, Martin departed from Decapitated to live with his family and to move to California.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join {{the attack and}} overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch escapes from his own damaged aircraft, wearing an AMP suit and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from <b>suffocation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid <b>suffocation.</b> The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E
5|$|Irene Garza (1934 – April 1960) was a South Texas {{teacher and}} beauty queen whose death {{has been the}} subject of {{investigation}} for several decades. Garza was last seen alive on April 16, 1960, when she went to confession at a church in McAllen, Texas. She was reported missing the following morning. Following the largest volunteer search to that date in the Rio Grande Valley, Garza's body was discovered in a canal on April 21. An autopsy concluded that she had been sexually assaulted before being killed; the cause of death was <b>suffocation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, <b>suffocation,</b> ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Since their formation, Defeated Sanity has {{released}} four studio albums: Prelude to the Tragedy(2004), and Psalms of the Moribund(2007), both through the United Kingdom-based label Grindethic Records; and Chapters of Repugnance(2010) and Passages into Deformity(2013) through Willowtip Records. Defeated Sanity also released numerous promos, demos and splits. Influenced by bands such as Cannibal Corpse and <b>Suffocation,</b> their music is mostly {{based on the}} American death metal style. On 2 May 2009, the band announced their signing to Willowtip Records.|$|E
5|$|At these sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively. Concentrations of {{aluminium}} higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause <b>suffocation</b> of fish by accumulating in their gills. The toxicity of aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5. There were also 0.65, 0.81, and 1.84 parts per million of iron in these sites, and 0.96, 1.15, 0.03, and 2.65 parts per million of manganese. There were 91.37, 114.27, and 274.1 milligrams per liter of sulfates {{in the waters of}} Nescopeck at these sites.|$|E
5|$|Autopsies showed {{all three}} victims had water in their lungs, proving {{they had been}} thrown into the water while still alive. Michelleidentified as the second body foundhad freed one hand from her bonds before she drowned. The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around their necks with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either <b>suffocation</b> or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and <b>suffocation),</b> though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal {{back into the}} water. Shark finning {{involves}} removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from <b>suffocation</b> or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E
5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from <b>suffocation</b> or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from <b>suffocation.</b> Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent <b>suffocation.</b> Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is <b>suffocation</b> by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from <b>suffocation</b> and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
5|$|While {{anchored}} off the Galápagos, Beebe and {{his crew}} noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, {{and set out to}} investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption, and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding it was filled with noxious gases, and narrowly avoided <b>suffocation</b> before staggering away from it. Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava, or drawing too close to it in an attempt to scavenge other animals that had died.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing <b>suffocation.</b> Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in <b>suffocation</b> by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, <b>suffocation</b> and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
25|$|There's {{no fear of}} <b>suffocation</b> in the old bark hut.|$|E
25|$|According to this account, {{the subject}} {{attempts}} to breathe deeply and finds herself {{unable to do}} so, creating a sensation of resistance, which the threat-activated vigilance system interprets as an unearthly being sitting on her chest, threatening <b>suffocation.</b> The sensation of entrapment causes a feedback loop when the fear of <b>suffocation</b> increases {{as a result of}} continued helplessness, causing the subject to struggle to end the SP episode.|$|E
25|$|After investigation, some {{of these}} infant deaths {{are found to be}} caused by {{accidental}} <b>suffocation,</b> hyperthermia or hypothermia, neglect or some other defined cause.|$|E
25|$|Open cut hazards are principally mine wall {{failures}} and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include <b>suffocation,</b> gas poisoning, roof collapse, rock burst, outbursts, and gas explosions.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, <b>Suffocation</b> {{began making}} posts {{revealing}} {{that they were}} in the process of recording demos for a new album with a potential release date of late 2015.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral chemoreceptors in {{the brain}} monitor the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels {{in the brain}} to give a feeling of <b>suffocation</b> if carbon dioxide levels get too high.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{an infant}} to sleep while {{lying on the}} stomach or the side {{increases}} the risk. This increased risk is greatest at {{two to three months}} of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals. Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of <b>suffocation.</b> They are not recommended for children under one years of age as this risk of <b>suffocation</b> greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of the crib.|$|E
25|$|Black damp: {{a mixture}} {{of carbon dioxide and}} {{nitrogen}} in a mine can cause <b>suffocation,</b> and is formed as a result of corrosion in enclosed spaces so removing oxygen from the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|<b>Suffocation</b> is an American {{technical}} death metal band {{formed in}} 1988 in Centereach, New York. The band consists of vocalist Frank Mullen, lead guitarist Terrance Hobbs, bassist Derek Boyer, rhythm guitarist Charlie Errigo, and drummer Eric Morotti. <b>Suffocation</b> rose to prominence of death metal {{and created a}} blueprint for the genre for the 1990s with their 1991 debut album Effigy of the Forgotten, and have released seven studio albums since formation. The band's raw death metal style uses growled vocals with a downtuned guitar sound, fast and complex guitar riffs and drumming, open chord notes, breakdowns, and a sophisticated sense of songwriting.|$|E
25|$|Discarded plastic bags, six pack rings, {{and other}} forms of plastic waste which finish up in the ocean present dangers to {{wildlife}} and fisheries. Aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement, <b>suffocation,</b> and ingestion.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006, {{three members}} of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area ski patrol died while on duty. All three died from <b>suffocation</b> by carbon dioxide when they fell into a {{fumarole}} on the slopes of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{thousands}} of houses and apartments were {{damaged by the}} strikes, only two people died directly as consequence of the impacts. Another 12 lost their life from indirect causes (<b>suffocation</b> while wearing gas-masks and heart attacks).|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of acute}} {{overexposure}} to dichloromethane via inhalation include difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation {{of the upper}} respiratory tract and eyes. More severe consequences can include <b>suffocation,</b> loss of consciousness, coma, and death.|$|E
25|$|In total, opponents {{argue that}} the effect of {{dilution}} or improper administration of thiopental is that the inmate dies an agonizing death through <b>suffocation</b> due to the paralytic effects of pancuronium bromide and the intense burning sensation caused by potassium chloride.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} SIDS is unknown. The {{requirement}} {{of a combination}} of factors including a specific underlying susceptibility, a specific time in development, and an environmental stressor has been proposed. These environmental stressors may include sleeping on the stomach or side, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Accidental <b>suffocation</b> from bed sharing (also known as co-sleeping) or soft objects may also play a role. Another risk factor is being born before 39 weeks of gestation. SIDS makes up about 80% of sudden and unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs). Other causes include infections, genetic disorders, and heart problems. While child abuse in the form of intentional <b>suffocation</b> may be misdiagnosed as SIDS, this is believed to make up less than 5% of cases.|$|E
