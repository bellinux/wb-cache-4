5000|$|Patent 1794361 (filed 25 March 1927) {{describes}} {{milling machine}} spindle and tool shapes using a <b>steep</b> <b>taper.</b> [...] The patent {{was assigned to}} Kearney & Trecker Corporation, Brown & Sharpe, and Cincinnati Milling Machine Company. The patent wanted a taper that would freely release the tool and found that a taper of 3.5 in 12 had that property. [...] The patent also used the keys and slots and a tail on the tool shank to prevent the tool shank from falling out of a horizontal mill's spindle while the operator connected the drawbar.|$|E

5000|$|In geodynamics {{the concept}} is used to explain tectonic {{observations}} in accretionary wedges. Every wedge has a certain [...] "critical angle", which depends on its material properties and the forces at work. This angle {{is determined by the}} ease by which internal deformation versus slip along the basal fault (décollemont) occurs. If the wedge deforms more easily internally than along the décollement, material will pile up and the wedge will reach a <b>steeper</b> critical <b>taper</b> until such a point as the high angle of the taper makes internal deformation more difficult than sliding along the base. If the basal décollement deforms more easily than the material does internally, the opposite will occur. The result of these feedbacks is the stable angle of the wedge known as the critical taper.|$|R
5000|$|The National Machine Tool Builders Association (now {{called the}} Association for Manufacturing Technology) defined a <b>steep</b> <b>taper</b> that is {{commonly}} used on milling machines. The taper is variously referred to as NMTB, NMT or NT. The taper is 3.500 inches per foot and is {{also referred to as}} [...] "7 in 24" [...] or 7/24; the computed angle is 16.5943 degrees. [...] All NMTB tooling has this taper but the tooling comes in different sizes: NMTB-10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60. These tapers were apparently also specified in ASA (now ANSI) B5.10-1943.|$|E
5000|$|Splitting mauls {{are heavy}} axes (6 lbs or more) used for rough {{splitting}} of firewood. They have small heads {{in terms of}} edge length, but are heavy as they are especially wide across the cheeks and have a <b>steep</b> <b>taper</b> for rapid splitting. To provide the power necessary, they have full-length shafts and are used with a full swing at the log. Splitting is usually done to logs that are already sawn to length and so they may be split vertically. To split longer logs, wedges are driven with the heavy poll of this maul, giving its alternative name of [...] "hammer-poll axe".|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{models that}} treat accretionary {{complexes}} as critically tapered wedges of sediment demonstrate that pore pressure controls their taper angle by modifying basal and internal shear strength. Results from some {{studies show that}} pore pressure in accretionary wedges {{can be viewed as}} a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). Sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. In one such study, it was found that as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable taper angles to increase from ∼2.5° to 8°-12.5°. With increased sediment thickness (from 100 - 8000 m), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable taper angle from 8.4°-12.5° to <2.5-5°. In general, low-permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin taper angles, whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have <b>steep</b> <b>taper</b> angles. Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing taper angle (from >15° to <4°) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The current {{contributions}} of individual ionic channels {{can be measured}} by electrically isolating {{a small patch of}} membrane. To do this, the tip of a small pipette is brought into close contact with an enzymati-cally cleaned membrane of a hypersensitive amphibian or mammalian muscle fiber. Current flowing through the pipette is measured. If the pipette contains choliner-gic agonist at ft-molar concentrations, quare pulse current waveforms can be observed which represent the activation of individual acetylcholine-receptor chan-nels. The square pulses have amplitudes of 1 to 3 pA and durations of 10 -lOOms. In order to obtain the necessary resolution, a delicate compromise had to be found between different experimental parameters. Pipettes with 1 - 3 ~tm in-ternal diameter and a <b>steep</b> final <b>taper</b> had to be used, extensive nzyme treatment was necessary, and con-ditions had to be found in which channels open at a relatively low frequency...|$|R

SIMS and XPS {{studies on the}} photoresist surface after etching revealed that the deposited polymer using CH 3 F contained fewer C [...] F bonds than the damaged layer ex-posed to CHF 3 ion beam. The incident angle dependence of photoresist etching rate suggested that physical sput. ter-etching of the depos-ited polymer was a rate-determining process on photore-sist. The etching rate of A 120 ~ was also dominated by sput-tering of nonvolatile reaction products formed on the etched A 1203 surface. Acknowledgments We {{would like to thank}} Dr. Y.

40|$|Five {{significant}} problems hinder advances in {{understanding of the}} volcanology of kimberlites: (1) kimberlite geology is very model driven; (2) a highly genetic terminology drives deposit or facies interpretation; (3) the effects of alteration on preserved depositional textures have been grossly underestimated; (4) the level {{of understanding of the}} physical process significance of preserved textures is limited; and, (5) some inferred processes and deposits are not based on actual, modern volcanological processes. These issues need to be addressed in order to advance understanding of kimberlite volcanological pipe forming processes and deposits. The traditional, steep-sided southern African pipe model (Class I) consists of a <b>steep</b> <b>tapering</b> pipe with a deep root zone, a middle diatreme zone and an upper crater zone (if preserved). Each zone is thought to be dominated by distinctive facies, respectively: hypabyssal kimberlite (HK, descriptively called here massive coherent porphyritic kimberlite), tuffisitic kimberlite breccia (TKB, descriptively here called massive, poorly sorted lapilli tuff) and crater zone facies, which include variably bedded pyroclastic kimberlite and resedimented and reworked volcaniclastic kimberlite (RVK). Porphyritic coherent kimberlite may, however, also be emplaced at different levels in the pipe, as later stage intrusions, as well as dykes in the surrounding country rock. The relationship between HK and TKB is not always clear. Sub-terranean fluidisation as an emplacement process is a largely unsubstantiated hypothesis; modern in-vent volcanological processes should initially be considered to explain observed deposits. Crater zone volcaniclastic deposits can occur within the diatreme zone of some pipes, indicating that the pipe was largely empty {{at the end of the}} eruption, and subsequently began to fill-in largely through resedimentation and sourcing of pyroclastic deposits from nearby vents. Classes II and III Canadian kimberlite models have a more factual, descriptive basis, but are still inadequately documented given the recency of their discovery. The diversity amongst kimberlite bodies suggests that a three-model classification is an over-simplification. Every kimberlite is altered to varying degrees, which is an intrinsic consequence of the ultrabasic composition of kimberlite and the in-vent context; few preserve original textures. The effects of syn- to post-emplacement alteration on original textures have not been adequately considered to date, and should be back-stripped to identify original textural elements and configurations. Applying sedimentological textural configurations as a guide to emplacement processes would be useful. The traditional terminology has many connotations about spatial position in pipe and of process. Perhaps the traditional terminology can be retained in the industrial situation as a general lithofacies-mining terminological scheme because it is so entrenched. However, for research purposes a more descriptive lithofacies terminology should be adopted to facilitate detailed understanding of deposit characteristics, important variations in these, and the process origins. For example every deposit of TKB is different in componentry, texture, or depositional structure. However, because so many deposits in many different pipes are called TKB, there is an implication that they are all similar and that similar processes were involved, which is far from clear...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{volatile}} expulsion, {{the duration}} of venting, the total volume of volatiles expelled, {{and the size of}} intrusion required to supply them are key parameters in the formation of any magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposit that can be estimated from the morphology of the hydrothermally altered rock. The radius of pervasively altered rock around the fluid source and the taper of alteration halo with distance from the pervasively altered zone constrain the duration and rate of volatile expulsion. The volume of altered rock records the total mass of volatiles expelled. An analysis of the Pittsmont Dome at the porphyry copper system at Butte, Montana provides an example. The moles of hydrogen ion consumed during alteration are calculated from the mineralogy of unaltered and altered rock. Published composition estimates are used to determine the concentration of reactable hydrogen ion in the magmatic fluid. Diffusion from the vein to a reaction front {{at the edge of the}} halo surrounding it constrains the rate of hydrogen ion loss from the vein. Semi-analytic and finite difference simulations of alteration halo formation show how the radius of the pervasively altered zone and the steepness of the taper beyond that zone depend on the rate of volatile expulsion; the faster the fluid velocity, the less <b>steep</b> the <b>taper.</b> Data from the Pittsmont Dome suggest 23 to 30 billion tons of magmatic fluid was expelled over a period of less than 20 years. Assuming 5 wt% magmatic water in the porphyry intrusion, a spherical intrusion ~ 7 km in diameter is needed to supply the volatiles for just this part of the Butte mineralization system...|$|R
40|$|Kimberlites {{have been}} {{recently}} discovered beneath 100 m of glacial sediment at Fort a la Come, Saskatchewan, Canada. Crater and extra-crater facies have been intersected in borehole core, interstratified with coastal and marine sediments of Cretaceous age. Extra-crater kimberlite is very rare, and particularly well preserved at Fort a la Come. It is encountered in five borehole intersections drilled by Rhonda Mining Corporation, {{sponsors of the}} Operation Fish Scale project, which included kimberlite research at the University of Leeds. The regional setting and geological description of six kimberlite borehole intersections are presented. In addition, the broad geodynamic conditions and the stratigraphic context are described, and from these a model for kimberlite eruption is constructed. The kimberlites are then described at a range of scales from stratal thickness and disposition, to ultra-fine diagenetic mineral growth. A textural classification is then applied to the deposits. The volcanology of the Fort a la Cone kimberlites are then discussed: these are unusual in that the craters are preserved, and are broad and flat, rather than <b>steep</b> sided <b>tapering</b> cones. A new term, pateran crater, and process of evolution is proposed for these and other kimberlites of similar morphology. The survival of these volcanic edifices in the sedimentary environment is also considered. The geochemistry of the kimberlites is presented, both bulk rock, and over 450 analyses of individual mineral grains by electron microprobe. These minerals are mostly gamet, ilmenite and pyroxene, of megacryst, kimberlite, crust, mantle peridotite and eclogite origin. The mineral chemistries are compared {{to those found in}} other kimberlites around the world, {{and the nature of the}} cratonic lithosphere is described. The P-T and compositional characteristics of the lithosphere are further refined from diamond and garnet trace element chemistry in collaborative works with Taylor and Griffin, described herein. Economic aspects of the kimberlites are reviewed, and all the conclusions are presented in time order, from diamond growth in the Archean, crustal evolution in the Mid-Proterozoic, Early Cretaceous magma generation and eruption, to Late Cretaceous reworking and burial...|$|R
