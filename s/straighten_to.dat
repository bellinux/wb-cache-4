5000|$|The Quran {{uses the}} words adl, qist, qast, wasat, and mizan in {{referring}} to justice, {{with the word}} adl being mostly used and literally meaning to <b>straighten,</b> <b>to</b> balance, to depart from wrong, or to be equal. Its meaning is thus [...] "a combination of moral and social values denoting fairness, balance, temperance and straightforwardness." [...] In Islam, justice {{is not only a}} moral virtue but also an obligation to be fulfilled under all circumstances. The Quran at its two hundred places warns people against injustice, and at its one hundred places directs people to establishing justice. The Quran served for the early Muslims, as it serves for the present Muslims, as the primary source for the notion of justice. As his capacity as a prophet, the Quranic notion of justice was explained and translated into practice by Muhammad in dealing with various social issues, thus setting moral and legal examples and standards of justice in society and paving ways for the later Muslim theologians and scholars to [...] "formulate theories of justice". The obligation to establish justice comes as a fundamental principle in the Quran, second in importance only to the oneness of God. The Quranic injunction of fairness and fair dealing is equally applicable to all people, irrespective of caste, creed, and color. According to the scholars of the Quran, rendering justice to people is a trust from God entrusted on mankind, and this should be fulfilled with a sense of responsibility, not just as a formality.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a method to}} design software process models. The method is based on object oriented design extended with a kernel of PM specific classes and relations. A graphical notation to depict process model designs is given together with few structuring and presentation rules. 1 Introduction One of {{the aims of the}} E 3 project is to devise a method to design process models before implementing them. Initially the object oriented (OO) Coad and Yourdon methodology has been investigated and used to design both the ISPW 6 example problem and the software process of a local software organization. The latter software process was described by a textual document of more than one hundred pages. The resulting OO design is based on: 1. a set of kernel classes and relations with PM semantics. Classes identify the root for activity, data, tool, and role submodel; 2. a set of domain specific classes and relations. Once the kernel was identified, it was <b>straighten</b> <b>to</b> obtain the process model [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Vesicular monoamine {{transporter}} 2 (VMAT 2) catalyzes {{transport of}} monoamines into storage vesicles {{in a process}} that involves exchange of the charged monoamine with two protons. VMAT 2 {{is a member of the}} DHA 12 family ofmultidrug transporters that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary transporters. Here we present a homology model of VMAT 2, which has the standard MFS fold, that is, with two domains of six transmembrane helices each which are related by twofold pseudosymmetry and whose axis runs normal to the membrane and between the two halves. Demonstration of the essential role of a membraneembedded glutamate and confirmation of the existence of a hydrogen bond probably involved in proton transport provide experimental evidence that validates some of the predictions inherent to the model. Moreover, we show the essential role of residues at two anchor points between the two bundles. These residues appear to function as molecular hinge points about which the two six transmembrane-helix bundles flex and <b>straighten</b> <b>to</b> open and close the pathways on either side of the membrane as required for transport. Polar residues that create a hydrogen bond cluster form one of the anchor points of VMAT 2. The other results from hydrophobic interactions. Residues at the anchor points are strongly conserved in other MFS transporters in one way or another, suggesting that interactions at these locations will be critical in most, if not all, MFS transporters...|$|E
