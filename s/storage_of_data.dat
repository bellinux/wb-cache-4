In this article, time series analysis {{has been used for}} analyzing the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> water <b>data</b> in Kihung agricultural reservoir that is located in Yongin City, Korea. For analyzing the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> water <b>data,</b> three models, the ARIMA model, the autoregressive error model, and the dynamic regression model have been used. The result shows that the autoregressive error model is best suited for describing the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> water <b>data...</b>|$|R

25|$|Compact disc (CD) is {{a digital}} optical disc data storage format {{released}} in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. The first commercially available Audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{over time}} the cameras and {{recording}} media for fluoroscopic imaging have progressed as follows. The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> sensor <b>data.</b> Sensor data can also be characterized as time series data. The exponential increase <b>of</b> sensor <b>data</b> exposes the scalability issues of relational databases. noSQL databases are a new type <b>of</b> <b>data</b> stores, which are built with scalability and availability in mind. The capabilities provided by these databases, makes them a good candidate for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> time series <b>data.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to compare different data schemas for noSQL databases and their applicability for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> sensor <b>data.</b> An overview <b>of</b> noSQL database taxonomies is presented. Also, various data schemas used by experts in production are researched and presented. This gives an insight on which data schemas are appropriate for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> time series. Next, we perform load tests using Cassandra, which is a noSQL database suitable for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> sensor <b>data.</b> The tests are performed with regard to performance <b>of</b> different <b>data</b> schemas for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> sensor <b>data.</b> A test structure and scennarios are defined and different data schemas are tested on the basis of throughput and latency. The results are expected to provide suggestions for the suitable noSQL data schemas to use in different situations when storing time series data. ...|$|R
