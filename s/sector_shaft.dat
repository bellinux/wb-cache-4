50|$|The {{hydraulic}} assistance is supplied by a servo piston {{operating in a}} cylinder integral with the steering box casting. The teeth of a rack projecting from the piston mesh with a sector of a spur gear machined into the <b>sector</b> <b>shaft.</b> A roller in the <b>sector</b> <b>shaft</b> meshes with the helical track on the cam, and the two together are responsible for providing the variable ratio. No external lockstops are provided as they are incorporated into the steering box.|$|E
50|$|The Pitman arm is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) <b>sector</b> <b>shaft,</b> it converts the angular motion of the <b>sector</b> <b>shaft</b> into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} <b>sector</b> <b>shaft</b> and supports the drag link or center link with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or center) link, causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or drag link at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|E
50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains {{a worm gear}} inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the <b>sector</b> <b>shaft</b> (also called a sector gear) which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|E
40|$|DE 10012348 A UPAB: 20020429 NOVELTY - The moving and/or {{positioning}} device can be fitted to a base (ZG) {{in the form}} of a carriage for the multi-axial motion of a carrier (TP) with axis element (AE) having a first <b>shaft</b> <b>sector</b> (AE 1) turning about a first turning axis (A 1) on the base, and a second <b>shaft</b> <b>sector</b> (AE 2). The carrier can turn about a second turning axis (A 2) on the second <b>shaft</b> <b>sector.</b> USE - For the tool unit of a machine tool. ADVANTAGE - More versatile...|$|R
50|$|British {{soldiers}} of the 170th Tunneling Company established a listening system {{at the bottom of}} shaft 8bis which picked up sounds of activity in August 1917.In early September there was an underground struggle in which the Germans were forced out of the mine.Around midnight of 25-26 September 1917 the 38th German Pioneer Regiment poured about 8 tons of the suffocating gas chloropicrin into Mine 8, and carried by the ventilation systems the gas took under four hours to travel the 6 km to Mine 9 and the shaft of Mine 12.The people around the base of Shaft 8 died, but those further away escaped via the ladders of Shaft 9.After the attack a thick masonry wall was built in the main haulage gallery to isolate the <b>sectors</b> near <b>shafts</b> 8 and 8bis.The Germans blew up the casing of Shaft 8 and the heads of Shafts 8 and 8bis.The mine was reopened after the war, and finally closed in 1961.|$|R

40|$|In Part I, {{torsional}} stress and moment of a straight bar with asymmetrical cross-section bounded by confocal ellipses and hyperbolas {{are given in}} the forms of infinite series. By selecting the boundary values, several kinds of symmetrical figures (<b>sector,</b> semi-circle, circular <b>shaft</b> with a sharp crack, circular pipe with a slit and rectangle) are all contained. Numerical examples show the results coincide very well with that found by bi-polar, polar and rectangular coordinates. In Part II, shearing stress of a beam with symmetrical cross-section bounded by confocal ellipses and hyperbolas are found by Saint-Venant's flexure function. The shearing load acts on the beam along the vertical axis of symmetry, so the torsion does not accompany. It is {{pointed out that the}} stress distribution is not influenced by the presence of a crack and the stress concentration does not occur when the crack is vertical. But, if the crack is horizontal, the great stress concentration is found at the top o...|$|R
