40|$|We {{implement}} {{techniques of}} graph theory to {{international trade in}} order to empirically inspect the international system of trade. Examining macro and <b>submacro</b> levels {{of the international system}} of trade from 1962 - 2003, we find the presence of a Scale-Free Network with a Multiscalar Hierarchy. Such structures are resilient to bottom-up economic collapse, but are susceptible to top-down and horizontal economic failures. Our findings are based upon an especially novel approach for examining <b>submacro</b> systems, applying latent community identification analysis to identify trading communities that are not necessarily formalized or institutionalized as trading blocs. Following this analysis, we examine the role of international institutions in the international trade network, specifically considering macro level institutions for stability solutions and examining the effects of joining a trade bloc. We find evidence that supports the intergovernmentalist framework, whereby certain types of trade blocs seem to succeed while others fail, leading to different results in integration and unification. by Dinsha Mistree.

40|$|This paper {{initially}} researches the use {{of available}} low-cost analogue CMOS macros to perform simple onchip tests on the Analogue to Digital Converter macro. The results are evaluated for these tests and then further fuller tests are undertaken. The technique of transient response testing is then applied to three CMOS analogue and mixed <b>submacros</b> to provide more comprehensive test results. Introduction An innovative approach to solving {{problems associated with the}} testing of mixed ASIC devices has been developed by the author. The frequently mentioned range of problems include: (i) the cost and time of adapting external test equipment to accommodate mixed circuits, (ii) the formulation of tests and generation of the separate signals for the digital / analogue sections, (iii) the lack of a simple functional test for the complete system. Previous investigations by the author [1] have focussed on applying functional mixed signal testing to ASIC devices. The novelty of this approach is t [...] ...|$|R
