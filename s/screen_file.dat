40|$|Measurement of {{fluorescence}} lifetime is a well-established technique, which {{has recently been}} introduced into the portfolio of assay formats used in high-throughput screening (HTS). This investigation establishes appropriate conditions for using lifetime measurements to reduce the impact of compound interference effects during large-scale HTS of corporate <b>screening</b> <b>files.</b> Experimental data on mixtures of standard fluorophores and interfering compounds (from 5 HTS campaigns) have been combined with a theoretical model to identify the minimum data quality required, defined by the photon count in the peak channel, for discrimination of biological activity. Single-component fluorophore lifetimes can be recovered with an error of 1 %, with a peak photon count of 102, but the same accuracy with a 2 -component decay requires a peak photon count of 103. When a 3 rd component is introduced, the minimum peak count increases to 104. The influence of scattered light on lifetime determination was investigated using an emulsion (diameters 25 - 675 nm). The measured decays of interfering compounds, identified as autofluorescent, show {{that the vast majority}} have a very short lifetime that can readily be resolved from the reporter fluorophore, using appropriate data-fitting methods.

40|$|High {{throughput}} screening (HTS) is {{an effective}} method for lead and probe discovery that is widely used in industry and academia to identify novel chemical matter and to initiate the drug discovery process. However, HTS can be time-consuming and costly {{and the use of}} subsets as an efficient alternative to screening these large collections has been investigated. Subsets may be {{selected on the basis of}} chemical diversity, molecular properties, biological activity diversity, or biological target focus. Previously we described a novel form of subset screening: plate-based diversity subset (PBDS) screening, in which the screening subset is constructed by plate selection (rather than individual compound cherry-picking), using algorithms that select for compound quality and chemical diversity on a plate basis. In this paper, we describe a second generation approach to the construction of an updated subset: PBDS 2, using both plate and individual compound selection, that has an improved coverage of the chemical space of the <b>screening</b> <b>file,</b> whilst only selecting the same number of plates for screening. We describe the validation of PBDS 2 and its successful use in hit and lead discovery. PBDS 2 screening became the default mode of singleton (one compound per well) HTS for lead discovery in Pfizer...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{emergence}} {{of the field of}} proteomics has been driven by advances in mass spectrometry methods and instrumentation. Due to the large amount of data generated, success at peptide and protein identification is contingent on reliable software algorithms. The software programs in use at the time the work in this dissertation was carried out were well suited to the task of identifying unmodified peptides and proteins in complex mixtures. However, the existing programs were not able to reliably identify protein modifications, especially unpredicted modifications. This dissertation describes the development of two novel software algorithms {{that can be used to}} <b>screen</b> LC-MS-MS data <b>files,</b> and identify MS-MS spectra that correspond to peptides with either predicted or unpredicted modifications. The first program, SALSA, is highly flexible and uses user defined search criteria to <b>screen</b> data <b>files</b> for spectra the exhibit fragmentation patterns diagnostic of specific modifications or peptide sequences. SALSA facilitates exhaustive searches, but requires user expertise to both generate search criteria and to validate matched spectra. The second program, P-Mod, provides automated searches for spectra corresponding to peptides in a search list. P-Mod is able to identify spectra derived from either modified or unmodified peptides. All sequence-to-spectrum matches reported in the P-Mod output are assigned statistical confidence levels derived using extreme value statistics...|$|R
