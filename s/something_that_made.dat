25|$|In 1222 {{the first}} {{inhabitants}} of the new monastery, {{under the leadership of}} Abbot Richard, arrived from Halesowen Abbey. They were not monks, instead they were canons regular belonging to the Premonstratensian order (also known as the 'white canons' from the colour of their robes and Norbertines from the name of their founder, St. Norbert). They lived communally, following a very strict interpretation of the Rule of St Augustine, but in addition to engaging in a life of study and prayer within their abbeys, they also had a pastoral mission and served as parish priests ministering to the spiritual needs of the laity. The order was well known for the austerity of the lives led by its members, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it — as with the Cistercians — especially popular with wealthy benefactors in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.|$|E

There must have been <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." ...|$|E
500|$|By May 1972, Bushnell and Dabney quit Nutting Associates {{and moved}} to {{incorporate}} Syzygy Engineering; they instead named it Atari due to another company with a similar name. Bushnell later stated that he was encouraged {{by the success of}} Computer Space in regards to future game ideas, as he had never before created <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> so much money, and additionally felt that his time at Nutting gave him confidence in running his own company because he [...] "couldn't screw it up more than they did". Nutting Associates did not make any further Computer Space games before closing in 1976. Bushnell's enthusiasm was soon substantiated, as Atari's first game, Pong, went on to substantially greater success than Computer Space. Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release {{marked the beginning of the}} commercial video game industry.|$|E

500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Joanna Johnston created 60 {{different versions}} of Ray's leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered {{from the beginning of}} the journey to the end. [...] "He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts," [...] explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: [...] "I wanted her to have <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face," [...] Johnston notes. [...] "That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times." [...] Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, [...] "They're more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface," [...] Johnston says.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Boyle started {{brainstorming}} {{ideas with}} designer Mark Tildesley, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They considered [...] "what was essentially British", with the non-British Larlarb {{able to offer}} a view of what the world thought Britain meant. Cottrell Boyce had given Boyle a copy of Pandaemonium, (named after the capital of Hell in Paradise Lost) by Humphrey Jennings, which collated contemporary reports from the industrial revolution. [...] It had become traditional during the opening ceremony to 'produce' the Olympic rings in a spectacular manner. Cottrell Boyce commented [...] "Danny had a very clear idea {{that in the first}} 15 minutes you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world; it had to climax with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> people go 'Oh my God!'". [...] Boyle decided that [...] "the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings" [...] would be that image.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{received}} some criticism. Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha {{said after a}} run of [...] "several strong" [...] episodes, Lost [...] "has slipped into mediocrity. While none of the recent episodes have been bad, they haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must have been <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E

50|$|Rama Records owner George Goldner {{arranged}} a session for the Wrens {{that took place}} on November 21, 1954. They recorded four songs <b>that</b> day: “Love’s <b>Something</b> <b>That’s</b> <b>Made</b> For Two” (led by Mansfield), “Beggin’ For Love” (fronted by Concepcion), “Come Back My Love” and “Eleven Roses” (both by Mansfield). The piano player was Johnson, who provided the other session musicians. However, he and the Wrens parted company soon after the session, {{and from then on}} Goldner used the Jimmy Wright Orchestra to back them. Further recordings including six single releases on Rama, were unsuccessful and Mansfield left in 1956 to pursue a solo career.|$|R

2500|$|The {{problem of}} free will has been {{identified}} in ancient Greek philosophical literature.

According to Susanne Bobzien, the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias (third century CE); [...] "what makes us have control over things {{is the fact that we}} are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".|$|E

Guggenheim noted, [...] "We were talking about where to put —we were talking about maybe it was an old warehouse or whatever. Someone said <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me think, 'You know, there's this building in Cincinnati that is the basis for the Hall of Justice in the Super Friends. I'm sure there's stock footage that we could then alter.' That's what we ended up doing... Props to Encore who did an amazing job of altering it in all the right ways.

Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: [...] "It's very hard to leave <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me so happy.

2500|$|The {{tendency}} to keep Spock as a background character continued {{for the first}} eight episodes of The Original Series, when the NBC executives called Roddenberry and producer Herbert Franklin Solow to their offices in Burbank. The executives complained that Spock was not appearing frequently in the show. They had received requests from local stations asking for Spock-centric episodes, which they referred to as [...] "Spockmania". When told {{they were told that}} it was NBC who requested he be a background character, they flatly denied it and said it was obvious how popular Spock had become. Roddenberry showed them the advertising brochure as evidence and only then did they apologise. It was decided to switch the romantic lead in [...] "" [...] from Hikaru Sulu to Spock, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> Nimoy apprehensive. But he subsequently said he enjoyed being able to act out Spock's emotions, and praised writer D. C. Fontana for expanding Vulcan culture within the series.|$|E
2500|$|Following Davis to {{his newly}} formed J Records label, Keys rented an {{apartment}} {{and struggled to}} create an album.

Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> sense, something that can translate to people. That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up." [...] Keys learned how to produce by asking questions to the producers and engineers; she wrote, arranged and produced a majority of the album. She recorded the songs [...] "Rock wit U" [...] and [...] "Rear View Mirror", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively. One of the final songs Keys recorded was [...] "Fallin'". A total of 32 songs were recorded for the album. Originally titled Soul Stories in A Minor, the title of the album was changed over concerns that it would limit exposure only to black radio stations.|$|E

The IRA was not a sectarian group and went {{out of its way}} to {{proclaim}} it was open to all Irishmen, but its membership was largely Catholic with virtually no Protestants serving as [...] "active" [...] IRA men.

The first human Prue meets in The Wood is an old man driving a mail truck, Richard, the South Wood Postmaster General. She sees in him something she [...] "couldn't put her finger on that seemed to exude from him, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him seem like no one she'd ever met before. It was a kind of aura or shine, like the way a familiar landscape is transformed in the light of a full moon." [...] The natives of The Wood are consistently able to recognize Prue and Curtis as Outsiders, who ought {{not to be able to}} enter through the Periphery Bind surrounding The Wood, while only the people of the pastoral and meditative North Wood can see with an unexplained sense that Prue and Curtis have a dual nature, born outside The Wood yet unhindered by the magical barrier that keeps the Outsiders out.|$|E

During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long.
