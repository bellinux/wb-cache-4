5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Riot, as <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{was mostly}} {{done in the}} <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> area. Several scenes were filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals at Detroit Metro Airport in late February 2009 with minimal filming in Omaha, in Las Vegas and in Miami, Florida.

Producers set up a <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Missouri production office on January 5, 2009. Filming began in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> on March 3, 2009, and continued {{through the end of}} April.

5|$|After the {{transfer}} of Louisiana to the United States, the Spanish had ended subsidies to the Catholic Church in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis.</b> As a result, Catholics in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> had no resident priest until the arrival of Louis William Valentine Dubourg in early January 1818. Upon his arrival, he replaced the original log chapel with a brick church, recruited priests, and established a seminary. By 1826, a separate <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> diocese was created. Joseph Rosati became the first bishop in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|Although de jure {{segregation}} in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> public schools ended in 1954 after Brown v. Board of Education, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> area educators continued to employ tactics to ensure de facto segregation during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1850s, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> hosted annual {{agricultural}} and mechanical fairs at Fairground Park {{to connect with}} regional manufacturers and growers. By the 1880s, the connection to agriculture had declined, and in 1883, a new <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Exposition and Music Hall was built to house industrial exhibits. In 1890, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> attempted to host the World's Columbian Exposition, but the project was awarded to Chicago, which hosted the exposition in 1893. In 1899, delegates from states that {{had been part of}} the Louisiana Purchase met in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> selecting it as the site of a world's fair celebrating the centennial of the purchase in 1904.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> was the {{location}} of a large ammunition factory and the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory. Area factories also produced uniforms and footwear, K-rations, and chemicals and medicines. The uranium used in the Manhattan Project was refined in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> by Mallinckrodt Chemical Company starting in 1942, and several atomic bomb scientists had ties to <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> including Arthur Compton. At the start of the war, many German, Italian, and Japanese St. Louisans were interrogated or arrested, while the FBI investigated charges of sedition in the area. Residents engaged in civil defense drills and supported the war effort with scrap drives and war bond purchases. <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> produced several notable soldiers in the war, including Edward O'Hare, who grew up in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> and won the Medal of Honor for combat in the Pacific. <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> also was home to Wendell O.

5|$|In September 1880, the <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Choral Society opened as {{a musical}} {{orchestra}} and choir; the same organization provided annual concerts through 1906, {{when it was}} renamed the <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Symphony Orchestra. Starting in the 1890s, the district known as Chestnut Valley (an area near the present-day Scottrade Center) became the home of <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> ragtime. Several well-known ragtime and jazz composers lived or played in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> including W.C. Handy, Tom Turpin, Scott Hayden, Arthur Marshall, Joe Jordan, and Louis Chauvin. In addition to the early Chestnut Valley players, ragtime composer Scott Joplin moved to <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> from Sedalia, Missouri in 1901, where he associated with Tom Turpin and composed music in the city until moving to Chicago in 1907.|$|E
5|$|In a game {{versus the}} Reds on June9, {{the score was}} tied 5–5in {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning when Stivetts {{connected}} for a pinch-hit, walk-off solo home run. This was his second career walk off home run, his third as a pinch hitter, and the last home run of his career. It was reported on July22 that a deal had been agreed upon to trade Stivetts to the <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Browns of the NL for Kid Carsey and cash. The deal was contingent upon the acceptance of Stivetts. In early August, the Boston manager Selee sent Stivetts home, commenting that the team did not have use of his services any longer. Tim Hurst, now managing <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> planned on using Stivetts in center field. Stivetts refused to accept the move to <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> and a sale was officially conducted on August14 that sent him to <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> for $2000 and an unnamed player. True to his word, Stivetts did not report, or play a single game for <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> that season. Due to his objection to being sold to <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> he claimed that he would remain in Ashland and return to coal mining.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory governed the Louisiana District (which included <b>St.</b> <b>Louis),</b> and the district's organizational law forbade the foreign slave trade and reduced the influence of <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> in the region. Wealthy St. Louisans petitioned Congress to review the system, and in July 1805, Congress reorganized the Louisiana District as the Louisiana Territory, with its territorial capital at <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> and its own territorial governor. From the division of the Louisiana Territory in 1812 to Missouri statehood in 1821, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> was the capital of the Missouri Territory.|$|E

Quain transferred the players' contracts and franchise operations to a new company called the Hockey Association of <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Inc. Eddie Gerard was hired to coach the new team. The club was renamed the Eagles, inspired by the logo of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, which was founded in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis.</b> The Senators name and logo remained in Ottawa and would be used by a senior amateur team until 1954. At the time, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> was the seventh largest city in the United States, with over 800,000 inhabitants— over seven times larger than Ottawa. Despite this, <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> had been denied an NHL franchise in 1932 because travel to the Midwest was considered too expensive during the Great Depression.|$|E
