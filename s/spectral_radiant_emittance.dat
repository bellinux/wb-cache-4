The techniques are based on measuring relative differences in the thermal properties between gravel-laden targets and the surrounding gravelless background. These properties are determined from modeling the <b>spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> recorded over both types of surfaces in conjunction with ground measurements {{of the most significant}} heat flows above and below the surface. Thermodynamic properties of sampled materials from control sites are determined, and diurnal and annual subsurface heat waves are recorded. Thermal models that account for heat exchange at the surface, as well as varying levels of soil moisture, humidity, and vegetation, are needed for adaptation and modification to simulate the physical and radiative environments of this region...|$|E

40|$|In the {{lighting}} community ray tracing {{is a popular}} tool for the optical design of luminaires. In most cases it suffices to perform ray tracing at one wavelength, typically 555 nm, because the optical properties of most materials used in luminaire design are not strongly dependent on wavelength. In some special purpose luminaires however, optical components are incorporated to modify the spectrum of the light source. A typical application is the illumination of food products in a retail environment. In this paper it is investigated whether spectral ray tracing {{can be used to}} predict the angular variation of the spectrum of a luminaire equipped with an interference filter. The input data for the ray tracing simulations are the experimentally determined spectrum of the light source and spectral scattering properties of the materials in the luminaire, and a geometric model of the luminaire. The <b>spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> intensity of the luminaire at a set of emission angles is measured with a goniospectrometer and compared with the <b>spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> intensity found from the ray tracing simulations. A very good agreement is obtained. Additionally, detailed information is gathered through raytracing simulations, on how the light follows different trajectories through the optical system, contributing to the <b>spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> intensity at different emission angles. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> flux is {{the primary}} optical {{characteristic}} of a light source, determining the luminous flux and color. Much research {{is dedicated to the}} modeling of light-emitting diode (LED) spectra and their temperature dependence, allowing for the simulation of optical properties in various applications. Most of the <b>spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> flux models that have been published so far are purely mathematical. For this paper, <b>spectral</b> <b>radiant</b> fluxes of commercial single color LED packages have been measured in a custom made integrating sphere at several junction temperatures by active cooling and heating with a Peltier element. A spectrum model at 300 K is constructed where the Boltzmann free carrier distribution and carrier temperature are included. Subsequently, the model is extended with the carrier temperature variation, the band gap energy shift, and the nonradiative recombination rate decrease with junction temperature. As a result, the skewness variation, peak frequency shift, and peak value change in the spectrum with temperature can be predicted. The model has been validated by comparing flux and color coordinates of measured and simulated spectra at 340 K junction temperature. In practice, only two spectral flux measurements at different junction temperatures are needed to accurately simulate a single color spectrum at any temperature.
