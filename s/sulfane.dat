25|$|H2S therapy uses a H2S donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to {{increase}} the supply of H2S to an AMI patient. H2S donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion complications. Increased H2S levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce <b>sulfane</b> sulfur, a storage intermediate for H2S. H2S pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess H2S and eNOS {{to increase}} NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of H2S directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In H2S therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing myocardial infarct size.|$|E

The sulfur {{crosslinking}} {{films from}} Natural Rubber (NR), Carboxylated Stryrene Butadiene Rubber (XSBR) latices, and their blends {{have been investigated}} using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES). The film was prepared by casting the latex compound on glass surface and heating at 120 oC in a hot air oven for 10 minutes. The sulfur crosslinking densities were studied by the XANES. This was done to provide the local geometry and electronic environment of sulfur bonding in the rubber networks. We found that the reversion takes place {{before the onset of}} oxidative processes at the sulfur bridges. Parallel to the oxidative processes, the production of cyclic <b>sulfanes</b> takes places.

50|$|Cyanide is {{naturally}} present in human tissues in very small quantities. It is metabolized by rhodanese, a live enzyme {{at a rate}} of approximately 17 µg/kg*min. Rhodanese catalyzes the irreversible reaction forming thiocyanate from cyanide and <b>sulfane</b> which is non-toxic and can be excreted through the urine. Under normal conditions, availability of <b>sulfane</b> is the limiting factor which acts as a substrate for rhodanese. Sulfur can be administered therapeutically as sodium thiosulfate to accelerate the reaction. A lethal dose of cyanide is time-dependent because of the body’s ability to detoxify and excrete small amounts of cyanide through rhodanese-sulfate catalysis. If an amount of cyanide is absorbed slowly, rhodanese-sulfate may be able to biologically render it non-toxic through catalysis to thiosulfate whereas the same amount administered over {{a short period of time}} may be lethal.|$|E

We found that H 2 S helps maintain redox homeostasis and protects bacteria against antibiotic-triggered oxidative stress ``on demand'', through activation of alternate respiratory oxidases and cellular antioxidants. We discovered, a hitherto unknown role for this gas, that chemical inhibition of H 2 S biosynthesis reversed antibiotic resistance in multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains of clinical origin, whereas exposure to the H 2 S donor restored drug tolerance.

All changes in the spectra could be identified by comparison with reference compounds. The reactions in thermally stressed polythiophenes differ depending on the dopants. It is revealed that the irreversible damage of the heat-sensitive counter-ions {{and the release of}} reactive gases accelerate the main chain damage. XANES spectroscopy at the S K-edge of natural rubbers is a nondestructive alternative to wet chemical analysis methods. Rubbers were studied in three different development steps: noncured, cured and aged.

The calculated lowest energy transitions for these species were diagnostic of their protonation and oligomerization state. We here extend these studies to As and Sb oxidation state III and v sulfides and to polysulfides S n 2 -, n = 2 – 6, the bisulfide anion, SH -, hydrogen sulfide, H 2 S and the <b>sulfanes,</b> S n H 2, n = 2 – 5. Many of these calculations are more difficult than those performed for the As(iii) bisulfides, since the As and Sb(v) species are more acidic and therefore exist as highly charged anions in neutral and basic solutions. In general, small and/or highly charged anions {{are more difficult to}} describe computationally than larger, monovalent anions or neutral molecules. We have used both Hartree-Fock based (CI Singles and Time-Dependent HF) and density functional based (TD B 3 LYP) techniques for the calculations of absorption energy and intensity and have used both explicit water molecules and a polarizable continuum to describe the effects of hydration. We correctly reproduce the general trends observed experimentally, with absorption energies increasing from polysulfides to As, Sb sulfides to SH - to H 2 S. As and Sb(v) species, both monomers and dimers, also absorb at characteristically higher energies than do the analogous As and Sb(III) species. There is also a small reduction in absorption energy from monomeric to dimeric species, for both As and Sb III and v. The polysufides, on the other hand, show no simple systematic changes in UV spectra with chain length, n, or with protonation state. Our results indicate that for the As and Sb sulfides, the oxidation state, degree of protonation and degree of oligomerization can all be determined from the visible-UV absorption spectrum. We have also calculated the aqueous phase energetics for the reaction of S 8 with SH - to produce the polysulfides, S n H -, n = 2 – 6. Our results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data, and support the existence of a S 6 species. </p...|$|R

The covalent modifications of sulfhydryl groups (–SH) may occur through oxidation to mixed disulfides (S-thiolation), S-nitrosylation, {{as well as}} persulfide and trisulfide formation. The latter possibilities of –SH group modification connected with compounds containing sulfur called <b>sulfane</b> sulfur are described in this paper. <b>Sulfane</b> sulfur compounds contain a labile, highly reactive sulfur atom at a reduced oxidation state with a valence of 0 or – 1, covalently bound to another sulfur atom. These compounds include persulfides, polysulfides, polythionates, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and disulfides, which enable tautomerization to thiosulfoxides. <b>Sulfane</b> sulfur compounds are formed in the anaerobic cysteine sulfur metabolism with the participation of such enzymes as cystathionase (CST), 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MpST) and rhodanese (thiosulfate: cyanide sulfurtransferase).

Of these, the 5 -HT 2 A receptor plays {{a prominent role}} in the central nervous system {{as well as in the}} periphery (blood vessels, uterus, platelets). Mescaline and LSD act as hallucinogens through a (partial) agonism at central 5 -HT 2 A receptors. On the contrary, recently developed, so-called atypical antipsychotics like clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone block 5 -HT 2 A receptors besides the dopaminergic D 2 -receptor family and are established as effective drugs against schizophrenia endowed with fewer side effects. In the submitted thesis, so far unknown chiral congeners of the literature known 5 -HT 2 A-receptor antagonist dimethyl-[2 -(3 -phenylquinolin- 2 -ylsulfanyl) ethyl]amine (ICI 169, 369) have been synthesised and characterised pharmacologically, in order to further elucidate the 5 -HT 2 A receptor´s stereochemical requirements with regard to ICI 169, 369 -type antagonists. The synthesis started from chiral aminoalcohols or available aminoalkanethiols. Besides, a racemic resolution via diastereomeric amides was described in order to obtain (R) -dimethyl-[2 -(3 -phenylquinolin- 2 -ylsulfanyl) propyl]amine. In addition, the appertaining chiral ethers, chain-lengthened <b>sulfanes,</b> benzylic amines and derivatives of 4 -(4 -fluorobenzoyl) piperidine and analogues have been produced. In some exemplary cases, it was possible to determine the enantiomeric purity of the compounds by capillary electrophoresis in the presence of cyclodextrines. The ee was usually > 96 %. The affinity of the new compounds, expressed as pA 2, was determined in the presence of cocaine and prazosin on segments of the isolated rat tail artery, which can be contracted by 5 -HT. For some compounds it was also determined at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor of the porcine coronary artery for comparison. The compounds are - except for few - competitive antagonists with nano- to subnanomolar affinities (pA 2 values 6. 3 ? 9. 7). The affinity ratios of the enantiomers are low (2 : 1 ? 6 : 1) with the (R) -configurated isomers being the eutomers in both positions of the side chain with few exceptions to the rule. The highest enantiomeric ratio found is 33 : 1 for methyl-[2 -(3 -phenylquinolin- 2 -yloxy) propyl]amine.

It was {{investigated}} in vitro non-enzymatically and enzymatically (in the presence of rat tissue homogenate). The results indicate that both H 2 S and <b>sulfane</b> sulfur are formed from LA non-enzymatically in the presence of environmental light. These results suggest that H 2 S is the first product of non-enzymatic light-dependent decomposition of LA that is, probably, next oxidized to <b>sulfane</b> sulfur-containing compound(s). The study performed in the presence of rat liver and kidney homogenate revealed an increase of H 2 S level in samples containing LA and its reduced form dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA).

The human brain regions, {{as compared to}} human liver, showed low γ-cystathionase activity. The activity of rhodanese was also much lower {{and it did not}} vary significantly between the investigated brain regions. The activity of 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase was the highest in the thalamus, hypothalamus and subcortical nuclei and essentially the same level of <b>sulfane</b> sulfur was found in all the investigated brain regions. The investigations demonstrated that the level of <b>sulfane</b> sulfur in gliomas with the highest grades was high in comparison to various human brain regions, and was correlated with a decreased activity of γ-cystathionase, 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and rhodanese. This can suggest <b>sulfane</b> sulfur accumulation and points to its importance for malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In gliomas with the highest grades of malignancy, despite decreased levels of total free cysteine and total free glutathione, a high ratio of GSH/GSSG was maintained, which is important for the process of malignant cells proliferation. A high level of <b>sulfane</b> sulfur and high GSH/GSSG ratio could result in the elevated hydrogen sulfide levels. Because of the disappearance of γ-cystathionase activity in high-grade gliomas, it seems to be possible that 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase could participate in hydrogen sulfide production.

Finally, we assayed the concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, respectively. In the liver, acute cocaine treatment, did not change concentrations of the whole pool of <b>sulfane</b> sulfur, its bound fraction, H 2 S or sulfate but markedly decreased levels of non-protein SH groups (NPSH), ROS and GST activity while γ-GT was unaffected. In the kidney, acute cocaine significantly increased concentration of the whole pool of <b>sulfane</b> sulfur, reduced the content of its bound fraction but H 2 S, sulfate and NPSH levels were unchanged while ROS and activities of GST and γ-GT were reduced. Acute cocaine enhanced activity of the CSE and 3 -MST in the liver and kidney, respectively. Repeatedly administered cocaine enhanced the whole pool of <b>sulfane</b> sulfur and reduced H 2 S level simultaneously increasing sulfate content both in the liver and kidney. After repeated cocaine, a significant decrease in ROS was still observed in the liver while in the kidney, despite unchanged ROS content, a marked increase in MDA level was visible. The repeated cocaine decreased 3 -MST and increased γ-GT activities in both organs but reduced GST in the kidney.

40|$|IscS and IscU from Escherichia coli {{cooperate}} {{with each other}} in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters.

Cys- 328 of IscS attacks the sulfur atom of l-cysteine, and the <b>sulfane</b> sulfur derived from l-cysteine binds to the Sγ atom of Cys- 328. In the course of the cluster assembly, IscS and IscU form a covalent complex, and a sulfur atom derived from l-cysteine is transferred from IscS to IscU. The covalent complex is thought to be essential for the cluster biogenesis, but neither the nature of the bond connecting IscS and IscU nor the residues involved in the complex formation have been determined, which have thus far precluded the mechanistic analyses of the cluster assembly. We here report that a covalent bond is formed between Cys- 328 of IscS and Cys- 63 of IscU. The bond is a disulfide bond, not a polysulfide bond containing <b>sulfane</b> sulfur between the two cysteine residues. We also found that Cys- 63 of IscU is essential for the IscU-mediated activation of IscS: IscU induced a six-fold increase in the cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS, whereas the IscU mutant with a serine substitution for Cys- 63 had no effect on the activity. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism for an early stage of iron-sulfur cluster assembly: the sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU is initiated by the attack of Cys- 63 of IscU on the Sγ atom of Cys- 328 of IscS that is bound to <b>sulfane</b> sulfur derived from l-cysteine...|$|E

The mitochondria isolation indicates that the probe can specifically localize in mitochondria. Finally, the fluorescent probe has been successfully applied to detect O- 2 and H 2 Sn in mice.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of sulfur bonding is undergoing change. Old theories on hypervalency of sulfur {{and the nature}} of the chalcogen-chalcogen bond are now questioned. At the same time, there is a rapidly expanding literature on the effects of sulfur in regulating biological systems. The two fields are inter-related because the new {{understanding of}} the thiosulfoxide bond helps to explain the newfound roles of sulfur in biology. This review examines the nature of thiosulfoxide (<b>sulfane,</b> S 0) sulfur, the history of its regulatory role, its generation in biological systems, and its functions in cells. The functions include synthesis of cofactors (molybdenum cofactor, iron-sulfur clusters), sulfuration of tRNA, modulation of enzyme activities, and regulating the redox environment by several mechanisms (including the enhancement of the reductive capacity of glutathione). A brief review of the analogous form of selenium suggests that the toxicity of selenium may be due to over-reduction caused by the powerful reductive activity of glutathione perselenide.

The isolation of stable DiPhSeSeCN, both in the solid state and in solution, is facilitated by strong intramolecular Se center dot center dot center dot N interaction. The compound DiPhSeSeCN, an example of unsymmetrical diselenide, did not exhibit any glutathione peroxidase-like activity.

40|$|Thiotaurine, a thiosulfonate {{related to}} taurine and hypotaurine, is formed by a {{metabolic}} process from cystine and {{generated by a}} transulfuration reaction between hypotaurine and thiocysteine. Thiotaurine can produce hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) from its <b>sulfane</b> sulfur moiety. H 2 S is a gaseous signaling molecule which can have regulatory roles in inflammatory process. In addition, <b>sulfane</b> sulfur displays the capacity to reversibly bind to other sulfur atoms. Thiotaurine inhibits PMA-induced activation of human neutrophils, and hinders neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis. Here, we present {{the results of a}} proteomic approach to study the possible effects of thiotaurine at protein expression level. Proteome analysis of human neutrophils has been performed comparing protein extracts of resting or PMA-activated neutrophils in presence or in absence of thiotaurine. In particular, PMA-stimulated neutrophils showed high level of glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression compared {{to the level of the}} same glycolytic enzyme in the resting neutrophils. Conversely, decreased expression of GAPDH has been observed when human neutrophils were incubated with 1 mM thiotaurine before activation with PMA. This result, confirmed by Western blot analysis, suggests again that thiotaurine shows a bioactive role in the mechanisms underlying the inflammatory process, influencing the energy metabolism of activated leukocytes and raises the possibility that thiotaurine, acting as a sulfur donor, could modulate neutrophil activation via persulfidation of target proteins, such as GAPDH...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe role of {{the three}} conserved {{cysteine}} residues on Azotobacter vinelandii IscU in accepting <b>sulfane</b> sulfur and forming a covalent complex with IscS has been evaluated using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry studies of variants involving individual cysteine-to-alanine substitutions. The results reveal that IscS can transfer sulfur {{to each of the}} three alanine-substituted forms of IscU to yield persulfide or polysulfide species, and formation of a heterodisulfide covalent complex between IscS and Cys 37 on IscU. It is concluded that S transfer from IscS to IscU does not involve a specific cysteine on IscU or the formation of an IscS–IscU heterodisulfide complex...|$|E
40|$|The Sox pathway {{found in}} many sulfur {{bacteria}} oxidizes thiosulfate to sulfate. Pathway intermediates are covalently bound to a cysteine residue in the carrier protein SoxYZ. We have used biochemical complementation by SoxYZ-conjugates to probe {{the identity of the}} intermediates in the Sox pathway. We find that unconjugated SoxYZ and SoxYZ-S-sulfonate are unlikely to be intermediates during normal turnover in disagreement with current models. By contrast, conjugates with multiple <b>sulfane</b> atoms are readily metabolised by the Sox pathway. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that the true carrier species in the Sox pathway is a SoxYZ-S-sulfane adduct...|$|E
