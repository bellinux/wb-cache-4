25|$|Heavy {{or light}} traffic within the ride system can cause speed {{variations}} as the vehicles {{try not to}} enter the specified <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> between one another. On busy days, each vehicle may slow to a crawl at intervals within the ride path {{in order to allow}} the vehicle ahead to gain distance, then suddenly jerk back into higher speed. Because of these unexpected variations in speed, the soundtrack to the ride is not of a specific length, in fact, each scene of the attraction has a pre-selected score to play which is already of a certain length. If the vehicle finds itself remaining in one scene {{for an extended period of}} time, the score will play in full or until the vehicle leaves the scene. If the vehicle remains in a scene longer than the length of the score, then an exaggerated soundtrack of the vehicle's engine will fade-in and play to keep riders from experiencing awkward silence. Due to safety reasons, vehicles on the ride path cannot reverse. Contrary to the finale scene when the vehicle reverses away from the boulder, the vehicle is actually stationary while the motion base tilts backwards and the cave walls accelerate past the riders to give the illusion of reversing.|$|E

25|$|Although D Company {{ultimately}} prevailed {{they would}} have been defeated {{were it not for the}} timely arrival of the cavalry and the availability of significant artillery support. The Australians had come close to disaster and the battle brought home the dangers of a dismounted platoon or company being overwhelmed, while several deficiencies had been evident in 1 ATF's preparation and response. As the fighting began there was no ready reaction force available at Nui Dat, resulting in a lengthy delay reinforcing D Company. After Long Tan a rifle company with armoured support was dedicated to this role, on standby to respond to an attack or exploit any opportunity. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong had been armed with weapons at least equal to those used by the Australians. Most had carried modern Soviet assault rifles, as well as a large quantity of ammunition, which allowed them to sustain a high rate of fire. In contrast, the amount of ammunition carried by the Australians had been insufficient, and following the battle the minimum load was increased to 140 rounds per rifle and 500 for each machine-gun. Equally the aerial resupply of D Company had been delayed because there were no prepacked ammunition available. This also changed, while rounds would also be supplied loaded in magazines for quick use. The Viet Cong had also used 60mm mortars, but they were no longer standard equipment for Australian rifle companies, and although battalions were issued 81mm mortars they were controlled by Support Company. Such weapons would afford integral fire support in situations where their opponents had closed within the <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> of the artillery, and consideration was given to their re-issue. Yet the added weight would limit the ability of sub-units to patrol and M-79 grenade launchers were issued instead, while a number of APCs were modified as mortar carriers.|$|E

The {{source of the}} smoke was a tanker flying no flags, showing no lights, and zigzagging to thwart submarine attack, leading Detmers to conclude she was an Allied vessel. With little time before the sun set and the likelihood the tanker would resist capture, Kormoran commenced fire at [...] {{in an attempt to}} disable the ship. When the third salvo hit, the merchantman broadcast a distress call, identifying herself as British Union and saying she was under attack by an unknown vessel at [...] Firing continued until British Union directed a light towards Kormoran, which the Germans assumed was a surrender signal, but as the raider closed to , four shots were fired by the tanker. All four missed, and heavy retaliatory fire from the raider set the merchant ship alight and forced the crew to abandon ship. The decision was made to destroy the 6,987-ton tanker with a torpedo, although two torpedoes and shells from the raider's main guns were required to sink her, while a third torpedo exploded as soon as it cleared its <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> and armed; Detmers later stated the quantity of ammunition used during the attempted capture was excessive for the result obtained. The tanker's master, 27 sailors, and a pet monkey were recovered from two lifeboats as the tanker sank at , and the raider fled the area. The distress call and glow from the fires attracted the attention of the armed merchant cruiser , which passed through the engagement site around midnight in pursuit, but failed to locate Kormoran, and returned that morning to collect a third lifeboat carrying seven survivors. These sailors stated their attacker had fired on the other two lifeboats, a claim not made by those rescued by the Germans. The Allies initially assumed that the [...] was responsible, but after this was disproven, the Admiralty was unable to determine the identity of the attacker.|$|E

Physical features such as the gas jet release process, flammable cloud size, blast generation and propagation, and explosion effects on building columns are considered and evaluated through the SLAB integral model, Multi-Energy Method and structural blast fragility surfaces.

The aim of this thesis is to evaluate and analyze existing risk analysis methods for conventional railroads and guidelines regarding <b>safety</b> <b>distances.</b> The goal is to decide whether these methods and <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> {{could be used to}} determine derailment risks associated with future high-speed railroads in Sweden. During the last decades, the number of reported accidents has decreased in Sweden while the number of travelled passenger train kilometers has increased. In this thesis, derailment statistics for passenger trains from 2008 - 2016 are collected. These data are analyzed and compared with data from 1985 - 1994. The aim is to determine whether the risk of derailment has decreased significantly between the two time periods. Furthermore, the longest distance that a single wagon could travel orthogonally from the railway embankment is investigated. A general theoretical model is developed and applied to high-speed railroads. The results indicate that some of the current probabilistic risk analysis methods would give too conservative results if they were to be applied to upcoming high-speed railroads. According to the theoretical model, impact distances could exceed 30 meters if trains were to derail at speeds of 320 km/h.
