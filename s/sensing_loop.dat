40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a novel dynamic droop scaling (DDS) technique for paralleled power modules. The major {{concern is the}} uniform current distribution of each module in multiple power systems. The droop method relies on the slope characteristic of load regulation to achieve current sharing accuracy. Owing to the trade-off between error percentages of current sharing and output voltage variation, conventional droop technique can’t provide good load regulation and current balance at the same time. However, the proposed DDS technique can break through the limitation of the conventional droop method by the implementation of dual current <b>sensing</b> <b>loops.</b> The dual current <b>sensing</b> <b>loops</b> not only increase the droop gain but also compensate the extra output dropout voltage automatically according to the steeper slope value of the novel method.

A lot of temperature sensors based {{on a number of}} different measurement principles have been developed. In this paper, we report a novel temperature sensing system by the use of optical coherence domain reflectometry (OCDR). OCDR is a technique based on the low coherence interferometry. A CW low coherence source with a coherence length on the order of 10 ?gm is coupled to a fiber directional coupler and divided into the test arm and the reference arm. In the test arm, the light is divided into the <b>sensing</b> <b>loop</b> and sub-reference loop by the couplet and reflected by the loop ends (R 1 and R 2) with 4 % reflectivity. The optical length of the test arm can be modulated by the PZT. The optical delay in the reference arm can be varied by translating the movable mirror. When it matches the delay for light reflected from R 1 and R 2 respectively, optical interference appears. The length difference between the <b>sensing</b> <b>loop</b> and the sub-reference loop is set to be less than 2 mm, but it is much longer than the coherence length of the light source. The signal detected by the photodetector is passed through a signal processing unit and the result is demonstrated in Fig. 2 where the signal {{is a function of the}} mirror position.

The goal of this investigation is to design, fabricate and characterize a differential amplifier whose performance is based on a physically coupled, but electrically isolated fully differential mechanical transconductor input stage that is fabricated using SOI-MEMS technology. The MEMS sensor will act as a vibrating capacitor input stage. It will provide galvanic isolation and up-modulation of the input signal as it vibrates. The galvanic isolation facilitates low-leakage inputs and a very wide input common mode voltage range. The up-modulation provides a means for achieving a low input referred offset voltage and low-noise via the use of correlated double sampling or chopper stabilization. At the system level, this amplifier consists of two major loops: the drive <b>loop</b> and a <b>sense</b> <b>loop.</b> The drive loop includes half of the MEMS structure along with some electronics and provides a means of moving the beam at a constant frequency. The drive loop's design was facilitated by describing function analysis. The drive loop vibrated the beam at its mechanical resonance because at that frequency, the displacement of the beam is maximized for a given electrostatic force and consequently, the sensitivity of the amplifier is maximized. The <b>sense</b> <b>loop</b> includes {{the other half of the}} beam and some electronics whose role is to process the differential input signal applied at the MEMS structure's inputs. Common-mode rejection is performed by the mechanical transconductor, while the <b>sense</b> <b>loop's</b> crossover frequency sets the signal bandwidth. (cont.)

The magnitude of the footprint latitudinal shift may reach ∼ 10 ° corrected geomagnetic latitude (CGLat) during strong substorms (I 1 = 2 MA). A strong helical magnetic field around the field-aligned current generates a surge-like region with embedded spiral structures, associated with a westward traveling surge (WTS) at {{the western end of}} the SCW. The helical field may also contribute to rotation of the ionospheric projection of narrow plasma streams (auroral streamers).

In superfluid 4 He, when this combined current through the aperture exceeds the critical current, one or several vortices are created, resulting in a quantized decrease of the flow through the aperture (phase slip).

40|$|In recent years, the {{security}} of networked control systems (NCSs) {{has been an important}} challenge for many researchers. Although {{the security}} schemes for networked control systems have advanced in the past several years, there have been many acknowledged cyber attacks. As a result, this dissertation proposes the use of a novel time-delay switch (TDS) attack by introducing time delays into the dynamics of NCSs. Such an attack has devastating effects on NCSs if prevention techniques and countermeasures are not considered in the design of these systems. To overcome the stability issue caused by TDS attacks, this dissertation proposes a new detector to track TDS attacks in real time. This method relies on an estimator that will estimate and track time delays introduced by a hacker. Once a detector obtains the maximum tolerable time delay of a plant’s optimal controller (for which the plant remains secure and stable), it issues an alarm signal and directs the system to its alarm state. In the alarm state, the plant operates under the control of an emergency controller that can be local or networked to the plant and remains in this stable mode until the networked control system state is restored. In another effort, this dissertation evaluates different control methods to find out which one is more stable when under a TDS attack than others. Also, a novel, simple and effective controller is proposed to thwart TDS attacks on the <b>sensing</b> <b>loop</b> (SL). The modified controller controls the system under a TDS attack. Also, the time-delay estimator will track time delays introduced by a hacker using a modified model reference-based control with an indirect supervisor and a modified least mean square (LMS) minimization technique. Furthermore, here, the demonstration proves that the cryptographic solutions are ineffective in the recovery from TDS attacks. A cryptography-free TDS recovery (CF-TDSR) communication protocol enhancement is introduced to leverage the adaptive channel redundancy techniques, along with a novel state estimator to detect and assist in the recovery of the destabilizing effects of TDS attacks. The conclusion shows how the CF-TDSR ensures the control stability of linear time invariant systems...|$|E

The use of Bragg gratings, multilayer quarter-wave stacks, and rugate mirrors for fibre optic sensing applications is discussed in this work. Rugate mirrors are presented in more detail since they form {{an important part of}} the research. The control system for an electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition reactor was developed for the growth of inhomogeneous dielectric filters. The system is intended to control the growth of films of the required refractive index profile for optical applications on different substrates including fibre ends. The system also includes an automatic microwave tuner. Rugate mirrors deposited directly on optical fibre were used in a dual cavity Fabry- Perot interferometric strain sensor. It was found by computer simulation that reflectances of 40 % for the two outer mirrors and 68 % for the centre mirror allow the interferometer to have maximum fringe amplitude. The sensor was evaluated experimentally as a strain gauge. The maximum strain applied to the sample was about 0. 12 % and the corresponding phase change was about 800 radians. The discrepancy between the readings of this sensor and those of a resistive strain gauge, applied to the same structure, did not exceed 5 %. Two novel fibre optic sensors were developed during this work: a merged Sagnac- Michelson interferometric sensor for distributed disturbance detection, and a disturbance location sensor using modified Sagnac and Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Both are intended for distributed impact location along the fibre. The magnitude of impact can also be measured with these sensors. The merged Sagnac-Michelson interferometric sensor uses two light sources and a frequency selective mirror to separate the Michelson and Sagnac signals. Birefringence in the fibre was used to bias the Sagnac interferometer to have a sine response. Computer simulations yielded the optimal biasing conditions: the state of linear polarisation of the input light should be rotated by r/ 4 with respect to the horizontal axis; birefringence in the Sagnac loop must provide retardation of ff/ 2 with the optical axes rotated by K/ 4 with respect to the horizontal axis. We verified the sensor concept experimentally. The discrepancy between measured and actual locations of disturbances applied to the fibre did not exceed 2. 5 m for a 200 m long <b>sensing</b> <b>loop.</b> The sensor using the modified Sagnac and Mach-Zehnder interferometers makes use of phase modulation and synchronous detection to obtain the sine-biased Sagnac signal. A modified Sagnac interferometer configuration that incorporates an additional coupler and a mirror, allows separation of the Sagnac and Mach-Zehnder signals. Operation of the new configuration was verified experimentally in the system with a sensing fibre of 100 m long. The discrepancy between measured and actual locations of disturbances applied to the fibre did not exceed 2 m...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{business}} environment of many organizations require {{to monitor their}} business, IT and organizational processes in real-time in order to proactively respond to exceptions and {{to take advantage of}} time-sensitive business opportunities. The ability to sense and interpret events about a changing {{business environment}} or customer needs require an event-driven IT infrastructure for making fast and well-informed decisions and putting them into action. In this paper we introduce <b>Sense</b> & Respond <b>loops</b> that support a complete Business Intelligence process to sense, interpret, predict, automate and respond to business processes and aim to decrease {{the time it takes to}} make the business decisions. Our approach enables real-time analytics across corporate business processes, notifies the business of actionable recommendations or automatically triggers business operations, effectively closing the gap between Business Intelligence systems and business processes. We propose a system for executing and managing <b>Sense</b> & Respond <b>loops</b> and illustrate our approach with a supply chain business scenario. 1...|$|R
