5|$|In 1901, Antoine posted an {{advertisement}} in the Spiritist journal The Messenger (Le Messager), seeking doctors who would associate with him, but the attempt {{did not meet}} with success. At the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> was deeply influenced by Léon Denis' book In the Invisible.

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle.

At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
