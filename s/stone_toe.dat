40|$|Long-term {{assessments}} of ecosystem rehabilitation project effects are rare. Herein we describe {{a study of}} the Hotophia Creek rehabilitation project in northwest Mississippi. The stream channel was subjected to channelization ca. 1963 and experienced rapid channel erosion between 1963 and 1985, with annual suspended sediment yield exceeding 1, 000 t km- 2. More than $ 10 million were expended on erosion control measures within the 90 -km 2 watershed between 1985 and 2000, with an attendant sixfold reduction in suspended sediment yield. Fish and physical aquatic habitat data were collected for one year prior to construction of a one-km long stream habitat rehabilitation project in 1992. Habitat rehabilitation consisted of extending existing stone spurs, placing <b>stone</b> <b>toe,</b> and planting willow cuttings. Post construction monitoring was conducted for the four years following construction, and at 10 years following construction. Parallel monitoring was conducted on an untreated reference stream and on untreated reaches upstream on Hotophia Creek. Effects of rehabilitation on habitat and fish communities were found to be positive in both th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe earth-fill dam of Zhiguli Hydropower Plant {{is located}} between the {{building}} of the hydropower plant and the concrete spillway dam. To collect seepage water {{in the body of the}} earth-fill dam throughout its entire length, inside a <b>stone</b> <b>toe</b> drain, there is a gallery made of reinforced concrete. In order to estimate the technical state, signs of structural deformation, cracks, chips and corrosive wear, a survey of the reinforced concrete structures of the drainage gallery with discharge outlets in the earth-fill dam has been conducted, the main results of which are presented in this paper. As a result of this survey, the areas and the value of subsidence of the reinforced concrete structures of the drainage gallery have been identified. The slope of the drainage gallery and the amount of sediment in it has been defined. Besides, the area along the route of discharge outlets has been examined, and the state of the coastline has been evaluated. Basing on the results of this survey, a detailed assessment of the technical state of the reinforced concrete structures of the drainage gallery in the earth-fill dam of Zhiguli Hydropower Plant has been given...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many stream {{ecosystems}} are severely limited by damaged physical habitat. Channelization and associated accelerated erosion {{is a primary}} cause of damages in agricultural watersheds. Cost-effective strategies are needed to address erosion problems and restore stream corridor habitats. Detailed studies of restoration outcomes are rare. Herein we present {{a case study of}} two small streams (watershed size = 12 and 14 km 2) damaged by channel straightening and incision. One stream was stabilized using a low drop grade control structure and dormant willow post planting, while the other was treated with a stone weir, <b>stone</b> <b>toe</b> bank protection, and willow sprout planting. Effects of restoration were monitored by collecting physical and biological data for one to two years before restoration and two to three years afterward. Following construction, channel planforms were stable, but up to 1 m of deposition and erosion occurred along the thalweg profile. Willow planting was not successful, so canopy, bank vegetation and woody debris density were unchanged. Pool habitat area increased from less than 5 % to more than 30 %. Fish species richness was unchanged, but species composition shifted away from cyprinids that occur in shallow, sandy runs toward pool-dwelling types (catostomids and centrarchids). Response to restoration was more modest than for two nearby restoration projects. Potential causes include less ambitious restoration design, greater initial degradation, and isolation from less-degraded sites which could serve as sources of colonists...|$|E

We dragged it to the doorway, and, seeing his purpose, Oliver jumped on to it with him. Then at Japhet's direction, while I supported the table to prevent its oversetting, Orme rested his forehead against the stone, making what schoolboy's call [...] "a back," [...] up which the mountaineer climbed actively until he stood upon his shoulders, and by stretching himself was able to grasp the end of the fallen transom. Next, while I held up the lamp to give him light, he gripped the roughnesses of the hewn <b>stone</b> with his <b>toes,</b> and in a few moments was upon the coping of the wall, twenty feet or more above the floor line.|$|R
40|$|Along 3, 260 -km {{coastline}} of Vietnam, {{there is}} a system of about 2, 700 -km sea dike. This system has an important role {{for the development of}} Vietnam. It protects densely concentrated population and industrial areas. However, in the storm season, there is usually some collapse in the sea dike system due to the strong impacts of wind wave and high sea water level. One of the reasons, which cause the dikes collapse, is that the toe protection loses its stability. The present research deals with the study of toe protection for sea dikes and revetments in Vietnam. In the present research, two dimension physical model tests were carried out to study the toe protection for sea dikes and revetments in Vietnam using typical data of water depth, wave climate and slope of revetments, etc. Experiments were carried out in a regular wave flume of the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics Delft University of Technology. Wave-induced kinetic energy, which causes the movement of <b>stones</b> at the <b>toe,</b> was determined from the obtained velocities at different locations in front of the slope. Moreover, the study proposed a new concept on relative turbulent energy intensity to compare fluctuation between points and an assumption on an equivalent wave based on wave-induced kinetic energy equivalence to determine the stone size for bottom protection. The results of the experiments proved that the seabed (sand) would be totally eroded and lowered by strong wave-induced kinetic energy at nodes positions, the net flows and movement of nodes due to water level changes during a storm. The seabed is still eroded even if it was lowered. As a result, the toe protection loses its stability and the slope slides afterwards. Moreover, the study concluded that the equivalent wave height is equal to Hmax = (1 +KR) H, where H is incoming wave height and KR is the reflection coefficient. Finally, an equation, which was also based on wave-induced kinetic energy equivalence, has been provided giving a good reliability to use for determining the stone size for bottom protection. For the safety of the sea dikes, the study recommended that, for the Vietnamese specification, there should be a requirement on slope (revetment) stability calculation in case {{there is a}} scour hole in front of the slope. A mattress made of available material like bamboo can be applied to keep the scour hole away from the toe. For preliminary design, the stones, which keep the mattress stable, can be determined by modified Shields curve with Hmax. Finally, the study recommended that the approach for determining the stone size based on the equivalent wave should be developed and applied in scale model research. A crest height of 7 m +SWL complies with an allowable downtime of approximately 0. 2 %. The downtime costs are of considerable more influence than estimated by the port authority. Also the consequences of a breakwater collapse result in a 65 % heavier element weight. The discounted total costs over the lifetime of the breakwater are 219 $ million for the probabilistic design and 468 $ million for the deterministic design. The collapse costs and downtime costs have a significant influence on the total costs over the lifetime and therefore on the economic optimal geometry of the breakwater. A more robust design than deterministically derived can reduce the total cost over the lifetime by almost 50 %. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
