40|$|Simulation of monomeric {{material}} transport in reactive extrusion {{revealed that}} two different situations {{can be distinguished}} in the partially filled zone of a twin-screw extruder. Material is transported {{from the bottom of}} the barrel to the top of the screw by drag or material remains on the bottom of the channel because of gravity. Which process takes place can be predicted when the ratio between the Froude number (gravitation forces) and the Reynolds number (viscous forces) is known. From experiments in a perspex model of a corotating, self-wiping, twin-screw extruder, using glycerol and silicone oil as model fluids, it could be observed which situation can be expected at different filling degrees, screw speeds, throughputs, and viscosities. In the case of a constant filling degree, material moves up with the <b>screw</b> <b>flight</b> at a certain value of Fr/Re. At higher Fr/Re ratios, a larger filling degree is needed for the screws to drag material up with the screw flights. When the filling degree reaches one-half, material moves up with both the pushing and the pulling <b>screw</b> <b>flight.</b> On the basis of these observations, a model is proposed to determine the backflow in the partially filled zone of a corotating, selfwiping, twin-screw extruder, dependent on viscosity and screw speed. ...|$|E

40|$|Eri {{silkworm}} pupae (Samia ricini) {{are very}} interesting creatures since {{they can be}} developed as a sustainable high protein food source for human beings and animals, and their cocoons {{can be used for}} silk production. At present, Thai silk is very famous for its special qualities, whereas the requirement of pupae as food grows increasingly, in particular, canned pupae with seasoning favors. Like other food products, size uniformity is required. Therefore, in this paper, a rotary drum screen with internal <b>screw</b> <b>flights</b> was designed and constructed for separating Eri silkworm pupae into two groups with different sizes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} metallic {{contact between the}} screws and barrels of extruders processing polymeric materials is described. Above a critical shear stress {{of the order of}} 10 ’ N/m 2, contact is obtained between <b>screw</b> <b>flight</b> and barrel under all operating conditions. This critical value is similar in magnitude to that associated with the onset of melt fracture in capillary flow. It is therefore suggested that slip in, or near, the clearance reduces or eliminates polymer hydrodynamic lubrication of the screw. Below the critical shear stress, the hydrodynamic lubrication associated with a continuous film is capable of supporting substantial lateral loads applied to the screw. ...|$|E

40|$|The Buss cokneader is a {{single-screw}} extruder with interrupted flights. Pins from the barrel are {{inserted into the}} screw channel. The screw is both rotating and oscillating. Due to this action, screw flights are continuously wiped by the pins. During one passage of the pin, the material is not only subjected to high shear stress, but it is reoriented as well, thus promoting the distributive mixing process by the local weaving action of the pins and screw flights. Attempts to model the cokneader {{tend to focus on}} a single pin passing through the hole in a <b>screw</b> <b>flight</b> (1, 2). However, a more comprehensive model can start with the same equations that apply to the corotating twin-screw extruder (3). Because the effect of leakage flows on the local pressure gradient has to be considered along with the effect of the local dragging action of the pins (neglecting the oscillatory action), experiments with model liquids have been performed to evaluate the comprehensive model. Additional experiments with a Plexiglas-wailed cokneader support the calculations concerning filled lengths in various screw geometries. These results, and those of model calculations, which are extended to the nonisothermal, non-Newtonian situation, are presented...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{a highly}} {{instrumented}} single screw extruder {{has been used}} to study the effect of polymer rheology on the thermal efficiency of the extrusion process. Three different molecular weight grades of high density polyethylene (HDPE) were extruded at a range of conditions. Three geometries of extruder screws were used at several set temperatures and screw rotation speeds. The extruder was equipped with real-time quantification of energy consumption; thermal dynamics of the process were examined using thermocouple grid sensors {{at the entrance to the}} die. Results showed that polymer rheology had a significant effect on process energy consumption and thermal homogeneity of the melt. Highest specific energy consumption and poorest homogeneity was observed for the highest viscosity grade of HDPE. Extruder screw geometry, set extrusion temperature and screw rotation speed were also found to have a direct effect on energy consumption and melt consistency. In particular, specific energy consumption was lower using a barrier <b>flighted</b> <b>screw</b> compared to single <b>flighted</b> <b>screws</b> at the same set conditions. These results highlight the complex nature of extrusion thermal dynamics and provide evidence that rheological properties of the polymer can significantly influence the thermal efficiency of the process...|$|R
40|$|Screw feeders {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the food, plastics, household products, mineral processing and agricultural industries to remove material from hoppers and bins at a controlled rate. A key design requirement {{is to make the}} empty space in the screw available evenly along its exposed length below the hopper or bin. The evenness of the flow depends on the drawdown flow pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. If the drawdown is not even then compositional variations in the outgoing stream can be created. The strongly varying residence time distributions for particles within the bin can also lead to quality issues. Designs to date have typically been based on analytical models and often performance issues are observed when the screw design used does not give the desired flow pattern. In this study the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate particle transport in a horizontal screw feeder system for a range of conventional screw designs including variable screw pitch, <b>screw</b> <b>flight</b> and core diameters. The influence of screw design on the particle mass flow rate, the evenness of particle drawdown from the hopper and power consumption are investigated. The results of this study are able to better inform the design of screw feeders for specific materials.

40|$|Screw feeders {{are used}} to remove {{material}} from hoppers and bins at a controlled rate. The evenness of the flow in the bin depends on the drawdown pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. A key design requirement {{is to ensure that}} a progressive increase in the screws volumetric capacity is achieved along {{the entire length of the}} hopper's opening so as to produce even drawdown. If this is not achieved then compositional variations in the outgoing stream and other operational problems (such as caking) can be created. Screw designs to date have been generally based on analytical models and at times the predicted flow pattern is not achieved. In this study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to predict particle transport in a horizontal screw feeder system for a range of conventional screw designs including a variable screw pitch, variable <b>screw</b> <b>flight</b> outside diameters and variable core diameters. The influence of screw choice on the particle mass flow rate, the evenness of particle drawdown from the hopper, power consumption, screw wear and wall friction variations are all investigated. Important features captured by DEM that are not accounted for by the analytic model and which vary strongly between competing screw designs, include the particle circulation in the hopper, shearing of the particle bed in the trough just outside the screw and the spatially varying particle force along the hopper which leads to non-uniform drawdown and to the existence of large stagnant or slow moving zones. The screw design and consequent flow patterns also strongly affect the power draw with variations up to a factor of three and screw wear with large changes in their distribution and magnitude. Finally, the surface frictional properties of the screw are shown to strongly influence the rate of bed compaction within and along the screw leading to strong variation in mass flow rate, uniformity of drawdown and power draw...|$|E
40|$|Screw feeders {{are being}} {{widely used in}} {{industry}} to feed reliably many kinds of bulk solids because of their simplicity in structure, good metering characteristics, total enclosure for safety, great flexibility of design and wide application. However, to date, the design {{of this type of}} equipment is still not precise due to an overall shortage theoretical analyses and experimental data reported in the literature. For this reason, this thesis aims at formulating theoretical models to predict the performance of single and twin screw feeders. The models concentrate on the volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque or power requirement of screw feeders. The models are based on analyses of the relevant particulate mechanics. An element of bulk solid sliding on the helical surface of a <b>screw</b> <b>flight</b> will move in a direction related to the angle of friction between the bulk solid and the surface, and helical of the flight surface. An analytical solution to the integral equation to express the volumetric efficiency of screw feeders has been obtained. A theoretical model for the torque requirement is developed by analysing the stresses acting on the five confining surfaces surrounding the bulk solid contained within a pitch. This model allows the torque characteristics to be predicted. A criterion for uniform draw-down performance is presented based on the pitch characteristics of the screw. To obtain detailed information on the interaction among the screw geometry, the operating conditions and properties of the bulk solid, a systematic experimental investigation is undertaken into the performance of screw feeders with different screw and trough configurations, three types of bulk material and different operating conditions. Experimental programs on the twin screw feeders are also conducted to observe the effect of operating conditions and geometric parameters. The factors affecting performance of the twin screw feeders also are analysed. Experimental data are compared with the results obtained from the theoretical predictions. The volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque requirements of screw feeders predicted by the theoretical models developed in this work are found to provide results which agree well with experimental data. The performance prediction models are also applied in industrial practice. Some typical problems experienced by industry are analysed. New design of screw feeders are provided for four upgrade projects...|$|E

40|$|Screw {{conveyors}} {{are used}} extensively in food, plastics, mineral processing, agriculture and processing industries for elevating and/or transporting bulk materials over {{short to medium}} distances. Despite their apparent simplicity in design, the transportation action is very complex for design and constructors have tended to rely heavily on empirical performance data. Screw conveyor performance is affected by its operating conditions (such as: the rotational speed of the screw, the inclination of the screw conveyor, and its volumetric fill level). In this paper, horizontal, several single-pitch screw conveyors with some geometry variations in screw blade was investigated for mixing action during transport, using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The influence of geometry modifications {{on the performance of}} screw conveyor was examined, different screw designs were compared, and the effects of geometrical variations on mixing performances during transport were explored. During the transport, the particle tumbles down {{from the top of the}} helix to the next free surface and that segment of the path was used for auxiliary mixing action.

50|$|Orange oxide was {{received}} from the Refinery in five-ton mobile hoppers, which were mounted on seal hoppers to feed the reduction furnace {{at a rate of}} approximately 375 pounds per hour for producing metal grade UF4. The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon <b>flight</b> <b>screw.</b> Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon <b>flight</b> <b>screws</b> and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|R

Results showed melt temperature fields at low throughputs to be relatively independent of screw geometry with a flat-shaped temperature profile dominated by conduction. At high throughputs, melting performance and measured temperature fields were highly dependent upon screw geometry. A barrier-flighted screw with Maddock mixer achieved significantly better melting than single <b>flighted</b> <b>screws.</b> Low temperature "shoulder" regions were observed in the temperature profiles of single-flighted screws at high throughput, due to late melting of the solid bed.
