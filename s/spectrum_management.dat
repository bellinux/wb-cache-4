30|$|<b>Spectrum</b> handoff <b>management</b> {{is still}} an open issue in CR networks. It is {{particularly}} challenging in CR-MANETs. In CR-MANETs, the available spectrum bands vary over time and space, while they are distributed nonadjacently over a broad frequency range. However, in CR-MANETs, the fluctuation of PU activity and the SU mobility make the issue of maintaining optimal routes more complex. In this work, we present an integrated <b>spectrum</b> handoff <b>management</b> and routing scheme that considers spectrum mobility in the time and space domains and considers the network topology variations. We propose a network architecture that considers the heterogeneous spectrum availability and its variation over time and space and distributed nodes. Then, the probability of channel availability in this dynamic radio environment is calculated. Based on this unified architecture, an integrated routing and <b>spectrum</b> handoff <b>management</b> scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme considers the CR-MANETs spectrum handoff problem and incorporates the routing issue. Both the analytical and simulation results verify the improvement in the network performance using the introduced management scheme.|$|R

40|$|Opportunistic data {{transmissions}} {{in cognitive}} radio networks {{is an effective}} data transmission mechanism which reduces the limitations of fixed spectrum allocations. In cognitive radio networks secondary users (SUs) can transmit over the available spectrum when the primary users (PUs) are inactive. However, a SU may get interrupted over multiple times when the PU re-appear on that channel for data transmission. For an interrupted SU, efficient <b>spectrum</b> hand-off <b>management</b> is vital to complete the data transmission. Efficient spectrum hand-off necessitates greatly for delay sensitive data transmissions (e. g. time critical remote monitoring applications). For such data transmissions, delay sensitive spectrum hand-off mechanisms are necessary. However, the existing sensed <b>spectrum</b> hand-off <b>management</b> methods do not consider delay bounded repeated attempts for spectrum reallocation when there are multiple interruptions. In this paper a delay sensitive <b>spectrum</b> hand-off <b>management</b> for the re-entrant SUs due to multiple interruptions is proposed. Compared to the existing solutions, the proposed spectrum allocation strategy offers more reliable delay-tolerant opportunities for accessing the spectrum for the re-entrant SUs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radio (CR) {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} {{as a solution to}} both spectrum inefficiency and spectrum scarcity problems. However, they face several challenges based on the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, making it more difficult to support seamless communications, especially in CR cellular networks. In this paper, a spectrum-aware mobility management scheme is proposed for CR cellular networks. First, a novel network architecture is introduced to mitigate heterogeneous spectrum availability. Based on this architecture, a unified mobility management framework is developed to support diverse mobility events in CR networks, which consists of <b>spectrum</b> mobility <b>management,</b> user mobility management, and intercell resource allocation. The <b>spectrum</b> mobility <b>management</b> scheme determines a target cell and spectrum band for CR users adaptively dependent on time-varying spectrum opportunities, leading to increase in cell capacity. In the user mobility management scheme, a mobile user selects a proper handoff mechanism so as to minimize a switching latency at the cell boundary by considering spatially heterogeneous spectrum availability. Intercell resource allocation helps to improve the performance of both mobility management schemes by efficiently sharing spectrum resources with multiple cells. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than conventional handoff schemes in terms of both cell capacity as well as mobility support in communications.
