5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed by <b>simple</b> <b>rules</b> the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing <b>simple</b> <b>rules</b> for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks first {{occurred}} in the Pacific ports of Chile and Peru. While their ships were docked, British mariners played football among themselves and with locals {{as a form of}} leisure; the sport's practice was embraced at the ports because its <b>simple</b> <b>rules</b> and equipment made it accessible to the general public. Peru's chief seaport of Callao, where football became a working-class sport, is possibly where the bicycle kick originates as news reports and oral traditions indicate that the local Afro-Peruvians performed the bicycle kick or tiro de chalaca ("chalaca shot", as spectators called it in reference to the local demonym) in the late 19th century, during matches with British sailors and railroad employees. Chile's important seaport of Talcahuano also holds a bicycle kick tradition dating to the 1910s, when Ramón Unzaga, a Basque athlete born in Spain and a naturalized Chilean, allegedly invented the manoeuvre locally known as chorera (also alluding the local demonym).|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} to modelling monetary policy; <b>simple</b> instrument <b>rules</b> and optimal policy. We propose an alternative that combines the two by extending the loss function with a term penalizing deviations from a <b>simple</b> <b>rule.</b> We analyze {{the properties of the}} modified loss function by considering three different models for the US economy. The choice of the weight on the <b>simple</b> <b>rule</b> determines the trade-off between optimality and robustness.

25|$|While 8 <b>Simple</b> <b>Rules</b> was renewed for {{a second}} season and {{production}} had begun, Ritter's sudden death in September 2003 left the series in an uncertain position. After a hiatus, the series returned and continued without Ritter, with the producers deciding to kill off Paul and not replace him. James Garner and David Spade later joined the main cast as Cate's father and nephew, Jim Egan and C.J. Barnes, {{in an attempt to}} fill the void left by Ritter. After three seasons, ABC cancelled 8 <b>Simple</b> <b>Rules</b> in May 2005 due to low ratings.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} idea that very <b>simple</b> <b>rules</b> often {{generate}} great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in chaos theory and complex systems.

25|$|Because games do {{not need}} to mimic actual physics, {{stability}} is not as much of an issue. Almost all games use a posteriori collision detection, and collisions are often resolved using very <b>simple</b> <b>rules.</b> For instance, if a character becomes embedded in a wall, they might be simply moved back to their last known good location. Some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall, and only allow him to move that far.|$|E
25|$|From a more {{abstract}} point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion {{of a large}} number of self-propelled entities. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an emergent behaviour arising from <b>simple</b> <b>rules</b> that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by active matter physicists as a phenomenon which is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the statistical physics of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

Conway led to the invention of the surreal numbers and contributed to development of combinatorial game theory (with Go Infinitesimals being a specific example of its use in Go).|$|E
