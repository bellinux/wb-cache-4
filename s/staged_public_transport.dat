The study focuses upon three areas of individuals preferences in relation to the use of real-time <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information. The first area examined in the study asked respondents to choose between the following options for receiving real-time <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information: the internet, via a mobile phone, a passenger information display and a call centre. The second aspect of the study investigated what type of information respondents required across three <b>stages</b> of a <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> trip, defined as: pre-trip planning from home to work, at-stop/station information and pre-trip planning from work returning home. The third area assessed how a series of explanatory and attitudinal variables impact upon the benefits derived from real-time <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{planners}} and policymakers are increasingly considering multimodal <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and travel demand management (TDM) strategies {{to stem the}} unsustainable travel behaviour trends associated with modern-day, car-dominated travel. Multimodal <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> however, implies that people change transport mode, which may mean that {{they can no longer}} implement their usual activity patterns, perhaps even resulting in increased car use. The quality of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> is determined not only by the quality of the main transport mode, but also by the before (access) and after (egress) modes. The interconnectivity of the different modes also becomes important in order to realise a trip. An important question from a policy perspective is, therefore, how people make decisions regarding location, activity scheduling and mode choice when faced with multimodal <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> alternatives. These decisions span different time horizons; the long-, medium- and short-term implications of multimodal <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> are addressed in the AMADEUS research programme, of which this dissertation forms part. National travel survey data for The Netherlands were used to address some of the research questions. An extensive activity diary data collection exercise was undertaken during April to September 2000 in the Utrecht-Almere-Amsterdam urban region of The Netherlands to collect detailed, multimodal activity-travel data. The data collection exercise relied on a specifically designed activity travel diary to capture the detailed <b>stages</b> of <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> The results suggest that multimodal <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> users have distinctly different characteristics compared to other transport mode users. Considering the relationship between the different time elements, it was found that access, egress and line-haul times are not necessarily influenced by the same variables, while the interconnectivity ratio (access plus egress divided by total trip time) showed different distribution curves for different multimodal chains. Assuming that people make least uncertain decisions first, the results suggest that mode choice ranks lower on the chain of travel behaviour decisions and that individuals make activity scheduling and participation decisions before they make mode choice decisions. The results of this dissertation can be used to inform {{planners and}} policymakers about the implications of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and travel behaviour...|$|R

The study examines the need for <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information across three <b>stages</b> of a <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> trip. The <b>stages</b> examined are as follows; stage one: pre-trip planning from home to work, stage two: at-stop/station information, and stage three: pre-trip planning from work to home. At each of these stages, the respondents were asked to choose between several methods of receiving information, via the internet, mobile phone, call centre or at stop real-time information displays. The study utilised a stated preference approach to ascertain what type of information respondents required at each stage and their willingness to pay for this information. This paper {{presents the}} findings of the study undertaken and reports several factors which affect respondent’s willingness to pay for <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information. This paper examines several factors relating to the impact of the geographical location of a respondent in relation to the utility they derive from real-time <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information. The first factor examined measures the impact that the proximity of an individual to a high quality <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> option has upon utility derived from real-time information. The second factor examines how the residential location of the respondent impacts upon the utility derived from real-time information.

Its objectives are twofold. First, it investigates the motivations for using or not using <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> It focuses on distinctive characteristics between the users and non-users and how they are different in their demographic and travel profiles as well as their attitude towards <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> Second, it seeks to understand which factors influence visitor use of <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> The main reasons for visitor use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> are drive-free benefits, traffic reduction, advantages of local <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> and car unavailability. In contrast, what often discourages <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> use are inconvenience and restrictions, lack of information, disadvantages of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and personal preferences. The five most important variables that differentiate visitor user of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> from a non-user are length of stay, main purpose of trip, age group, frequency of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> use at place of residence, and valid driving license ownership.

40|$|Abstract:- The <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> {{reform is}} very {{important}} to increase the use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> mode. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> problems include: an overall lack of capacity, lack of quality and choice, severe traffic congestions and insufficient fund to renew and repair vehicles. Generally, the comfort and quality of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> fleet is poor, and many of the vehicles are dilapidated and dirty. Whereas those who can least afford to travel may be prepared to suffer such indignities, people who can pay to travel by their own vehicles, or by taxi, would seldom find any temptation to use public. Increasingly, patronage will be confined to the poorest members of society, thereby further eroding service levels and comfort. Most of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> users are captive passengers, who use the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> because they have no choice to travel by other modes. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> system in Yogyakarta and Bandung were analyzed by counting <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles and occupancies, interviewing the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> passengers, drivers and institutional staffs, who involve in <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> management.
