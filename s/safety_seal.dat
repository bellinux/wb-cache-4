40|$|TutorialTutorial 19 B: Traditionally double seals {{have been}} used for low {{pressure}} applications when nitrogen gas at pressure higher than process was available for sealing. Double seals were not applied to low pressure processes where process contamination by nitrogen was not permitted. In these cases application of the process gas for sealing in a double seal was considered ?unsafe? and the preference was given to a tandem seal. In recent years this approach has been re-evaluated and additional steps to insure safety in case of a secondary seal failure undertaken. Since both tandem and double seals can be used for applications with sealing pressure below approximately 40 bar, what benefits are to be gained by double seal application? Double seal arrangement, among other things, allows for system simplification and more reliable operation, significant reduction of sealing gas volumes, prevention of seal reverse pressurization and shorter in-between the bearings shaft span. A possibility of secondary seal failure and prevention of uncontrolled process gas emission can be addressed {{in a variety of ways}} - from incorporation of flow restriction to utilization of separation seal as <b>safety</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|E

40|$|Cycle {{studies have}} shown the {{benefits}} of increasing engine pressure ratios and cycle temperatures to decrease engine weight and improve performance in next generation turbine engines. Advanced seals {{have been identified as}} critical in meeting engine goals for specific fuel consumption, thrust-to-weight, emissions, durability and operating costs. NASA and the industry are identifying and developing engine and sealing technologies that will result in dramatic improvements and address the goals for engines entering service in the 2005 - 2007 time frame. This paper provides an overview of advanced seal technology requirements and highlights the results of a preliminary design effort to implement advanced seals into a regional aircraft turbine engine. This study examines in great detail the benefits of applying advanced seals in the high pressure turbine region of the engine. Low leakage film-riding seals can cut in half the estimated 4 % cycle air currently used to purge the high pressure turbine cavities. These savings can be applied in one of several ways. Holding rotor inlet temperature (RIT) constant the engine specific fuel consumption can be reduced 0. 9 %, or thrust could be increased 2. 5 %, or mission fuel burn could be reduced 1. 3 %. Alternatively, RIT could be lowered 20 'F resulting in a 50 % increase in turbine blade life reducing overall regional aircraft maintenance and fuel bum direct operating costs by nearly 1 %. Thermal, structural, secondary-air systems, <b>safety</b> (<b>seal</b> failure and effect), and emissions analyses have shown the proposed design is feasible...|$|E
40|$|This degree {{project is}} divided into two sub{{projects}}. Both of the projects are executed for Fogmaker, a company that specialises in designing and installing fire suppression systems in engine compartments. These projects are executed according to product development methods. The first subproject described in this report is about designing a handle for the transportation of a 35 kg weighing fire extinguisher. The handle functions as a <b>safety</b> <b>seal</b> and as a grip that makes it easier and safer to lift the fire extinguisher. A casted zinc T-handle is the best solution based on cost and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) analysis. An FMECA (Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis) and a FEM (Finite Element Method) study have been performed to verify the design. A zinc prototype of the safety handle has been manufactured and is ready for testing. It is expected that 10. 000 handles will be produced every year once this prototype is approved by Fogmaker. The second subproject concerns a connection hub placed on a pressurized bottle. In order to make the fire suppression system more reliable this component needs to be redesigned. An external company with the required expertise in hydraulic systems will develop the connection hub in cooperation with Fogmaker, based on the conceptual designs described in this report. An FMECA of the new connection hub concept proves this redesign increases the safety of the system. The overlying subject of both of these projects is the safety of the fire suppression system.

40|$|AbstractThe win-win {{situation}} of CO 2 storage in natural gas hydrate reservoirs is attractive {{for several reasons}} {{in addition to the}} associated natural gas production. Since both pure CO 2 and pure methane form structure I hydrate there is no expected volume change by replacing the in situ methane with CO 2, and there is not net production of associated water which requires extra handling. The geo-mechanical implication of the first of these may be a very important issue since hydrates in unconsolidated sediments are the most promising targets for exploitation of natural gas. The stability of CO 2 stored in the form of hydrate {{is probably one of the}} safest options today, even though also this option relates to <b>safety</b> of <b>sealing</b> cap-rock or clay layer. The stability of hydrates in a reservoir depends on many factors, including the interactions between minerals, surrounding fluids and hydrate. The natural level of salinity increases with depth in a reservoir. In addition formation of hydrate will lead to increased salinity of the fluids surrounding the formed hydrate. This may lead to liquid pockets of residual aqueous solution with increased salinity as well as very non-uniform hydrate. The latter due to the fact that hydrate composition and stability relates to properties of surrounding fluids. In the work presented here methane hydrates were formed in several sandstone cores. The cores were all partially saturated with brine of different salinities in order to identify the effect salinity has on the fill fraction, the amount of methane per available structural site in hydrates. The results indicate that salinities lower than regular sea water composition has no significant impact on the fill fraction of methane hydrate in porous media. When the salinity surpasses regular sea water composition there is a significant drop in fill fraction. The methane hydrate fill fraction is dominated by total brine salinity rather than brine distribution in the core...|$|R

As they maintain their flexibility at elevated temperatures, which are typical in gas turbines, high density brush seals made of super-alloy bristles found popularity among engine designers. Inherent flexibility of brush seals allows fibers to compact under pressure load. Due to the frictional {{interaction between the}} fibers and the backing plate as well as within the fibers themselves, brush seals are known to exhibit pressure stiffening and hysteresis behavior. While hysteresis affects seal performance after a rotor excursion, pressure stiffening is critical in determining heat generation and seal wear during hard rubs. Typically brush-rotor contact occurs at very high surface speeds. If not managed properly, high contact loads may result in extreme wear and damage to rotor. In order to ensure engine operational <b>safety</b> brush <b>seal</b> stiffness should be controlled through seal design and detail analysis. In addition to the physical complexity of these dense brush structures, frictional contacts among the bristles themselves, between the bristles and the support plates, and between the bristles tips and the high speed rotor further increase the analysis complexity, {{and make it a}} major undertaking if not impossible. The complicated nature of bristle behavior under various combinations of pressure load and rotor interference requires computer analysis to study details that may not be available through analytical formulations. This work presents a 3 -D computational brush seal structural FE model {{that can be used to}} calculate bristle forces. The analysis includes a representative brush segment with bristles formed by 3 -D beam elements. Bristle interlocking and frictional interactions (interbristle, bristle-backing plate and bristle-rotor) are included to better simulate pressure-stiffness coupling. The results indicate that rotor interference has some effect on seal tip forces in the absence of any pressure loading. However, upon application of small pressure loads, seal stiffness is generally dominated by pressure-stiffness coupling...|$|R
40|$|The win-win {{situation}} of CO 2 storage in natural gas hydrate reservoirs is attractive {{for several reasons}} {{in addition to the}} associated natural gas production. Since both pure CO 2 and pure methane form structure I hydrate there is no expected volume change by replacing the in situ methane with CO 2, and there is not net production of associated water which requires extra handling. The geo-mechanical implication of the first of these may be a very important issue since hydrates in unconsolidated sediments are the most promising targets for exploitation of natural gas. The stability of CO 2 stored in the form of hydrate {{is probably one of the}} safest options today, even though also this option relates to <b>safety</b> of <b>sealing</b> cap-rock or clay layer. The stability of hydrates in a reservoir depends on many factors, including the interactions between minerals, surrounding fluids and hydrate. The natural level of salinity increases with depth in a reservoir. In addition formation of hydrate will lead to increased salinity of the fluids surrounding the formed hydrate. This may lead to liquid pockets of residual aqueous solution with increased salinity as well as very non-uniform hydrate. The latter due to the fact that hydrate composition and stability relates to properties of surrounding fluids. In the work presented here methane hydrates were formed in several sandstone cores. The cores were all partially saturated with brine of different salinities in order to identify the effect salinity has on the fill fraction, the amount of methane per available structural site in hydrates. The results indicate that salinities lower than regular sea water composition has no significant impact on the fill fraction of methane hydrate in porous media. When the salinity surpasses regular sea water composition there is a significant drop in fill fraction. The methane hydrate fill fraction is dominated by total brine salinity rather than brine distribution in the core...|$|R
