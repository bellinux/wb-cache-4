40|$|Abstract—An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the measured distributions of the fade slope of rain attenuation, conditional for attenuation values, measured at Eindhoven University of Technology from the satellite Olympus. It is found that the distribution is similar for positive and negative fade slopes and independent of frequency {{in the range from}} 12 to 30 GHz. A distribution model for the condi-tional distribution is found. The only parameter of the distribution is the standard deviation, which is found to be proportional to at-tenuation level and dependent on rain type, on the low-pass filter bandwidth and on the time interval used in the slope calculation. The observed relation between the standard deviation and attenu-ation is compared with results from other measurement sites. From this comparison it is found that the fade slope standard deviation is likely to depend on elevation angle and on climate, through its dependence on rain type.

The channel had hired a transponder on the Russian Ekran <b>satellite,</b> with an <b>up-link</b> from the USSR. Later, the company hired a transponder on the Rimsat satellite, and shifted the up-link to Subic Bay in the Philippines and then to Manila. Initially, the transmission time was only three hours per day which was gradually increased to 12 hours per day {{by the end of}} 1994 and later to round the clock broadcasting. In early 1995, the uplink was shifted to Singapore where it attained full operational status. With a change in the broadcasting policies of the Government of India, Asianet started an up-link from Chennai through VSNL. From 15 July 2002, Asianet had its own earth station at the Asianet Studio Complex in Puliyarakonam, Thiruvananthapuram. Over the course of more than two decades of operations, Asianet has developed its own in-house production facilities and now has full-fledged production studios in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Design {{procedure}} for a modified Composite Right/Left Handed (CRLH) unit cell is represented. The ferroelectric interdigital capacitor (IDC) {{is used as}} a tuned capacitor, and spiral inductor is utilized to implement inductors. A modified CRLH unit cell is attained by moving the shunt inductor of conventional unit cell to both ends with doubled values. In this manner, only one bias network would be required for each unit cell. The parameters of the designed unit cell are obtained so that the Bloch impedance to be equal to 50 Ω and the Bloch propagation constant to have one zero at the operational frequency. The operational frequency is chosen equal to 11. 45 GHz, which is in the Ku-band and in middle of the <b>up-link</b> <b>satellite</b> communications. To design the modified unit cell, initially, the unit cell without a shunt capacitor is constructed. This would result in Π-model structure for which the element dimensions are varied to reach the desired values. Next, the shunt capacitor is added to the model and its length is varied until the balanced condition is achieved. 1...|$|R
40|$|Current {{integrity}} {{concepts such}} as the GIC (Galileo Integrity Concept) and the SBAS integrity concept are based on integrity indicators that are computed exclusively on ground, uplink to the <b>satellites</b> from the <b>Up-Link</b> Stations (ULS) and broadcast from the satellites as originally computed in the ground segment. This paper presents two new concepts based {{on the possibility of}} intercepting the integrity information inside the satellite, the "Satellite autonomous on-board orbit monitoring" and the "Satellite autonomous on-board clock monitoring" concepts, which could be traced univocally to non-existing Space Segment functionalities and which would be in position of: • Accessing to local information, not available on ground, which could be used to detect the existence of non-nominal Signal-In-Space (SIS). Such local information includes clock environment, other local clocks, inertial measurement units, satellite thrusters control information or Clock monitoring & Control Unit (CMCU) phase noise observables. • Detecting non-nominal SIS sooner than with the current baseline, improving the time-to-alert (TTA). • Potentially using inter-satellite links observables, which implies range and doppler measurements not affected by atmospheric delays and ground local degradation (including multipath and interference). Cleaner measurements could permit to define sharper barriers or making the Signal In Space Monitoring Accuracy compatible with lower a-priori probability of non-nominal SIS. • Adding independent barriers for the detection of hazardously misleading SIS information. The new satellite on-board integrity monitoring algorithms will be described. Then, the results of the experimentation campaign, carried out with synthetic data generated with simulation tools defined and implemented by GMV and INRIM, will be presented to demonstrate the performance of the new satellite on-board monitoring algorithms. Furthermore, an introduction of 'on board clock ensemble' will be made. This clock ensemble shall offer very robust solutions, high reliability and autonomous integrity monitoring and autonomous redundancy. Since the switch-over of defective or unstable clocks of the ensemble could be made without upload of new clock model, this solution will keep the satellite operational in any conditions of clocks anomalies. Finally, the experimentation results will be to assess the capability of the new satellite autonomous integrity concepts to diminish the non-nominal Signal-In-Space "a priori" probability and to reduce the TTA; resulting as a consequence on a increase of service integrity availability...|$|R
40|$|The quantum {{space age}} has officially begun and many {{important}} milestones and achievements {{have recently been}} demonstrated, such as the exciting launch and results of the first quantum demonstration satellite, Micius. Previously with terrestrial applications, quantum key distribution was limited in distance to a few hundred kilometers through either free space or optical fiber. This had dampened progress towards a global quantum cryptographic network, but with the recent progress towards space implemented quantum systems, the door has been opened once again. In this thesis, we begin by studying the effect of using an adaptive optics system to improve the efficiency of a free space link to a satellite for quantum key distribution. Adaptive optics has been used extensively in astronomy and {{has the potential to}} increase the average optical intensity received by the satellite. We study the effect of the atmosphere on the beam as it propagates from the ground station to the <b>satellite.</b> In the <b>up-link</b> configuration, the atmosphere is of special concern as it affects the beam {{at the beginning of the}} propagation, making the end effect worse. One of the important components of a free space quantum key distribution satellite system is a fine pointing unit. We have, along with industry partners, designed and implemented such a unit for free space optical links. The device was designed to have little to no effect on the polarization of the photons used to transmit the key bits. The device was tested, both in the laboratory and outside and quantum key distribution was successfully performed while the fine pointing was active. The main experiment of the thesis demonstrates quantum key distribution to a moving airplane from a ground station. The components of a quantum key distribution receiver prototype were tested locally around the University of Waterloo campus as well as some tests using private airplanes. The collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada really allowed the project to take flight by granting us access to a research aircraft to deploy our receiver prototype. This project spanned over three years and culminated in a two week flight campaign out of Ottawa and Smiths Falls Ontario. Using only five flight hours we were able to successfully transmit finite size quantum secure keys from our optical ground station, located at Smiths Falls [...] Montague Airport to a Twin Otter Research Aircraft housing our quantum key distribution receiver prototype. Many of the components implemented in the receiver were designed and built with spaceflight in mind and have a clear path to flight for space application. Finally, we study the feasibility of implementing a quantum key distribution receiver onto a nano satellite. In partnership with the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies Space Flight Laboratory, we studied the various aspects such as optics, detection, cooling, power, mass, etc., to determine if it would be possible to perform quantum key distribution to a nano satellite. The main difference of this project from the previous Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite is the simpler pointing system, which doesn't utilize fine pointing. Through various studies, experiments, and component design, we have shown the feasibility of implementing quantum key distribution to a moving aircraft in an up-link configuration. This work contributes to the long line of achievements leading towards satellite implementations of quantum key distribution for eventual global quantum cryptography...|$|R

The proposed equalizer exhibits enhanced performance compared to other techniques, including Volterra equalizers and neural network equaliz-ers. Moreover, this gain in performance is obtained at a substantially lower computational cost. Secondly, a new constellation shaping tech-nique, which efficiently and effectively reduces the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, is proposed.
