5000|$|The {{macroeconomic}} {{program was}} based on several key assumptions, the most important being that the manufacturing sector had ample underutilized capacity. The lack of full utilization was, in turn, attributed to two fundamental factors: the monopolistic nature of the manufacturing industry {{and the structure of}} income distribution. Based on this diagnosis, influenced by Keynesian ideas of support to aggregate demand, it was thought that if income were redistributed toward the poorer groups through wage increases and if prices were properly controlled, there would be a significant expansion of demand and output. This provided the theoretical basis for the belief that large fiscal deficits would not necessarily be inflationary [...] Regarding inflation, the UP program placed blame on <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities</b> (namely, slow or no response of quantity supplied to price increases), bottlenecks, and the role of monopolistic pricing, and it played down the role of fiscal pressures and money creation.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} role of <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities</b> in recent labour market {{performances}} in Europe through various and complementary angles in five essays. By <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities,</b> we mean a lasting feature caused {{by a set of}} institutions, which prevents a market from operating efficiently. The approach is essentially empirical and macro-economic, while the scope of the analysis is definitely European, which is technically reflected in the use of either euro area aggregates or panels and cross-sections of European countries.

40|$|The {{development}} {{experience of}} a number of African and other developing countries has been characterized by policies of market interventions, agricultural taxation, and stateled industrialization in import substituting sectors. This paper investigates the potential implications of these policies for the current account and public debt of a small open economy with <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities.</b> I find that the current account dynamics associated with unsustainable public debt creation and distortionary tax finance of the government budget are nonunique, possibly nonmonotonic, and sensitive to private expectations regarding future policy. The paper also shows that in the presence of adjustment frictions, distortionary tax finance of government expending could lead to nonmonotonic government debt dynamics with an initial fall followed by an unsustainable expansion. Thus, short horizon government policies could lead to explosive public debt dynamics. This possibility seems pertinent for a number of African countries where the constant threats of military coups and political overthrow are unlikely to have been conducive to fostering governments with long horizons.

40|$|A {{reduction}} in the legal workweek may induce a degree of downward wage flexibility, while an employment subsidy to firms accommodates downward wage rigidity. It may be possible, therefore, to increase employment with a policy that combines a {{reduction in}} the workweek with an employment subsidy. In general, however, the long-run employment outcome is ambiguous, and a decline in output cannot be ruled out. More direct policy measures whose impact can be assessed with greater certainty—in particular, removing <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities</b> in the labor market—should be given priority to decrease long term unemployment. ...|$|E

In the first scenario, characterized by severe <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities,</b> the contractionary effects of exchange rate appreciation dominate the expansionary effects, so that gross domestic product and employment fall and the external surplus declines only slightly. In the alternative case of free movement of goods, services, and factors, the expansionary effects of the appreciation become more prominent as supply and demand respond much more readily to the relative price changes. ...|$|E

This essay explores the relationship between globalization and democracy, which is neither linear nor characterized by <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities.</b> It seeks to analyze how globalization might constrain degrees of freedom for nation states and space for democratic politics, and how political democracy within countries might exercise some checks and balances on markets and globalization. The essential argument is that the relationship between globalization and democracy is dialectical and does not conform to ideological caricatures...|$|E

40|$|In {{a sample}} of 32 {{countries}} in Latin America and the Caribbean, the evidence indicates {{the existence of a}} kinked supply curve, implying positive demand shocks feed predominantly into prices while negative demand shocks mainly affect output.

The analysis highlights the benefits of eliminating <b>structural</b> <b>rigidities</b> responsible for the kinked nature of the supply curve and points to the dangers of pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies. ...|$|E
