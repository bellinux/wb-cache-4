25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes <b>sumping</b> (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} <b>sump</b> {{design of}} Rolls-Royce AE 3007 central <b>sump</b> is a tangential <b>sump.</b> An experimental program at Purdue University {{was conducted to}} investigate {{the characteristics of a}} tangential <b>sump</b> design. The research employed a bespoke experimental rig consisting of modular transparent chamber to allow unprecedented view of the two-phase flow inside the bearing chamber. It was found that a persistent liquid pooling near the drain entrance of a tangential <b>sump</b> obstructs the outflow to the scavenge off-take. While space requirement is minimal, the scavenge performance of a tangential <b>sump</b> is poor. A prototype advanced <b>sump</b> was proposed and built with features to address various issues found in the tangential <b>sump.</b> In this paper, further experimental work on the refinements of the advanced <b>sump</b> is presented. This includes experimental study on the effect of a fence and splitter plate, off-take hole diameter and its location, the effect of gravity by tilting, upstream wall fairing, as well as the depth of the <b>sump</b> itself. The experiments showed that the faired upstream wall modification can reduce residence volume significantly across different operating conditions, indicating improvement in scavenge performance. The other modifications help to reduce residence volume only in certain operating conditions. The results of this study helped towards the birth of an optimized <b>sump</b> design, known as Indy <b>sump.</b> The Indy <b>sump</b> has been accepted as a superior <b>sump</b> design and {{has been used as a}} benchmark in many <b>sump</b> design studies...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in 1961, the {{landfill}} received liquid industrial waste for disposal. The types of liquid waste included paints, thinners, and coagulated solvent sludge.

50|$|As liquid {{enters the}} {{landfill}} cell, it {{moves down the}} filter, passes through the pipe network, and rests in the <b>sump.</b> As collection systems are planned, the number, location, {{and size of the}} <b>sumps</b> are vital to an efficient operation. When designing <b>sumps,</b> the amount of leachate and liquid expected is the foremost concern. Areas in which rainfall is higher than average typically have larger <b>sumps.</b> A further criterion for <b>sump</b> planning is accounting for the pump capacity. The relationship of pump capacity and <b>sump</b> size is inverse. If the pump capacity is low, the volume of the <b>sump</b> should be larger than average. It is critical for the volume of the <b>sump</b> to be able to store the expected leachate between pumping cycles. This relationship helps maintain a healthy operation. <b>Sump</b> pumps can function with preset phase times. If the flow is not predictable, a predetermined leachate height level can automatically switch the system on. Other conditions for <b>sump</b> planning are maintenance and pump drawdown. Collection pipes typically convey the leachate by gravity to one or more <b>sumps,</b> depending upon the size of the area drained. Leachate collected in the <b>sump</b> is removed by pumping to a vehicle, to a holding facility for subsequent vehicle pickup, or to an on-site treatment facility. <b>Sump</b> dimensions are governed by the amount of leachate to be stored, pump capacity, and minimum pump drawdown. The volume of the <b>sump</b> must be sufficient to hold the maximum amount of leachate anticipated between pump cycles, plus an additional volume equal to the minimum pump drawdown volume. <b>Sump</b> size should also consider dimensional requirements for conducting maintenance and inspection activities. <b>Sump</b> pumps may operate with preset cycling times or, if leachate flow is less predictable, the pump may be automatically switched on when the leachate reaches a predetermined level.|$|R
5000|$|Fitimaen {{is a form}} of stick-fighting from Buru in the Maluku Islands. The term {{comes from}} the Buru word maen which means stick. The maen are either made from rattan or from native hardwood, of which there are {{hundreds}} of varieties. Sparring sessions are short to minimise injury, and training is carefully conducted for the same reason. They may be fought with one or a pair of sticks, the length of which depends on personal preference. The first written attestation of fitimaen comes from a British naturalist who recounts that the natives are [...] "adepts at quarterstaff" [...] and that even children [...] "practice with singular skill their cuts and thrusts". While spears and metal knives were also used by the Buru Alifuru for fighting, their preference has always been the fighting staff. Donn F. Draeger calls them the best stick and staff fighters in the whole of Indonesia although not a particularly combative community. The blowpipe (<b>sumping)</b> and bow and arrow could also be used for warfare but are generally hunting implements. Two styles of fitimaen are dominant, one from Namlea and the other from Leksula.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2010. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Heinz Stefan, Omid Mohseni. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 58 pages. Ill. (some col.) There are many standard <b>sumps</b> in urban stormsewer systems that may {{qualify as a}} best management practice to pre-treat stormwater runoff by removing suspended sediment from the water. However, no data {{on the effectiveness of}} sediment removal and required maintenance schedules of standard <b>sumps</b> exist. Such data could justify providing pollution prevention credits for the use of standard <b>sumps.</b> The goals of this study are to (1) evaluate several standard <b>sump</b> configurations for sediment capture and washout; (2) develop sediment capture and washout functions for the assessment and design of standard <b>sumps</b> as stormwater treatment devices; and (3) design a retrofit for standard <b>sumps</b> to increase sediment capture and decrease washout. To determine how much suspended sediment they remove from stormwater runoff, two standard <b>sumps</b> of different size and a scale model <b>sump</b> were tested in a laboratory setting. Removal efficiency under low flow conditions as well as sediment washout rate under high flow conditions was measured. The <b>sumps</b> did remove suspended sediment at low flows, but at high flows the washout was substantial. A porous baffle, named SAFL Baffle, was designed and tested as a possible retrofit to the standard <b>sump.</b> Results indicate that, with the correct baffle configuration, the washout of sediments accumulated in the <b>sump</b> can be nearly eliminated for flows up to approximately the 10 -year design storm runoff, and removal efficiency can be increased by 10 to 15 %.

A sediment removal efficiency function and a washout function were developed from the experimental data using the scaling parameter.
