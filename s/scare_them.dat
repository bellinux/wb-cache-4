On the first day, his supervisor Delilah (Cissy Jones) contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks that he investigate illegal fireworks at a nearby lake. There he detects teenage girls skinny dipping, who accuse him of leering. On his way back, he finds a locked gate in a cave and spots a shrouded figure. Henry discovers his watchtower ransacked at arrival. The next day, Delilah sends him to a downed communication line. It is found cut, along with {{a message from the}} girls.

When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg.

They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes.

Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins to transform the house into a posh modern art piece. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and the usual overworked caseworkers. The Maitlands' own caseworker, Juno, informs them that they must remain {{in the house for}} 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to <b>scare</b> <b>them</b> away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove counterproductive, despite their ability to shape-shift into monsters.|$|E

25|$|In many regions, bhoots are {{supposed}} to fear water and steel or iron objects, so keeping those nearby is believed to <b>scare</b> <b>them</b> off. The scent of burnt turmeric is also said to ward them off. As is typical of ghosts throughout the world, invoking the name of holy figures and deities is also said to repel bhoots. In some regions, sprinkling earth on oneself is said to shield against bhoots.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy predators use against schooling fish is first to <b>scare</b> <b>them</b> into forming a bait ball. Strategies {{such as those}} outlined {{in the previous section}} can work to a degree against freely streaming fish schools, but work much better if the fish school is first compacted into a bait ball. It is difficult for predators working individually to scare a fish school into a bait ball, and they usually work together.|$|E

25|$|Their long claws {{are their}} only defense against predators. A cornered sloth may swipe at its attackers {{in an effort}} to <b>scare</b> <b>them</b> away or wound them. Despite their {{apparent}} defenselessness, predators do not pose special problems: sloths blend in with the trees and, moving only slowly, do not attract attention. Only during their rare visits to the ground do they become vulnerable. The main predators of sloths are jaguars, ocelots, harpy eagles, and humans. The majority of recorded sloth deaths in Costa Rica are due to contact with electrical lines and poachers. Their claws also provide another, unexpected deterrent to human hunters; when hanging upside-down in a tree, they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do not fall down even if shot from below.|$|E
25|$|With no {{alteration}} in the government's stance, {{there was}} already talk of the council adopting illegal tactics in its 1984 budgeting, and on 19 March the District Auditor Les Stanford wrote to every councillor warning that the consequences of not setting a legal rate was a budget crisis, with surcharge and disqualification for councillors. A group of six Labour councillors {{under the leadership of}} Eddie Roderick declared they would not approve an illegal budget, but the majority of the Labour group thought the letter was a tactic to <b>scare</b> <b>them</b> into backing down. The council leadership put forward an illegal budget on 29 March; after an eight-hour meeting, Roderick put forward an amendment to delay setting a budget until 11 April to let officers prepare a legal one. A suggestion that council leader John Hamilton and chair of Finance Tony Byrne form an emergency committee to control finances in the interim was accepted but the delaying amendment fell: it had the support of the Conservatives and six councillors in Roderick's group but the Liberal councillors opposed it and supporters of the council leadership abstained. Instead the six Labour rebels, 30 Liberals and 18 Conservatives voted to postpone consideration.|$|E

While they were outside the courthouse waiting to take the test, a group of white farmers from the area heard what was happening and tried to <b>scare</b> <b>them</b> off.
