5|$|She {{was renamed}} Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to {{disassociate}} her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945. She spent the post-war period on routine training missions. She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged {{from the government}} after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; one says that she was converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.|$|E
5|$|The tale shows Potter at {{her best}} in {{depicting}} {{the life of}} the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one of something more than just local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based– the foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable– is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{question}} as regards Shakespeare's Cressida is centralised around whether <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a [...] "whore", or if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> more complex, and worth further attention {{due to her}} obvious intelligence and duality.|$|R
50|$|Danny and Chandler clash {{over the}} {{affections}} of Xian. Danny acts aggressively but Chandler interviews {{that he has}} no intention of jeopardizing his place with the agency by fighting. Xian interviews that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a flirt.|$|R
5|$|The {{power of}} the Aksumite Kingdom {{declined}} after the 6th century due {{to the rise of}} other regional states in the Horn of Africa. Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure Gudit (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum. The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk Tekle Haymanot, who compiled historical writings gathered from various Ethiopian churches and monasteries. The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to Judaism. The Scottish travel writer James Bruce (1730–1794) was incredulous about the tale and believed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> a Jewish queen. Carlo Conti Rossini (1872–1949) hypothesized that she was an ethnic Sidamo from Damot, whereas Steven Kaplan argues she was a non-Christian invader and historian Knud Tage Andersen contends she was a regular member of the Aksumite royal house who shrewdly seized the throne. The latter is more in line with another legend that claims Dil Na'od, the last king of Aksum, kept his daughter Mesobe Werq in isolation out of fear of a prophecy that her son would overthrow him, yet she eloped with the nobleman Mara Takla Haymanot from Lasta who eventually killed the Aksumite king in a duel, took the throne and founded the Zagwe dynasty. The latter {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood periods of Ethiopia's recorded history. What is known is that the early Zagwe kings were polytheistic, eventually converted to Christianity, and ruled over the northern Highlands of Ethiopia, while Islamic sultanates inhabited the coastal Ethiopian Lowlands.|$|E
25|$|Information {{about the}} Sabaudias war-time service is conflicting. She was {{converted}} to a troopship, but no information is available about her capacity in that function. Most sources claim that she {{was used as a}} troopship by the Regia Marina without specifying the campaigns she participated in, while others state <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> laid up at Trieste after conversion.|$|E
25|$|Tabloids {{from the}} time claimed that, at some point after her infant {{daughter}} and husband both died, a Boston medium told her (while supposedly channeling her late husband) that she should leave her home in New Haven and travel West, where she must continuously build a home for herself and the spirits {{of people who had}} fallen victim to Winchester rifles. Winchester left New Haven and headed for California. Though it is possible <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by ghosts, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits.|$|E
5000|$|Her son Oliver Holt {{has denied}} that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> reclusive, {{pointing}} out that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> private, and [...] "one {{of the last of}} a dying breed of old-fashioned actresses who do it for the love of acting, not for all the attendant publicity".|$|R

25|$|In a 1995 noncanonical short-story prequel to Mortal Kombat 3, {{sponsored}} by CD Projekt {{and published by}} Polish magazine Secret Service, Jade is defeated after a hard fight with Sub-Zero, who then freezes and shatters her. She was a recurring guest character in the Mortal Kombat series published by Malibu Comics, first in the 1995 miniseries Battlewave, in which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> an evil assassin serving Shao Kahn and had no connection to Kitana, instead being paired regularly with fellow Mortal Kombat II hidden character Smoke. She was identical to Kitana only in that she was brunette with light skin, and employed a pair of steel fans, while her green palette was unchanged. Jade and Smoke unsuccessfully attempt to kill Jax and Johnny Cage aboard a plane headed to Outworld. In the finale of the 1995 three-issue miniseries Rayden and Kano, she and Smoke try to redeem themselves by killing Raiden, but again fail.|$|E
500|$|Danger: Diabolik began filming on April 11, 1967. Roger Vadim {{suggested}} to De Laurentiis that he cast his ex-fiancée Catherine Deneuve as Eva Kant. Law noted that Bava was against this idea and felt personally that Deneuve was {{wrong for the}} role, noting that [...] "there was no chemistry between us. She was very sweet, {{and a very good}} actress, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> not right for the part." [...] After one week of shooting with Deneuve, both Bava and De Laurentiis felt that she should be replaced. Bava was given the opportunity to cast the role, and narrowed his choices to Marilù Tolo and Marisa Mell, with Mell eventually getting the role.|$|E
500|$|Kaganovich (...) was a Project 26bis2 [...] of the Soviet Navy {{that was}} built during World War II. She was built in Siberia from {{components}} shipped from European Russia. She saw no action {{during the war and}} served into the Cold War. She was renamed Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to distinguish her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. Her post-war career was generally uneventful, although her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon in 1957. She was renamed Petropavlovsk (...) in 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; some say that she was converted into a floating barracks in 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> sold for scrap in 1960.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{paintings}} are conceived without perspective and are brightly colored with many figures included. Judy Blundell said, [...] "Any symbolism is straightforward and honest.

5000|$|Austra, in the {{beginning}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> Anne's maid and friend but undergoes the sedoi test and has part in Anne's development and her part in the final play is important.

500|$|Reports of {{the reasons}} behind Lehzen's {{departure}} varied; court diarist Charles Greville noted she was leaving [...] "for her health (as she says), to stay five or six months, but it is supposed never to return." [...] The Times however reported that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> visiting friends in Germany. After her departure, family adviser Baron Stockmar remarked of the affair thatt was not without great difficulty that the Prince succeeded in getting rid of [...] She was foolish enough to contest his influence, and not to conform herself to the change in her position... If she had done so, and conciliated the P, she might have remained in the Palace {{to the end of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after losing}} the Green Party nomination, Barr {{announced}} that she would run on the Peace and Freedom Party [...] ticket with activist Cindy Sheehan as her running mate. On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party. Barr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein, leading Sheehan to request her name taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was told {{it was too late}} to have her name removed, so she instead announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> leaving the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Maura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the {{development}} of the character ahead of season 12 saying, [...] "When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life. She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman — and she will be just fine." ...|$|E
5000|$|Susana San Juan dies: She refuses {{absolution}} by the priest. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> {{waiting for}} death {{to come and}} take her.

She dies without receiving the last sacraments.|$|R
5000|$|Schoenbaum {{also notes}} that Curzon {{seemingly}} {{did not know the}} name of Shakespeare's wife (as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> called [...] "Shakespear's Consort").

500|$|During {{the last}} year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became {{friendly}} with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending Mary Lyon's Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (which later became Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, about ten miles (16km) from Amherst. She was at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there. The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> homesick. Whatever the specific reason for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to [...] "bring [...] home at all events". Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities. She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.|$|E
500|$|In early {{seasons of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and {{occasionally}} for the damsel in distress plot device, {{which would require}} series' heroine Buffy to save her. Any concerns that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential. In {{an article about the}} psychology of characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Steven C. Schlozman writes about how [...] "Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander." [...] He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and [...] "all the characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deyan Sudjic of The Guardian {{described}} Hadid as [...] "an {{architect who}} first imagined, then proved, that space {{could work in}} radical new ways...Throughout her career, she was a dedicated teacher, enthused by {{the energy of the}} young. She was not keen to be characterised as a woman architect, or an Arab architect. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> an architect." ...|$|E
5000|$|What Yuki-onna {{is after}} varies from tale to tale. Sometimes <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> {{satisfied}} {{to see a}} victim die. Other times, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> more vampiric, draining her victims' blood or [...] "life force." [...] She occasionally takes on a Succubus-like manner, preying on weak-willed men to drain or freeze them through sex or a kiss.|$|R
2500|$|The story's {{epigraph}} {{is taken}} from Chapter 4 of Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll: [...] "And if he left off dreaming about you...". It comes from the passage in which Tweedledee points out the sleeping Red King to Alice, and claims <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a character in his dream.|$|R
5000|$|Years later, her son Cal visits her. Cal’s {{goodness}} makes Kate uncomfortable, {{especially when}} he states his love for his father, Adam: “a curious spasm shook Kate [...] - [...] an aching twist tore in her chest.” After a brief conversation, Cal leaves, telling Kate that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> afraid.|$|R
2500|$|Steele {{never saw}} a {{complete}} screenplay for the film. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> handed the scenes she would play, and her dialogue, every morning of the production.

2500|$|Some {{historian}}s doubt Wilson's account, since {{other things}} that he told the historian proved false. Also, in the will he made out just prior to his disappearance, he left everything to his [...] "beloved wife" [...] and daughter. Other settlers declared that Harrod [...] "almost worshiped" [...] his wife. Interestingly, Ann was granted an annulment of her third marriage in April 1804 {{on the grounds that}} her previous husband was still living. It is not clear whether Ann had contact with Harrod following his disappearance or if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> seeking a means of escaping an undesirable marriage.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{conflicting}} accounts, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> {{allowed to}} go free, or detained at Malmaison prison before her declining health made the authorities commit her to Nicolae Gh. Lupu's clinic, ultimately assigning her house arrest in a Bucharest lodging she shared with her mother. She lacked the means to support herself, and was cared for by her friends and family. After his People's Court trial and just prior to his June 1946 execution for war crimes, Ion Antonescu met his wife one final time, handing her his watch with the request that she imagine [...] "it is my heart beating", and never let it stop.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, {{she took}} {{on the part of}} Lady Chiltern in An Ideal Husband, of which the Theatre Record said [...] "Others have played this pure, cool, idealistic, {{demanding}} role with more authority and finesse, but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> right for it". In 2001, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Irina in a new West End theatre production of Uncle Vanya directed by Peter Gill.|$|R
60|$|Such {{passages}} suggest {{not only}} genius {{but also a}} keen, sympathetic observer, whose eyes see every significant detail.
