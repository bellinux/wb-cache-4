Whatsername attempts to talk about Johnny's behavior, while the Extraordinary Girl dresses Tunny's wounds and Will <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> once again alone ("21 Guns"). Johnny leaves a note for Whatsername, saying he has chosen Jimmy and drugs over her.

5000|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on 7 July 2016. The video opens with an extended sequence resembling David Lynch's short film Rabbits. Lead singer Matt Healy walks into a living room in clown makeup, which was previously seen in the music video for [...] "A Change of Heart", while a woman <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> in a collapsed position. Like in Rabbits, Healy's actions in the room seem randomly soundtracked by a studio laugh track, including whoops, hollers and applause. He removes his clown makeup, <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and speaks in an exceptionally distorted, unintelligble voice to the woman before leaving again. As the song begins, the video shifts its tone by moving into colour footage. Healy tries to deal with heartbreak on a night alone, by crying, drinking, dancing and eventually {{having sex with a}} stripper {{in the back seat of}} an automobile. Near the end, Healy seems to come to his senses and realizes that not only is he hallucinating most of his interactions with others in these situations, but that some of the other people are copies of himself (in the case of the stripper, he finds himself alone in the backseat, stroking his own face and chest.) The video was based on a story that Healy wrote.|$|E
