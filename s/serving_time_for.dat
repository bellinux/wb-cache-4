500|$|Newsweek {{magazine}} {{stated that}} the media may have become more skeptical of [...] "herd mentality" [...] and open to alternative suspects after the Levy case. The D.C. police claimed {{that they would have}} discovered Levy's body earlier, if not for a miscommunication regarding the scope of the search.

Both the Chief of Detectives, Jack Barrett, and the Chief of Police, Charles H. Ramsey, have since left the force in D.C. Ramsey became head of the Philadelphia Police Department; Barrett, who became an analyst for an intelligence support firm in Arlington, Virginia, stated in hindsight that the media had imposed [...] "enormous amounts of pressure" [...] on the D.C. police.

500|$|In any case, {{the aging}} blind blues player Jimmie Strothers {{recorded}} the song, as [...] "The Blood-Strained Banders", sometimes called [...] "Keep Away from the Bloodstained Banders", for Alan Lomax and Harold Spivacke {{on behalf of}} the Library of Congress in June 1936. [...] (The name was probably a corruption of [...] "Blood Stained Bandits".) [...] Strothers accompanied himself on four-string banjo, an instrument upon which his skill was well regarded. [...] Coming from the Appalachian part of Virginia, Strothers had lost his sight in a mine explosion and had made a living playing on street corners and in medicine shows. [...] Blind, itinerant street singers like Strothers were part of the tradition that kept African-American religious music alive. [...] The recording was made at the Virginia State Prison Farm near Goochland, Virginia, where Strothers was <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> having murdered his wife. (Although sometimes described as having murdered his wife with an axe, in letters to Governor of Virginia James H. Price requesting pardon Strothers wrote that he shot his wife with a pistol in self-defense. The pardon was granted in 1939.) Lomax thought prisons were a good place to find old songs, and was also interested in illustrating the interaction of white and black music. This haunting recording was part of what Allmusic describes as a [...] "group of songs that explore the boundaries between the sacred and the profane." ...|$|E

Criminologist professor James Alan Fox assets that {{this is to be}} expected as illegal immigrants who tend to be poor [...] "will have a higher rate of individuals in prison" [...] as there is a correlation between social class and criminality, a correlation between social class and the probability to being sent to prison for the same crime as compared to people in a higher social class, and inadequate legal representation for the poor.|$|E
