5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
25|$|Australia's 11 {{million square}} {{kilometre}} fishing zone {{is the third}} {{largest in the world}} and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods. Lobster, prawns, tuna, salmon and abalone are the main ocean species harvested commercially, while aquaculture produces more than 60 species for consumption, including oysters, salmonoids, <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> mussels, prawns, barramundi, yellowtail kingfish, and freshwater finifish. While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide some unique fresh water game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy.|$|E
2500|$|Fish farming can enclose {{the entire}} {{breeding}} {{cycle of the}} fish, with fish being bred in captivity. Some fish prove difficult to breed in captivity and can {{be caught in the}} wild as juveniles and brought into captivity to increase their weight. With scientific progress more species are being made to breed in captivity. [...] This was the case with <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> which were first bred in captivity in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The oxygen {{dissociation}} curves for <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> show {{a reverse}} temperature effect between 10 and(-) 23 C, and temperature insensitivity between 23 and(-) 36 C. Reverse temperature shift might prevent premature oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin {{as it is}} warmed in rete mirabile. Root effect and a large Bohr factor were also observed at 23 C.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> are thermo-conserving and can {{function}} {{over a wide}} range of temperature conditions, which allows them to dive {{from the surface of the}} water to depths of 1000 m, in only a few minutes. They forage in temperate waters of the southern hemisphere oceans, during winter in Australia, and migrate to tropical areas in the north-western Indian Ocean, from spring to autumn, for the spawning season. Their preferred temperature range is 18-20 C, with most of their time (91%) spent below 21 C. <b>Southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> experience a wide range of ambient water temperatures, from a minimum of 2.6 C to a maximum of 30.4 C. All species of tuna are reported to spawn in water temperatures above 24 C. [...] However, 24 C is outside, or at the upper limit, of temperature tolerances for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> Large individuals have been found to withstand temperatures of less than 10 C and as low as 7 C for over 10 hours, possibly to search for prey. [...] During the day they migrate through depths between 150-600 m, but at night they stay in waters that are 50 m or less in depth.|$|R
50|$|This {{wide range}} of {{temperature}} and depth changes poses {{a challenge to the}} respiratory and circulatory systems of the <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> Tunas swim continuously and at high speeds and, therefore, have a high demand for oxygen. The oxygen concentration in the water changes with the change in temperature, being lower at high temperatures. Tunas are, however, driven by the availability of food, not by thermal properties of water. <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tunas,</b> unlike other species of tunas, maintain a fairly constant red muscle (swimming muscle) temperature over a {{wide range of}} ambient temperatures. So, in addition to being endotherms, <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> are also thermoregulators. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> {{aquaculture}} {{was first}} initiated in Australia in 1990 through a collaborative {{research and development}} program involving the Australian <b>Southern</b> <b>Bluefin</b> <b>Tuna</b> Industry Association (ASBTIA), previously the Tuna Boat Owners Association of Australia (TBOASA), the Japanese Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation and the South Australian Government. <b>Southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> is the most valuable sector of South Australia’s aquaculture industry and {{is represented by the}} Australian <b>Southern</b> <b>Bluefin</b> <b>Tuna</b> Industry Association (ASBTIA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> migrate {{between a}} variety of {{different}} ocean regions, however the osmotic conditions faced by the tuna stay relatively similar. This species of tuna inhabits ocean areas that are relatively high in salinity compared {{to the rest of the}} world’s oceans. Like other marine teleost fish, the <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> maintain a constant ion concentration in both their intracellular and extracellular fluids. This regulation of an internal ion concentration classifies <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> as osmoregulators.|$|E
50|$|The {{blood of}} <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> is {{composed}} of erythrocytes, reticulocytes, ghost cells, lymphocytes, thrombocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes, and monocytes. <b>Southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> has a high blood hemoglobin content (13.25—17.92 g/dl) and, therefore, a high oxygen carrying capacity. This results from an increased hematocrit and mean cellular hemoglobin content (MCHC). The erythrocyte content in the blood ranges from 2.13-2.90 million/l which is at least twice that of adult Atlantic salmon, reflecting the active nature of <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> Because the MCHC is high, more blood can be delivered to tissues without an increase in energy used to pump more viscous blood. For <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> this is important in blood vessels that are not protected by heat exchangers when they migrate to colder environments.|$|E
50|$|By 2004, {{the number}} of adult Atlantic <b>Bluefin</b> <b>Tuna</b> capable of {{spawning}} had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean. Japan has {{a quarter of the}} world supply of the five big species: <b>bluefin,</b> <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin,</b> bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.|$|R
25|$|The highly {{migratory species}} include: tuna and tuna-like species (albacore, Atlantic <b>bluefin,</b> bigeye <b>tuna,</b> skipjack, yellowfin, blackfin, little tunny, Pacific <b>bluefin,</b> <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> and bullet), pomfret, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, saury and oceangoing sharks, {{dolphins}} and other cetaceans.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{the other}} <b>bluefins</b> (Atlantic and <b>southern),</b> the Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> was not {{considered}} threatened initially, resulting in a Least Concern rating in 2011. In 2014, it {{was found to be}} threatened and the status was upgraded to Vulnerable. Overfishing is occurring in the Pacific bluefin, but overall the stock was not yet believed to be in an overfished condition in 2011. [...] In 2010, it was estimated that the complete spawning biomass was 40-60% of the historically observed spawning biomass. In 2013-2014, scientists found a drastic population decline, estimated at 96%, due to overfishing. In 2000-2004, between 16,000 tonnes and 29,000 tonnes were caught per year. Its wide range and migratory behavior leads to some problems, since fisheries in the species are managed by several different Regional Fisheries Management Organisations that sometimes give conflicting advice. The IUCN have recommended that the responsibility is moved to a single organisation. Other recommendations include a substantial reduction of fishing of this species, especially juveniles. As much as 90% of the caught Pacific bluefins are juveniles.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} fifteen years, the market for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> has evolved {{in an attempt to}} further enhance the {{economic}} value of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> landings. Historically, the US East Coast has been a major supplier of high quality <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> to Japan, the primary market for sashimi grade tuna. To date, many questions regarding the economic feasibility of offshore aquaculture, and in particular offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farming in the United States, remain unanswered. This research assesses the economic feasibility of an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture industry located on the East Coast of the US by developing a dynamic stochastic adaptive bioeconomic model of such an offshore enterprise. The bioeconomic model incorporates the biological constraints of the species, the interaction of relevant economic parameters and constraints, and stochastic sources of risk, to solve for the profit maximizing behavior of a farmed <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> producer. This research identifies the optimal harvest schedule for an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farming facility that maximizes the net present value of the operation under a variety of economic, biological and regulatory conditions. Economic feasibility is analyzed using profitability indicators including net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR).

40|$|Although <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the Atlantic Ocean, spawning in the western Atlantic has been recorded predominantly in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in spring. Larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances from the northern GOM are formulated into an index used to tune the adult stock assessment, and the variability of this index is currently high. This study investigated whether some of the variability in larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances was related to environmental conditions, by defining associations between larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catch locations, and a suite of environmental variables. We hypothesized that certain habitat types, as defined by environmental variables, {{would be more likely}} to contain <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae. Favorable habitat for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae was defined using a classification tree approach. Habitat within the Loop Current was generally less favorable, as were warmcore rings, and cooler waters on the continental shelf. The location and size of favorable habitat was highly variable among years, which was reflected in the locations of larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catches. The model successfully placed <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae in favorable habitat with nearly 90 % accuracy, but many negative stations were also located within theoretically favorable habitat. The probability of collecting larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> in favorable habitat was nearly twice the probability of collecting <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae across all habitats (35. 5 versus 21. 0 %).

50|$|Since {{southern}} bluefin tunas {{must constantly}} be swimming to drive {{water over the}} gills and provide their bodies with oxygen, there is a requirement for their metabolic rate to constantly be high. Unlike other organisms, the <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> cannot expend more energy to produce heat in cold temperatures, while slowing down metabolism to cool down in high temperature waters and maintain a homeostatic temperature. Instead, the <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> seems to implement a system that regulates how actively the rete mirable system heats the tissues. Experiments involving the <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> have led researchers {{to believe that this}} species of tuna has developed a shunting system. When the <b>southern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> experiences cold temperatures, more blood is directed to the rete vascular system, heating muscle tissue, while in warm temperatures, blood is shunted to the venous and arterial systems, reducing the heat in the muscle tissues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{assesses the}} {{economic}} feasibility of capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture on the US East Coast and examines {{the potential of}} this hybrid form of aquaculture production to increase the net economic value generated in the US East Coast <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. A bioeconomic model of an offshore capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture facility is {{used to evaluate the}} economic feasibility of this form of production on the US East Coast under a variety of economic, biological, and regulatory assumptions. The results suggest that of the three proposed farming sites along the US East Coast, the expected net present value (NPV) of the operation over a 10 -year operating horizon is highest at the Gray’s Reef, GA, site. The second part of this article assesses {{the extent to which the}} opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production could improve the net economic value gener-ated in the US East Coast <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. The results suggest that if the fishery had the opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production, there would be an increase in the net revenue generated in the fishery. Depending on how the seasonal quota was enforced, economic improvement in the fishery ranged from a 52 – 142 % improvement in net revenue. Even when the cost per fish associated with capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production was doubled, the results still indicated that the opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production would lead to a 12 % increase in net revenue in the fishery.
