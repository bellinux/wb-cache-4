The term shmoo has also entered the lexicon, defining highly technical concepts in no less than four separate fields of science, including the variations shmooing (a microbiological term for the [...] "budding" [...] process in yeast reproduction), and shmoo plot (a technical term {{in the field of}} electrical engineering). In <b>socioeconomics,</b> a [...] "shmoo" [...] refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to [...] "widgets" [...] which require resources and active production.) In the field of particle physics, [...] "shmoo" [...] refers to a high energy survey instrument, as utilized at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the Cygnus X-3 constellation. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as druthers, schmooze and nogoodnik, neatnik, etc. In his book The American Language, H.L. Mencken credits the postwar mania for adding [...] "-nik" [...] to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning—not with beatnik or Sputnik—but earlier, in the pages of Li'l Abner.|$|E
