5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart of a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research {{found them to be}} particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington. During the trial, {{numerous}} players and coaches {{who were at the}} game testified, while Washington <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.|$|E
5|$|Princess Andrew {{returned}} to Great Britain in April 1947 {{to attend the}} November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring. On {{the day of the}} wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI. For the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of her family {{on the north side of}} Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.|$|E
50|$|The school {{offers a}} wide range of subjects, and has very broad curriculum. Pupils study the Key Stage 3 Curriculum in years 7, 8 and 9, and sit National Curriculum {{assessment}} examinations (<b>SATs)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of this period.|$|R

5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same table with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In {{the course of the}} start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E

25|$|Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–92) {{lived and}} worked at Aldworth House, Haslemere, {{for much of his}} later life, dying there in 1892. Tennyson spent much of his time walking around Blackdown in Haslemere and famously <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Temple of The Winds in Blackdown.|$|E
25|$|The {{funeral service}} {{was held at}} 11 a. m. in the throne room of Iolani Palace on February 15. Admission was by printed {{invitation}} only. The royal family <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the casket, and Kalākaua's cabinet ministers <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of the casket. The entire service and its music was in the Hawaiian language. As with the service that had been held in San Francisco, the clergy reading was 1 Corinthians 15:20–55. Liliuokalani composed her own chant for the choirs, based on Psalm 90. In her memoirs, she made note of her fascination of {{the women of the}} Hale Naua secret society and their prayer rituals over the body of Kalākaua. The King had inducted women into the society as equal members {{for the first time in}} Hawaiian history.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{also helped}} several {{passengers}} who {{were unable to}} escape on their own; a pilot carried out one passenger with an injured leg.

One of the paintings he produced here was Chez le père Lathuille (At Pere Lathuille's), in which a man displays an unrequited interest in a woman dining near him.|$|E
25|$|Both Pablo Christiani and Geronimo de Santa Fé, in {{addition}} to criticizing the Talmud, also regarded it {{as a source of}} authentic traditions, some of which could be used as arguments in favour of Christianity. Examples of such traditions were statements that the Messiah was born {{around the time of the}} destruction of the Temple, and that the Messiah <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right hand of God.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Lindley's Mill (also {{known as}} the Battle of Cane Creek) took place in Orange County, North Carolina (now in Alamance County), on September 13, 1781, during the American Revolutionary War. The battle took its name from a mill that <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site of the battle on Cane Creek, which sat along a road {{connecting}} {{what was then the}} temporary state capital, Hillsborough, with Wilmington, North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} season, Keegan {{was able to}} produce {{some of his best}} form {{and at the end of}} January 1982 Southampton <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the First Division table, but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a rather disappointing seventh-place finish. Despite this, Keegan was voted the PFA Player of the Year and awarded the OBE for services to Association Football. Keegan had scored 26 of the team's 72 goals and was voted the club's Player of the Year.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Scottsville {{station of}} the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{west end of}} Maple Street, well {{to the north of}} the end of the road. Its 1911 replacement was on the curve where Maple turns south to Wyvil and Hanford. The railroad built a new station in Scottsville, formally dedicating it in 1911. Sitting approximately one hundred meters south of the original building, it was introduced to the public in a modest ceremony featuring Surrogate Judge Selden S Brown and businessman David Salyerds.|$|E
25|$|Parliament first <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> former {{headquarters}} {{building of}} the Federated Malay States Volunteer Force on a hill near Jalan Tun Ismail (Maxwell Road). The Dewan Negara met in a hall {{on the ground floor}} while the Dewan Rakyat met in the hall on the first floor. With the completion of Parliament House in 1962, comprising a three-storey main building for the two houses of Parliament to meet, and an 18-storey tower for the offices of Ministers and members of Parliament, both houses moved there.|$|E
