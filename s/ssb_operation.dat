50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1939, there was a flu epidemic that at times afflicted one fifth of the SSB's workforce. When the Federal Council finally proclaimed a general war mobilization in late summer that year, {{a large portion of}} the SSB's employees had to report for army duty, which caused numerous restrictions in the <b>SSB's</b> <b>operations.</b> Nevertheless, and for the first time ever, more than 20 million passengers travelled on the network tram in 1939.|$|R
25|$|Named for {{the segment}} of 10 meters granted for use to American Novice Class Amateur Radio license holders. The Novice sub-bands consist of two {{frequency}} ranges; one for CW and Data operation, {{and the other}} for <b>SSB</b> phone <b>operation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The film {{centers around}} Major Shehzad Khan, a Secret Service Bangladesh agent, tasked with assassinating Zulfiqer Mirza, who is {{planning}} to undertake a massive terrorist attack in Bangladesh. The plot of the film builds around <b>SSB</b> espionage <b>operation,</b> and assassination of Zulfiqer Mirza in Australia. Principal photography began on September 2016, in Sydney, Australia. The film is slated to release in 23 December 2017.|$|R
50|$|In June 2011, the EU {{announced}} another {{change in}} technical specifications for C.B. use which, if implemented, would introduce a type approval for both AM and <b>SSB</b> <b>operation.</b> The introduction was originally delayed by the 2012 Olympics, and {{was scheduled to}} take effect in 2014.|$|E

50|$|On 1 October 1944, the {{blackout}} was lifted after three years. Shortly {{after the war}} ended in 1945, <b>SSB</b> reintroduced the <b>operation</b> of trams at five-minute intervals. Voters approved the extension of line 5/6 from Burgernziel to Freudenbergerplatz (Ostring). This extension was ready to be opened on 1 December 1946.|$|R
50|$|Musafir (মুসাফির) is an 2016 Bangladeshi action-thriller film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Ashiqur Rahman. The film stars Arifin Shuvoo, Misha Sawdagor, Tiger Robi, Robiul Islam, Shimul Khan, Marjan Jenifa, Prosun Azad and Cindy Rolling. Shuvoo plays an intelligence double agent, and a trained assassin of Secret Service Bangladesh (SSB) who is placed as a mole in target organization. The plot builds up around <b>SSB's</b> rescue <b>operation</b> of Zara, who has possession of many classified information wanted by Bangladesh's external enemies. Jenifa plays the role of Zara Mehjabin, a surveillance agent of SSB, suddenly disappeared with many classified documents of the agency. The plot takes an interesting turn when the target agency sends Shuvo to abduct Zara, not knowing that he is actually a SSB agent in disguise.|$|R
50|$|South Africa allows use of nine 27 MHz CB {{frequencies}} between 27.185 MHz and 27.275 MHz (27 MHz CB channels 19-27). Maximal {{output power}} is 5 watts carrier power in AM mode and 12 watts PEP power in SSB mode. As with the 29 MHz allocation, each frequency {{is assigned to}} either AM only or <b>SSB</b> <b>operation.</b> Channels 19-22 (27.185-27.225 MHz) are designated for AM use and channels 23-27 (27.255-27.275 MHz) are designated for SSB use.|$|E
5000|$|Single-sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>operation</b> {{involves}} {{the selection of}} either the Lower Side Band (LSB) or the Upper Side Band (USB) mode for transmit and receive. SSB radios also have the standard AM mode for communicating with standard CB radio models. With the original 23 CB channels SSB stations commonly used channel 16, to avoid interference to those using AM (SSB stations are authorized to use 12 watts, as opposed to 4 watts for AM stations) and to more easily locate other SSB stations. With the FCC authorization of 40 channels, <b>SSB</b> <b>operation</b> shifted to channels 36-40. Channel 36 or 38 (LSB) became the unofficial SSB [...] "calling channels" [...] for stations seeking contacts, with the subsequent conversation moving to channels 37-40. CBers with AM-only radios are asked to not use channels 36 through 40. In return, SSB stations stay off the remaining 35 channels {{so they could be}} used by AM stations. This agreement provides interference-free operation for all operators by separating the far more powerful SSB stations from the AM stations. This solution also resolves the chaos created by the false advertising that SSB radios have 120 channels compared to only 40 for AM radios.|$|E
50|$|Clansman was {{developed}} by the Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) in the 1960s, to satisfy a General Staff Requirement (GSR) laid down in 1965. Most Clansman radio equipment was built by Racal, Mullard Equipment Ltd (MEL) and Plessey, although headsets and ancillaries were also produced by Amplivox, Marconi and others. Clansman represented a considerable advance over existing radios being offered to the Armed Forces at the time. It replaced the aging Larkspur radio system, and proved to be more flexible, reliable and far lighter. The technological advances achieved in the design of Clansman allowed the introduction of Single SideBand (<b>SSB)</b> <b>operation</b> and NarrowBand Frequency Modulation (NBFM) to forward area combat net radio for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The shortwave radio {{equipment}} {{used by the}} expedition was a Soviet-made solid state 10 watt tranceiver. It weighed 1.2 kilograms without batteries and had six fixed, crystal controlled frequencies for single-sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>operation</b> on the 80, 40 and 20 meter amateur radio bands. The 2 kg lithium battery provided the 2.2 amps at 12 V required to operate the transceiver for about a month, one hour per day, at low temperatures. The antenna for the system was an inverted-V with the mast made of five skis fitted together. The limited lifetime of the batteries {{was one of the}} reasons that there was generally no contact between radio 'Hams' and the skiers, other than with the support stations.|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{stem cell}} biology have afforded {{promising}} {{results for the}} generation of various cell types for therapies against devastating diseases. However, a prerequisite for realizing the therapeutic potential of stem cells {{is the development of}} bioprocesses for the production of stem cell progeny in quantities that satisfy clinical demands. Recent reports on the expansion and directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in scalable stirred-suspension bioreactors (SSBs) demonstrated that large-scale production of therapeutically useful hESC progeny is feasible with current state-of-the-art culture technologies. Stem cells have been cultured in SSBs as aggregates, in microcarrier suspension and after encapsulation. The various modes in which SSBs can be employed for the cultivation of hESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are described. To that end, this is the first account of hiPSC cultivation in a microcarrier stirred-suspension system. Given that cultured stem cells and their differentiated progeny are the actual products used in tissue engineering and cell therapies, the impact of bioreactor's operating conditions on stem cell self-renewal and commitment should be considered. The effects of variables specific to <b>SSB</b> <b>operation</b> on stem cell physiology are discussed. Finally, major challenges are presented which remain to be addressed before the mainstream use of SSBs for the large-scale culture of hESCs and hiPSCs...|$|E
