We {{propose a}} new overdetermined blind source {{separation}} (SSS) using frequency-domain independent component analysis (FDICA) based on multiple-input single-output (MISO) constraint. To achieve a superior separation performance under reverberant environments, we set {{the number of}} microphones to be larger than that of sources. This leads to alternative problems in which the <b>sound</b> <b>qualities</b> of the separated signals are deteriorated. In order to solve these problems, we propose the overdetermined SSS based on MISO-constrained FDICA. The experimental results reveal that the <b>sound</b> <b>qualities</b> of the separated signals in the proposed method outperform that in the conventional FDICA especially in the large-array case...|$|R
5|$|After {{experimenting with}} porting the {{original}} The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, the Flagship team, supervised by Yoshiki Okamoto, began developing three interconnected Zelda games {{that could be}} played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game. Both Seasons and Ages were a critical success, and together sold eight million units. Critics complimented the gameplay, colorful designs and graphic quality, but criticized the inconsistent <b>sound</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the poor}} <b>sound</b> <b>quality</b> limits its {{commercial}} appeal, the album provides historic {{insight into the}} group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances.|$|E
5|$|Black Beauty {{was first}} {{released}} only in Japan by CBS/Sony in 1973 without individual songs {{specified in the}} track listing. Columbia Records, Davis' American record label, had difficulty identifying the compositions for royalty purposes, and the album was not released in the United States until 1997. Critics were generally positive toward Black Beauty, although some were critical of its <b>sound</b> <b>quality</b> and Grossman's solos; Corea said the recording was an accurate document how that particular band of Davis' played live.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm <b>sound</b> <b>quality.</b> The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E

Life Is Peachy debuted and peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number one in New Zealand. In its first week of being released, the album sold 106,000 copies.

Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. Too Tough to Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the <b>sound</b> <b>quality</b> on End of the Century and Pleasant Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E

Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall <b>sound</b> <b>quality</b> and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics such as Daniel Kalabakov of RPGFan, {{who claimed that}} it was his favorite Super Nintendo Entertainment System-era Square soundtrack, primarily due to the mixture of techno and jazz. He preferred Shimomura's techno tracks, but enjoyed the way the two styles mixed together. Kero Hazel of Square Enix Music Online similarly praised the mix of the two styles, though he criticized the <b>sound</b> <b>quality</b> of the album and stated that the album would have been improved by using real instruments rather than synthesized ones.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{critics were}} {{impressed}} by the improved <b>sound</b> <b>quality</b> and the group's ability to survive the loss of Gabriel without sacrificing {{the quality of the}} music.

The album reached No. 3 in the UK, remaining on the charts for 39 weeks, and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.|$|E
