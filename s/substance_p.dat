5|$|Rodents {{are used}} widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for {{research}} in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States {{for research in}} the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter <b>substance</b> <b>P,</b> a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.|$|E

40|$|Lysosomal serine {{carboxypeptidase}} Cathepsin A (CTSA) is a multifunctional enzyme with distinct protective and catalytic function. CTSA that {{is present}} in the lysosomal multienzyme complex facilitates correct lysosomal routing, stability and activation of betagalactosidase and alpha-neuraminidase. In addition, CTSA plays a role in the inactivation of bioactive peptides including bradykinin, <b>substances</b> <b>P,</b> oxytocin, angiotensin I and endothelin-I by cleavage of one or two amino acid(s) from the C-terminal ends. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory role of CTSA on bioactive peptides in a knock-in mouse model of CTSAS 190 A. We evaluated the levels of bradykinin, <b>substances</b> <b>P,</b> oxytocin, angiotensin I and endothelin-I in the kidney, liver, lung, brain and serum of the CTSAS 190 A mouse model at three- and six-months of age. Our results suggest that CTSA selectively contributes to the processing of bioactive peptides in different tissues of CTSAS 190 A mice compared to those of age-matched wild-type mice...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanisms}} behind dysfunction of {{the tympanic}} tensor muscle and their consequences are hypotheses. However, in a published study, researchers studied {{the case of}} an acoustic shock whose mechanisms suggest dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle. This study appears {{to be the first to}} provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles (MEM) may behave abnormally after an acoustic shock. It is suggested that abnormal contractions (eg tonic contractions) of the tympanic tensor muscle may trigger neurogenic inflammation. Indeed, fibers with <b>substances</b> <b>P</b> and CGRP were found in close proximity.|$|R
25|$|The skin {{of naked}} mole-rats lacks a key {{neurotransmitter}} called <b>substance</b> <b>P</b> {{that is responsible}} in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. As a result, the naked mole-rats feel no pain, {{even when they are}} exposed to acid or capsaicin. When they are injected with <b>substance</b> <b>P,</b> however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with capsaicin and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.|$|E
25|$|Aprepitant ({{brand name}}: Emend (the brand name used in all English-speaking countries)) is an {{antiemetic}} chemical compound {{that belongs to}} a class of drugs called <b>substance</b> <b>P</b> antagonists (SPA). It mediates its effect by blocking the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the association between}} panic disorder and licit and illicit substance use in the population provided with primary care in the southern Brazil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with patients from three primary care centers. We used the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) to evaluate substance use and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to diagnose panic disorder. Results: A total of 1, 081 subjects were evaluated. The prevalence of panic disorder was 5. 6 %. Panic disorder was associated with using marijuana (p = 0. 001), tobacco (p = 0. 001), cocaine (p < 0. 001), and other illicit <b>substances</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001). Conclusion: A significant association is noticed between panic disorder and licit and illicit substance use, thus, {{it is interesting to}} rethink the approach to treatment/intervention in patients with dual diagnosis...|$|R
25|$|Itch (pruritus) {{has many}} causes. Allergies and {{inflammatory}} skin disease all produce itch as a symptom. Pathophysiologically, {{the sensation of}} the itch is poorly understood. Nevertheless, there are many known inducers of itch. Histamine is wildly known as an inducer of the itch sensation. Other substances known to induce itch are <b>substance</b> <b>P,</b> cytokines, and proteases.|$|E
25|$|Parasympathetic {{innervation}} to the {{salivary glands}} is carried via cranial nerves. The parotid gland receives its parasympathetic {{input from the}} glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion. These nerves release acetylcholine and <b>substance</b> <b>P,</b> which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.|$|E
25|$|NK1 is a G protein-coupled {{receptor}} {{located in}} the central and peripheral nervous system. This receptor has a dominant ligand known as <b>Substance</b> <b>P</b> (SP). SP is a neuropeptide, composed of 11 amino acids, which sends impulses and messages from the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the vomiting center of the brain, and, when activated, it results in a vomiting reflex. In addition to this it also plays a key part in the transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral receptors to the central nervous system.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} is pilot {{evaluation}} of the life skills program REBOUND in a school context focusing on substance use, risk perception, and knowledge about psychoactive substances (n IG + CG = 723 students in five schools and 46 classes, Mage = 14. 8, range 14 - 18) for the total sample and in the subgroups gender, age, and school type. Main goal {{of the study is}} collecting evidence for program optimization. A controlled study was carried out with repeated measurement before and after the intervention (4 - 6 months). Multilevel analyses, ANCOVA, and logistic regression analyses were applied to measure the effects. Overall, significantly lower incidence rates of drunkenness (odds ratio [OR] =. 55; p =. 033), improved knowledge about psychoactive <b>substances</b> (<b>p</b> =. 006), lower personal (p =. 013) and general tobacco risk perception among users (p =. 002), and lower general tobacco (p =. 018) and cannabis (p =. 000) risk perception in non-users were found in the total intervention group. In subgroups, significantly lower rates for the incidence of drunkenness can be shown for males (p =. 008) and for younger participants (p =. 004). Students at academic high school (German Gymnasium) showed a decrease in 30 -day prevalence for alcohol (p =. 017) and cannabis (p =. 014), and they improved in their knowledge about psychoactive <b>substances</b> (<b>p</b> =. 000). In vocational high school classes (German Realschule), there was an increase in the relative alcohol risk perception of the students (p =. 019). REBOUND contributes to a controlled use of alcohol and increases knowledge about psychoactive substances. REBOUND has various effects on the examined subgroups age, gender, and school type: Males, younger students, and students in academic high school benefitted more from the course regarding consumption-related criteria. We suggest a program optimization specific to school form and age, inclusion of a tobacco intervention, and the use of more gender-segregated interventions...|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} several {{different}} chemicals {{have been used}} to induce referred pain including bradykinin, <b>substance</b> <b>P,</b> capsaicin, and serotonin. However, before any of these substances became widespread in their use a solution of hypertonic saline was used instead. Through various experiments it was determined that there were multiple factors that correlated with saline administration such as infusion rate, saline concentration, pressure, and amount of saline used. The mechanism by which the saline induces a local and referred pain pair is unknown. Some researchers have commented that it could be due to osmotic differences, however that is not verified.|$|E
25|$|Baclofen is {{considered}} to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity, and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance. Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing calcium ion influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of <b>substance</b> <b>P</b> in the spinal cord, as well.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Individuals with {{multiple}} versus single suicide attempts present a more severe clinical picture {{and may be}} {{at greater risk for}} suicide. Yet group differences within military samples have been vastly understudied. Purpose: The objective is to determine demographic, diagnostic, and psychosocial differences, based on suicide attempt status, among military inpatients admitted for suicide-related events. Method: A retrospective chart review design was used with a total of 423 randomly selected medical records of psychiatric admissions to a military hospital from 2001 to 2006. Results: Chi-square analyses indicated that individuals {{with multiple}} versus single suicide attempts {{were significantly more likely to}} have documented childhood sexual abuse (p =. 025); problem <b>substance</b> use (<b>p</b> =. 001); mood disorder diagnosis (<b>p</b> =. 005); <b>substance</b> disorder diagnosis (<b>p</b> =. 050); personality disorder not otherwise specified diagnosis (p =. 018); and Axis II traits or diagnosis (p =. 038) when compared to those with a single attempt history.

25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} {{leads to}} acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, specifically M3, and causes an increased intracellular calcium ion concentration (through the IP3/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein, an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon {{blood vessels and}} capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability respectively. The resulting increased {{blood flow to the}} acini allows production of more saliva. In addition, <b>Substance</b> <b>P</b> can bind to Tachykinin NK-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepithelium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Holtz and Blaschko it {{was clear}} that animals {{synthesized}} noradrenaline. What was lacking to attribute a transmitter role to it was proof of its presence in tissues at effective concentrations and not only as a short-lived intermediate. On April 16, 1945, Ulf von Euler of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, who had already discovered or co-discovered <b>substance</b> <b>P</b> and prostaglandins, submitted to Nature {{the first of a series}} of papers that gave this proof. After many bioassays and chemical assays on organ extracts he concluded that mammalian sympathetically innervated tissues as well as, in small amounts, the brain, but not the nerve-free placenta, contained noradrenaline and that noradrenaline was the sympathin of Cannon and Rosenblueth, the ″physiological transmitter of adrenergic nerve action in mammals″. Overflow of noradrenaline into the venous blood of the cat’s spleen upon sympathetic nerve stimulation two years later bore out the conclusion. In amphibian hearts, on the other hand, the transmitter role of adrenaline was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and <b>substance</b> <b>P.</b> The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E

Hyperhomocysteinemia was induced in albino Wistar rats by oral administration of L-Methionine (1 gm / kg) and they were treated simultaneously with chloroform and methanol extracts (100 mg / kg) from the leaves of Trichilia connaroides. Serum homocysteine, lipid profile, and products of lipid peroxidation (MDA) in the heart homogenate were recorded and treated for statistical significance. Hyperhomocysteinemic animals recorded significantly elevated serum homocysteine changes in lipid profile (P < 0. 01) and Thibarbituric acid reactive <b>substances</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 01), compared to the vehicle control animals.
