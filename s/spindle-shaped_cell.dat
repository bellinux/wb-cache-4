40|$|BACKGROUND: The liver is {{a common}} site of neuroendocrine tumors (NTs) metastatic from {{primaries}} in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, biliary system and lungs. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is also a potential source of metastases of NTs. Their metastases to the liver are frequent and can appear several years after the primitive tumor. Although {{a wide variety of}} cytomorphologic features are normally exhibited by MTC in smears, a <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cell</b> pattern can predominate, complicating the correct interpretation of a metastasis. CASE: A 63 -year-old man presented with multiple liver nodules two years after a total thyroidectomy for MTC. Fine needle aspiration biopsy smears of the liver revealed neoplastic cells occurring in loose groupings or lying singly, most of them with a spindle shape and elongated nucleus with the characteristic "salt and pepper" chromatin pattern of a neuroendocrine tumor. Cytoplasmic dendritic processes and intranuclear inclusions were frequently seen. The cytomorphologic features of the tumor were essentially the same as those of the primary MTC. Immunoreactivity for calcitonin confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In fine needle aspiration biopsy of liver masses, knowledge of the spindle pattern of the NT is important in order to achieve a correct diagnosis when metastases are the first manifestation of an occult primary tumor. Among neuroendocrine tumors, MTC must be included in the differential diagnosis...|$|E

Psychological pain and empathy to pain involves a neural network that involves the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insula (AI). At the neuronal level, little is known about how complex emotions such as shame, guilt, self-derogation and social isolation, all of which feature suicidal behavior, are represented in the brain.

The density of VENs was determined using cresyl violet-stained sections of the ACC of 39 individuals with psychosis (20 cases with schizophrenia, 19 with bipolar disorder). Nine subjects had died from suicide. Twenty specimen were available from the right, 19 from the left ACC. The density of VENs was significantly greater in the ACC of suicide victims with psychotic disorders compared with psychotic individuals who died from other causes. This effect was restricted to the right ACC. VEN density in the ACC seems to be increased in suicide victims with psychosis.

The histologic and immunohis-tochemical features of this tumor were consistent with those found in human epithelioid schwannomas. Key words: Dog; malignant epithelioid schwannoma; trigeminal nerve. In human beings, schwannomas (neurilemmomas, schwann cell neoplasms) are the most common benign neoplasm of both cranial and spinal nerve roots and peripheral nerve^. ^ Malignant schwannomas are frequent in human beings, par-ticularly with von Recklinghausen’s d i ~ e a s e. ~ There are two variants of malignant schwannomas, melanotic and epithe-lioid, and both are rare. 5 Schwannomas affecting cranial or spinal nerve roots and the brachial plexus have been de-scribed in several animal species (cattle, horses, rats, and dogs). 2 Most are benign. z Malignant cranial and spinal nerve sheath tumors are rare in animals and metastasize infre-quently. * In this report, a malignant epithelioid schwannoma affecting the left trigeminal nerve of a dog is described.

These tumors contained varying proportions of epithelioid cell and <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cell</b> components [2] and associated with glycogen granules in nine patients, necrosis in two patients, and hemorrhage in six patients. In our patient, {{the tumor was}} composed mostly of epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm, and spindle-shaped tumor cells are inconspicuous in these specimens. Glycogen granules and hemosiderin deposition are also noted, but tumor necrosis is not observed. Immunohistochemically, all the patients suffering pancreatic PEComa exhibited immunoreactivity for HMB- 45 and αSMA except for two patients including our patient. S- 100 immunoreactivity was observed in one patient and focally observed in four patients, {{and the others were}} negative. Desmin immunoreactivity was observed in one patient, and the others were negative as we could retrieve. Neither endocrine nor epithelial markers exhibited immunoreactivities. Myogenic marker, αSMA, exhibited immunoreactivity in spindle-shaped cells with muscular feature, and smooth muscle actin was found in 80  % of PEComa patients [2, 18]. In the present case, the tumor cells were negative for αSMA, different from other previously reported pancreatic PEComas except for one case, probably since the tumor was composed mostly of epithelioid cells in our patient [4]. Ki- 67 labeling index was less than 1  % in large proportion of pancreatic PEComa patients including our patient except for one patient with less than 5  %. Prognosis of pancreatic PEComa is good, most patients remained free of relapse; however, followed-up period was only within 1  year except for the patient for 5  years.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{distribution of}} two glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins and a trans-membrane protein and the compartments {{involved in their}} trafficking were investigated in the insect stage of Leishmania mexicana, which belongs to the phylogenetically old protozoan family Trypanosomatidae. Electron microscopy of sections from high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted cells allowed {{a detailed description of}} exo- and endocytic structures located in the vesicle-rich, densely packed anterior part of the <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cell.</b> A complex of tubular clusters/translucent vesicles is the prominent structure between the trans-side of the single Golgi apparatus and the flagellar pocket, the only site of endo- and exocytosis. A tubulovesicular compartment lined by one or two distinct microtubules and extending {{along the length of the}} cell is proposed to be a post-Golgi and probably late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Using biotinylation experiments, FACS analysis and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy it was found that, at comparable expression levels, 73 - 75 % of the two GPI-anchored proteins but only 13 % of the trans-membrane protein are located on the cell surface. The tubulovesicular compartment contains 46 %, the ER 5 %, the Golgi complex 1. 9 % and the tubular cluster/translucent vesicle complex 3. 6 % of the intracellular fraction of the GPI-anchored protease, GP 63. The density of GP 63 was found to be 23 -fold higher on the plasma/flagellar pocket membrane than on the ER and about tenfold higher than on membranes of the Golgi complex or of endo- or exocytic vesicles. These results indicate that there is a considerable concentration gradient of GPI-anchored proteins between the plasma/flagellar pocket membrane and the ER as well as structures involved in exo- or endocytosis. Possible mechanisms how this concentration gradient is established are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{observed}} sympathetic hyperinnervation and hyperplasia {{of an unknown}} cell population within {{the base of the}} hearts from transgenic mice in which nerve growth factor (NGF) expression was targeted to cardiac tissue (Hassankhani et al., 1993, 1995). To characterize this ectopic cell population, cells from the base of hearts of 3 - to 4 -week-old transgenic mice were dissociated and established in tissue culture, and their properties were analyzed using morphological, immunocytochemical, and physiological techniques. Morphological studies of the ectopic cells revealed the temporal expression of two different cellular phenotypes: (i) a <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cell</b> type, present by 1 to 2 days in vitro (DIV) and (ii) cells with a fiber-like morphology, detected by 7 DIV. In contrast to transgenic cardiac myocytes that express immunoreactivity to antibodies against sarcomeric myosin, beat spontaneously (∼ 60 /min), and are electrically excitable, the ectopic cell types did not stain with an antibody against sarcomeric myosin, never showed contractile activity, and did not manifest membrane excitability. Moreover, these two types of ectopic cells demonstrated other distinctive characteristics. The spindle-shaped subpopulation typically formed small clusters of cells that were immunostained by antibodies to GFAP, vimentin, and low-affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR) and demonstrated a low incidence of dye coupling (30 %), whereas the fiber-like cells aligned themselves along their long axes, immunostained for gp 140 trkA, LNGFR, and anti α-smooth muscle actin and showed extensive (100 %) and diffuse dye spread to numerous other contiguous fiber-like cells. Dye spread was not observed between the adjacent fiber-like and the spindle-shaped cells and was reversibly blocked between homologous cells after treatment with halothane, a gap junction channel blocking agent. In comparison to cardiac myocytes, macroscopic junctional conductance of the spindle-shaped cells was more voltage-sensitive. At the single channel level, unitary junctional conductances of approximately 60 pS were predominant. Overall, these results indicate that these ectopic cells are likely derived from neural crest. The spindle-shaped cells appear to be immature Schwann cells, whereas the fiber-like cells {{may be related to the}} ectomesenchymal cells contributing to the morphogenesis of the cardiac outflow tract...|$|E
40|$|Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative {{disease that}} is {{characterized}} by proliferation of <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cells</b> predominantly of vascular endothelial cell origin, neoangiogenesis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and edema. Although the lesions of classical KS and AIDS-associated KS (AIDS-KS) share common histological features, AIDS-KS occurs at a markedly higher frequency with a more aggressive clinical course. Immunohistochemical analyses of 26 evolutionarily staged AIDS-KS lesions derived from HIV-infected patients demonstrate significant cytoplasmic levels of Bcl- 2, a protooncogene known to prolong cellular viability and to antagonize apoptosis. Bcl- 2 expression increases as the pathological stage of KS advances. Immunohistochemical analyses of classical KS lesions demonstrate prevalent expression of Bcl- 2 as well, indicating that upregulation of Bcl- 2 may be important in the pathogenesis of both classical and AIDS-associated KS.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the relationship between lamellipodium protrusion and forward translocation of the cell body in the rapidly moving keratocyte. It is first shown that the trailing, ellipsoidal cell body rotates during translocation. This was indicated by {{the rotation of the}} nucleus and the movement of cytoplasmic organelles, as well as of exogenously added beads used as markers. Activated or Con A-coated fluorescent beads that were overrun by cells were commonly endocytosed and rotated with the internal organelles. Alternatively, beads applied {{to the rear of the}} cell body via a micropipette adhered to the dorsal cell surface and also moved forward, indicating that both exterior and underlying cortical elements participated in rotation. Manipulation of keratocytes with microneedles demonstrated that pushing or restraining the cell body in the direction of locomotion, and squeezing it against the substrate, which temporarily increased the intracellular pressure, did not effect the rate of lamellipodium protrusion. Rotation and translocation of the cell body continued momentarily after arrest of lamellipodium protrusion by cytochalasin B, indicating that these processes were not directly dependent on actin polymerization. The cell body was commonly flanked by phase-dense "axles," extending from the cell body into the lamellipodium. Phalloidin staining showed these to be comprised of actin bundles that splayed forward into the flanks of the lamellipodium. Disruption of the bundles on one side of the nucleus by traumatic microinjection resulted in rapid retraction of the cell body in the opposite direction, indicating that the cell body was under lateral contractile stress. Myosin II, which colocalizes with the actin bundles, presumably provides the basis of tension generation across and traction of the cell body. We propose that the basis of coupling between lamellipodium protrusion and translocation of the cell body is a flow of actin filaments from the front, where they are nucleated and engage in protrusion, to the rear, where they collaborate with myosin in contraction. Myosin-dependent force is presumably transmitted from the ends of the cell body into the flanks of the lamellipodium via the actin bundles. This force induces the <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cell</b> body to roll between the axles that are created continuously from filaments supplied by the advancing lamellipodium...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} cell morphologies in the LAM lesion: small <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cells</b> and {{cuboidal}} epithelioid cells. LAM cells stain positively for smooth muscle actin, vimentin, desmin, and, often, estrogen and progesterone receptors. The cuboidal cells within LAM lesions also react with a monoclonal antibody called HMB-45, developed against the premelanosomal protein gp100, an enzyme in the melanogenesis pathway. This immunohistochemical marker is very useful diagnostically, because other smooth muscle-predominant lesions in the lung do not react with the antibody. The <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cells</b> of the LAM lesion are more frequently proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive than the cuboidal cells, consistent with a proliferative phenotype. Compared with cigar-shaped normal smooth muscle <b>cells,</b> <b>spindle-shaped</b> LAM <b>cells</b> contain less abundant cytoplasm and are less eosinophilic. Estrogen and progesterone receptors are also present in LAM lesions, but not in adjacent normal lung tissue. LAM lesions express lymphatic markers LYVE-1, PROX1, podoplanin and VEGFR-3.

ACE was localized to endothelial cells of all vessels, whereas endothelial DPPIV and APM were restricted to veins and capillaries of some cases. Perivascular <b>spindle-shaped</b> <b>cells</b> stained positively for APM, but rarely for ACE and DPPIV.

This distribution of membrane peptidases supports the hypothesis of a functional compartmentalization of vascular peptidergic systems, with the activities of vasoactive peptides localized to their sites of release. Furthermore, metabolic pathways for regulatory peptides may vary between different structures within human synovium, and these enzymes may be of different relative importance in normal and inflamed tissues. The implied regional control of regulatory peptide activity by membrane peptidases suggests novel potential approaches to the pharmacological manipulation of inflammation by specific enzyme inhibitors...|$|R
