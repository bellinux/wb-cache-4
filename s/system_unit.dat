40|$|Abstract. With Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) a {{new type}} of <b>system</b> <b>units</b> is {{introduced}} (aspects). One observed characteristic of AOP is that it results in a large number of additional (coarse-grained to ne-grained) <b>system</b> <b>units</b> (aspects) ready to be composed to the nal appli-cation. With this growing number of <b>system</b> <b>units</b> the dependencies be-tween them become vast and tangling. This results in the necessity of an improved management of the dependencies between these <b>system</b> <b>units.</b> Our paper investigates this problem, proposes a more general model (version model) to capture dierent facettes of AOP as well as a partial solution towards unit consistency based on versions. ...|$|R

The UK version, season 1, had the Mole sabotage the other contestants' units. In the UK season 2, the contestants not only had to reach a destination in a given time, but had to hike there in a specific order, which the Mole tried to confuse. The US version gave the contestants two options at the final destination: add the prize money to the pot or examine the Mole's dossier. In the Dutch version, the talking GPS gave strange directions, such as [...] "Drive towards Switzerland" [...] while the show was filmed in Mexico.

40|$|Various recent {{approaches}} aim {{at improving}} {{the application of}} the separation of concerns principle by introducing new <b>system</b> <b>units.</b> Although they seem to have the potential to improve the system development process, additional challenges evolve. This paper addresses some challenges concerning the reusability of these new <b>system</b> <b>units.</b> Our considerations about reusability are twofold. First, the independence of these <b>system</b> <b>units</b> is regarded on the mechanism level. Second, the composition validation problem emerging from the composition of these new and also reusable <b>system</b> <b>units</b> is investigated. The problems are illustrated by means of two examples. 1 Introduction and Problem Classification Common to recent approaches exploring the future beyond "objects" is that they all aim at a better separation of concerns. Besides objects, they introduce new units encapsulating concerns along additional dimensions. In this paper we comprise these units in the term "units of concerns". Though th [...] ...|$|R
