5|$|In late August {{to early}} September, Argus transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk, Russia. She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for {{eventual}} delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England, {{but this was}} cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied Eagle back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. Argus loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in Operation Perpetual, sailed {{to the west of}} Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced Argus to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> available.|$|E
25|$|Air France {{has moved}} {{all of its}} {{operations}} previously located at 2C to 2E. In October 2012, 2F closed its international operations and became completely Schengen, allowing for all Air France flights currently operating in 2D to relocate to terminal 2F. Further, in April 2013, Terminal 2B closed for a complete renovation (all airlines relocated to 2D) and will receive upgrades including {{the addition of a}} second floor completely dedicated to arrivals. Once 2B is completed, 2D will close and receive similar upgrades, including the addition of a new floor. Low-cost carrier easyJet has shown its interest in being the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> at 2B. To facilitate connections, a new boarding area between 2A and 2C was opened in March 2012. It allows for all security and passport control to be handled in a single area, allows for many new shopping opportunities as well as new airline lounges, and eases transfer restrictions between 2A and 2C.|$|E

50|$|All Nippon Airways is the <b>sole</b> air <b>carrier</b> at Tottori Airport. It {{maintains}} several {{flights to}} and from Tokyo Haneda per day, almost all on a fleet of Boeing 737s.|$|R
50|$|After {{a boiler}} room fire, the carrier was rebuilt, {{and sold to}} Argentina. The Argentines already {{operated}} a carrier, ARA Independencia, also a former Royal Navy Colossus-class. After Independencia was decommissioned in 1970, Veinticinco de Mayo was the <b>sole</b> remaining <b>carrier</b> in the Argentine fleet. She could carry up to 24 aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Monmouthshire Canal Navigation got its Act in 1845, authorising it {{to build}} the Newport and Pontypool Railway, to use {{locomotives}} and become <b>sole</b> <b>carriers.</b> Authorised capital was £119,000. The Act required it to make the new railway to standard gauge and to convert {{the whole of the}} Western Valley system to that gauge as well,) and to provide all the rolling stock for mineral traffic. To retain income during the conversion, the Canal Company had to find some way of allowing existing services to run while the work was being done. The Company owned some 30 miles of tramroad, but there were just as many miles under private ownership, as well as the 22 miles of the connecting Rumney Tramroad, and 14 miles of the Sirhowy Tramroad. Some of the curves were sharper than 15 feet radius, an impossibility under locomotive operation.|$|R
50|$|Armenian Airlines was {{established}} shortly after independence in 1991 from Aeroflot's Armenia directorate, {{and was the}} <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> in Armenia until 2002, when private companies Armenian International Airways and Armavia began to compete with it.|$|E
50|$|The Kronsberg Church Centre was {{initially}} planned as an ecumenical project. However, after the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hildesheim {{withdrew from the}} project, the Hanover City Evangelical Lutheran Church Synod became the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier,</b> {{in cooperation with the}} Society for Building and Housing Hanover (GBH).|$|E
5000|$|On June 26, WJZJ {{became the}} <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of The Zone as WLJZ broke the {{simulcast}} {{to switch to}} Hot AC. After less than two years, it switched to classic country. Since April 2010, WAVC and WLJZ simulcast [...] "Bear" [...] classic rock programming.|$|E
3000|$|In {{contrast}} to conventional superconductors, the physical properties of organic superconductors directly reflect the electronic {{structure of the}} molecules they consist. Inabe et al. have first reported the thermoelectric power of single crystal K 3 C 60 and Rb 3 C 60 superconductors [10]. Nonlinear temperature dependences of S(T) with negative sign are documented above Tc for both K- and Rb-doped fullerides. The room-temperature value of S(T) is about − 11 μV/K, indicating the metallic nature in the normal state with electron as <b>sole</b> <b>carriers.</b> The absolute value of S decreases linearly until it drops discontinuously to zero at T c [...] and at a broad hump around 70 K. The analysis of density of states in K 3 C 60 reveals that low-frequency phonon modes are significant in normal state transport, and the nonlinear behavior in low-temperature regime (T < 70 K) is ascribed to phonon drag.|$|R
50|$|Under the new agreement, BCal had its {{licences}} {{to commence}} scheduled services from its Gatwick base to both Houston and Atlanta confirmed and was {{designated as the}} UK's exclusive flag carrier on both routes. It also obtained a licence and <b>sole</b> UK flag <b>carrier</b> status to commence scheduled services from Gatwick to Dallas-Fort Worth. In addition, BCal obtained a licence and <b>sole</b> UK flag <b>carrier</b> status to commence scheduled all cargo flights between Gatwick and Houston — including an optional stop at Manchester or Prestwick in either direction.|$|R
40|$|Answers to the title&#x 2032;s {{question}} {{have been}} influenced by a history in which an early science of consciousness was rejected by behaviourists on the argument that this entails commitment to ontological dualism and "free will" in the sense of indeterminism. This is, however, a confusion of theoretical assertions with metaphysical assertions. Nevertheless, a legacy within computational and information-processing views of mind rejects or de-emphasises a role for consciousness. This paper sketches a mentalistic metatheory in which conscious states are the <b>sole</b> <b>carriers</b> of symbolic representations, and thus have {{a central role in the}} explanation of mental activity and action-while specifying determinism and materialism as useful working assumptions. A mentalistic theory of causal learning, experimentally examined with phenomenal reports, is followed by examination of these questions: Are there common roles for phenomenal reports and brain imaging? Is there defensible evidence for unconscious brain states carrying symbolic representations? Are there interesting dissociations within consciousness...|$|R

50|$|The first {{attempted}} use of antiship missiles {{against a}} carrier battle group {{was part of}} Argentina's efforts against British Armed Forces during the Falklands War. This was the last conflict so far in which two belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of its <b>sole</b> <b>carrier,</b> originally built in the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|We compare {{different}} {{treatments of}} the constraints in canonical quantum gravity. The standard approach on the superspace of 3 – geometries treats the constraints as the <b>sole</b> <b>carriers</b> {{of the dynamic}} content of the theory, thus rendering the traditional dynamical equations obsolete. Quantization of the constraints in both the Dirac and ADM square root Hamiltonian approaches leads to the well known problems of time evolution. These problems of time are of both an interpretational and technical nature. In contrast, the geometrodynamic quantization procedure on the superspace of the true dynamical variables separates the issues of quantization from {{the enforcement of the}} constraints. The resulting theory takes into account states that are off-shell with respect to the constraints, and thus avoids the problems of time. We develop, for the first time, the geometrodynamic quantization formalism in a general setting and show that it retains all essential features previously illustrated in the context of homogeneous cosmologies...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} year of production, 15 Super Étendards were {{produced}} for the French Navy, allowing the formation of the first squadron in 1979. Dassault produced the aircraft at a rough rate of two per month. The Argentinian Navy placed an order for 14 aircraft to meet their requirements for a capable new fighter that could operate from their <b>sole</b> aircraft <b>carrier.</b> In 1983, all manufacturing activity was completed, the last delivery to the French Navy taking place that year.|$|R
50|$|The {{privatization}} plan {{required the}} service population {{to be divided}} into geographical areas with each area assigned to a <b>sole</b> insurance <b>carrier</b> {{by means of a}} services contract awarded through competitive bidding and proposals. The designation and assignment of geographical areas were finalized in 2001. Subsequent to 1994, all government hospitals and medical centers were sold to private companies and investors, including local medical groups and companies composed of doctors. The only exception to the privatization plan was that the Rio Piedras Medical Center would be (and still is) run by the commonwealth government.|$|R

Jambonet currently uses four VSAT satellites to carry the country's internet traffic.|$|E
50|$|Tiring {{of life as}} a fugitive, Nader {{presented}} himself to a Persian nobleman. He was employed as a courier, to deliver important messages to the royal court at Isfahan in 1712. A second courier accompanied Nader on these missions. On one of their journeys, he murdered his fellow courier either because his companion was slowing him down or, as is more likely, because he wanted to be the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of messages to the royal court.|$|E
5000|$|BOAC, still Britain's <b>sole</b> transatlantic <b>carrier,</b> {{sought to}} compete with Pan Am's [...] "round the world" [...] service by {{offering}} an [...] "all-red" [...] route from Britain to Australia via Canada, but bilateral agreements between the UK and these countries stalled in the early 1950s. BOAC proceeded to open a London-Chicago route in May 1954, with the intention to extend the service to San Francisco and Tokyo. The San Francisco extension was not realized until 1957, and US government approval for the Tokyo service did not come until 1959 due to objections by Northwest Airlines.|$|R
50|$|On 29 February 2012, {{domestic}} competitor Aeroperlas Regional ceased operations due {{to financial}} troubles, leaving Air Panama as the <b>sole</b> regional <b>carrier</b> in the country. The same month, the airline expressed its interest {{to open a}} new non-stop international route from Panama to the Cayman Islands, using jet-powered aircraft. In anticipation for these flights, Air Panama ordered two Fokker 100 aircraft, receiving the first one in June and the second two months later. As of February 2015, the planned service to Cayman Islands is on standstill. Furthermore, almost six months after Aeroperlas' bankruptcy, Air Panama assumed all of its domestic routes.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1968 unification, MARCOM {{undertook}} several {{changes to}} its force structure. The <b>sole</b> remaining aircraft <b>carrier,</b> HMCS Bonaventure, was {{nearing the end}} of her service life, being a Second World War-era vessel. In the early 1970s, it was decided to pay Bonaventure off and not find a replacement, instead focusing on the traditional blue-water navy.|$|R
50|$|A {{provision}} existed {{that allowed}} any Heathrow-authorised British carrier operating as the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> between London Gatwick and any US city to switch that service to Heathrow {{as long as}} the incumbent airline had demonstrated its ability to carry a minimum of 300,000 non-stop passengers (both transfer and point-to-point) between that city and London, and vice versa, over a period of two consecutive calendar years. Using this method, BA was able to transfer Denver, San Diego and Phoenix services from Gatwick to Heathrow.|$|E

5000|$|On January 1, 2003, TNT {{launched}} a substitute feed called TNT Plus, {{although it does}} not appear this was ever reflected in the channel's on-air identity. The apparent sole purpose of its establishment was to force renegotiations with cable and satellite providers to increase carriage fees to help pay for TNT's new NBA and NASCAR contracts well before the channel's distribution agreements with providers were scheduled to come up for renewal. In theory, TNT Plus was to have been the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of Turner's NBA and NASCAR coverage from that point forward, while any providers still carrying the original TNT would have seen replacement programming instead. Although it appears that Comcast did not immediately sign on to carry TNT Plus, {{there is no evidence that}} Turner had actually pulled its sports programming from the [...] "original" [...] TNT.|$|E
25|$|With the PAF in {{the east}} {{effectively}} neutralized, the IAF could now concentrate on supporting their advancing army. Movements of Pakistani troops during daytime came to a virtual halt due to relentless IAF air attacks. Ferries across major river crossings were sunk by the IAF, thus denying the Pakistani army its line of retreat to Dhaka. On 7 December, INS Vikrant, the Navy's <b>sole</b> aircraft <b>carrier</b> at the time, joined the operations. Sea Hawks, operating from the deck of Vikrant, struck Chittagong harbor, Cox's Bazaar, and Barisal.
