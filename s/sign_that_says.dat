Notable details include a classical entablature surmounts pilasters with Corinthian capitals, which result in what is described as a colonnade effect, which is repeated in the upper stories. The building is capped with a heavy cornice. The structure's highly ornamented facade includes decorative cornices and terra cotta pilasters. The top two stories has Corinthian-styled columns situated upon a projecting beltcourse.|$|E

Wearing enjoyed this method of photographing because “when they returned with something they had written, it challenged her own perception of them.” [...] The photographed subjects that are from different backgrounds becomes unified through this paper where ‘all of a sudden you have to start re-appraising people.’ [...] The audience’s fantasies of imposing their own interpretations onto these photographed subjects are challenged and redirected by the paper that they are holding. This exchange between Wearing and the people she photographs makes the interaction more conversational rather than typical documentation methods of portrait photography.|$|R
