40|$|Questions about capital {{formation}} {{and the implications}} of a potentially increasing <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> in the United States have recently emerged as important public issues, not just as a matter of long~range planning but as an object of concern in ~the medium run, too. There are reasons for expecting both the overall <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> investment <b>capital</b> and, perhaps more importantly, the relative <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> long-term <b>capital</b> to crease during the coming five to ten years. As a result, private businesses may have to postpone or abandon plans for new physical investment undertakings, thereby further reducing the prospects for meeting mediumrun national goals dependent on {{capital formation}}. Many individuals and some institutions have therefore called for public policy initiatives to bolster physical capital formation against the pressures <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> <b>scarcity.</b> Not surprisingly, proposals for change in the funding of pensions have figured prominently in these discussions. As of the end of 1975, the pension funds of private businesses and state and local governments had financial assets of $ 255 billion, of which $ 224 billion represented equity interests in or debt liabilities of U. S. corporate businesses. ~ Including the roughly $ 40 billion of government securities in the Social Security Trust Fund, the total financial assets of pension funds amounted to some 20 percent of the combined equity and outstanding debt of the U. S. nonfinancial corporate business sector. Even with no changes in their current structure, therefore, pension funds already represent a substantial pool <b>of</b> financial <b>capital</b> invested in American industry. Furthermore, this pool is also growing rapidly. In 1975 the pension funds of private businesses and state and local governments purchased, net of sales and retirements, $ 2...|$|R

50|$|By contrast, George Reisman {{says that}} time {{preference}} arises {{because of the}} possibility of being less able (say through injury or the effects of aging) or totally unable (through substantial incapacitation or death) to enjoy the use of goods in the future. The further into the future someone considers, the less likely it is that this someone will be able to enjoy the goods {{as much as they can}} be enjoyed now. The root of time-preference in Reisman's view is an internal risk premium that is specific to the owner of the goods, in contrast to an external risk premium that is demanded when the owner invests them in a production process or lends them to another. He then points out that the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> combined with the uncertainties he raises, means that time preference is unavoidable and hence a minimum rate of return on that capital (such as in interest and normal profit) is always going to be required by suppliers of capital.|$|E
50|$|Still {{another factor}} {{limiting}} bureaucratic power was {{the emergence of}} an affluent society. In the early postwar period, the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> made it possible for the Ministry of Finance and MITI to exert considerable influence over the economy through control of the banking system (see Monetary and fiscal policy). To a decreasing extent, this scarcity remained until the 1980s because most major companies had high debt-equity ratios and depended on the banks for infusions of capital. Their huge profits and increasing reliance on securities markets in the late 1980s, however, meant that the Ministry of Finance had less influence. The wealth, technical sophistication, and new confidence of the companies also made it difficult for MITI to exercise administrative guidance. The ministry could not restrain aggressive and often politically controversial purchases by Japanese corporate investors in the United States, such as Mitsubishi Estate's October 1989 purchase of Rockefeller Center in New York City, which, along with the Sony Corporation's acquisition of Columbia Pictures several weeks earlier, heated up trade friction between the two countries.|$|E

Supply and demand constraints like <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> and low effective demand further reduce the scope of industrialization. Institutions have to be developed to share the risks in consumption and production and thus achieve equity and efficiency.

Monetary and fiscal intervention can ensure that such a supply response is met effectively and the benefits are passed to consumers, labor and entrepreneurs through a regulated market. ...|$|R

Anthropologist Michael Dove described the dissertation as [...] "a classic, in-depth, on-the-ground anthropological study of a 1,200-year-old industry". According to Dove, Dunham's dissertation challenged popular perceptions regarding economically and politically marginalized groups, and countered the notions that the roots of poverty lie with the poor themselves and that cultural differences are responsible for the gap between less-developed countries and the industrialized West. According to Dove, Dunham:found that the villagers she studied in Central Java had many of the same economic needs, beliefs and aspirations as the most capitalist of Westerners. Village craftsmen were [...] "keenly interested in profits", she wrote, and entrepreneurship was [...] "in plentiful supply in rural Indonesia", having been [...] "part of the traditional culture" [...] there for a millennium.Based on these observations, Dr. Soetoro concluded that underdevelopment in these communities resulted from a <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> the allocation of which was a matter of politics, not culture. Antipoverty programs that ignored this reality had the potential, perversely, of exacerbating inequality because they would only reinforce the power of elites.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the resilience {{of the stock market}} and its ability to accurately set prices are affected by credit conditions in the economy. A <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> deployable <b>capital</b> may cause market-makers to become financially constrained, leading to a breakdown in intermediation. This paper describes another channel by which the supply <b>of</b> available <b>capital</b> affects secondary market liquidity. When agents hold more wealth in technologically liquid investments, a marginal adjust-ment to portfolio holdings alters discount rates less, causing a smaller price impact. The stock of liquid wealth also buffers income shocks, leading to lower risk premia and lower volatility when savings are high. The theory thus implies that, even without intermediaries or frictions, the degree <b>of</b> liquid <b>capital</b> may be a crucial determinant of asset market conditions...|$|R

40|$|What {{prevents}} sub-Saharan Africa from escaping poverty {{through the}} development of significant manufacturing industries? The first category of constraints are those external to firms, about which we have economic theories: <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>capital,</b> taxes, poor infrastructure, lack <b>of</b> human <b>capital,</b> corruption, trade costs.
