40|$|Distribution of Cotton Bacterial Blight in Benin and Susceptibility of Local Varieties to its Attacks. In {{order to}} improve the {{production}} of cotton in Benin, Agricultural Research is continually developing varieties resistant to pests and diseases and adapted to {{the diversity of the}} local growing conditions. In this framework, surveys were conducted in 2012 in all cotton areas of Benin on 44 sites of 16 districts to detect bacterial blight strains. At least two sites were surveyed per district and on each site 30 and 10 plants were inspected randomly along the two diagonals of a cotton field, respectively for the incidence and severity. The results showed that cotton bacterial blight was present in 41 of 44 sites. The highest means for incidence (89. 3 %) and severity (62. 6 %) were observed in Alibori-Atacora area with the maximum incidence in the district of Banikoara and Kandi (100 %). The Plateau-Couffo area recorded the lowest incidence with a null value at Ketou. In parallel with the achievement of the survey, a trial on susceptibility of seven varieties of cotton against three bacterial blight isolates selected for their virulence has been carried out under greenhouse conditions at the experimental farm of the faculty of agronomy in august 2012. The <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> has been realized in a split plot design with isolate as principal factor and variety as secondary factor. Differential reactions were observed between isolates and varieties which may indicate the existence of races of the pathogen and resistance genes to it...|$|E
40|$|The non-leaf {{photosynthetic}} organs {{have recently}} {{attracted much attention}} for the breeding and <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> of cereal crops to achieve a high grain yield. However, the glume photosynthetic characteristics and responses to high temperature at the late stages of grain filling are not well known in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In the present study, an experiment was conducted to investigate the anatomy, chloroplast temporal changes, chlorophyll fluorescence, xanthophyll cycle and antioxidative defense system in glumes of field-grown wheat during grain filling compared with flag leaves. Observations using a light microscope revealed that the glumes developed a solid structural base for performing photosynthesis. Compared with the flag leaves, the glumes preserved a more integral ultrastructure, as observed under transmission electron microscopy, and had higher values of Fv/Fm and ΦPSII at the maturity stage. Further analysis of the chlorophyll fluorescence demonstrated that the glumes experienced high non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) at the late stages. Determination of the pool size of the xanthophyll cycle suggested that the (A+Z) /(V+A+Z) ratio was consistently higher in glumes than in flag leaves and that the V+A+Z content was considerably higher in glumes at the maturity stage. In addition, the glumes exhibited a higher antioxidant enzyme activity and a lower accumulation of reactive oxygen species. These {{results suggest that the}} glumes are photosynthetically active and senesce later than the flag leaves; the advantages may have been achieved by coordinated contributions of the structural features, higher NPQ levels, greater de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle components and antioxidative defense metabolism...|$|E

We demonstrate use of DARTS to identify known small-molecule–protein interactions and to reveal the eukaryotic translation initiation machinery as a molecular target for the longevity-enhancing plant natural product resveratrol.

40|$|A {{total of}} 985 wild and semi-wild soybean accessions were field {{screened}} for {{resistance to the}} aphid. The investigation involved inoculating A. glycines in cage houses, and was carried out for two years. We identified that three wild soybeans 85 - 32, 85 - 39 and 85 - 1 had resistance characters on A. glycines, whose resistance level was identified to be “High Resistance (HR) ”. The aphid resistance characters in these three materials were higher than those found in cultivated soybean materials. The damage index difference significance level test and the observed growth rate of aphis populations also further demonstrated an obvious difference in the resistance characters between the wild soybeans and A. glycines; simultaneously, they validated the aphid resistance characters in the above three materials.
