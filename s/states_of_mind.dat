5|$|Silver {{included}} lyrics in {{more of his}} compositions at this point, {{although these}} were sometimes regarded as doggerel or proselytizing. The first album to contain vocals, That Healin' Feelin' (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had to insist on the support of Blue Note executives to continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; the three were later compiled as The United <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind,</b> but were soon dropped from the catalog.|$|E
5|$|Several changes {{occurred}} in the early 1970s: Silver disbanded his group {{to spend more time}} with his wife and to concentrate on composing; he included lyrics in his recordings; and his interest in spiritualism developed. The last two of these were often combined, resulting in commercially unsuccessful releases such as The United <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> series. Silver left Blue Note after 28 years, founded his own record label, and scaled back his touring in the 1980s, relying in part on royalties from his compositions for income. In 1993, he returned to major record labels, releasing five albums before gradually withdrawing from public view because of health problems.|$|E

25|$|Carl Jung {{believed}} that the collective unconscious, which reflects the cosmic order {{and the history of}} the human species, is {{the most important part of}} the mind. It contains archetypes, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the anima (a man's suppressed female self), the animus (a woman's suppressed male self), or the shadow (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.|$|E
25|$|In Vianu's view, Momente şi schiţe {{was more}} vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict {{feelings}} and occasionally provided additional {{details such as}} physiology or cenesthesia. Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters' psychological background—aside from his Năpasta and Păcat, and O făclie de Paşte, he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, {{as a means to}} parody its use. A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, Silvian Iosifescu, who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest, while George Călinescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in O făclie de Paşte are actually physiological and ethnological.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, the {{endogenous}} {{production of}} psychoactive agents {{was considered to}} be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis. Several speculative and yet untested hypotheses suggest that endogenous DMT is produced in the human brain and is involved in certain psychological and neurological states. DMT is naturally occurring in small amounts in rat brain, human cerebrospinal fluid, and other tissues of humans and other mammals. A biochemical mechanism for this was proposed by the medical researcher J. C. Callaway, who suggested in 1988 that DMT might be connected with visual dream phenomena: brain DMT levels would be periodically elevated to induce visual dreaming and possibly other natural <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> A role of endogenous hallucinogens including DMT in higher level sensory processing and awareness was proposed by J. V. Wallach (2009) based on a hypothetical role of DMT as a neurotransmitter. In 2011, Nicholas V. Cozzi, of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, concluded that INMT, an enzyme that may be associated with the biosynthesis of DMT and endogenous hallucinogens, is present in the primate (rhesus macaque) pineal gland, retinal ganglion neurons, and spinal cord. Neurobiologist Andrew Gallimore (2013) suggested that while DMT might not have a modern neural function, it may have been an ancestral neuromodulator once secreted in psychedelic concentrations during REM sleep, a function now lost.|$|E
500|$|Lyric {{poetry is}} a genre that, unlike epic and {{dramatic}} poetry, does {{not attempt to}} tell a story but instead is of a more personal nature. Poems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative.

500|$|Critic Ruth Miller {{claimed that}} Crane wrote [...] "an {{intellectual}} poetry {{rather than a}} poetry that evokes feeling, a poetry that stimulates the mind rather than arouses the heart". [...] In the most complexly organized poems, {{the significance of the}} <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> or feelings is ambiguous, but Crane's poems tend to affirm certain elemental attitudes, beliefs, opinions and stances toward God, man and the universe. [...] The Black Riders in particular is essentially a dramatic concept and the poems provide continuity within the dramatic structure. [...] There is also a dramatic interplay in which there is frequently a major voice reporting an incident seen ("In the desert / I saw a creature, naked, bestial") or experienced ("A learned man came to me once"). [...] The second voice or additional voices represent a point of view which is revealed to be inferior; when these clash, a dominant attitude emerges.|$|E

500|$|Dostoyevsky's Petersburg is {{the city}} of unrelieved poverty; [...] "magnificence {{has no place in}} it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold". Dostoyevsky connects the city's {{problems}} to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Donald Fanger asserts that [...] "the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched." [...] The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also be perceived as a Shakespearean pathetic fallacy. For example, the great storm in Shakespeare's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character's mind, much like the chaos, disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov's mind.|$|E

500|$|A.C. Bradley notes that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the scene's few closing lines, the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance [...] "denied the dignity of verse." [...] According to Bradley, Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> or abnormal conditions such as somnambulism, with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection. Lady Macbeth's recollections – the blood on her hand, the striking of the clock, her husband's reluctance – are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish. For Bradley, Lady Macbeth's [...] "brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth" [...] with the spare and simple construction of the character's diction expressing a [...] "desolating misery." [...] Lady Macbeth's compulsive washing of her hands to rid them of blood is reminiscent of hand washing common among sufferers from Obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
