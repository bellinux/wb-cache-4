50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for <b>sanitary</b> <b>drainage</b> system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in <b>sanitary</b> <b>drainage</b> systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E

During the 1960s rain water pipes, guttering and down pipes using plastic materials were introduced followed by PVC soil systems which became viable {{with the introduction of}} ring seals. A British Standard was launched for soil systems, local authorities started to specify PVC systems. By 1970 plastic rainwater systems accounted for over 60% of new installations. A European Standard EN607 has existed since 2004.|$|E
50|$|The Alexandria Water Company (AWCO) is {{the water}} {{company of the}} city and the {{governorate}} (province) of Alexandria, Egypt. It was founded in 1860 as a private company and it operated as such for more than 100 years before it was nationalized under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser. At that time it became the Alexandria Water General Authority (AWGA), a department of Alexandria Governorate in charge of both water supply and sewerage. In 2004, through a country-wide sector reform it became a commercially oriented company under private law. The sewerage and wastewater treatment functions were transferred to a separate company, the Alexandria General Organization for <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Drainage</b> (AGOSD), later renamed to Alexandria Sanitary and Drainage Company (ASDCO). The water utility became a company under private law, reverted to its old name AWCO and gained some operational independence. Both AWCO and ASDCO are part of the government-owned Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, which owns all utilities in Egypt. AWCO serves 4.5 million inhabitants, a number that increases to 6 million during the summer season. The Alexandria water utility is one of the better-performing water service providers in Egypt, ranked fifth among 22 water utilities by the Egyptian Water Regulatory Authority in 2012/13.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, {{industrialisation}} had swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his Ansichten vom Niederrhein) until 1801, when Aachen became the [...] "chef-lieu du département de la Roer" [...] in Napoleon's First French Empire. In 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, the Kingdom of Prussia took over. The city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Administered within the Rhine Province, by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the railway from Cologne to Belgium passed through Aachen. The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until 1875, when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new, better housing was built in the east of the city, where <b>sanitary</b> <b>drainage</b> was easiest. In December 1880, the Aachen tramway network was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified. In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, pins, needles, buttons, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.|$|E
30|$|The {{national}} government has taken action against water pollution mainly targeted on the Nile River by adopting 12 programmes {{for the protection}} of the river. The measures include preventing the flow of industrial effluents and <b>sanitary</b> <b>drainage</b> into the Nile, managing waste from Nile river vessels; treatment of agricultural waste; solid waste management; periodic monitoring of water cleanliness; and developing a water quality database [6]. Five plants have been established to receive waste from river cruisers and safely dispose of the waste in the <b>sanitary</b> <b>drainage</b> networks. Greening the city is also made possible when residents have access to nature hence the action by the government to combat the pollution of Nile River helps to ensure the river flows in its natural state thus increasing the natural ecosystems in the city.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of sewage treatment in Alexandria {{has resulted in}} the production of substantial quantities of effluent and sludge. In an arid country such as Egypt, these materials should be regarded as valuable resources for agricultural irrigation and soil fertilisation, particularly as water resources are strictly limited and there is an urgent need for continued horizontal expansion of agriculture into the desert areas as the population increases. However, effluent and sludge need to be treated and managed appropriately to avoid potentially adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The use of effluent and sludge must also be practicable and economic, to ensure operational sustainability.

40|$|Background: In {{cities of}} India, {{at least one}} fifth people live in slums {{and most of the}} health {{problems}} as well as environmental issues are generated from these slums only. Objectives: To study the socio-demographic and environmental profiles as well as magnitude of morbidity among urban slum dwellers. Materials and Methods: The cross sectional study had been carried out between January 2000 and December 2000 on non-randomly selected 1, 389 slum dwellers of Ahmedabad. Information was obtained by interviewing the head and/or other family members. General physical examinations and history of illness present in previous two weeks were recorded. Results: There were no <b>sanitary</b> latrines and <b>drainage</b> facilities at studied slum. There were 987 females per thousand males and 903 females per thousand males in under five year age group. The literacy rate was 16. 8 % and 5. 6 % among males and females respectively. Among five years above age males, 27 %, 9. 7 % and 7. 4 % had a habit of smoking, tobacco chewing and alcohol intake respectively. Among five years above age females 4. 36 %, 10. 9 % and 0. 84 % had a habit of smoking, tobacco chewing and alcohol intake respectively. Out of 233 eligible couples, 11. 16 % and 24. 46 % were adopted spacing and permanent methods for contraception respectively. 28 % males and 33. 7 % females were either suffering from or have a history of one or more illness within previous two weeks. The morbidity rate for both sexes was 30. 88 %. Anemia was found in 19 % of females of age group of 15 - 44 years. Respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea were present in 7. 4 % and 3. 7 % of studied population respectively. The incidence rates for respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea were found higher among 0 - 4 year age group children (15 % and 10. 6 % respectively).
