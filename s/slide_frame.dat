25|$|A current {{production}} Glock 17 {{consists of}} 34 parts. For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm {{is designed for}} the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge, but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P and +P+ ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{compensator}} cuts start {{about halfway}} {{back on the}} top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100–1,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 23 is a [...]40 S {{version of}} the compact Glock 19. It is {{dimensionally}} identical to the Glock 19, but is slightly heavier and uses a modified <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> [...]40 S barrel, and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds.

The Glock Model 22 is favored and used by several police agencies around the world, including the Baltimore Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, Miami Police Department, Maryland State Police, Kansas City Police Department, Missouri State Highway Patrol, Alaska State Troopers in the United States, and the NSW Police Force and Queensland Police Service in Australia - among others.|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 19 is {{effectively}} a reduced-size Glock 17, called the [...] "Compact" [...] by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about [...] {{compared to the}} Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18.

These signal models or prototypes, are used to decompose the audio signal and compute analysis parameters for each grain. As a preliminary evaluation, we tested the method with real-life, monophonic and monaural recordings and obtained encouraging results...|$|R
50|$|Several {{companies}} currently offer upgrades or comprehensive rebuild {{packages for}} AMLs, particularly {{with regards to}} the elderly Panhard Model 4 HD engine, for which spare parts are difficult and expensive to source. Saymar, an Israeli firm, has proposed replacing it with a two-litre Toyota diesel engine developing 76 kW (102 hp). Another extensive AML modernisation programme is being marketed by a subsidiary of the Saudi Military Industries Corporation.

50|$|The {{detachable}} barrel {{is locked}} in place with a dowel at the receiver and a nut at the magazine tube. The barrel and chamber are chrome-coated for increased durability and corrosion protection. The chamber is sealed by rotating the sealing wedge, which locks into the port in the shank of the barrel. Its trigger mechanism is located on a detachable mounting plate. Cartridges are fed from a tubular magazine under the barrel, and shells are ejected {{from the side of}} the receiver. The forearm is located on the magazine, and is connected to the <b>slide</b> <b>frame</b> by two action bars. A blocking lever blocks the forearm when the hammer is cocked. A cross-bolt trigger safety prevents an accidental pull of the trigger from firing the gun.|$|E

5000|$|The PF-9 is {{manufactured}} in Cocoa, Florida, by Kel-Tec CNC Industries. Featuring {{extensive use of}} computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing techniques, its six main components consist of the barrel, <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> grip, trigger group, and magazine. The barrel is manufactured of SAE/AISI 4140 steel hardened to 48 RHC, and the slide is constructed of the same steel. The frame, which houses the trigger group, consists of a solid machined 7075-T56 aluminum billet. A transfer bar system connects the hammer and trigger. A hammer block safety is incorporated which helps prevent accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped. The long double-action-only trigger pull provides an additional safety feature. The pistol includes a slide hold-open feature which locks the slide in its rearmost position after the last round is fired. The grip is made of DuPont ST-8018 polymer and holds the steel, 7-round, single-column magazine. [...] The sights consist of a fixed front blade and a windage-adjustable notched rear sight. Three white dots highlight the sights for optimum visibility in low-light conditions.|$|E

50|$|When the ammo is {{too weak}} or the recoil spring is too stiff or the slide is too heavy, and limp wristing jams occur, the cure {{may be more}} {{powerful}} ammo or a lower-force recoil spring. When the ammo is too powerful or the recoil spring is too weak or the slide is too light, slide slam occurs. Slide slam is bad for the firearm and bad for the shooter's hand. The correct balance is when the ejected casings land approximately 5 feet from the shooter. In this balance there is adequate ejection and no slide slam.When a police force chooses guns and ammo for a diverse population of personnel with low hand mass {{all the way to}} high hand mass, the compromise will be to have the heavy-handed experience some slide slam, rather than the light-handed to experience limp wristed jams. The ramification is that those on the force with heavy hands will see the ejected cases go further than 5 feet. This small amount of slide slam may cause some tiny additional wear to the <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> and shooter's high mass hand, but it is a better option than a limp wristed malfunction for the low hand mass officers.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 4006 {{has been}} used by many law {{enforcement}} agencies as a standard duty sidearm, including by the California Highway Patrol, California State Parks and Rec., and until recently, the Colorado State Patrol. California State Parks and Rec, carried the Smith & Wesson model 4006-CHP from 1996 to 2009, as the primary duty weapon issued to State Park Peace Officers. The 4006-CHP was unique in that it had an adjustable rear sight (no fixed Novak rear sight), no trigger play spring, and was engraved with the State's Grizzly Bear logo and the words California State Parks under it. Additionally, the <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> and barrel were engraved with a unique identification number, which started with PR, which stood for Parks and Recreation. This number helped department armorers keep track of when a weapon went into service, who it was issued to, and kept State Park Peace Officers from inadvertently swapping parts with other officers during field stripping and cleaning, as the three main parts were hand-fitted. California State Parks and Rec. used other variants of the 4006, from 1996 to 2009, State Park Peace Officers K9 handlers were issued the 4006-TSW, with a tactical light, to free up their off hand for dog handling; also, investigators and command staff were issued the smaller, aluminum-framed version, the 4013-TSW. As of September 2009, both the California State Parks and Rec. Department and the Colorado State Patrol have both retired the venerable 4006 in favor of the lighter and more versatile Smith & Wesson M&P 40, also chambered in [...]40 S&W. From possibly the mid-1990s until 2008, the Atlanta Police Department used the 4003 TSW until replacing it with the Smith & Wesson M&P.|$|E
