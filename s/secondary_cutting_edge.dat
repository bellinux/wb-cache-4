40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill cutting edge radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The cutting edges therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling. In this paper, a mathematical modeling to predict microdrilling thrust is developed, and the geometric characteristics of microdrill were considered in force models. The thrust is modeled in three parts: major cutting edges, <b>secondary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, the major cutting edges and <b>secondary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively. The thrust modeling of the major cutting edges and second cutting edge includes two different kinds of processes: shearing and ploughing. The indentation zone is modeled as a rigid wedge. The force model is verified by comparing the predicted forces and the measured cutting forces...|$|E

The surface roughness, Ra, was less than 100 nm but the Ra/Rz ratio ranged from 0. 03 - 0. 12. The surface roughness was found to improve with increasing width of cut {{and to a lesser}} extent with increasing feed rate. A single pass of the end-mill was found to produce a smoother surface than two passes over the same surface.

Orthogonal cutting experiments were used together with FEM simulation of the cutting process. This technique was applied to machining of P 20 mold steel (30 HRC) using uncoated carbide tooling. The friction at the chip-tool contact was estimated by using the flow stress data determined at high speed cutting conditions. This data was used in modeling of turning with nose radius cutting tools where the cutting process is simulated with plane strain and axisymmetric plastic deformation analysis. The resultant cutting forces, tool stresses and temperatures were predicted in the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> accordingly.

Furthermore, the developed 3 D remeshing technique represents a possibility to investigate the effects caused by the <b>secondary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> in detail for more complex cutting processes. When a 3 D model is builtup to simulate the cutting process, an accurate meshing of the workpiece and the cutting edge is applied, which means {{that a large number}} of elements is generated.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} literature describing simulation of drilling process. It considers both {{the negative impact of}} vibrations, arising when cutting, on the given technological process (emerging so-called chatter) and the positive effects (chip breakage). The paper also examines different models used in modern works and presents basic equations of dynamics, taking into account the regenerative effect, including transverse, axial and torsional degree of freedom. Besides, it describes methods to calculate the chip thickness desirable in cutting force model. Two existing approaches to study dynamics of drilling process are discussed in detail: analytical stability analysis and time domain investigation. The first method is based on eigenvalue problem solution of delayed differential motion equation discretized in the time domain. As to the second approach, full time domain numerical modeling of drilling process using geometry algorithms is conducted. This work emphasizes the analysis of forces acting on the tool during machining. General cutting force models used in modern works are considered. The paper describes main approaches to process damping phenomenon (interaction between cutting tool flank face and work-piece) modelling. It notes the feature specific only to the drilling – near the tip of the tool the chisel edge occurs to indent to the material instead of cutting. From the authors’ point of view the most complete is the model, where a cutting edge is divided into three zones (indentation zone, <b>secondary</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and primary cutting edge), each of which uses different equations in the model of forces. Additional advantage of this model is that there is an experimental technique to determine cutting coefficients. The paper ends with a detailed classification of existing models of drilling dynamics.

Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or basic opening, diameter and length of the cutting part, mill length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The chip load thickness provided by the curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mills. A thickening degree of the chip load is changed with changing form and sizes of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> mill profile.
