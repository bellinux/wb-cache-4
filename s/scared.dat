40|$|Background : A {{substantial}} number of young women experience pregnancy <b>scares</b> - thinking they might be pregnant, and later discovering that they are not. Although pregnancy <b>scares</b> are distressing events, {{little is known about}} who experiences them and whether they are important to our understanding of unintended pregnancy. Objective : We describe the young women who experience pregnancy <b>scares,</b> and examine the link between pregnancy <b>scares</b> and subsequent unintended pregnancy. Methods : We used data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study. T-tests and regression analyses were conducted using baseline and weekly data to estimate relationships between respondent characteristics and subsequent pregnancy <b>scares.</b> Event history methods were used to assess pregnancy <b>scares</b> as a predictor of unintended pregnancy. Results : Nine percent of the young women experienced a pregnancy <b>scare</b> during the study. African-American race, lack of two-parent family structure, lower GPA, cohabitation, and sex without birth control prior to the study are associated with experiencing a pregnancy <b>scare</b> and with experiencing a greater number of pregnancy <b>scares.</b> Further, experiencing a pregnancy <b>scare</b> is strongly associated with subsequent unintended pregnancy, independent of background factors. Forty percent of the women who experienced a pregnancy <b>scare</b> subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the study period, relative to only 11 Š of those who did not experience a pregnancy <b>scare.</b> Conclusions : Young women from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a pregnancy <b>scare,</b> and pregnancy <b>scares</b> are often followed by an unintended pregnancy...|$|R
