40|$|Magnetic {{nanostructures}} {{have attracted}} attention {{due to their}} possible applications in information storage and sensors. The <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> and <b>switching</b> field are two magnetic properties that can determine the applicability of magnetic nanostructures. It is known that changing the composition or geometry of a magnetic nanostructure can change its <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> and <b>switching</b> field. Geometry can be changed {{by the addition of}} artificial structuring. However, complete control of these parameters has not yet been achieved. To investigate the changes in <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> and in <b>switching</b> field, the magnetisation reversal of nanostructures containing various compositional changes and various artifcially introduced structures were modelled. It is observed in Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowires of diameter 100 nm that are switched by an external magnetic field of 25 kAm- 1, <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> increases when the damping parameter is increased from 0. 0861 to 0. 5. Whereas, for an external magnetic field of 250 kA m- 1, <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> decreases as the damping parameter is increased from 0. 0861 to 0. 18. Increasing the damping parameter, from 0. 18 to 0. 5, increases the <b>switching</b> <b>time.</b> When a spherical artificial structure is introduced {{along the length of the}} nanowire, the position of the spherical artificial structure relative to the longitudinal axis of the nanowires was found to a ect the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> for external magnetic fields of 30 kA m- 1 and 250 kA m- 1. In an external magnetic eld of 30 kA m- 1, the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> peaks when the spherical arti cial structure is placed halfway along the longitudinal axis of the Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowire. Whereas in an external magnetic eld of 250 kA m- 1, the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> is at a minimum when the spherical artificial structure is placed in the same position. For the hemispherical arti cial structures at the end of the Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowire, the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> increases when the length of the hemispherical artificial structure is increased. Due to computational limitiations, the effect of interaction in nanowires on the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> is di cult to investigate. Thus, previous research on this topic in nanowires and in nanostructures containing artificial structures has usually been performed on isolated structures. To determine if interacting nanowires that contain artificial structures affect the <b>switching</b> <b>time,</b> arrays of Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowires were modelled. Observed in arrays of Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowires that contain various arti cial structures, the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> generally decreases as the number of interacting nanowires are increased. The objective of achieving faster <b>switching</b> <b>times</b> has been met. Research shows that increasing the rare-earth doping of Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowires can decrease the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> at large magnitudes of external magnetic elds and low values of the damping parameter. A possible new observation is seen in the investigation of introducing artificial structures where the addition of a spherical one in the middle of the nanowire can decrease the <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> at large magnitudes of external magnetic field. Rounding the ends of the nanowire could also decrease the <b>switching</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R

50|$|Mutual {{exclusion}} has a Lock convoy problem, {{in which}} threads may pile up on a lock, causing the JVM {{to need to}} maintain expensive queues of waiters and to 'park' the waiting threads. It is expensive to park and unpark a thread, and a slow context switch may occur. Context switches require from microseconds to milliseconds, while the Map's own basic operations normally take nanoseconds. Performance can drop to {{a small fraction of}} a single Threads' throughput as contention increases. When there is no or little contention for the lock, there is little performance impact, however, except for the lock's contention test. Modern JVMs will inline most of the lock code, reducing it to only a few instructions, keeping the no-contention case very fast. Reentrant techniques like native synchronization or java.util.concurrent.ReentrantReadWriteLock however have extra performance-reducing baggage in the maintenance of the reentrancy depth, affecting the no-contention case as well. The Convoy problem seems to be easing with modern JVMS, but it can be hidden by slow context switching: in this case, latency will increase, but throughput will continue to be acceptable. With hundreds of threads, a context <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> of 10ms produces a latency in seconds.|$|E

He further reason out that the switching issues are the reasons monorails operate as single lines and that it is very complex to plan for network of monorails.further it creates an operational concern as it is essential a segments of concrete beams that are mechanically moved into place, which takes 15-25 seconds in contrasts to 0.6 second <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> for conventional rail which will escalate the cost of construction while such complex switching process is not needed in a LRT System.

The Storage simulator calculates the I/O access time (per I/O request) by HDDs considering the current location of the disk arm and time needed to reach the desired new location and access data size.

Several electronic devices and systems have been realized. In late 2003 a commercial printing press was installed to test large scale production of these devices. Prior to the summer of 2005 the project made significant progress. As a step towards industrialisation, the variability and yield of the printing process needed to bee studied. A decision to implement Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Design of Experiments (DOE) to evaluate and improve the process was taken. SPC has been implemented on the EC-patterning step in the process. A total of 26 Samples were taken during the period October-December 2005. An - and s-chart were constructed from these samples. The charts clearly show that the process is not in statistical control. Investigations of what causes the variation in the process have been performed. The following root causes to variation has been found: PEDOT:PSS-substrate sheet resistance and poorly cleaned screen printing drums. After removing points affected by root causes, the process is still not in control. Further investigations are needed to get the process in control.

To reduce the methane emissions, a thermal reverse flow reactor packed with the ceramic honeycomb monoliths was developed. The methane thermal oxidation characteristics were studied experimentally. Different methane concentrations (0. 2 - 1 %) on a volume basis were used for experiments of the methane oxidation in the reverse flow reactor. The {{results show that the}} lean methane oxidation that are not normally auto-thermal can be run and sustained in the reverse flow reactor; the methane conversion efficiency achieved is over 95 %; the lowest methane concentration limit at which methane will oxidize reliably is approximately 0. 3 %; the highest temperature in the reactor is lower than the detrimental temperature of the ceramic monolith, the stability and reliability of the reactor can be ensured.

There are also several other points in the radio switching code where busy-waiting loops are used, but the impact of those loops is much smaller as their waiting time is in the order of 0.1 [*]msec. Furthermore, not all protocols are impacted by the demonstrated off-to-receive switch problem. If the timing for events after the switch is done relative to the completion of the switch, for example, by waiting until a certain number of bytes have been read from the radio, the time difference is effectively zero as well.|$|E
