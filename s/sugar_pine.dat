5|$|White pine blister rust, a {{fungal disease}} that infects conifer trees, was accidentally {{introduced}} in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s. It has since infected many <b>sugar</b> <b>pine</b> {{trees in the}} Yosemite area. The rust is managed by removing plants belonging to the ribes genus, which act as carriers of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, <b>sugar</b> <b>pine,</b> incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E

5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), <b>sugar</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
25|$|At {{elevations}} below 6,500 feet {{the dominant}} vegetation community is the mixed conifer forest. Ponderosa and Jeffrey Pines, <b>Sugar</b> <b>Pine,</b> and White Fir form the forest canopy for this rich community {{that also includes}} species of manzanita, gooseberry, and ceanothus.

There are also {{a small number of}} redwoods growing along the South Fork. Fir forests comprise almost 74percent of the forests in the Trinity River watershed; pine and hardwoods account for 13percent each. There are also limited amounts of chaparral, brush and grass/rangeland within the basin. Wildfires are common in the dry summers which receive little to no precipitation, aside from the occasional high elevation thunderstorm.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of Merced County and the independence of California from Mexico, many settlers came to the Merced River area and established small towns on the Merced River. One of the first was Dover, established in 1844 at {{the confluence of the}} Merced River with the San Joaquin River. Dover functioned as an [...] "inland seaport" [...] where boats delivered supplies from the San Francisco Bay area to settlers in the San Joaquin Valley. Some towns that followed were Hopeton, Snelling and Merced Falls, the latter named for a set of rapids on the Merced River near the present-day site of McSwain Dam. In the late 1880s a flour mill, woolen mill and a few lumber mills were constructed at Merced Falls. The <b>Sugar</b> <b>Pine</b> Lumber Company and Yosemite Lumber Company operated lumber mills at Merced Falls for over thirty years, relying on narrow-gauge railroads to ship lumber from the Sierra Nevada along the Merced River. Following the construction of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads, many of the river towns on the Merced River were deserted. Several cities that did achieve prominence, however, include Merced and Turlock, both located on the railroad.|$|E

The home villages of various groups shared many cultural elements, such as food, clothing, and shelter types. Intermarriage was common, and many people understood dialects {{of more than one}} of the three language groups spoken in the region. The Native Americans (Indians) included Tututni people near the coast and, further upstream, groups of Shasta Costa, Dakubetede, Takelma, Shasta, and Latgawa.

500|$|In part as an {{alternative}} to Auburn Dam project, flood control for the lower American River is being improved through the USD$1 billion Joint Federal Project (a collaboration of the US Bureau of Reclamation and the US Army Corps of Engineers) at Folsom Dam which adds a new lower spillway and strengthens the eight dikes that serve as part of the dam. [...] Additional work proposed includes a possible raise of Folsom Dam several feet to improve its flood control and storage capacity.

50|$|Their chaparral, grassland, and oak {{woodland}} plant communities evolved with wildfires, {{with some}} species of their native plants dependent on natural fires to regenerate and thrive.Chaparral is Californiaâs most extensive native plant community. It {{is also one}} of the Stateâs most characteristic wilderness types, dominating foothills and mountain slopes. Properly defined, chaparral is a kind of shrub-dominated community of hard-leaved plants shaped by summer drought, mild, wet winters, and fires that naturally occur every 30 to 150 years plus - more frequent fires can lead to habitat loss and conversion to non-native grasslands. Montane forests are generally pine and fir dominated communities that occur at higher elevations in southern Californiaâs mountain areas from 3000 up to 8500 ft. At the lower parts of the range, dominant trees include big-cone Douglas fir and Coulter pine as well as canyon live oak and California bay. On higher slopes, lodgepole, limber, ponderosa, Jeffrey, and <b>sugar</b> <b>pines</b> occur along with white fir, incense cedar, western juniper, and black and canyon oaks.
