5|$|Reagan {{was first}} elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild (<b>SAG)</b> in 1941, serving as an {{alternate}} member. After World War II, he resumed service and became third vice-president in 1946. The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the <b>SAG</b> president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and was subsequently elected. He was chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959. Reagan led the <b>SAG</b> through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the Taft–Hartley Act, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the <b>Sag</b> Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the <b>Sag</b> Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between <b>Sag</b> Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes k-means {{clustering}} algorithm {{to identify}} voltage <b>sags</b> patterns and group fault zones with similar impact in high and medium voltage electric. The proposed methodology comprises three stages. First, network modeling and faults simulation were performed {{in order to}} get information about voltage <b>sags</b> caused by faults in the transmission system. Voltage <b>sags</b> patterns were identified at the second stage by means of a k-means clustering algorithm, allowing the determination of fault zones. Using the power quality measurements data base of the major electricity utility of Bogotá, voltage <b>sags</b> were classified according to the previously determined voltage <b>sags</b> patterns. At the third stage of the methodology a comparison between simulated and measured <b>sags</b> is performed, allowing the identification of <b>sags</b> caused by faults...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} {{that result in}} end-stage organ damage cause inflammation, which can reveal sequestered self-antigens (<b>SAgs)</b> in that organ and trigger autoimmunity. The thymus gland deletes self-reactive T-cells against ubiquitously expressed <b>SAgs,</b> while regulatory mechanisms in the periphery control immune responses to tissue-restricted <b>SAgs.</b> It is now established that T-cells reactive to <b>SAgs</b> present in certain organs (e. g., lungs, pancreas, and intestine) are incompletely eliminated, and the dysregulation of peripheral immuneregulation can generate immune responses to <b>SAgs.</b> Therefore, chronic diseases can activate self-reactive lymphocytes, inducing tissue-restricted autoimmunity. During organ transplantation, donor lymphocytes are tested against recipient serum (i. e., cross-matching) to detect antibodies (Abs) against donor human leukocyte antigens, which {{has been shown to}} reduce Ab-mediated hyperacute rejection. However, primary allograft dysfunction and rejection still occur frequently. Because donor lymphocytes do not express tissue-restricted <b>SAgs,</b> preexisting Abs against <b>SAgs</b> are undetectable during conventional cross-matching. Preexisting and de novo immune responses to tissue-restricted <b>SAgs</b> (i. e., autoimmunity) {{play a major role in}} rejection. In this review, we discuss the evidence that supports autoimmunity as a contributor to rejection. Testing for preexisting and de novo immune responses to tissue-restricted <b>SAgs</b> and treatment based on immune responses after organ transplantation may improve short- and long-term outcomes after transplantation...|$|R

50|$|Some women use {{the pencil}} test to {{determine}} if their breasts are <b>sagging.</b> However, some degree of <b>sagging,</b> or in medical terms, ptosis, is normal and natural. <b>Sagging</b> is partly determined by inherited traits like skin elasticity and breast density, which affects the ratio of lightweight fat to heavier mammary glands. Some <b>sagging</b> {{is due to the}} aging of the glandular tissues that produce breast firmness. The general public and the medical community define <b>sagging</b> differently. Plastic surgeons categorize the severity of ptosis by evaluating the position of the nipple relative to the inframammary fold. They don't consider a woman's breasts to be <b>sagging</b> unless the nipple is positioned below the inframammary fold. In the most advanced stage, the nipples are below the fold and point towards the ground.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the relative location of voltage <b>sags</b> source based on voltage measurements only. Network faults {{are the most}} frequent disturbances in the electrical systems and in turn are the causes that generate most voltage <b>sags.</b> Thus, the proposed algorithm considers only voltage <b>sags</b> by network faults and {{a minimum of three}} voltage meters are required. Power quality can be evaluated automatically using the characterising and extracting information from voltage records. The positive sequence voltages are the descriptors used to determine the relative location of the voltage <b>sags</b> causes and the methodology is applied to a simulation where its effectiveness is verified. Matlab was used for validating this methodology, receiving voltage records of simulated voltage <b>sags</b> in ATP-EMTP...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial superantigens (<b>SAgs)</b> {{constitute}} {{a large family}} of bacterial toxins that share the capacity to induce massive activation of the human immune system. Such a feature {{is based on the}} ability of these toxins to activate T cells that express Beta-chains of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) containing variable regions (V) coded by specific families of VBeta genes. In addition, bacterial <b>SAgs</b> bypass the need for processing by antigen-presenting cells by directly binding to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on the surface of these cells. Emerging work indicates that bacterial <b>SAgs</b> utilize not only the canonical pathways of TCR-mediated T cell activation but also other pathways. Here, we review the structural information on recognition of bacterial <b>SAgs</b> by T cells, the TCR signalling induced by this recognition event, and the effector functions that this recognition triggers. We analyze experimental evidence suggesting the existence of alternative receptors and coreceptors for bacterial <b>SAgs,</b> and outline future challenges in the research with these toxins...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} an {{extended}} fault positions method {{combined with the}} Monte Carlo method to evaluate voltage <b>sags.</b> The distribution function SARFI is obtained by {{taking into account the}} randomness of (i) location of faults in lines, (ii) generation dispatch, and (iii) the prefault voltage. Voltage magnitudes are calculated with power flow, while noting changes in the generation dispatch, the load, and the topology of the area of vulnerability (AOV). The method is tested in the Atlantic coast area of the National Interconnected Power System of Colombia. The distribution of the number of voltage <b>sags</b> per year with the magnitude in bus bars and the impact of generation on the voltage <b>sags</b> are determined.
