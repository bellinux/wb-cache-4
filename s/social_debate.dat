The magazine increased in circulation under Zou's editorship from 2,800 in 1925 to 80,000 in 1930, and became a forum for political discussion and <b>social</b> <b>debate.</b>|$|E

You can launch a president.'" [...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't always tell people what they want to hear. He tells them what they need to hear.'" [...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame <b>social</b> <b>debate</b> {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E

500|$|Manhunt {{is easily}} the most violent game ever made. It will likely be {{dismissed}} by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But Manhunt also is the Clockwork Orange of video games, holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter – asking you, is this really what you enjoy watching? Had Manhunt been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. Manhunt is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep {{through the streets of}} this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's Ubisoft's Splinter Cell meets the cult Faces of Death videos [...] If Manhunt succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or <b>social</b> <b>debate.</b> That makes Manhunt the most important video game of the last five years.|$|E

Gorsuch wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent.
