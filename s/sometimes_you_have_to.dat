Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> step back and get off the wheel.

500|$|Following McCarthy {{dropping}} out of the race on October 8, the caucus vote was indefinitely postponed. Massie and Peter T. King referred to the House as a [...] "banana republic." [...] Massie also criticized Boehner for postponing the election, saying they [...] "called off the election because they didn’t like the result," [...] which was echoed by Tom Rice, Louie Gohmert, and Justin Amash. McMorris Rodgers and Conference Vice Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins defended Boehner, saying the matter was handled properly, as conference rules give him sole discretion. Rich Lowry of National Review asked McCarthy in a phone interview if the House was governable, to which McCarthy replied [...] "I don’t know. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hit rock bottom." [...] Charlie Dent, a Republican from Pennsylvania who had supported McCarthy, suggested that if Republicans are unable to agree on a candidate, the best option might be for a bipartisan coalition to select a Speaker.|$|E
500|$|Greene's {{corruption}} is exposed by the Plain Dealer newspaper and Cleveland Police Detective Joe Manditski, {{who grew up}} with Greene in Collinwood, arrests him. Bankrupt and facing prison, Greene plea bargains to lesser charges in return for becoming an FBI informant and being banned for life from organized labor. Greene is released and moves his unhappy wife and daughters back to Collinwood. Nardi gets him work as an enforcer for Hungarian Jewish loan shark Shondor Birns, and later helps pitch a deal to Mafia Capo Jack Licavoli: Greene will force the city's garbage haulers to join the union Licavoli controls. Greene, McComber, Sneperger, and ex-Hells Angel Keith Ritson terrorize many into joining, but Greene's friend Mike Frato refuses. Licavoli orders Greene to kill Frato, but Greene balks because Frato has ten children. Nardi tells him privately, though, that, [...] "You wanted to play in the big leagues. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do things you don't wanna do." ...|$|E

500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities. Beyoncé noted that the album displayed [...] "sides of [...] {{that only a few}} people had seen", adding that [...] "all of us want happiness... <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take the insecurities to get to the secure place. And all of those things I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which {{differs from that of}} Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, [...] "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that [...] "he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer." [...] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.|$|E
500|$|Rebel Heart {{opens with}} the song [...] "Living for Love". Composed in the house genre, it begins with Madonna singing over a [...] "regal" [...] piano line, {{eventually}} joined by percussion. Although a breakup song, [...] "Living for Love" [...] talks about being triumphant and hopeful. According to Dean Piper of The Daily Telegraph, the song has [...] "some classic Madonna traits: religious references, a gospel choir, 90s piano beats and a whirling bass". It was compared to her 1989 singles, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard. The second track, [...] "Devil Pray", was inspired by how one could be enticed to partake of narcotics to achieve {{a higher level of}} consciousness and connect to God. Lyrically it asks for salvation from a variety of drug abuses, making allusions to Saint Mary and Lucifer, as well as the pain of healing from drug abuse. Produced by Madonna with Falk, Avicii, DJ Dahi, and Blood Diamonds, [...] "Devil Pray" [...] starts with gentle guitar sounds which build up to an electropop production, accompanied by a house beat. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] talks about civilizations ending and the world encountering an armageddon, but humans seeing hope amid the destruction. Written with Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, it is a power ballad song, which Madonna sings in [...] "piercing" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] vocals like those of Karen Carpenter's, and the production is comparable to her 1986 single, [...] "Live to Tell". According to Douglas, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was written in three days, after Madonna personally requested studio time with him and the other songwriters. The fourth track, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", has reggae, dancehall, and dubstep influences, and is a ska song where Madonna speaks negatively about a break-up and her lover, in lyrics such as: [...] "It might sound like I'm an Unapologetic Bitch but <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> call it like it is". Madonna explained that the song is about having fun irrespective of the situation one is in.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2013, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg {{said after}} meeting with his Georgian {{counterpart}} Maia Panjikidze that Russia respected only a state [...] "that is larger" [...] and therefore the Czech Republic could not mediate between Russia and Georgia. As for Georgia’s future {{with regard to the}} occupied territories, the Czech Foreign Minister said Georgia should maintain contacts with them. [...] "It is difficult when your territories are occupied, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for years, even decades before the window of possibilities will be opened for you.

2500|$|In a 2000 {{article in}} The New Yorker Alex Ross {{described}} him as a bully. Boulez did not disagree: “Certainly I was a bully. I’m not ashamed of it at all. The hostility of the establishment to what {{you were able to}} do in the Forties and Fifties was very strong. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight against your society.” Boulez's hostility was not only directed against the establishment. When, in 1951, Henri Dutilleux, who was only {{a few years older than}} Boulez, presented his First Symphony, Boulez greeted him by turning his back. As Dutilleux said many years later: [...] "the problem was he had a lot more power than me. Indeed, he has often seemed to enjoy expressing his contempt for other musicians who do not share his musical views." [...] The most notorious instance of this is Boulez's declaration in 1952 that [...] "any musician who has not experienced‍—‌I do not say understood, but truly experienced‍—‌the necessity of dodecaphonic music is USELESS. For his whole work is irrelevant to the needs of his epoch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lighting {{challenges}} were abound for Greenberg {{as most of}} {{the film}} took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car's headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, [...] "We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look." [...] Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, [...] "In a movie like this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab ..." [...] He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of Alien Nation by figuratively mentioning, [...] "as a cameraman, you can create a lot more at night. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> feel your way. You also have true control at night. If a light is on it is because you turned it on." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E

6000|$|All {{communication}} trenches are tortuous {{and practically}} endless.

At rare intervals they branch, and a notice board says [...] "To Regent Street," [...] or [...] "To Oxford Street," [...] or some such lie. It is all just trench. For a time you talk, but talking in single file soon palls. You cease to talk, and trudge. A great number of telephone wires come into the trench and cross and recross it. You cannot keep clear of them. Your helmet pings against them and they try to remove it. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop and crawl under wires. Then you wonder what the trench is like in really wet weather. You hear a shell burst at no great distance. You pass two pages of The Strand Magazine. Perhaps thirty yards on you pass a cigarette end. After these sensational incidents the trench quiets down again and continues to wind endlessly--just a sandy, extremely narrow vertical walled trench. A giant crack.|$|E
