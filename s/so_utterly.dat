5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|But once I {{caught him}} when he was open like Silenus' statues, and I had a glimpse of the figures he keeps hidden within: they were so godlike – so bright and beautiful, <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> amazing – that I no longer had a choice. I just had to do {{whatever}} he told me.|$|E

60|$|In {{expectation}} of danger, he seized {{the person of}} the Rajah, and he pretends that the Rajah suffered no disgrace from his arrest. But, my Lords, we have proved, what was stated by the Rajah, and was well known to Mr. Hastings, that to imprison a person of elevated station, in that country, is to subject him to the highest dishonor and disgrace, and would make the person <b>so</b> imprisoned <b>utterly</b> unfit to execute the functions of government ever after.|$|R
25|$|Zimbabwe, naturally, {{could not}} answer this, {{and they were}} up against a much {{stronger}} bowling attack than their own. The openers Brendan Taylor and Stuart Carlisle survived 14 overs, scoring 62 runs, but Chris Cairns and Andre Adams inspired a collapse to 123 for 6. At one point, Zimbabwe threatened to break the record of highest ODI defeat ever (256 runs), but 45 from Heath Streak, including two sixes, took them past 200. Overall, 205 all out wasn't such a bad score. The problem {{was that they had}} been <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> demolished in the first innings – and two days later, they were to meet India's feared batting line-up, including people like Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, the new Air Corps {{discarded}} the A Plan {{in favor}} of the B Plan, which awarded only a single rating, Airplane Pilot, requiring completion of all phases of a year-long, three-school (Primary, Basic, and Advanced) flying training course. The Airship School closed in 1928 for economic reasons, ending all increases and replacements in airship ratings. The Air Corps Act of 1926 mandated that 90% of all Air Corps officers be rated, and that for reasons of economy, by 1929 at least 20% of tactical pilots had to be enlisted men. However, the latter requirement was <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> impractical it was circumvented by the Air Corps with the tacit approval of the War Department. The Air Corps had only 38 rated enlisted men in 1930 (about 4% of all pilots), and nearly every enlisted graduate was being commissioned to decrease deficits in rated officers. Those remaining as enlisted men in the Regular Army held reserve officer commissions in the event of war.|$|E

60|$|Pisani's first task, {{after seeing}} the galleys put in hand, {{was to examine the}} defences Giustiniani had erected.

I went out and looked on. Then they took all the men, Brahmans and Chumars alike, and broke caste, and tied them each to a gun. I could not have done it, though I cut down the Feringhee ladies; but they did it, and made a light matter of it. Then they fired the guns, and in a whiff their bodies were all blown away <b>utterly,</b> <b>so</b> that there was nothing left of them. This they did <b>so</b> as <b>utterly</b> to destroy the rebels, leaving neither body nor soul, but annihilating them altogether, which is worse than death. They would have done it to me, if they had caught me. Do you wonder that I hate the Feringhees, Sahib? Why, they did it even to the twice-born Brahmans, let alone a Jat. The gods will avenge it on them.|$|R

[...] "This poverty really breaks one's heart: it is so sale , <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> depressing, so hopeless. Pray do what you can" [...] {{he wrote to his}} publisher. He {{corrected}} and published An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, the proofs of which, according to Ellmann, show a man [...] "very much in command of himself and of the play", but he refused to write anything else: [...] "I can write, but have lost the joy of writing".|$|E

500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ...

500|$|In June 2014, {{the lawsuit}} was {{dismissed}} without trial by a Federal Judge {{in an act of}} Summary Judgment in Chicago, stating, in part, [...] "The differences [...] so outweigh the purported similarities between the melodies that they cannot be said to be even remotely similar” “We agree with Defendants that the songs do not have common lyrics, the themes are different, and they do not sound at all alike musically.” [...] “Thus, we find the similarity of expression to be, quite clearly, ‘totally lacking.’ The (two songs) are <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> dissimilar that reasonable minds could not differ as to a lack of substantial similarity between them.” ...|$|E
500|$|From {{its early}} days, {{there has been}} {{criticism}} of Palsgraf, and more recently, of Cardozo for authoring it. Cowan, writing in 1938, described its holding as limited to its facts, that given the identical circumstances recurring, the railroad would breach no duty to the new plaintiff by assisting a man with such a package in boarding. Prosser in his 1953 article wondered [...] "how can any rule as to the 'scope of the risk' evolved from two guards, a package of fireworks and a scale aid in the slightest degree in the solution of this question? Is it proper, in Palsgraf itself, <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> {{to ignore the fact}} that the plaintiff was a passenger... until the question is decided, is Palsgraf really definite authority even for Palsgraf?" ...|$|E

As soon as we were free, we all hurried away, to wash and dress, that we might make a decent appearance at the procession; and I saw no more of the Frenchman until we took up our station in the main street to see it pass, when he squeezed himself into a front place, elaborately renovated; threw back his little coat, to show a broad-barred velvet waistcoat, sprinkled all over with stars; then adjusted himself and his cane <b>so</b> as <b>utterly</b> to bewilder and transfix the Friar, when he should appear.|$|R

She was later given her own [...] "coming out party". She said of her debut in a public discussion once (as later recounted in her New York Times obituary), [...] "It was simply awful. It was a beautiful party, of course, but I was so unhappy, because a girl who comes out is <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> miserable if she does not know all the young people. Of course I had been so long abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls I used to know in New York. I was miserable through all that." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the day it}} was shown, [...] "Last Gasp" [...] was {{selected}} as comedy [...] "pick of the day" [...] in the Daily Express, but, the following day, an extremely critical review of the episode by Virginia Blackburn was published in the newspaper. She felt that the episode was disappointing and wasted the talent of the actors, and that the concept was [...] "the sort of idea you can imagine two students coming up with after the sixth pint ... and then feeling slightly embarrassed about it when they wake up the next morning". She summed up the episode by saying that it was neither funny nor clever, and [...] "is <b>so</b> <b>utterly,</b> irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else".|$|E
500|$|Tipping the Velvet {{was adapted}} into a BBC {{television}} drama serial {{of the same}} name, originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002. It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions, and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan, Keeley Hawes as Kitty, Anna Chancellor as Diana, and Jodhi May as Florence. The BBC had previously adapted Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow, but none had been so explicit. Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut. Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book. Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role, despite her avowed heterosexuality: [...] "To counteract any hard-core sex within it, there's a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life. It was <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> believable that you never for a moment thought, Fuck, there's no reason why I'm standing here naked." ...|$|E

There was no resistance. Thousands of the men had fallen in the battle and flight. Thousands had failed to enter the gates. All who did <b>so</b> were <b>utterly</b> panic-stricken and terrified. Thus the five thousand men you sent out have defeated forty thousand, and have captured Bruges, and I verily believe that not more than a score have fallen. Methinks, my friends, you will all agree with me that your governor has done well to give these knights the honour of carrying the good news to Ghent." ...|$|R
50|$|Gwydion {{suggests}} {{his sister}} Arianrhod {{as the new}} footholder. Math magically tests her virginity requiring her to step over his wand. She immediately gives birth to a son, Dylan ail Don, who takes to the sea. She also drops a scrap of life which Gwydion scoops up and incubates in a chest by his bed. Arianrhod is deeply shamed and angered <b>so</b> she <b>utterly</b> rejects the boy. She swears a destiny upon him that he cannot have name, nor warrior arms, except she gives them to him. Gwydion tricks her into naming the boy Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Bright Skilful Hand) by speaking to him, not knowing who he is as he is shapeshifted. More shapeshifting fakes a military attack so Arianrhod gives them arms.|$|R
500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly {{he was a}} big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E
500|$|Most {{historians have}} seen Nigel as an administrator, not a {{religious}} bishop. The historian David Knowles wrote that Nigel [...] "had devoted all his energies and abilities to matters purely secular; {{in the department of}} financial administration he was supreme, and more than any other man he helped to ensure the continuity and development of the excellent administrative practice initiated under Henry I". The historian W. L. Warren said that [...] "Stephen probably paid dearly for the dismissal of Bishop Roger of Salisbury and Bishop Nigel of Ely, for the expertise of the exchequer was lodged in their expertise." [...] Whatever Nigel's administrative talent, his ecclesiastical abilities are generally held to be low; the Gesta Stephani says of both him and Alexander that they were [...] "men who loved display and were rash in their reckless presumption... disregarding the holy and simple manner of life that befits a Christian priest they devoted themselves <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> to warfare and the vanities of this world that whenever they attended court by appointment they... aroused general astonishment on account of the extraordinary concourse of knights by which they were surrounded on every side." ...|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis {{arrived at}} Bingen on 12 July 1862 and {{were greeted by}} cheering crowds {{gathered}} in spite of pouring rain. After being introduced to town officials, they took a train to Mainz, where they had breakfast, before taking a steamer along the Rhine to Gustavsburg. From there, they took a train to Darmstadt, where they were greeted with great enthusiasm. Alice wrote back to her mother that [...] "I believe the people never gave so hearty a welcome", while her sister Helena wrote that [...] "nothing {{could have been more}} enthusiastic than her entry into Darmstadt was″. Alice did not adapt immediately to her new surroundings. She was homesick, and could not believe that while she was so far away from England, her father was not still alive and comforting her mother. The Queen confided to her journal: Already nearly a fortnight since our dear Alice has left and strange to say – much as she has been to me – and dear and precious as a comfort and an assistance, I hardly miss her at all, or felt her going – <b>so</b> <b>utterly</b> alone am I – by that one dreadful loss – that one thought, that everything passed by unheeded! ...|$|E

5000|$|Joe Viglione from AllMusic gave a {{positive}} review from the album, giving it four out five stars. He commented that [...] "it {{would be a}} mistake to think these songs are all mere 'covers.' The production and arrangements by Bruce Welch and John Farrar are innovative and worthwhile." [...] Viglione also praised Newton-John's performance, stating: [...] "After all her own hit records, hearing this superstar sing so many familiar tunes, and performing them <b>so</b> well, is <b>utterly</b> charming." ...|$|R
