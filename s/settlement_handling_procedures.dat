The importance of maintaining and improving Business-To-Consumer (B 2 C) e-business competitiveness by adequately addressing consumers&# 039; complaints has been acknowledged.

This study focuses on the influence of complaint <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> on consumers&# 039; decisions to shop online from both the online consumer and merchant perspectives. The authors found that complaint <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> have more impact on consumer confidence and trust and therefore affect their decision to shop online, especially when accessible and responsive complaint <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> are required...|$|R

The results indicated that goats subjected to typical routine <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> such as oral drenching and subcutaneous vaccination had significantly higher serum cortisol concentration than the basal levels and can be considered as acute stressors. Stressors that did not involve handling, such as heat exposure, food and water deprivation did not elicit cortisol levels significantly higher than the basal level in this study.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} profiling {{is a tool}} to gain mechanistic {{understanding of}} adverse effects in response to compound exposure. However, {{little is known about}} how the common <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> of experimental animals during a preclinical study alter baseline gene expression. We report gene expression changes in the livers of female Sprague-Dawley rats following common <b>handling</b> <b>procedures.</b> Baseline gene expression changes identified in this study provide insight on how these changes may affect interpretation of gene expression profiles following compound exposure. Rats were divided into three groups. One group was not subjected to <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> and served as controls for both handled groups. Animals in the other two groups were weighed, subjected to restraint in Broome restrainers, and administered water via oral gavage daily for 1 or 4 days with tail vein blood collections at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours postdose on days 1 and 4. Significantly altered genes were identified in livers of animals following 1 or 4 days of handling when compared to the unhandled animals. Gene changes in animals handled for 4 days were similar to those handled for 1 day, suggesting a lack of habituation. The altered genes were primarily immune function related genes. These findings, along with a correlating increase in corticosterone levels suggest that common <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> may cause a minor immune system perturbance...|$|R

The heat stress episode consisted of exposure to 50 C for up to 240 min in a forced-draft chamber. In two experiments in which broiler chickens were studied, the heat stress survival time, determined at 25 days of age, was increased by the <b>handling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The same phenomenon did not occur in Leghorn chicks or broiler chickens heat stressed after a 3 -day adjustment period.

40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental {{program was}} initiated {{for the purpose}} of understanding the mechanisms leading to bubble generation during fluid <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> in a microgravity environment. Several key fluid <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> typical for PCG experiments were identified for analysis in that program. Experiments were designed to specifically understand how such procedures can lead to bubble formation. The experiments were then conducted aboard the NASA KC- 135 aircraft which is capable of simulating a low gravity environment by executing a parabolic flight attitude. However, such a flight attitude can only provide a low gravity environment of approximately 10 - 2 go for a maximum period of 30 seconds. Thus all of the tests conducted for these experiments were designed to last no longer than 20 seconds. Several experiments were designed to simulate some of the more relevant fluid <b>handling</b> <b>procedures</b> during protein crystal growth experiments. These include submerged liquid jet cavitation, filling of a cubical vessel, submerged surface scratch, attached drop growth, liquid jet impingement, and geysering experiments. To date, four separate KC- 135 flight campaigns were undertaken specifically for performing these experiments. However, different experiments were performed on different flights...|$|R
