40|$|Strength {{values of}} the sapwood of <b>Siberian</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> were {{measured}} in a system with orthogonal coordinates along the axial, radial, and tangential directions of the cell structure. Highest strength was the axial normal strength and lowest the tangential normal strength. The {{difference between these two}} values was 87 -fold. Shear strength values remained between the two normal strength values. The highest shear strength appeared in tangential direction across the reinforcing fibers, i. e., on the plane perpendicular to the axial direction. Lowest shear strength appeared in tangential direction on the plane perpendicular to radial direction. The variations are due to orientation of cells and of fiber reinforcement in the cell wall laminas, especially in the middle layer of the secondary cell wall...|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{boost to}} Savannah's economy arrived {{with the increased}} export of naval stores. Items such as pitch and turpentine, recovered from South Atlantic <b>yellow</b> <b>pine,</b> were essential in the manufacture and upkeep of wooden ships. In 1902 the naval stores industry was revolutionized by former University of Georgia chemist Charles Herty. Herty who devised a method of collecting the raw sap from <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> in nearby Statesboro, Ga., proved that the method was not only more effective than previous methods of extraction but also enabled the trees to live into maturity and be eventually harvested. The harvesting of <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> further diversified Savannah’s economy as a lumber exporter. By this time Savannah, with vast <b>yellow</b> <b>pine</b> forests extending far into Georgia’s coastal plain, became the chief exporter of naval stores in the world.|$|R
