2500|$|Business service {{bonds are}} surety bonds which seek to {{safeguard}} a bonded entity's clients from theft. These bonds are common for home health care, janitorial service, {{and other companies}} who routinely enter their homes or businesses. [...] While these bonds are often confused with fidelity bonds, they are much different. [...] A business service bond allows the bonded entity's client to claim on the surety bond when the client's property has been stolen by the bonded entity. [...] However, the claim is only valid if the bonded entity's employee is convicted of the crime {{in a court of}} law. [...] Additionally, if the <b>surety</b> <b>company</b> pays a claim on the bond, they would seek to be reimbursed by the bonded entity for all costs and expenses incurred {{as a result of the}} claim. [...] This differs from a traditional fidelity bond where the insured (bonded entity) would be responsible for paying the deductible only in the case of covered claim up to the policy limit.|$|E
