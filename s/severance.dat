5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and <b>Severance</b> complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and <b>Severance</b> being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since <b>Severance</b> had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E

5000|$|In many jurisdictions, {{land use}} laws require that <b>severances</b> of land occur {{in an orderly}} fashion by way of plans of subdivision, {{especially}} when multiple lots are being created. [...] In order to avoid the sometimes complicated and lengthy subdivision process, some jurisdictions allow <b>severances</b> of a minor nature to proceed without a plan of subdivision, as long as other criteria are met. The approval of such minor <b>severances</b> are often referred to as [...] "consents", and the authority to grant consents is usually given to local planning bodies such as committees of adjustment or land division committees. [...] Colloquially, the term [...] "severance" [...] is often used to solely refer to such minor land divisions rather than to divisions undertaken by way of the more complicated subdivision process.|$|R
2500|$|Southern Ontario's limited {{supply of}} {{agricultural}} land {{is going out}} of production at an increasing rate.

Over 2,000 farms and [...] of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%". of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural <b>severances</b> provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.|$|R

5|$|Against his will, Gygax {{was back}} in charge again; he {{immediately}} looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had retained the rights to Gord the Rogue {{as part of his}} <b>severance</b> agreement with TSR, so he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new novels beginning with Sea of Death (1987); sales were brisk, and Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels ended up keeping New Infinities in business.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Joshua Tree, {{directed by}} Academy Award and BAFTA-winning stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who {{has turned to}} hauling exotic stolen cars with his friend Eddie Turner (Ken Foree). One day he is framed by police officer Frank <b>Severance</b> (Segal) {{for the murder of}} a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run from the law, involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove <b>Severance</b> guilty of being involved in the car ring and for murder. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the desert of the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California.|$|E
5|$|Among Jones' other accomplishments {{were the}} passage of a {{mandatory}} seat belt law, an increase in funding for the state park system, and the phasing out of the state inheritance tax. He also established the state's largest-ever reserve trust fund using income from the state's sales, income, corporate, coal, <b>severance,</b> and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a <b>severance</b> tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, and an {{increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{in public}} schools were the {{hallmark}} of Carroll's term. Using money from a coal <b>severance</b> tax enacted by Ford's administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes. He strengthened the Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks. A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings. Vocational and special education were expanded, and a program for {{gifted and talented students}} was piloted. Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from 46th to 38th nationally in teacher salaries.|$|E
5|$|In United States v.

The Court recounted the history of criminal <b>severance</b> in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E

5|$|King's Highway140, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway140, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario.

Opened to traffic in late 1972, several months following the tunnel, Highway140 has remained unchanged since, despite growing calls to resign it as an extension of Highway406.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraumatic {{injuries}} of {{the hand}} and fingers might be devastating with irretrievable functional and psychological consequences in injured individuals. We present a case of successful replantation of hand multi-level <b>severances</b> with 17 segments to address {{the best way of}} treatment of such injury. The patient was 18 -year-old female with multi-level <b>severances</b> due to cutting injury. During the surgery, we adopted unifying coordination and grouping surgery. Moreover, we tried {{to improve the quality of}} vascular anastomosis with various measures and shorten operative time. Postoperatively, we closely observed the patient to effectively prevent and treat vascular crises. Furthermore, we acquired utmost hand function recovery through enhancing functional rehabilitation exercise. The case was followed-up regularly. As a result, the replanting palm and all fingers survived successfully. Abdominal pedicle flaps were used to repair the skin of the distal end portion of thumb and middle finger due to severe injury. At 5 -year follow-up, the prehension function {{of the hand}} was restored and the patient was capable of general labour and normal activity with the replanted hand. This report demonstrated our experience of successful treatment of a rare and severe case of hand injury. Accordingly, we recommend grouping surgery, closely coordination, effective and comprehensive intra-operative and post-operative technical operations and treatments. Postoperative functional rehabilitation exercise can restore utmost hand function...|$|R
50|$|One {{method to}} treat PNS injury is {{surgical}} reconnection of the severed nerve {{by taking the}} two ends of the nerve and suturing them together. When suturing the nerves together, the fascicles of the nerve are each reconnected, bridging the nerve back together. Though this method works for <b>severances</b> that create a small gap between the proximal and distal nerve ends, this method does not work over gaps of greater distances due to the tension that must {{be put on the}} nerve endings. This tension results in the nerve degeneration, and therefore the nerve cannot regenerate and form a functional neural connection.|$|R
