500|$|Fire Station Number 4, {{also known}} as the Collyer Fire Station, (see {{building}} plaque) [...] was constructed in 1887-1888 by H. L. Bassett & Co. and F. L. Mason on the southwest corner of Broadway and Carnation Street, in the center of Pleasant View neighborhood. The building was completed and named in 1890. The main block of the Queen Anne-styled red brick firehouse is a -story, hip-roofed rectangle with a cross-gable facing Broadway. A pair of matching single-story wings with gable-on-hipped roofs project from the long sides of the building. The building has small hip-roofed porches with arched openings on the main entrance and Broadway facing sides. Though constructed of red brick and pinkish mortar, sandstone was used for the window sills and lintels and the station's trim. The building has detailed terracotta work, with an ornate foliate name and date plaque on the front gable and a string course {{at the base of the}} corbeled main entrance. Above the plaque is a semi-circular window, and another round-headed window is on the northern side. The northwest corner has a square hose drying/bell tower that also has its own round headed window. Photos of the building are available here. The station has been modified; its two fire engine doors have been removed and replaced with modern garage doors. The pyramidal roof on the belfry which crowned the bell tower was [...] "recently" [...] removed at the time of its NRHP nomination in 1983. The interior of the firehouse has been greatly altered in the conversion to office and meeting room space by the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination. The surviving details included the Queen Anne staircase and <b>sunken</b> <b>panel</b> doors. Though the interior has been greatly modified, it did not prevent its listing on the historic register.|$|E

In that frieze, the menorah is shown resting upon a double octagonal base, built all around {{in the form of}} a step. The lower base was identical in design to the upper base, only larger in circumference. Each facet of the octagonal base was made with two vertical stiles and two horizontal rails, a top rail and a bottom rail, resembling a protruding frame set against a <b>sunken</b> <b>panel.</b> These panels have some relief design set or sculpted within them. The panels are depicting the Ziz and the Leviathan from Jewish mythology.|$|E

[...] A series of these <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> was often used as decoration for a ceiling or a vault, also called caissons ('boxes"), or lacunaria ("spaces, openings"), so that a coffered ceiling can be called a lacunar ceiling: the strength of the structure is in the framework of the coffers.|$|R

50|$|The caisson is a <b>sunken</b> <b>panel</b> {{placed in}} {{the centre of the}} ceiling. It is raised above the level of the ceiling through use of the dougong (斗栱) structure, which, through {{interlocking}} structural members, as beams were not used, creates successive levels of diminishing size. Beams may also be used to create a hexagonal or octagonal caisson surrounded by a square border. These beams, and the dougong members, are usually visible, and richly carved and often painted with deities.|$|E
5000|$|The Caisson (...) , also {{referred}} to as a caisson ceiling, or spider web ceiling, in East Asian architecture is an architectural feature typically found in the ceiling of temples and palaces, usually at the centre and directly above the main throne, seat, or religious figure.The caisson is generally a <b>sunken</b> <b>panel</b> set into the otherwise largely flat ceiling. It is often layered and richly decorated. Common shapes include square, octagon, hexagon, circle, and a combination of these.|$|E
50|$|As the caisson became {{increasingly}} standard in formal architecture in ancient China, similar structures {{also appeared in}} Buddhist grottos, such as in Dunhuang. These <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> in the ceiling of grottos would be carved to imitate the dougong-based structure in wooden buildings.|$|R
25|$|The dome {{features}} <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> (coffers), in five {{rings of}} 28.

50|$|A new three-speed syncromesh gearbox {{was fitted}} along with {{standard}} Jackall built-in hydraulic jacks and Magna wired wheels. (It {{should be noted}} that a 3-speed gearbox produced at least a 25% reduction in anxiety level for most drivers. Suburban streets shivered to the sound of grating gears in pre-syncromesh gearboxes). Easy-clean pressed steel wheels with six-stud fixing became available, initially as an option but in either case they carried 5.75—16 extra low pressure tyres of a smaller section than the previous model. A spare wheel with its tyre was carried in a <b>sunken</b> <b>panel</b> {{on the back of the}} car and a steel cover was supplied for it on the dearer sliding head model which also carried toughened glass in its side and rear windows.|$|E
50|$|The Book of Llandaff {{is bound}} in thick, square edged oak boards with sunken centre panels. The lower board, which is {{probably}} the twelfth-century original, bears evidence of having been covered in {{a thin layer of}} silver and is all that remains of the earliest binding. The gilt-bronze figure of Christ in Majesty that adorned the lower cover was a mid-thirteenth century addition which has, since 1981, been kept separate from the volume in its own box. Fragments of the thin silver plate are preserved along with the figure and nail holes in the board indicate that had once been completely covered. The outline of a mandorla with associated holes in the <b>sunken</b> <b>panel</b> suggest that an earlier ornament was attached to it.|$|E

50|$|A {{drawing by}} Samuel Hieronymus Grimm shows a {{building}} {{described as the}} Old Hospital abutting on to the hall range with its two fine late medieval windows. These buildings were {{on the west side}} behind the High Street frontage of the palace. The Hospital building should date from around 1500 and the lozenge shaped terminals to the doorway and the <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> to the spandrels find a very close parallel with the Chancery, in Minster Yard, Lincoln. This is probably the building that Edward James Willson mentions as having been demolished around 1810 and it is not shown on J. S. Padley's survey of Lincoln in 1842.|$|R
50|$|The name {{is taken}} from the Pantheon in Rome, an ancient temple with a classic domed roof. The dome of the Pantheon has a series of <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> that radiate from a central {{circular}} opening {{at the top of}} the dome, and Mercury’s Pantheon Fossae is reminiscent of this pattern. Consequently, the crater near the center of Pantheon Fossae is now named Apollodorus, after the Greek engineer Apollodorus who is credited by some as being the architect of the Pantheon. MESSENGER scientists are debating whether Apollodorus played a role in the formation of Pantheon Fossae or whether the crater is simply from a later impact that occurred close to the center of the radial pattern.|$|R
5000|$|The Castle {{is built}} from pre-cast black copper-slag blocks from Reeve's foundry at Crew's Hole. Designed in Gothic Revival style, the {{building}} is symmetrical in plan with crenellated circular towers at each corner that link two-storey blocks to form a square courtyard. The front and back blocks have larger crenellated entrance towers with moulded archways through. Above the front arch is a blank panel with ogee head and a two-centre arch on the second storey with perpendicular tracery. The ranges to {{each side of the}} entrance have two windows with Y-tracery below a white string course and white carved inset panels. At the top of the ranges are light-coloured battlements with <b>sunken</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The elegant white Georgian mansion was {{originally}} large and rectangular, three storeys over a basement. It was two rooms deep split {{by a large}} central hall. A shallow hipped roof was hidden behind a cornice. There was a blocking course that included chimneystacks. The entrance front had five bay windows. The original building had a simple triparite doorcase that was set in a shallow relieving arch, as well as single-storey walls with built-in niches and <b>sunken</b> <b>panels.</b> These joined the main block and included a pedimented carriage arch on each side. The 1837 Topographical Dictionary of Ireland described it as [...] "the seat of J. McClintock, Esq., an elegant mansion, beautifully situated in an extensive and richly wooded demesne, commanding a fine view of the Carlingford and Mourne mountains and the sea." [...] The view extends to Dundalk Bay.|$|R
50|$|Over Tabley Hall is {{constructed}} in red brick with stone dressings and a slate roof. It has two storeys and a symmetrical main front of nine bays. The central bay protrudes forwards and extends upwards {{to form a}} three-storey tower. At {{the sides of the}} central bay are pilasters with <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> containing round flower decorations. At the top of the bay is an entablature with a frieze containing similar decorations. Above this is a stone gable, with crocketed pinnacles at its apex and {{at the top of the}} pilasters. In the bottom storey is a doorway with a pointed arch, and more flower decorations. Above this is a large sash window with a pointed arch, and in the top storey is a similar, but smaller, sash window. All of the other bays contain sash windows under pointed arches, one in each storey. At the corners of the house are pilasters similar to those at the sides of the central bay, with similar decorations, but rising only through two storeys. On top of each of the pilasters is a crocketed pinnacle, and smaller, similar pinnacles run along the parapet at the top of the house. The sides of the house have one bay, with features similar to the bays of the front. The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.|$|R
50|$|The garbhagriha has a pancharatha {{plan that}} rests on plinth moldings {{that are similar}} to the Surya Temple at Tezpur. On top of the plinths are dados from a later period which are of the Khajuraho or the Central Indian type, {{consisting}} of <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> alternating with pilasters. The panels have delightful sculptured Ganesha and other Hindu gods and goddesses.Though the lower portion is of stone, the shikhara {{in the shape of a}} polygonal beehive-like dome is made of brick, which is characteristic of temples in Kamrup. The shikhara is circled by a number of minaret inspired angashikharas of Bengal type charchala. The Shikhara, angashikharas and other chambers were built in the 16th century and after. The inner sanctum, the garbhagriha, is below ground level and consists of no image but a rock fissure in the shape of a yoni: The garbhagriha is small, dark and reached by narrow steep stone steps. Inside the cave there is a sheet of stone that slopes downwards from both sides meeting in a yoni-like depression some 10 inches deep. This hollow is constantly filled with water from an underground perennial spring. It is the vulva-shaped depression that is worshiped as the goddess Kamakhya herself and considered as most important pitha (abode) of the Devi. The garbhaghrihas of the other temples in the Kamakhya complex follow the same structure - a yoni-shaped stone, filled with water and below ground level.|$|R
50|$|Structure 218 is a palace-type {{structure}} in the East Acropolis. The earliest version of the building dates to the Early Classic period (Structure 218 sub 1A) and had a long room with a corbel-vaulted roof. The structure had multiple east-facing doorways, possibly five, and two narrow doorways in {{the centre of the}} western facade. Traces of red pigment survive on the cornice. The location and characteristic of this Early Classic phase lead archaeologists to believe that it was built slightly after the Early Classic phase of Structure 216 (sub 1). The building was remodelled a number of times in the Early Classic. Stage 1B consisted in the division of the room into three chambers, the addition of a bench inside the north chamber and the addition of small zoomorphic masks to the <b>sunken</b> <b>panels</b> of the cornice. Phase 1C consisted of the addition of a small platform to the western facade. The Early Classic substructure has suffered subsidence at the southern end due to movement of a geological fault. Stage 2A dates to the Late Classic, during the 8th century AD. The western facade became the main facade, the height of the corbel vaulting was reduced and the previous structure was filled. Structure 218 Sub 2A measured 36.5 m long and was raised upon a 1.85 m high platform. Like the earlier version, it had a long room with a vaulted ceiling; the walls were 1 m thick and the interior vaulting was 2.6 m high. The building featured decorated cornices. The total heigh of the building as measured from the plaza floor may have been over 6.5 m. The rear, east, side of Stage 2A consisted of three plain, stepped levels. Two benches were built against the corners, possibly to disguise the subsidence that occurred {{as a result of the}} earlier earthquake. An offering was deposited underneath the central chamber; it consisted of 9 grey obsidian eccentrics, 14 flint eccentrics, a spondylus shell, a small fragment of greenstone and carbon remains mixed with unidentified vegetable fibres. The following stage, denominated 2B by archaeologists, also dates to the 8th century and consisted of the unification of Structure 218 with the neighbouring structures 217 and 219, creating a new facade with nine doorways. Three vaulted chambers were added to the east facade, with spacing between them; the north and south chambers (A and B) were built over the earlier benches. The central chamber (Chamber C) had flanking stairways. The talud wall between chambers A and C had the remains of a giant mask but the upper sectiuon of the wall was demolished by the Terminal Classic occupants of the city. The remains of painted murals were discovered in the interior of the central chamber of the palace, using red, blue, black and yellow pigments. The murals were badly damaged but apparently depicted human figures performing actions near a palace and a ballcourt. A high status Late Classic burial (Burial YX-08) was also found in Structure 218, buried in a cist in front of the main entrance. Four individuals were interred to the south of this principal burial during the Terminal Classic. They were not buried in cists and were unaccompanied by offerings. The bones belonged to individuals of varying ages and gender. At this time, during the 9th century AD, a three-chambered building with a perishable roof was built upon the upper platform of the structure; the chambers were linked by doorways. The only access to the building was via a narrow, sunken stairway built directly over the earthquake fissure. In its final form Structure 218 stood 38 m high, with four stepped platforms supporting the superstructure. The final remodelling of the building resulted in the blocking of the top of the stairway with a wall.|$|R
