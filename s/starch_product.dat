40|$|Background: The {{proportion}} of starch disappearing {{from the small}} intestinal lumen is generally lower in ruminants than in monogastric animals, and {{there are indications that}} the starch digestion capacity in ruminants is limited. Objectives: Milk-fed calves were used to study the rate-limiting enzyme in starch hydrolysis and to quantify starch fermentation in ruminants. Methods: Forty male Holstein-Friesian calves were fed milk replacer containing either lactose (control) or 1 of 4 corn starch products. The following starch products differed in the enzyme ratios required for their complete hydrolysis to glucose: gelatinized starch [a-amylase and (iso) maltase], maltodextrin [(iso) maltase and a-amylase], maltodextrin with a- 1, 6 -branching (isomaltase, maltase, and a-amylase), and maltose (maltase). In the adaptation period, calves were stepwise exposed to an increasing dose of the <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> for 14 wk to allow maximal adaptation of all enzyme systems involved. In the experimental period, apparent total tract and ileal <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> disappearance, total tract <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> fermentation, and a-amylase, maltase, and isomaltase activities were determined at 18 % inclusion of the <b>starch</b> <b>product.</b> Results: Maltase and isomaltase activities in the brush border did not increase for any of the <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatments. Luminal a-amylase activity was lower in the proximal (3. 9 ± 3. 2 and 2. 7 ± 1. 7 U/mg Co for control and <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> calves, respectively) but greater in the distal small intestine of starch-fed calves than in control calves (0. 0 ± 0. 0 and 6. 4 ± 1. 5 U/mg Co for control and <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> calves, respectively; means ± SEs for control and means ± pooled SEMs for <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatments). Apparent ileal (61. 6 % ± 6. 3 %) and total tract (99. 1 % ± 0. 4 %) <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> disappearance did not differ between <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatments, suggesting that maltase activity limits starch digestion in ruminants. Total tract <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> fermentation averaged 414 ± 43 g/d, corresponding to 89 % of intake, of which half was fermented before the terminal ileum, regardless of <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> treatment. Conclusion: Fermentation, rather than enzymatic digestion, is the main reason for small intestinal starch disappearance in milk-fed calves...|$|E

40|$|A new linear short-chain <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> was {{prepared}} by gelatinization of potato starch followed by enzymatic degradation, precipitation (retrogradation) and filtration. A high specific surface area was subsequently created by washing with ethanol or acetone or freeze-drying. Tablets compressed from a mixture containing the <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> and 30 % theophylline at {{a force of}} at least 15 kN showed no disintegration and an almost constant (zero-order) sustained drug release.

Drug release proved to be not affected by the incorporation of magnesium stearate into the tablet or the presence of alpha-amylase in the dissolution medium, both features in contrast to similar tablets compressed from conventional pregelatinized starches, which were prepared by gelatinization followed directly by thermic dehydration. A specific surface area of 1. 5 m(2) /g proved to be a prerequisite for the <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> to control drug release. A high surface area (linear long-chain) amylose product showed a sustained but less linear release profile.

40|$|A laboratory-scale {{method for}} {{determining}} the molecularly dispersed amount of cationic starch adsorbed on a papermaking pulp was developed. The starch was molecularly dispersed by pressure cooking and was characterised by SEC-MALLS (Size Exclusion with Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering) {{before and after the}} adsorption experiment. The adsorbed amount was calculated from the depletion of starch polymers in the starch-fibre suspension. The molecular composition of the adsorbed <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> was determined from the difference in the SEC chromatograms before and after adsorption.

The value of the method was demonstrated using the example of a low DS cationic potato starch derivative. This sample from a slurry process was adsorbed to a significantly higher extent in virtually electrolyte-free deionised water (DW) than in water with a high electrolyte content (36 degrees German Hardness - 36 dGH). In DW, both amylopectin and amylose were adsorbed on the pulp, whereas in water of 36 dGH only the amylopectin-rich fraction was adsorbed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Starches are {{the major}} source of dietary glucose in weaned {{children}} and adults. However, small intestine alpha-glucogenesis by starch digestion is poorly understood due to substrate structural and chemical complexity, as well as the multiplicity of participating enzymes. Our objective was dissection of luminal and mucosal alpha-glucosidase activities participating in digestion of the soluble <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> maltodextrin (MDx). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunoprecipitated assays were performed on biopsy specimens and isolated enterocytes with MDx substrate. RESULTS: Mucosal sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) contributed 85 % of total in vitro alpha-glucogenesis. Recombinant human pancreatic alpha-amylase alone contributed < 15 % of in vitro alpha-glucogenesis; however, alpha-amylase strongly amplified the mucosal alpha-glucogenic activities by preprocessing of starch to short glucose oligomer substrates. At low glucose oligomer concentrations, MGAM was 10 times more active than SI, but at higher concentrations it experienced substrate inhibition whereas SI was not affected. The in vitro results indicated that MGAM activity is inhibited by alpha-amylase digested <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> "brake" and contributes only 20 % of mucosal alpha-glucogenic activity. SI contributes most of the alpha-glucogenic activity at higher oligomer substrate concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: MGAM primes and SI activity sustains and constrains prandial alpha-glucogenesis from starch oligomers at approximately 5 % of the uninhibited rate. This coupled mucosal mechanism may contribute to highly efficient glucogenesis from low-starch diets and play a role in meeting the high requirement for glucose during children's brain maturation. The brake could play a constraining role on rates of glucose production from higher-starch diets consumed by an older population at risk for degenerative metabolic disorders...|$|E

It was established that Russian <b>starch</b> <b>products</b> and <b>starch</b> sweeteners {{are on the same}} level on quality as best European samples and they are very competitive. Market demand in crystalline glucose for food and medical purposes (over 30 thous. tons) is fully covered by import. The volume of import of modified starches exceeds 80 % of total consumption. The biggest volume of import among native starches belongs to potato starch – over 60 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the general applicability {{of a new}} pregelatinized <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> in directly compressible controlled-release matrix systems. It was prepared by enzymatic degradation of potato starch followed by precipitation (retrogradation), filtration and washing with ethanol. The advantages of the material include ease of tablet preparation, the potential of a constant release rate (zero-order) {{for an extended period}} of time and the possibility to incorporate high percentages of drugs with different physicochemical properties. Constant release profiles are the result of solvent penetration into the tablet. For theophylline as test drug, constant release profiles could be realized up to a drug content of 75 %. This illustrates the possibility to control the release of highly dosed drugs. Release rates from retrograded pregelatinized starch tablets can be enhanced or decreased to the desired profile by different parameters, like geometries of the tablet, compaction force and the incorporation of additional excipients. For procaine HCl it is demonstrated that larger tablets show slower release rates. The incorporation of soluble excipients like lactose and mannitol results for paracetamol in enhanced release rates.

This review aims to identify the opportunities and challenges associated with this technology. In addition to discussing the effects of high pressure on food components, this review covers the combined effects of high pressure processing with: gamma irradiation, alternating current, ultrasound, and carbon dioxide or anti-microbial treatment. Further, the applications of this technology in various sectors — fruits and vegetables, dairy, and meat processing—have been dealt with extensively. The integration of high-pressure with other matured processing operations such as blanching, dehydration, osmotic dehydration, rehydration, frying, freezing / thawing and solid-liquid extraction has been shown to open up new processing options. The key challenges identified include: heat transfer problems and resulting non-uniformity in processing, obtaining reliable and reproducible data for process validation, lack of detailed knowledge about the interaction between high pressure, and a number of food constituents, packaging and statutory issues.

40|$|The {{realization}} that low–glycemic index diets were formulated using resistant starch {{led to more}} than a decade of research on the health effects of resistant starch. Determination of the metabolizable energy of the resistant <b>starch</b> <b>product</b> allowed for the performance of isocaloric studies. Fermentation of resistant starch in rodent studies results in what appears to be a healthier gut, demonstrated by increased amounts of short-chain fatty acids, an apparent positive change in the microbiota, and increased gene expression for gene products involved in normal healthy proliferation and apoptosis of potential cancer cells. Additionally, consumption of resistant starch was associated with reduced abdominal fat and improved insulin sensitivity. Increased serum glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) likely plays a role in promoting these health benefits. One rodent study that did not use isocaloric diets demonstrated that the use of resistant starch at 8 % of the weight of the diet reduced body fat. This appears to be approximately equivalent to the human fiber requirement. In human subjects, insulin sensitivity is increased with the feeding of resistant starch. However, only 1 of several studies reports an increase in serum GLP- 1 associated with resistant starch added to the diet. This means that other mechanisms, such as increased intestinal gluconeogenesis or increased adiponectin, may be involved in the promotion of improved insulin sensitivity.

Garri is mostly pre-gelatinized and {{agglomerate}} <b>starch</b> <b>product.</b> The {{challenge lies in}} maximizing the protein supplementation without changing the textural characteristics. Three different soybean flours were used for fortification: toasted soy flour (TSF), isolated soy protein (ISP) and defatted soy flour (DSF). The soy flours were dispersed in water, and the pH of the dispersions adjusted to 6. 5 and 4. 5. Both boiled and unboiled dispersions were used. Fortification of garri with soy flour to a protein content of 15 % w/w affected the texture of garri agglomerates. The addition of soy flour suspensions that were not boiled to the shredded cassava roots resulted in increase of hardness of swollen garri particles by a factor greater than 1. 7 for ISP and DSF and a factor of 1. 2 for TSF.
