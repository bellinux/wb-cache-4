The Raman analysis of water is a good alternative. Instead of preparing fluid inclusions within minerals by the crack-and-heal method, fused-silica capillary capsules (FSCCs) were used as <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions to calibrate the Raman signal of water toward chlorinity. The preparation of FSCCs is convenient in the preparation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions, and the composition of the standard solutions is well controlled all along the preparation procedure.

40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> {{inclusions}} {{formed in}} high P-T experiments, which are subsequently analyzed with LA-ICP-MS, {{enable us to}} collect thermodynamic data to constrain metal transport in aqueous fluids as well as partitioning of metals between coexisting phases. The most essential prerequisite for such studies {{is to ensure that}} equilibrium conditions between liquid and solid phases are reached prior to the formation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions in the host mineral. Various methods have been proposed by different authors to achieve this goal, but to this point our knowledge on the best approach to synthesize equilibrated fluid inclusions under constrained pressure, temperature, and compositional (P, T, and X) conditions remains poor. In addition, information on the time needed to reach equilibrium metal concentrations in the fluid {{as well as on the}} timing of the onset of fluid inclusion formation in the host mineral are scarce. The latter has been tested in a series of time-dependent experiments at 800 °C and 200 MPa using scheelite (CaWO 4), molybdenite (MoS 2) and metallic gold as dissolving phases and using different approaches to optimize the formation of equilibrated fluid inclusions. Both Embedded Image and Embedded Image were fixed during all experiments using the pyrite-pyrrhotite-magnetite buffer (PPM). As an intermediate in situ quenching of the sample charge plays an important role in the synthesis of fluid inclusions, we further tested the efficiency of such an intermediate quench for re-opening fluid inclusions formed at 600 °C and 200 MPa. Our results reveal that fluid inclusions start forming almost instantaneously and that equilibrium between fluid and solid phases occurs in the timescale of less than two hours for molybdenite and gold up to ca. 10 h for scheelite. The best approach to synthesize equilibrated fluid inclusions at 800 °C was obtained by using an intermediate quench on a previously unfractured quartz host. Experiments at 600 °C showed similar results and illustrate that this should be the method of choice down to this temperature. Below 600 °C pre-treatment of the quartz host (HF etching and/or thermal fracturing) becomes important to produce large enough fluid inclusions for the analyses via LA-ICP-MS and special care must be taken to prevent premature entrapment of the fluid. Fluids with 8 wt% NaCl in equilibrium with scheelite, molybdenite and gold at 800 °C and 200 MPa have concentrations of ca. 7300 ppm W, 1300 ppm Mo, and 300 ppm Au, respectively, which is in good agreement with results from other studies or extrapolation from lower temperatures. It can be concluded that the formation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions from an equilibrated fluid is possible, but different experimental designs are required, depending on the investigated temperature. In general, dissolution of solid phases seems to be much faster than previously assumed, so that experimental run durations can be designed considerably shorter, which is of great advantage when using fast-consuming mineral buffers...|$|E

We employ a novel technique of forming <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions in olivine at run conditions to preserve samples of experimental fluids for subsequent analysis. Our experiments confirm that the breakdown of antigorite and chlorite are the most important fluid-producing reactions from serpentinite at sub-arc depths. For our low CaO/Al 2 O 3 peridotitic composition at 3. 5 to 4. 0 GPa we find that clinopyroxene reacts out below 750 [*]°C and chlorite breaks down progressively between 700 and 800 [*]°C to form garnet harzburgite. Raman analysis of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions indicates that all experiments contained a single aqueous fluid phase, which – together with a lack of textural or mineralogical evidence for hydrous melting – indicates that the water-saturated solidus for our starting composition is above 900 [*]°C at 4. 0 GPa.

In general, the fluids are enriched in trace elements compared to the bulk starting material, but particularly so for Li, B, LILE, LREE, and U. Chlorite dehydration fluids have high Li/B, LREE/HREE and Ce/Y due to retention of some B in olivine, and retention of Y and HREE in garnet. Our results indicate that fluids produced by serpentinite dehydration at sub-arc depths may carry some of the slab-derived trace elements required for arc magmatism, and may fractionate key trace element ratios in the dehydrated residues, which in turn may ultimately contribute to the geochemical heterogeneity of mantle-derived magmas...|$|E

Using <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions, namely closed vacuoles fabricated inside one solid host by hydrothermal processes, a Raman study was performed to examine how a superheated solvent (under negative pressure) interacts with its dissolved solutes. As a result, this contribution not only illustrates this well-known tensile state, but also displays evidence that a stretched solvent is able to pull on its dissolved solutes and put them also under a stretched state. The dielectric continuum hypothesis may lead to expect a stretching effect in solutes similar to the solvent’s, but our measurements evidence a damping mechanical effect (growing with tension), most probably related to solvation shells. One practical consequence is that the (experimentally known) super-solvent properties of superheated solutions are certainly related to the change of the chemical potential of solutes which results from the damping effect.

Currently, more experiments are being conducted while data are being analyzed to characterize the rheology of the foam. Cuttings transport experiments have been conducted using air, water and cuttings. Preliminary results have shown that it may not be possible to avoid cuttings bed deposition under any practical combination of air and water flow rates. Foam stability analyses have been conducted. Effects of salt and oil concentration on the foam stability have been investigated. A software for controlling the data sampling and data storage during cuttings monitoring process have been developed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Understanding {{nanoparticle}} diffusion within non-Newtonian {{biological and}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fluids</b> {{is essential in}} designing novel formulations (e. g., nanomedicines for drug delivery, shampoos, lotions, coatings, paints, etc.), but is presently poorly defined. This study reports the diffusion of thiolated and PEGylated silica nanoparticles, characterized by small-angle neutron scattering, in solutions of various water-soluble polymers such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) probed using NanoSight nano-particle tracking analysis. Results show that the diffusivity of nanoparticles is affected by their dimensions, medium viscosity, and, in particular, the specific interactions between nanoparticles and the macromolecules in solution; strong attractive interactions such as hydrogen bonding hampe...|$|R
