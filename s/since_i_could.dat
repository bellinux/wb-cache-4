60|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make {{no more of}} her, I was fain to {{be content}} with this.|$|E
60|$|I {{went to her}} {{and having}} cut the straps, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not stop to untie their knots, lifted the veil.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{has turned}} so; but fifty years <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have proved it otherwise,' the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the pony's lean flank.|$|E
60|$|I wrought like a fiend, for I {{expected}} {{every moment}} to be swamped; and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved straight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, {{and just as}} I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to think of them, Miss Hannay. I used to be rather of Wilson's opinion, but I have seen things <b>since</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not account for at all. There was a man here two or three months back who astounded me." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was much}} {{of truth in}} what Archie said, and yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not bring myself on the moment to believe we might do what seemed a most venturesome thing. <b>Since,</b> however, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not well answer the {{arguments}} he brought up, I set about as if to throw cold water on the scheme, by saying with {{the air of a}} lad who knows it all: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} you'd be happy in there. It looks real splendid to me, and I've been longing {{to see it}} ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come out." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when at last}} I {{had worked}} myself back to a firm {{position}} I hesitated to ascend, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not know that Thurid was not still awaiting me above.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a relief; it's {{quite a while}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{feel the}} bridle," [...] said Curtis, turning to Prescott. [...] "How did you scare Wandle off? Be as quick as you can!" ...|$|E
60|$|I thanked them and, glad {{enough to}} avail myself of this grace for my limbs were stiff with want of exercise, {{began to walk}} joyfully. I thought that the room {{must be one of}} those numberless apartments which opened on to the terrace, <b>since</b> {{distinctly}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear the wash of the sea coming from far beneath, doubtless through the open window-places.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{must tell}} you {{something}} else, Mr. Homos, and I hope you won't take it amiss. The first night when you talked about Altruria here, and showed us how you had come, by way of England, and the place where Altruria ought to be on our maps, I looked them over, after you were gone, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make nothing of it. I have often looked at the map <b>since,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never find Altruria; it was no use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{just before}} we left school, he carried off the prize in swimming. He was a good swimmer, but I was a better. I thought myself for once certain to beat him, but {{an hour before the}} race I got frightful cramps, a thing that I never had before or <b>since,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly make a fight at all. I thought at the time, and <b>I</b> have thought <b>since,</b> that <b>I</b> must have taken {{something}} at breakfast that disagreed with me horribly, and that he somehow put it in my tea.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will if I like," [...] she retorted. [...] "Nell, ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{remember}} you've {{raved about}} the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and deep. So wake up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. My brother's {{expenses}} {{have been}} higher, as well, and I {{was driven to}} the conclusion that <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not afford both, I'd better let the mare go and keep the brother." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hear you}} have {{commenced}} married man--so much the better. I know not whether the nine gipsies are jealous of my lucky, {{but they are}} a good deal shyer <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> boast the important relation of husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{at school}} {{up to the}} age of twelve," [...] Mrs. Andrews said quietly; [...] "circumstances at that time obliged me to remove him; but <b>I</b> have <b>since</b> done what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> myself towards {{continuing}} his education, and he still works regularly of an evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To think," [...] {{said the}} poor boy, slowly, [...] "that I've {{come all the}} way to the North Pole for this! Why I've {{believed}} in the great sea-serpent <b>since</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think, I've seen pictures of it twisting its coils round three-masted ships, and goin' over the ocean with a mane like a lion, and its head fifty feet out o' the water! Oh! it's too bad, I'd have given my ears to have seen the great sea-serpent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it <b>since.</b> <b>I</b> wish you <b>could</b> have heard how she talked of it--with what candour and generosity. <b>I</b> wish you <b>could</b> have heard her honouring your forbearance, {{in being able}} to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever {{receiving}} from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always {{like the}} earth," [...] she murmured. [...] "Always. And <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{find in the}} {{universe}} only what was {{deeply rooted in the}} fibres of my being there was love in it, too. But we won't talk of that." ...|$|E
60|$|Then she died. And {{for a time}} I too {{seemed to}} die, but could not. I buried her and the child here at Fulcombe; or rather I buried their ashes <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not endure that her beloved body should see corruption.|$|E
6000|$|It was then, when I laughed, that visions, dreams, memories, {{were put}} to flight, for my wise sister was {{studying}} my face, and now, putting her hand on mine, she said, [...] "Listen!" [...] And I listened, sadly, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> guess what was coming.|$|E
6000|$|But I {{must have}} lost it longer than <b>I</b> had thought, <b>since,</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> recognize {{nothing in the}} darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of my own thought, [...] "Two One Pound notes." ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR YORKE,--The {{story of}} the Ravenswing was written a long time <b>since,</b> and <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> account for the bad taste of the {{publishers}} of the metropolis who refused it an insertion in their various magazines. This fact {{would never have been}} alluded to but for the following circumstance:-- ...|$|R
60|$|I fancy, notwithstanding, {{this sort}} of {{responsibility}} gives the ministers or people of England very little trouble, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> discover any sensitiveness to their duties on this score. We all went in at Herman Mordaunt's, after walking to the house as we had walked from it, and were made to take a light supper, including some delicious chocolate. Just as we sat down to table, Bulstrode joined us, to receive the praises he had earned, and to enjoy his triumph. He got a seat directly opposite to mine, on Anneke's left hand, and soon began to converse.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not even}} {{so much as}} hazard a guess, the old man, forgetting his weariness and the need of gaining repose, led me out to {{where he had been}} halted by the sentinel, and, finding him at his post, began his {{investigations}} by saying: ...|$|E
60|$|King. Yes, I'll wear The fox no longer, but {{put on the}} lion; And <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{resolve to}} take the heads Of this great insurrection, you, the members, Look to it; beware, turn from your stubbornness, And learn to know me, for I will be king.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wantin' now!" [...] exclaimed {{the youth}} earnestly; [...] "I'm always wantin'. I've bin wantin' ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk; but I won't go till you let me, mother, that I won't!" [...] And he struck {{the table with}} his fist so {{forcibly}} that the platters rung again.|$|E
60|$|My first cursory {{inspection}} of {{the face of the}} cliffs filled my heart with forebodings, <b>since</b> nowhere <b>could</b> <b>I</b> discern, except where the weird herald stood still shrieking his shrill summons, the faintest indication of even a bare foothold upon the lofty escarpment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought that}} I {{did not love}} him at all,' she went on hysterically. 'A {{year and a half}} had passed <b>since</b> we met. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go by the gate of his garden without {{thinking}} of him--look at his seat in church and not care. But I saw him this morning--dying because he loves me so--I know it is that! Can I help loving him too? No, I cannot, and I will love him, and I don't care! We have been separated somehow by some contrivance--I know we have. O, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only die!' ...|$|R
5000|$|In another version, Cassandra {{consented to}} have sex with Apollo in {{exchange}} for the gift of prophecy, and then broke her promise. Her punishment was the curse of never being believed. This version of the myth is told by Cassandra in Aeschylus's Agamemnon: [...] "Oh, but he struggled to win me, breathing ardent love for me....I consented to Loxias (Apollo) but broke my word....Ever <b>since</b> that fault <b>I</b> <b>could</b> persuade no one of anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is hard to}} {{make them}} hear amid their darkness, [...] And it is long <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> call him home; [...] I am but his wife, but if you cry aloud [...] With that sweet voice that is so dear to him [...] He cannot help but listen.|$|E
60|$|One {{thing had}} {{struck me as}} curious about these hussars--that they {{pronounced}} French with the utmost difficulty. I remarked it to the lieutenant as he rode by my side, and I asked him from what foreign country his men were recruited, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> perceive {{that they were not}} Frenchmen.|$|E
60|$|And when, in my excited {{frame of}} mind, {{it seemed as}} if the escape was but just begun, I found myself in the thicket amid those lads who had been my playmates <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> remember, while each strove to show in silence how delighted he was that I had come safely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Forgive me, Mr. Waverley--and {{remember}} it is but within {{this half hour}} that there existed between us a barrier of a nature to me insurmountable, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> think of {{an officer in the}} service of the Elector of Hanover in any other light than as a casual acquaintance. Permit me then to arrange my ideas upon so unexpected a topic, and in less than an hour I will be ready to give you such reasons for the resolution I shall express as may be satisfactory at least, if not pleasing to you.' So saying Flora withdrew, leaving Waverley to meditate upon the manner in which she had received his addresses.|$|R
60|$|I was a {{good deal}} mortified at the purport of this letter, which seemed to adjourn to a more distant place and date the service which I had hoped to receive from this man Campbell. Still, however, it was some comfort to know that he {{continued}} to be in my interest, <b>since</b> without him <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have no hope of recovering my father's papers. I resolved, therefore, to obey his instructions; and, observing all caution before the guests, to take the first good opportunity <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find to procure from the landlady directions how I was to obtain a meeting with this mysterious person.|$|R
30|$|The Black-necked Cranes have wintered in Bhutan {{since time}} immemorial. The oldest survey {{respondent}} (82  year old woman from Bumthang) stated “BNC has always visited our area <b>since</b> the time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> remember”. She also stated as BNCs being {{the part of}} Bumthang’s landscape and how people of the community welcomed the BNC whenever they visit the area with great happiness. However, people in Bumthang and Trashi Yangtse reported witnessing the decrease in BNC visiting their place each winter and the records maintained by RSPN corroborates the claim.|$|R
