The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of the Aircam project, carry out more detailed inspections.|$|E

5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> generated by the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia.

5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners.

5|$|There {{are many}} different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic.

5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E

Most worlds also feature a Disney villain whom the player must defeat.

Available summoned characters include the Genie from Aladdin, Tinker Bell from Peter Pan, and Simba from The Lion King, among others.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, {{relations}} {{were not always}} friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> concluded {{at the end of}} the war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave an indication of their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E
5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines {{can be drawn}} on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved {{that the number of}} curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the floods, the NWS utilized enhanced radar technology and computer models to better forecast flood events, {{as well as}} improved communications. Whereas in 1985, three different NWS agencies issued different warnings for the area affected in southwest Virginia, the NWS has since restructured to allow local offices, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in Roanoke, to directly issue watches and warnings. The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia {{in the years after}} the floods. As many West Virginia counties lacked a full-time emergency management director at the time, funding from the NWS provided 24‑hour weather radios for every county by the year 1987.|$|E
5|$|Many foreign {{visitors}} to Iran {{of the time}} had commented on their pitiful situation. Traveller A.V.W. Jackson noted that Zoroastrians lived in constant fear of persecution by Muslim extremists and their lives were in danger whenever the fanatical spirit of Islam broke out, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> witnessed by him in Yazd. According to Edward Browne, the wall of Zoroastrian houses had to be {{lower than that of}} the Muslims and prohibited from marking their houses with distinctive signs. Zoroastrians were forbidden from erecting new houses and repairing old ones.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows.
