25|$|Varitek {{was called}} {{up for a}} single game on September 24, 1997, {{collecting}} a single in his only at bat. During the 1998 season, Varitek split time with incumbent catcher Scott Hatteberg playing in 86 games. Varitek showed signs {{of things to come}} in the season, and with a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> training the following season, Varitek earned the starting catcher position.|$|E
25|$|With {{the lineup}} and {{starting}} rotation largely set, the main position battles entering camp were for {{spots in the}} bullpen and on the bench. Ultimately, the available bench spots were claimed by infielder Casey McGehee, who had been claimed off waivers from the Chicago Cubs during the offseason, center fielder Chris Duffy, who was invited to camp as a non-roster invitee, and outfielder Brad Nelson, the Brewers' fourth-round draft pick in 2001. Mike Lamb, who had been expected to make the club before McGehee's <b>strong</b> <b>spring,</b> was released by the team on April 1; he was eventually signed to a minor league deal by the New York Mets. Closer Trevor Hoffman suffered an oblique strain in mid-March {{and was forced to}} begin the regular season on the disabled list.|$|E
500|$|On December 6, 2012, Revere {{was traded}} to the Philadelphia Phillies in {{exchange}} for Vance Worley and Trevor May. Revere was picked to lead off the Phillies' Opening Day lineup for the 2013 season against the Atlanta Braves over Jimmy Rollins after a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> training performance. After acquiring Revere, Phillies General Manager (GM) Rubén Amaro commented, [...] "He can go {{to the top of the}} order or bottom of the order. Either way, for us it was about the defense and the speed. We like athletic players and he's certainly that. He has great energy, a fantastic defender. And those are priorities for us." ...|$|E

50|$|In Westhofen rises the Seebach, Rhenish Hesse’s <b>strongest</b> <b>spring.</b> It is {{also the}} only spring {{in the region that}} rises in a valley. It is fed by {{groundwater}} from the Donnersberg area.|$|R
50|$|M425s had 9.00x20 size tires, while M426s had larger 11.00x20s with <b>stronger</b> <b>springs</b> and a {{slightly}} longer 10 m wheelbase. All had dual rear tires. Except for {{the difference in the}} size of the tires, and some minor details, all types are mechanically identical.|$|R
500|$|The {{starting}} peloton did 1993 winner, Miguel Indurain, {{came into}} the race having only raced twenty days during the season according to author Bill McGann. In addition, there were reports surfacing before the race that Indurain's knee was troubling him. The race did not feature Tony Rominger, who elected to ride the Vuelta a España instead. El País writer Carlos Arribas felt that Evgeni Berzin had a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> with his victory in Liège–Bastogne–Liège and second-place finish in the Tour of the Basque Country [...] Arribas felt that Russian Pavel Tonkov, who had won the young rider classification the previous two years, would challenge for the victory as his normal team leader, Maurizio Fondriest, was absent from the race due to injury.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] Umpire Pitman started the race at 2:36p.m. in a light breeze which helped create an unusually <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> tide. [...] Oxford made the better start, with their stroke Bourne out-rating his {{opposite}} number by two stroke per minute. [...] At Craven Steps, the Dark Blues were three-quarters of a length ahead which they held past the Mile Post. [...] At this point Oxford pushed on to be clear by the Crab Tree pub and a further length ahead by Harrods Furniture Depository. [...] By the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, the Dark Blues were two and a half lengths ahead and reduced their rating yet continued to pull away.|$|E
500|$|Torres {{signed with}} the San Francisco Giants on January 9, 2009. After a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> training, he {{was named to the}} Giants' Opening Day roster as a reserve outfielder. Except for a minor league rehab assignment, he spent the entire year in the majors. He was placed on the {{disabled}} list on April 27 with a strained left hamstring. After a rehab assignment, he was activated on May 26. On June, 15 he hit the 48th [...] "Splash Hit" [...] home run at AT Park, against John Lackey in a 97 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was again placed on the disabled list on July 31 with the same injury he suffered earlier in the year; he was out until September 1. On September 20, he hit two home runs against Randy Wolf in a 62 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished the year with a career high [...]270 batting average and tied for eighth (along with Craig Counsell, Gerardo Parra, Everth Cabrera, and Juan Pierre) in the National League (NL) with eight triples despite only playing 75 games.|$|E
5000|$|Prince Václav I Spring, , was {{originally}} {{one of the}} <b>strongest</b> <b>springs</b> {{in the area in}} both yield and force, and was used to produce curative salt. A second spring, Prince Václav II Spring, , comes from the same source and flows out several meters in front of the Mill Colonnade.|$|R
50|$|The Buna {{is a short}} {{river in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina; it is a left bank {{tributary}} of the Neretva. Its source (Vrelo Bune), a <b>strong</b> karstic <b>spring,</b> is near the village Blagaj, southeast of Mostar. Actually, it is best known by famous Buna Spring (Vrelo Bune), one of the <b>strongest</b> <b>spring</b> in Europe and extremely cold water. The Buna flows west for approximately 9 km, starts at Blagaj and meandering through villages Blagaj, Kosor, Malo Polje, Hodbina and joins the Neretva at Buna village. The Bunica river is main left bank tributary of the Buna.|$|R
50|$|In {{the central}} square of Malé Svatoňovice stands a baroque catholic church {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary (1734), the church was built in place of seven <b>strong</b> <b>springs.</b> Now springs are rising in chapel (1732). This place was witness of miraculous healings and recovery. In upper parts of village is crossed road with seven chapels.|$|R
2500|$|Benchmade has {{a patent}} on the locking {{mechanism}} used {{in most of the}} switchblades they produce.

2500|$|After a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> {{in which}} he hit [...]308 with a home run, Sweeney's {{contract}} was purchased on March 25, 2008. Sweeney underwent arthroscopic surgery on his troublesome left knee on June 11, and was expected to miss four to six weeks. After a brief return from the disabled list, Sweeney was released by the A's on September 9.|$|E
2500|$|Reserve roles. [...] Thanks to a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> at the plate, former Cardinals Minor League Player of the Year Matt Adams {{made the}} team as a pinch-hitter and backup at first base. [...] Rookie outfielder Óscar Taveras also made a strong impression, batting [...]289 with two home runs and 10 RBIs in 80 PAs. [...] He started the season in the minors to allow [...] "his {{development}} ... to be playing every day ... to handle the day-to-day rigors of the major league schedule", according to Mozeliak.|$|E
5000|$|Ajusco is a Náhuatl word {{variously}} {{translated as}} [...] "source of waters" [...] or [...] "watered grove", and the Lerma River and Balsas River draw {{some of their}} source waters from this area. Also, the flow {{from all of the}} remaining <b>strong</b> <b>springs</b> in the area adjacent to the peak are captured to augment Mexico City's water supply.|$|R
5000|$|John Maine had the <b>strongest</b> <b>spring</b> {{training}} {{performance from}} the pitching staff, leading all National League pitchers with a 1.53 ERA. Maine went 3-1 over 29⅓ innings, with 33 strikeouts and five walks. Ángel Pagán was a surprising force on offense, batting [...]329 {{to win the}} starting left field competition that was open due to Alou's injury.|$|R

2500|$|After a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> {{training}} {{in which he}} led the team in home runs, RBIs, and runs scored, Pederson was announced as the Dodgers Opening Day starting center fielder for the 2015 season. The prior two Dodgers rookies to both [...] start on Opening Day and keep the job the entire season were Todd Hollandsworth (in 1996) and Wilton Guerrero (in 1997). At 22 years of age, he was the youngest Dodgers opening day starting center fielder since Willie Crawford (in 1969), and the third-youngest player in the NL.|$|E
2500|$|Albasini was not {{originally}} Orica–GreenEDGE's leader; {{he inherited}} the role after Simon Gerrans was dropped {{towards the end}} of the race. He said that he thought he was the strongest of the four-man group that formed on the final climb and blamed a mistake for his failure to win: he said that he had chosen the wrong gearing for the sprint and was unable to match Poels's acceleration. He said that he had ridden [...] "a good race" [...] even though he had failed to win. Albasini's performance came at the end of a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> classics season for his team, following Mathew Hayman's victory at Paris–Roubaix two weeks previously. Costa, meanwhile, said [...] "It was the toughest day on a bike that I can remember" [...] and [...] "when it’s bad weather, my body seems to react well". He congratulated Poels, saying that he was stronger in the sprint.|$|E
2500|$|Glover {{joined the}} Triple-A Indianapolis Indians and rediscovered his control, going 3–3 with a 3.98 ERA. At {{the end of}} the minor league season the Brewers {{recalled}} Glover to the major leagues, his first appearance there since {{the end of the}} 2003 season. Glover appeared in four games, starting three of them, and went 2–1 with a 3.50 ERA. After a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> training Glover began the [...] season as Milwaukee's fifth starter. Glover went 3-3 in his first nine starts but lost his spot in the starting rotation at the end of May to Wes Obermueller. Brewers manager Ned Yost cited Obermueller's hot streak: [...] "I'm going with what amounts to the hot hand even though Glover pitches great the last time...Gary's done everything we've asked of him but Obermueller is starting to come on." [...] As in Chicago, Glover was disappointed. The move was not a success: Obermueller was rocked in two successive starts, while Glover was hit hard in relief and sent down to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds in early June to make room for backup catcher Julio Mosquera.|$|E
50|$|For {{situations}} where the simple spring action of metal wires or plastic is not strong enough or are not convenient for other reasons, screws {{can be used to}} hold joints together. Plastic collars are often used on microscale equipment. Metal clips with <b>strong</b> <b>springs</b> and screws to prevent release are used on larger joints that are subject to mechanical stress.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} changes to the bullet-shooting crossbow was the strong, upwardly curved bow. This allowed the strings and pouch, which hold and launch the bullet, to be placed away {{from the rest of the}} gun. This allowed for a straighter stock or body of the crossbow, which utilizes <b>stronger</b> <b>springs</b> to launch bullets faster and more accurately.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a general}} exclamation of [...] "Capital, mamma!" [...] and then a burst of {{laughter}} {{at the idea of}} making sugar with a mangle. The mangle in question was part of a patent washing apparatus which Mr. Hardy had brought with him from England, and consisted of two strong iron rollers, kept together by <b>strong</b> <b>springs,</b> and turning with a handle.|$|R
2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a <b>strong</b> <b>spring.</b> Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|E
2500|$|Fragments {{of stone}} {{used in the}} {{construction}} of the monument underwent a petrological examination at the British Museum in London, where it was established that they were a form of oolithic limestone that was local to the area around the Rollrights. Archaeologist George Lambrick argued that the stones had been discovered by prehistoric peoples as naturally occurring surface boulders, rather than having been quarried, because of certain weathering patterns that could be found on them and which were consistent with those found on surface boulders. He went on to argue that the most likely place that such surface boulders would have been found in the late prehistoric was [...] "on the sides of the ridge at or near the level of the <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> line between the Inferior Oolithic and the Lias clay." [...] If this had indeed been the place where the megalith builders had found the boulders, then they would have had to be transported up hill, at a gradient averaging about 1 in 15 on the shortest routes, for either 250 metres (for the Whispering Knights), or 450 metres (for the King Stone and King's Men).|$|E
60|$|They {{had merely}} {{adjusted}} the <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> to the shut door, and stretched it slightly in fastening {{it to the}} door-jamb, so that it drew together the moment the latch was released, and the door flew open.|$|E
6000|$|Four or more <b>strong</b> <b>springs</b> rise {{near the}} house, and have formed the [...] valley, which, {{like that of}} Petrarch, may be called Valchiusa, as it [...] begins, or is shut at the {{situation}} of the house.

5000|$|In 2009, Mylan and King started {{marketing}} a {{new version}} of EpiPen with the same basic mechanism but a <b>stronger</b> <b>spring,</b> better safety features, and clearer markings and instructions; an expert for NBC News estimated that the cost to redesign the device and packaging may have been [...] "several million dollars" [...] and the cost to retool the manufacturing process may have [...] "run into the double-digit millions." ...|$|R
60|$|Leaving {{the temple}} {{in which it}} was unsafe to walk, she led us to where a <b>strong</b> <b>spring,</b> the water supply of the place, bubbled up into a rock basin, and {{overflowing}} thence through prepared openings, ran away we knew not whither.|$|E
60|$|Trigger.--Where {{a trigger}} has {{to release a}} <b>strong</b> <b>spring,</b> an {{arrangement}} {{on the principle of}} a figure of 4 trap is, I believe, the most delicate; the standard may be a branch or the stock of a tree; and the other pieces should be hardened by fire.|$|E
6000|$|Marley's Ghost {{bothered him}} exceedingly. Every time he {{resolved}} within himself, after mature inquiry, {{that it was}} all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a <b>strong</b> <b>spring</b> released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, [...] "Was it a dream or not?" ...|$|E
60|$|While I {{heard and}} saw the mother as she said these words, I seemed to hear and see the son, defying them. All that I had ever seen in him of an unyielding, wilful spirit, I saw in her. All the {{understanding}} that I had now of his misdirected energy, became an understanding of her character too, and a perception that it was, in its <b>strongest</b> <b>springs,</b> the same.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} IOE layouts used atmospheric {{inlet valves}} which were held {{closed with a}} weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke. This worked well with low-speed early engines and {{had the benefit of}} being very simple and cheap, but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating <b>stronger</b> <b>springs,</b> which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb <b>spring</b> is the <b>strongest</b> that can be used (for practical purposes, {{it would have to be}} lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and <b>stronger</b> <b>springs</b> to close them. In both cases, the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or valve lifter and closed by springs.|$|R
