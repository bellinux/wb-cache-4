500|$|The land in {{question}} is apparently [...] "dry", but Papet knows of a source of water, a spring, that can solve that problem. Pique-Bouffigue {{does not want to}} sell, and an altercation breaks out when he insults the Soubeyran family. In the fight, Pique-Bouffigue is knocked unconscious. He becomes friendly (as a result of memory loss from a head wound) but dies about a year after the fight. Papet sees this as an opportunity, so after the funeral, Papet and Ugolin dig out the rubble that is filling the <b>spring,</b> <b>plug</b> the hole, and cover it with cement and then earth. Unknown to them, they are seen blocking the spring by a poacher.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{enhancement}} {{to the existing}} elliptical leaf spring (ELS) for improved damping and energy dissipation capabilities. The ELS consists of a high tensile stainless steel elliptical leaf spring with polymer or rubber compound. This device is conceived as a shock and vibration isolator for equipment and lightweight structures. The enhancement to the ELS consists of a lead <b>spring</b> <b>plugged</b> vertically between the leaves (referred to as lead-rubber elliptical leaf spring (LRELS)). The lead is shown to produce hysteretic damping under plastic deformations. The LRELS isolator is shown to exhibit nonlinear hysteretic behavior. In both horizontal directions, the LRELS showed symmetrical rate independent behavior but undergoes stiffening behavior under large displacements. However, in the vertical direction, the LRELS behavior is asymmetric, exhibiting softening behavior in compression and stiffening behavior in tension. Mathematical models based on the Bouc-Wen model, describing the hysteretic behavior of the proposed isolator, are developed and numerically calibrated using a series of finite element analyses. The LRELS {{is found to be}} effective in the in-plane and vertical directions. The improved damping and energy dissipation of the LRELS is provided from the hysteretic damping of the lead spring...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} results of {{dynamical}} modeling of the mechanical system “flat car – elastic elements – wheel machinery body”, allocated on a railway flat car. There have been obtained the formulas of equivalent rigidity of fastening spatial flexible elements relative to a vertical line, which are equal to rigidity of bus and spring flexible elements being plugged in series and which are then equal to rigidity of all elastic elements of wheeled machinery as <b>springs</b> being <b>plugged</b> in parallel...|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{the spring}} would erupt every 45 minutes and shoot up to 7 {{feet into the}} air. It was located in the Navajo Geyser Pavilion. The spring which is privately owned was {{restored}} in 2006, but ceased to flow in later years. There is now {{no sign of the}} Spring in the Manitou Outpost store building where the guide's photo displayed it. The <b>spring</b> was <b>plugged</b> and a sidewalk was paved over it. The spring was later renovated into the hand pump that exists today.|$|R
50|$|To rekey a lock {{you have}} to first remove the lock {{cylinder}} from any housing it rests in. The lock cylinder must be disassembled, and the plug removed. Use a plug follower to avoid dropping master-wafers, top pins and <b>springs.</b> The <b>plug</b> has cylindrical chambers spaced according to manufacturer specifications. Pins are contained in these chambers where they are pushed down by springs or raised by a key. Each cut sits under a chamber of its own, each pin sits on a cut of its own. Place the correct pins in each chamber, bringing {{the top of each}} new pin flush with the shear-line. Check the upper chambers using a master-follower for old unused master wafers and remove any. If any springs are noticeably weak or the lock was especially dirty replace the springs. If the old pins are rounded from use or otherwise show excessive wear replace <b>springs.</b> Reinsert the <b>plug</b> taking care not to drop top pins into any unused chamber. Test key, make slight adjustments if needed and reassemble.|$|R

Inserting the plug connects its tip to one part of that circuit instead.|$|R
50|$|Stopcocks {{are often}} parts of {{laboratory}} glassware such as burettes, separatory funnels, Schlenk flasks, and columns used for column chromatography. The stopcock is a smooth tampered plug or rotor with a handle, which fits into a corresponding ground glass female joint. The stationary female joint is designed {{such that it}} joins two or more pieces of glass tubing. The stopcock has holes bored through it which allow the tubes attached to the female joint to be connected or separated with partial turns of the stopcock. Most stopcocks are solid pieces with linear bores although some are hollow with holes to simple holes that can line up the joints tubing. The stopcock is held together with the female joint with a metal <b>spring,</b> plastic <b>plug</b> retainer, a washer and nut system, {{or in some cases}} vacuum. Stopcocks plugs are generally made out of ground glass or an inert plastic like PTFE. The ground glass stopcocks are greased to create an airtight seal and prevent the glass from fusing. The plastic stopcocks are at most lightly oiled.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{shows the}} {{development}} of the design and manufacturing of a very small engine, namely its head. The engine works under the 4 -stroke cycle, therefore having a very complex cylinder head, housing the camshaft, valves and its auxiliaries (seats, guides, <b>springs),</b> spark <b>plug,</b> inlet and exhaust passages and a coolant chamber. The geometries, both inner and outer are highly intricate which makes the production of such a part a very difficult job. In addition, when the engine is very small, as it is the case of this engine, all dimensions are miniaturized therefore making it extremely difficult to design, cast and finish. The cooling chamber, in particular, has a critical inner core removal problem due to reduced accessibility, imposing casting limitations. The cores place also a problem of air and gas removal during metal filling and solidification. Rapid prototyping may be the only solution to build the cores, and may help in the design and manufacturing phases of the casting tools. 3 D printing with a plaster based material as a rapid prototyping technique presents itself as a tool to drastically reduce the design-development-casting process effort and time cycle. This technique enables the designer to obtain new moulds for castings on the shortest time possible, following redesign and new casting simulations.

50|$|The SATA {{standard}} {{defines a}} data cable with seven conductors (three grounds and four active data lines in two pairs) and 8 mm wide wafer connectors on each end. SATA cables can have lengths up to 1 m, and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive. PATA ribbon cables, in comparison, connect one motherboard socket {{to one or}} two hard drives, carry either 40 or 80 wires, and are limited to 45 cm in length by the PATA specification; however, cables up to 90 cm are readily available. Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces, and reduce obstructions to air cooling. Although they are more susceptible to accidental unplugging and breakage than PATA, users can purchase cables that have a locking feature, whereby a small (usually metal) <b>spring</b> holds the <b>plug</b> in the socket.|$|R
