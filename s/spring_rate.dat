500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} swingarm {{in front of the}} pivot axle {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the pivot axle, the swingarm, the reinforced rear fender, and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring. This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|E
2500|$|The sports-oriented model, {{known as}} the [...] "SE" [...] in North America and [...] "Sportivo" [...] in Australasia, was {{developed}} by Toyota Australia. It features a black [...] "honeycomb" [...] grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels. To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers. Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a [...] "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only). Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel. In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America. The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed stabilizer bar at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts with coil springs, gas dampers and ball-jointed stabilizer bar.|$|E
2500|$|Utilising {{the same}} fully {{independent}} four-link front suspension, and double wishbone rear, as its related A6 and S6, the RS6 was lowered by , with a 30% stiffer <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> and 40% increased compression damping. [...] The RS6 {{also served as}} the debut model for Audi's [...] "Dynamic Ride Control" [...] (DRC) system. [...] The DRC system is mainly mechanical, and uses a pump to provide additional pressure to individual dampers (shock absorbers) during cornering, acceleration or braking; to counteract rolling and pitching. [...] The system can adjust the stiffness at each individual damper constantly; to maintain both a comfortable ride on straight roads, and high level of poise and grip when cornering hard, accelerating, or braking. [...] The DRC's main advantage is that it operates {{without the need for}} complicated electronics, as required in similar systems from Mercedes-Benz and other competitors. Its main drawback is that the DRC dampers have been known to fail (leaking fluid from the cross-linked circuits), which can affect the handling and ride quality of the vehicle; some owners have reported needing multiple replacements of faulty DRC units and many drivers have opted to replace the system with simpler and more reliable aftermarket coilover suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Stiffer {{anti-roll}} bar was added and suspension <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> were increased.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} it was being made, the 303 was the least {{expensive}} six-cylinder car in Germany. However, it was considered underpowered, with a top speed of [...] [...] The combination of soft <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> at the front and hard <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> at the rear caused understeer, body roll, and a generally unsettling pitching movement. 2300 BMW 303s were produced up to 1934, when the 303 was replaced by the 315.|$|R
2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E
50|$|Wheel rate is the {{effective}} <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> when {{measured at the}} wheel. This is as opposed to simply measuring the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> alone.|$|E
50|$|Vertical stiffness, or <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> is {{the ratio}} of {{vertical}} force to vertical deflection of the tire, and it contributes to the overall suspension performance of the vehicle. In general, <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> increases with inflation pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Specially tuned <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> for the Competition Package; {{this was}} carried over to all M3 {{production}} from 12/04 on.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} it was being made, the 303 was the least {{expensive}} six-cylinder car in Germany. However, it was considered underpowered, with a top speed of 56 mi/h km/h. The combination of soft <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> at the front and hard <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> at the rear caused understeer, body roll, and a generally unsettling pitching movement. 2300 BMW 303s were produced up to 1934, when the 303 was replaced by the 315.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} NSX body design {{received only}} minor modifications from Honda {{in the new}} millennium when in December 2001 the original pop-up headlamps were replaced with fixed xenon HID headlamp units, along with slightly wider rear tires to complement a revised suspension. Front <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> were increased from 3.2 kg/m to 3.5 kg/m, rear <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> were increased from 3.8 kg/m to 4.0 kg/m and the diameter of the rear stabilizer bar increased from 17.5 mm to 19.1 mm with a 2.3 mm wall thickness.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot {{provide a}} progressive <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> In most torsion bar systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may {{be changed by}} simply adjusting bolts that connect the torsion bars to the steering knuckles. In most cars {{with this type of}} suspension, swapping torsion bars for a different <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> is usually an easy task.|$|E
50|$|Wheel rate {{is usually}} {{equal to or}} {{considerably}} less than the <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above where the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated to be600 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), {{if you were to}} move the wheel 1 in (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let's assume the spring moved 0.75 in, the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.|$|E
50|$|The lowered stance was {{achieved}} using front coils {{with a different}} <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> and a 3-leaf rear spring pack.|$|E
40|$|Programs for the {{analyses}} of the free or forced, undamped vibrations {{of one or two}} elastically-coupled lumped parameter teams are presented. Bearing nonlinearities, casing and rotor distributed mass and elasticity, rotor imbalance, forcing functions, gyroscopic moments, rotary inertia, and shear and flexural deformations are all included in the system dynamics analysis. All bearings have nonlinear load displacement characteristics, the solution is achieved by iteration. Rotor imbalances allowed by such considerations as pilot tolerances and runouts as well as bearing clearances (allowing concail or cylindrical whirl) determine the forcing function magnitudes. The computer programs first obtain a solution wherein the bearings are treated as linear springs of given <b>spring</b> <b>rates.</b> Then, based upon the computed bearing reactions, new <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> are predicted and another solution of the modified system is made. The iteration is continued until the changes to bearing <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and bearing reactions become negligibly small...|$|R

50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>rates</b> and {{sway bars}} were revised, which largely {{addressed}} the handling nervousness {{of the early}} 280ZX Turbo, and reviews confirmed that the 1982 280ZX Turbo was the most sporting Z-car since the original 240Z of 1970.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} stiffness, or <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> of {{a bicycle}} tire, as with motorcycle and automobile tires, increases with inflation pressure.|$|E
50|$|As the strut compresses, the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> {{increases}} dramatically, {{because the}} air is being compressed, while the viscosity of the oil dampens the rebound movement.|$|E

50|$|The lightest of all NSX {{variants}} at 1230 kg, the First-Gen NSX-R {{is capable}} of blistering track performance, though the ride can be jarring and noisy due to the stiff suspension bushings, stiff <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and lack of sound insulation.|$|R
50|$|During 1971 the <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and damper {{settings}} were altered {{along with}} the front suspension bushes which reduced the bounciness of the ride and low speed ride harshness which had generated press criticism {{at the time of}} the Cortina Mark III's launch.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} shock {{absorbers}} it usually {{consists of two}} parts: a spring, and a damper. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, compressed air, or even an elastomer. Different spring materials have different spring rates which have a fundamental effect {{on the characteristics of}} the fork as a whole. Coil-sprung forks keep an approximately constant ("linear") <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> throughout their travel. The <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of air-sprung forks however increases with travel, making them progressive. Titanium coils are much lighter but much more expensive. Air-sprung forks are generally lighter still.|$|E
5000|$|Longitudinal semi-elliptical springs used to {{be common}} and still are used in {{heavy-duty}} trucks and aircraft. They have the advantage that the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> can easily be made progressive (non-linear).|$|E
50|$|Air springs work {{by using}} the {{characteristic}} of compressed air to resist further compression. As the spring itself {{is provided by the}} compressed air rather than a coil of metal it is much lighter; this makes their use popular in cross country designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> can easily be adjusted by changing the air pressure within the fork. This allows a fork to be effectively tuned to a rider's weight. To achieve this in a coil sprung fork, one would have to swap out different coils with different spring rates. However air pressure naturally controls both <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> and preload at the same time, requiring air forks to have additional systems to adjust preload separately, adding to its complexity. Another disadvantage of air-sprung forks is the difficulty in achieving a linear <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> throughout the fork's action. As the fork compresses, the air held inside is compressed. Towards the end of the fork's travel, further compression of the fork requires ever greater force. This results in an increase in <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> and gives the fork its progressive feel. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring reduces this effect but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited by the need to be contained within the fork. The use of two air chambers within the system has allowed a more linear feel to air suspension, this is achieved by having a 'reserve' chamber that becomes connected to the main chamber when it reaches a certain amount of compression. Once achieved, a valve opens and effectively makes the chamber larger. By linking the two, the force needed to compress the air in the chambers is reduced which reduces the exponential <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> feel traditionally associated with air systems when approaching the end of the suspension's travel.|$|E
50|$|In a vehicle, shock {{absorbers}} reduce {{the effect of}} traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling. While {{shock absorbers}} serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement, their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations. Shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the <b>springs.</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>rates</b> are chosen by the manufacturer based on {{the weight of the}} vehicle, loaded and unloaded. Some people use shocks to modify <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> {{but this is not the}} correct use. Along with hysteresis in the tire itself, they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down. Effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance.|$|R
50|$|The Cup Chassis option {{includes}} {{tire pressure}} monitor deletion, different 18-inch anthracite alloy wheels with 235/40R18 Dunlop SP Sport Maxx tyres, retuned dampers and <b>spring</b> <b>rates,</b> disconnectable ESP, anthracite coloured door mirror housings, and {{the vehicle is}} 20 kg lighter (1345 kg kerb, 1800 kg gross).|$|R
50|$|The new {{powertrain}} {{gives the}} 2015 WRX a different character than the car it replaces, but its acceleration times are virtually unchanged. The biggest performance gains {{come from the}} 2015 redesigned chassis. Structural stiffness and <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> are up 40 to 60 percent, raising roadholding numbers by about 0.80 G.|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-turn}} {{wave spring}} can decrease the needed axial space. It is suited for applications with large deflection {{and a small}} <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> A wide range of forces can be accommodated.|$|E
5000|$|A retuned, 20 mm lowered sports {{suspension}} {{included a}} 30 percent stiffer <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> and 40 percent more compression damping in the shock absorbers. Speed-sensitive [...] "servotronic" [...] {{power assisted steering}} was also standard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> (or {{suspension}} rate) is {{a component}} {{in setting the}} vehicle's ride height or its location in the suspension stroke. When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts is proportional to its change in length. The <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> or spring constant of a spring is {{the change in the}} force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. Vehicles which carry heavy loads will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke). Heavier springs are also used in performance applications where the loading conditions experienced are more extreme.|$|E
40|$|Hertzian {{equation}} for elastic {{contact is}} utilized along with lumped parameter approach {{to obtain the}} equations that govern the structural vibration of ball bearings.
