The Mind Games {{consists}} of separate tournaments in 3 disciplines: rapid, blitz and basque. In the rapid event, she placed second capturing the silver medal, losing only to Valentina Gunina, the eventual event winner. Her performance was 5/7 (+4 -1 = 3, rapid TPR 2672). She {{won the gold medal}} in the blitz event with a 22.5/30 score (+20 -5 = 5, TPR 2718). Especially noteworthy in her blitz tournament was her performance pushed her official blitz rating to 2704, making her the second female player to cross the 2700 barrier in any rating format. In the final basque <b>system</b> <b>event,</b> Hou took home another gold medal with an 8.5/10 score (+7 =3).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{computing}} {{systems are}} instrumented to generate {{huge amounts of}} system logs and these data can be utilized for understanding and complex system behaviors. One main fundamental challenge in automated log analysis is the generation of <b>system</b> <b>events</b> from raw textual logs. Recent works apply clustering techniques to translate the raw log messages into <b>system</b> <b>events</b> using only the word/term information. In this paper, we first illustrate the drawbacks of existing techniques for <b>event</b> generation from <b>system</b> logs. We then propose LogTree, a novel and algorithm-independent framework for events generation from raw system log messages. LogTree utilizes the format and structural information of the raw logs in the clustering process to generate <b>system</b> <b>events</b> with better accuracy. In addition, an indexing data structure, Message Segment Table, is proposed in LogTree to significantly improve the efficiency of events generation. Extensive experiments on real system logs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LogTree. Keywords-event generation; mining system log data; LogTree; log message clustering. I...|$|R
