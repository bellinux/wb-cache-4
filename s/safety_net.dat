40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{illness is}} common in childhood, and it is {{difficult}} for healthcare professionals to distinguish seriously ill children from the vast majority with minor or self-limiting illnesses. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> provides parents with advice on when and where to return if their child deteriorates, and it is widely recommended that parents of acutely sick young children should be given <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice. Yet little is known about how and when this is given. We aimed to understand what <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice first contact clinicians give parents of acutely sick young children, how, when, and why. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. Interviews and focus groups were held with doctors and nurses in a general practice surgery, a District General Hospital emergency department, a paediatric emergency department, and an out-of-hours service. Data were analysed using the method of constant comparison. RESULTS: Sixteen clinicians participated. They described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice includes advising parents what to look for, when and where to seek help. How <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was delivered and whether it was verbal or written was inconsistent, and no participants described being trained in this area. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> appeared to be rarely documented, and was left to individual preference. Limitations of written materials, and structural barriers to the provision of <b>safety</b> <b>netting,</b> were perceived. Participants described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was influenced by clinicians' experience, confidence, time and knowledge; and perceived parental anxiety, experience, and competence. Participants noted several limitations to <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> including not knowing if it has been understood by parents or been effective; parental difficulty interpreting information and desire for face-to-face reassurance; and potential over-reassurance. CONCLUSION: First contact clinicians employ a range of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> techniques, with inconsistencies within and between organisations. Structural changes, clinician training, and documentation in patient notes may improve <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> provision. Research is needed into the optimal components of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice so that clinicians can consistently deliver the most effective advice for parents.

40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>nets</b> {{have often}} been {{controversial}} instruments, condemned in some circles as short-term palliatives or even a waste of money. Much recent evidence shows that <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> not only support poverty reduction but also economic growth. The existence of <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> encourages adoption of higher income livelihood strategies {{that are associated with}} higher, but prudent, risk. <b>Safety</b> <b>nets</b> should be one component of a broader social protection strategy, which uses a plethora of instruments to address a wide array of risks and associated vulnerability. For {{the poorest of the poor}} one of their key concerns is access to sufficient food for a healthy and active life. Food-based <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> are therefore an important instrument for some of the poor and food insecure who are vulnerable to critical levels of food deficit. Integration of <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> within broader social protection strategies enables a more cohesive relief and development approach, as opposed to a relief to development continuum or more linear approach.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} social safety-net programs in Bangladesh run {{by the government and}} nongovernmental organizations to mitigate seasonal deprivation in the country's highly vulnerable northwest region. Specifically, the paper explores whether social <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> are limited to averting seasonal deprivation or can also address seasonality of income and employment more generally. Using a recent survey from the greater Rangpur (northwest) region, the paper finds that social <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> {{have a positive effect on}} mitigating both seasonal and non-seasonal food deprivation. The results are robust, owing to the recent expanded coverage of social safety-net programs run by nongovernmental organizations active in the region. But given the annual recurrence of monga (seasonal food insecurity) in the northwest region owing to agricultural seasonality and an overwhelming dependence on agriculture for livelihoods, social <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> are not a reliable tool for monga eradication.
