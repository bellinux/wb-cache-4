These components are neatly twisted into a multistrand cable, and are deployed as a single unit.

50|$|Zip-cord style jackets, {{including}} those that contain Aramid yarn as the <b>strength</b> <b>member,</b> can be slipped over multiple fiber strands {{coming out of a}} loose buffer cable to convert it to a complete set of single-fiber cables that can be directly attached to optical connectors.

5000|$|Several {{designs of}} cable are used. In one type, small plastic tubes each {{containing}} {{up to eight}} fibers are filled with a gel compound, and stranded around plastic rods.

50|$|A diver's {{umbilical}} is a {{group of}} components which supply breathing gas and other services from the surface control point to a diver.
