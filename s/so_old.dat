5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown <b>so</b> <b>old</b> and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most of his}} noble relatives, John {{opposed the}} tyrannical regime of Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182–85), and {{had been forced to}} sign written pledge of loyalty to the emperor. Nevertheless, on 11 September 1185, when his nephew Isaac Angelos killed Andronikos I's chief henchman, Stephen Hagiochristophorites, and sought {{sanctuary}} in the Hagia Sophia cathedral, John and his eldest son Isaac rushed to his side, fearing the Emperor's retribution. By the next day, a popular uprising provoked by Isaac Angelos' act of defiance had brought down the regime of Andronikos I, but Isaac Angelos hesitated to be crowned emperor. According to Niketas Choniates and Theodore Skoutariotes, John then bared his own head and offered his own bald head to be crowned, but the assembled people violently opposed this, refusing to be ruled by a man <b>so</b> <b>old</b> after the equally elderly Andronikos I, and Isaac Angelos was crowned.|$|E

5|$|When {{a warrior}} is <b>so</b> <b>old,</b> or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

The numbers were assigned with a letter prefix that indicated location (E = east), community, and then {{the order in which}} the census-taker saw the individual.

The organization traces its history back to the 19th-century streetcar systems of the region through the acquisition in 1970 of the Twin City Lines bus system from businessman Carl Pohlad. At the time of the acquisition, Twin City Lines had 635 buses: 75% of those were over 15 years old and 86 buses were <b>so</b> <b>old</b> that they were banned from operating in Minneapolis.

Blue-footed booby parents, meanwhile, build nests with steeper sides, thus preventing some older chicks from engaging in siblicidal behaviour.|$|R

She continued describing the songs as [...] "so authentic, <b>so</b> <b>old,</b> so archaic and yet, so modern and rich, both production and author-wise". The journalist {{observed that the}} lyrics were carefully selected with every track eligible for [...] "a compilation containing the best lyric songs from this region, which contains so many centuries of elegy and sadness, interwoven with rare moments of joy, which make life worth living".

500|$|... "Sweet Thing" [...] is {{the only}} song on the album to look forward instead of backward. In the words of The AllMusic reviewer: [...] "Over the {{endlessly}} descending, circular progression, Morrison sings positive lyrics about nature and a romantic partner, seemingly beginning {{in the middle of}} a thought: 'And I will stroll the merry way.'" [...] Paul Du Noyer wrote, [...] "Sweet Thing puts the singer in a hazy, pastoral paradise where he wanders in 'gardens wet with rain', or counts the stars in his lover's eyes, and vows to 'never grow <b>so</b> <b>old</b> again' or 'read between the lines'. He pleads with his mind to keep quiet, so his heart can hear itself think. He yearns to obliterate experience and rediscover innocence." [...] It has been a more popular cover song than any of the others on the album and {{is the only}} Astral Weeks song that has been included in any of Morrison's compilation albums.|$|E

500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this <b>so</b> <b>old</b> players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E
500|$|If {{the carbon}} in {{freshwater}} is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then {{the result will}} be a reduction in the / ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over limestone, which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate, will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually <b>so</b> <b>old</b> that they no longer contain any measurable , so this carbon lowers the / ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it. This is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results. [...] The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.|$|E
500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with Max Martin, Shellback; the latter two {{are responsible for the}} song's production. The song's lyrics and conception use a metaphor, comparing an older man to a prehistoric, carnivorous dinosaur. All three composers were responsible for providing the song's instruments. The song's recording was commenced at Maratone Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden, by Martin and Shellback. While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example. The singer explained that the song's conception was auto-biographical and that it stemmed from a previous experience she had when an older man had been hitting on her, which she elaborated on: [...] "I just write about what I live — literally, my entire record is totally autobiographical, because I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation. There's a song called 'Dinosaur' about this old guy who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, 'Oh my God, you're <b>so</b> <b>old,</b> you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur.
