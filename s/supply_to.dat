5|$|To {{supplement}} water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the lake, even {{as early}} as in 1993, the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the lake. However, most tube wells were dysfunctional, thereby aggravating the problem. The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake {{on a list of}} five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP) for restoration. They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works, but the situation has not eased.|$|E
5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E

5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to set up}} a water company for the town; pumping {{machinery}} was installed and works constructed in 1880 to provide a clean water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the town. In 1948, the council took over the company and in 1962 its operation was handed to the Kesteven Water Board, which was absorbed by the Anglian Water Authority in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, then-governor Dick Thornburgh {{allocated}} $1million {{in emergency}} {{aid for the}} disaster areas, and activated 600National Guardsmen to help with clean up. After nine water plants were closed, the companies relied on reserves to provide water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage. About 2,900people in Washington County lost access to clean water.|$|E

5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With {{disruption of the}} epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Uxbridge and District Electricity Supply Company had been {{established}} in Waterloo Road, {{and much of the}} town was connected by 1902, although some houses still had gas lighting in 1912. A water tower on Uxbridge Common was built in 1906, resembling a church tower, to improve the <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the town.|$|E
5|$|Shinwell {{acted to}} reduce {{consumption}} of coal by cutting the electricity <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> industry completely {{and reducing the}} domestic <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> 19 hours per day across the country. In consequence factories across the country were forced to shut and up to four million people claimed unemployment benefits. Although {{so many people were}} made redundant there was little unrest and no major public disorders. Television services were suspended completely, radio broadcasts were reduced, some magazines were ordered to stop being published, and newspapers were cut in size to four pages or one sheet. Food rations, still in use from the Second World War, were cut to levels lower than in the war years. These measures made little difference to the rate of coal consumption but served to reduce public morale.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|After {{a poignant}} attempt at radio {{communication}} with a fisherman on Earth who speaks only Eskimo–Aleut, Stone resigns herself to being stranded and shuts down the cabin's oxygen <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide. As {{she begins to}} lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing jets to propel the capsule toward Tiangong. Stone then realizes that Kowalski's reappearance was a hallucination, but has nonetheless given her the strength of will to continue. She restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing jets to navigate toward Tiangong on momentum.|$|E

Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.|$|E
5|$|By 24 May, the Germans had {{captured}} {{the port of}} Boulogne and surrounded Calais. The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under Generalmajor Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk. On 23 May, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks {{and the question of}} <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> his forward troops. He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 percent). Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> the cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to {{flow into the}} cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
