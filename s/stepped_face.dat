However, the first water deliveries did not reach San Francisco until 1934, eleven years after the completion of O'Shaughnessy Dam and twenty years after groundbreaking of the Hetch Hetchy project. O'Shaughnessy Dam had been designed with adequate foundations and a unique <b>stepped</b> <b>face</b> in order to make possible a future increase in the dam height. This was done in anticipation of rapid growth in the demand for water and hydroelectricity. Indeed, between 1935 and 1938, the dam was raised by a new spillway and outlet channels were constructed to accommodate the increased height and storage capacity, which helped to increase summer generation at downstream powerhouses.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a novel {{experimental}} work {{was used to}} study the flow over the stepped spillways and energy dissipation. This novel work {{was an attempt to}} increase energy dissipation on stepped spillways since it not include stilling basin and have less cost compared with traditional spillways. So, in this paper, to investigate the increasing of energy dissipation of flow over stepped spillways of different step shapes, a twelve physical plywood models have been built. Experiments have been carried out for different types of step shapes: - plain steps, steps have half cut, inclined end sill steps normal to downstream slopes of <b>stepped</b> <b>face,</b> and steps have a rough surface using crushed gravel. Three downstream slopes of <b>stepped</b> <b>face</b> (è = 30 o, 50 o, and 70 o) were tested with spillway having constant number of steps and constant height. In total, 144 experiments were done, the hydraulic parameters of flow over the models were measured and the energy dissipation of flow was calculated. Experimental results showed that the energy dissipation of flow on inclined end sill, and rough steps are more than the plain one. While the experiments results on the cutting steps showed that the energy dissipation are less than the plain one. With decreasing the downstream slopes of the stepped spillway face, the energy dissipation is increased. In addition, when compared with traditional spillways the case of rough steps and steps with inclined end sill can be used to increase the relative energy dissipation on plain steps by about 19 % and about 18 % respectively for small angle of spillway face since the stepped spillways more effective than traditional spillways by 10 %. Therefore, double that means that the affectivity of stepped spillway was approximately. On the other side, the energy dissipation increased at low discharges by 0. 1 % when using the cutting steps but decreased by 13 % with larger discharges. In summary, the flow energy dissipation decreases with increasing the flow rate, and the roughed step spillway surface is more effective compared to the other spillway surfaces at low or high flow rate. According to the flow types, the range of Nappe, Transition, and Skimming will increase for all the forms of steps that used compare with plain step...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:-In {{the past}} years {{considerable}} research {{was done on}} stepped spillways. Investigations were conducted to understand the hydraulics on the <b>stepped</b> <b>face</b> of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) dams and overlays for embankment dams. Also a number of embankments were designed with concrete overtopping protection shaped in a stepped fashion. During large overflows on stepped chutes, there is no skin friction between mainstream and steps, and flow resistance is basically form drag. Significant energy losses occur along the stepped chute so that the energy dissipation structure, e. g. the stilling basin, becomes smaller and more economic. In addition, in design conditions when discharge, slope of the normal ground and the height of spillway are available, {{there are so many}} combinations of width and the number of steps, which leads to different head losses. In each feasible case the remained head should be dissipate by the energy dissipaters in down stream, which are much cost consuming. So the cost of project which is consist of spillway and it’s down stream dissipaters should be minimized. In this study, the Genetic Algorithm has been applied to find the best combination of design variables to minimizing the total cost of both structures. The results show the efficiency of GA in this field of application. Furthermore, GA has a very rapid convergence to feasible and sufficient optimum...|$|E

Elevation 960 masl. ** Number and dimensions of quarries: Four main groups of quarries on two hills. Three groups on Gâvuröreni Tepe cover ca. 0. 5 km 2; single group on Göz Tepe (0. 75 km to west) covers 0. 25 km 2. On Gâvuröreni Tepe, at least 20 small to medium-sized quarries and additional small pits are configured {{in a straight line}} below one another, connected by slipway paths. Modern quarrying is confined to the crest of the hill, with limited additional prospection and drilling at the base. Extensive modern quarrying on Göz Tepe. The three medium-sized and 17 small quarries are bowl-shaped quarries with discernible faces and sides or simple pits. ** Geological age, grain size, and color: Mesozoic. Medium to coarse grained. Primarily white marble but with varying intervals of gray, mottling, a translucent bluish white and tan breccia. ** Modern quarrying: Extensive modern intrusion. In June 2008, Bes Mer from Izmir was active on the southeast slope of Gâvuröreni Tepe, and abandoned workers' lodging is on top of the hill. According to local informants from Ören, marble companies had destroyed several ancient structures, including a tower and several vaulted chambers. Modern wastage blocks scar the landscape and are visible from any vantage point in the western Morsynus river valley. ** Joints and quality of marble: Joint spacing is more generous here than in the other Southern Quarries, which explains why this area was worked more heavily. Area between joints varies in height from 3. 0 m to 6. 0 m and in width from 2. 5 m to 4. 0 m. Marble quality is high enough to have yielded some of the longest white blocks used in the city. ** Quarry organization and evidence for extraction: Ören Quarries took advantage of natural contours to obtain a greater supply of large blocks and to facilitate their transport out of the quarry. ** Of the five pit quarries at top of Gâvuröreni Tepe (Quarries 11 – 16), some grew to be quite wide; Quarry 14, the largest, measures 9. 9 m high, 43 m wide, and 12 m deep. In Quarry 11, a handful of blocks with ancient pickmarks line the uppermost, lateral, and bottom portions of the perimeter; it is impossible to determine the ancient extent though (modern capacity ca. 300, 000 m 3) because of extensive intrusion from modern quarrying. ** Quarry 10 lies below and west of the upper quarries and is medium sized. Modern quarrying has destroyed the lower levels, while the ancient quarry face and the original floor are preserved in the upper portion. On the upper face, joints are spaced widely enough for extraction of large blocks; after exposing a joint 4. 0 m wide, quarrymen dug down 6. 5 m, working in steps as they removed a succession of blocks from the thick marble beds. Quarry floor preserves four excavation trenches with traces of pickmarks and wedge holes. ** A third group of quarries lies 175 m below and west of Quarry 10. This area comprises nine different ancient quarries (Quarries 1 – 9), all connected by visible slipways. At the end of one slipway, a graffito of a bird was scrawled on a block that was once part of an ancient quarry face but has since been removed from its original location by modern quarriers. ** Quarry 4 is a medium-sized, bowl-shaped quarry. Two separating channels, 2. 5 m long and 1. 25 m wide, are partially exposed on the floor. ** Quarry 6 preserves a shallow, <b>stepped</b> <b>face</b> and wide working floor, filled with spoil. A series of nine wedge holes, spaced 0. 15 m apart, runs along the base of a separating channel, along natural fractures in the marble; the intent was to extract two blocks, each 1. 0 m long. ** Quarry 7 is bilevel with numerous worked floors. The scree that typically accumulates over time and obscures the original extent of a quarry has been removed by modern quarriers. Ancient quarry floors, or bottoms of separating trenches, are well preserved. The upper level was exploited first. After a nearly vertical north–south and east–west joint was exposed at floor level, quarriers followed it downward to what became the lower level. The pattern of trenches on the floor shows that quarrymen extracted standardized blocks, in three different widths— 0. 62 m, 0. 90 m, and 1. 50 m—and in varying lengths over 1. 0 m. Separating trenches were placed in alternating directions, parallel and perpendicular to natural north –south and east–west joints. In one well-preserved section, separating trenches 0. 25 m wide are on either side of a block 0. 66 m wide and 3. 50 m long; a regular line of tool fine-point chisel marks, 1 cm apart, is seen on three sides of the trench, indicating the intended bottom of the block. These marks scored the bottom of a block so that when pressure was applied, the block would break away along an even line. ** A slipway leading out of Quarry 9 ends at a level area surrounded by three low stone walls, which was possibly a staging ground for cutting blocks or area of shelter for workmen. ** Quarries 17 – 20 are on Göz Tepe, with traces of ancient pickmarks preserved in each. A single slipway, clearly visible in satellite images, connects the Göz Tepe and Gâvuröreni Tepe quarries {{at the foot of the}} hills. ** Blocks: Small worked block lies among abandoned modern blocks in Göz Tepe quarr...|$|E

Several alternative binding modes are compared: groove binding in which the conformation of the oligonucleotide remains close to that of B-DNA, intercalation between base-pairs and interaction with variously kinked structures in which base pairs of dinucleoside steps open towards the groove in which the binding occurs. The favored binding configuration occurs at the d(TpA) step of the AT kinked nucleotides in which the kink opens the base pairs towards the minor groove.

40|$|On a stepped {{spillway}} at large flows, the waters skim over the pseudo-bottom {{formed by the}} step edges with very strong recirculation vortices in the step cavities. The effects of step roughness on the flow properties are little known despite the practical relevance : e. g., gabion stepped chutes, unprotected roller compacted concrete spillways, damaged concrete steps on older structures. In the present study, the effect of step roughness was investigated systematically in {{a new series of}} experiments. The work was performed in a large size laboratory facility, with step height of 0. 10 m, step length of 0. 25 m and chute width of 1 m, based upon an undistorted Froude similitude. Four configurations were thoroughly tested with identical flow conditions : a smooth stepped chute, and three configurations with rough <b>step</b> <b>faces.</b> The latters were achieved by placing rough screens on the <b>step</b> <b>faces</b> : i. e., on the vertical faces only (Config. B), on the horizontal <b>step</b> <b>faces</b> only (Config. C) and on both vertical and horizontal <b>step</b> <b>faces</b> (Config. A). Detailed air-water flow measurements were performed with a dual-tip phase detection probe (sensor size: 0. 025 mm). Basic results included the vertical distributions of air concentration, bubble count rate, air-water velocity, turbulence level, and the air and water chord size distributions at each sampling point. The results showed some similarities between all four stepped configurations. Three basic flow regimes were observed, and the flow conditions at the change from one flow regime to another were identical for all four geometries. In skimming flows, visual observations showed that the step roughness affected the recirculation patterns in the step cavities. For the roughest configuration A, clear-water recirculation regions were observed downstream of the inception point of air entrainment. Seepage was also observed through the rough screens. At a macroscopic level, the effects of step roughness were two-fold. The location of the inception point of free-surface aeration was further downstream than for a smooth stepped chute for an identical flow rate. In turn the residual energy at the downstream end of the chute was greater on the rough stepped chute. At a microscopic level, the experimental results showed consistently several trends. The void fraction distribution results were very close for all stepped configurations, although there seemed to be slightly less entrained air in the rough stepped chute flows. Bubble count rate distributions indicated systematically lesser bubble count rates in the rough stepped chute flows. At step edges, the rough stepped chute flows were faster than smooth chute flows for a given flow rate and dimensionless location from the inception point of free-surface aeration. This was associated with lower turbulence intensities in rough stepped channel flows. A detailed analysis of air and water chord size distributions showed that, at each sampling location, the distributions of air and water chords were broad and spanned over two to three orders of magnitude. In the bubbly flow region (C < 0. 3), the probability distribution functions of air chord sizes followed closely a log-normal law for all investigated configurations and flow conditions...|$|R
