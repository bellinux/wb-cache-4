5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. She {{felt that it was}} more about ecstasy, especially a sexual one, and how it related to religious ecstasy. <b>She</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
25|$|On the April 29 show, {{the five}} {{remaining}} contestants each sang two songs. Diverting from their usual format, due to time constraints, the judges' critiques after each performance were instead to be bundled until after both songs were performed. However, {{after the first}} round had finished, host Ryan Seacrest asked for comments, and judge Paula Abdul, in discussing Jason Castro, delivered feedback on his second song before he had performed it. This has led to speculation that the show is scripted or rigged. The next day, Abdul claimed on Seacrest's radio show that <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> performance in rehearsal and in the rushed atmosphere of the show was confused and thought she was supposed to critique both.|$|E

500|$|... "Circus" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Britney Spears for her sixth studio album {{of the same name}} (2008). It was released on December 2, 2008, by Jive Records as the second single from the album. Written by Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly and Benny Blanco, [...] "Circus" [...] is a metaphor for the public's perception of Spears' life. After <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> track for the first time, she felt inspired to create an album and a tour with a circus theme. [...] "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song with elements of pop rock and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals. The song's lyrics talk about being an entertainer and putting on shows.|$|E

In July 2013, American singer Solange Knowles performed a cover version of the song in a laundromat {{as a part of the}} [...] "Make Boring Brilliant" [...] campaign. Her performance received positive reviews from critics, who felt it was an appropriate song choice for the venue.

500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{has said}} that her teenage years were unhappy. Her home life was {{complicated}} by her mother's illness and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms. Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven. Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as [...] "not exceptional" [...] but [...] "one {{of a group of}} girls who were bright, and quite good at English". Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. At this time, <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Smiths and the Clash. Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B and was Head Girl.|$|E
500|$|Having {{started his}} career as a remixer, Pettibone built the basic music of the Erotica songs in the style of his remixes for which Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics. According to Pettibone in an article [...] "Erotica Diaries" [...] {{published}} on Madonna's Icon magazine, he began with a tape of three tracks for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. <b>She</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working on demos in his apartment in October 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week and then she would work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet André Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone. [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar.|$|E

Erica {{became known as}} the [...] "first {{official}} Green Day fan" [...] as <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first four-track recordings by Billie and Sean, encouraging the band, touring with them and acting as occasional photographer for the band. Erica inspired many of Green Day's well known songs including [...] "Christie Road", which was written for her by Armstrong about the local tracks where the couple would sneak out to meet. When Armstrong began living in punk houses and warehouses at the age of seventeen, including the warehouse above a West Oakland brothel which ultimately inspired the song [...] "Welcome to Paradise" [...] Erica would often stay with him despite the dangers, [...] "I would stay with him sometimes in these warehouses full of crusty punks".
