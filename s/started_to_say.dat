500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E

2500|$|In The Simpsons episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", a {{representation}} of God agrees to tell Homer what {{the meaning of life}} is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what it is.|$|R
5000|$|Eight years later, {{he decided}} to run for {{president}} again. Things didn’t look great at first. His campaign nearly ran out of money. People were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he didn't have a chance. But my dad never gives up. Meghan McCain in My Dad, John McCain ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Spillikins <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I didn't know--" [...] {{and then}} checked himself and said, [...] "By Gad! what a fine-looking little chap, eh? I'm awfully fond of boys." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Granny Fox <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} unpleasant. Then {{she changed}} her mind and instead she sat down and told Bobby Coon all her troubles. As she talked, Bobby Coon kept ducking his head behind a branch of the tree to hide a smile. Finally Granny Fox noticed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aren't {{we going}} to wait----?" [...] I <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to Bingo, {{thinking}} it somewhat thick that, in addition to asking a girl to lunch {{with him in a}} place like this, he should fling himself on the foodstuffs before she turned up, when I caught sight of his face, and stopped.|$|E
5000|$|The {{irony is}} that I've really come full circle. The more science I studied, the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics and numbers become {{imaginary}} numbers. The farther you go into science, the mushier the ground gets. You <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Calvin Klein from [...] "The Pick" [...] {{watching}} with Tia Van Camp from [...] "The Airport." [...] Calvin quotes [...] "I like his style. He has {{a sort of}} casual elegance." [...] Tia quotes [...] "But he picks his nose." [...] Calvin <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Nevertheless..." [...] before their scene was cut to the next scene.|$|R
5000|$|On the July 19, 2016 {{episode of}} The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Laura Benanti (the impersonator of Melania Trump) {{finished}} her [...] "un-plagiarized" [...] "defense" [...] speech, <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Live from New York, it's Saturday..."

6000|$|My {{hand was}} hanging down by my chair; Agnes {{came along and}} licked it; by this act a secret was revealed. I <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "It is all a mistake; {{this is just a}} common, {{ordinary}} cat; the hair-needles on her tongue point inward, not outward." [...] But the words did not come, because they couldn't. Satan smiled upon me, and I understood.|$|E
60|$|Spencer {{had told}} her he was not coming back. She did not believe this, but she did not expect him for a few days. Consequently, when he {{appeared}} the very next evening she was surprised. Madison, to whom she was talking when Spencer entered, does not know to this day what she had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him, for she never finished her sentence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prudence, {{what does}} this mean?" [...] thundered Uncle Abimelech, as he flung the {{newspaper}} down on the table. Murray got up and peered over. Then he whistled. He <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something but remembered just in time and stopped. But he did give me a black look. Murray has a sneaking pride of name too, although he won't own up to it and laughs at Uncle Abimelech.|$|E
50|$|Everyone <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> sorry <b>to</b> {{everyone}}. Everyone <b>starts</b> arguing again. Matthew gives a long speech how {{he loves}} Sheena, Adam {{says he knew}} it.

The adults immediately stop upon sight of Emma and realize what they look like.|$|R
5000|$|Marla Penny from [...] "The Virgin" [...] who {{is still}} in a {{relationship}} with John F. Kennedy, Jr. since [...] "The Contest." [...] When John (who is sitting at the edge of their bed) asks Marla if it's the same Seinfeld that she went out with, Marla states that he's [...] "horrible." [...] John then <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Nevertheless..." [...] before their scene cuts to the next scene.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would he!' said Jim grimly. 'Well, I got {{the chance}} just now. Thompson said {{something}} to him, and he spun round, saw me, and shouted [...] "Thomson". I went up and capped him, and he was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something when he seemed to change his mind, and instead of confessing everything, he took me by the arm, and said, [...] "No, no, Thomson. Go away. It's nothing. I will send for you later."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Dear Me!" [...] cried Peter joyously. [...] "What are {{you doing}} way down here? I haven't seen you since you first arrived, just after Winsome Bluebird got here." [...] Peter <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he had {{wondered}} {{what had become of}} Dear Me, but checked himself, for Peter is very honest and he realized now that in the excitement of greeting so many friends he hadn't missed Dear Me at all.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{flicked the}} big, boney horse with his whip and looked thoughtful. Then he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} to his little companion, {{but before he}} could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. Next minute there was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground open in a wide crack and then come together again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better resolve {{not to make}} puddings of--" [...] began Felicity, {{then stopped}} as {{suddenly}} {{as if she had}} bitten off the rest of her sentence and swallowed it. Cecily had nudged her, so she had probably remembered the Story Girl's threat that she would never tell another story if she was ever twitted with the pudding she had made from sawdust. But we all knew what Felicity had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and the Story Girl dealt her a most uncousinly glance.|$|E
5000|$|As Steve sits on {{the curb}} and watches {{ambulances}} haul away both the victims and the heavily-restrained Guy, he is left wondering about Guy's private life, {{and the nature of}} insanity. He imagines Guy living in a similar situation as his own, driven insane by the irrationality of his wife, whom he may have murdered before coming to work this day, and the constant barking of the neighbor's dog. And under his breath he <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Eeeee." ...|$|R
50|$|He parks near a {{perimeter}} fence behind Lita's farm. He crawls under the fence when the Ilocano-speaking man, whom he identifies as Abraham, finds him and asks {{him about his}} business in Abraham's farm. Bardagul tells Abraham that he is no robber and he is just finding Lita. The mere mention of Lita earns Abraham's ire and <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> curses while his daughter, a familiar face to readers of the strip, tries to separate the two so Abraham can calm down.|$|R
50|$|He {{loves to}} sleep, loves to droll, and rarely talks, {{but when he}} <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} in that fairly slow speed, those simple words always reveals the reality and the truth. Usually {{he seems to be}} lazy and casual, nothing could ever surprise him. However, when trapped in dangerous situations, he would become ferocious in a second and get ready to fight. Once the alert canceled, he would go back to that sleepy face again. In addition, his loyalty to Hong Lie cannot be doubted.|$|R
60|$|Just {{as he had}} {{commenced}} {{to speak}} the skeleton had put into his mouth a very large piece of turkey--very much larger in proportion than himself--and when Toby had finished speaking he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something evidently not very complimentary to Mr. Lord. But what it was the company never knew; for just as {{he opened his mouth}} to speak, the food went down the wrong way, his face became a bright purple, and it was quite evident that he was choking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Darn curious," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself, [...] "that boy should get caught just at this time, {{and not with}} some o' those girls in Marion. Well, it's none o' my funeral," [...] he ended, with a sigh; for it had stirred him {{to the bottom of}} his sunny nature, after all. A dozen times, as he lay there beside his equally sleepless companion, he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} more in deprecation of the step, but each time stifled the opening word into a groan.|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't much to see," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{the kind}} of {{sculptor}} who works on order. I believe in the 'art for service' idea, and when I get an order I fill {{it as well as}} I can, make it as beautiful as I can, and send it out on its mission. I'd like to model mantel-pieces and andirons, because they are seen and actually influence people's lives. What I <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was this: my stuff all goes out--my real stuff; my fool failures stay by me--this thing, for instance." [...] He indicated the big clump of nude forms. [...] "I had an 'idea' when I started, but it was too ambitious and too literary. Moreover, it isn't democratic. It don't gibe with the present. I'd be a wild-animal sculptor if I knew enough about them." ...|$|E
50|$|The next Olympics were in 1992 in Barcelona and Jamaica {{had many}} athletes capable {{of winning the}} Olympic Gold medal but none rose to the occasion. Cuthbert came close but could only manage two silvers (in the 100 m and 200 m) and Winthrop Graham won silver in the 400 m hurdles behind record {{breaking}} Kevin Young. Ottey won two more Olympic Bronzes (that was in the 100 m and 200 m behind younger teammate Cuthbert) and many were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she should retire.|$|R
50|$|Son of Governor Houghton of St. Vickensburg, who has {{inherited}} his father's {{distaste for}} pirates. However, {{this is a}} problem for Blaine, who needs his help for the last quest he is setting out to fulfill. Elias is actually Blaine's son. When he finally accepts Blaine as his real father, he will <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> “father” instead of “captain.” Elias is the Index finger of Destiny’s Hand. He is the scholar who speaks Priscus and the key to the map to the Devil’s Eye.|$|R
5000|$|In one scene, the bouncer {{refers to}} Spike as [...] "a Billy Idol wannabe," [...] and Buffy <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Billy Idol {{actually}} stole the look from him (implying Spike {{had told her}} this in conversation at some point). In Season Five's [...] "Fool for Love," [...] Spike's resemblance to Billy Idol was depicted (though not acknowledged in dialogue) during his flashback fight with the Slayer Nikki Wood in 1977, at which time Spike's attire and hair mimicked Idol almost perfectly, several years before Idol's fame.|$|R
60|$|The {{behavior}} of the deer in the yard had puzzled Upton not a little. He could evolve no theory to account for it. Why at this season of the year should those two does have appeared so terror stricken at his approach, and why should the buck have been in such an ugly mood? From all accounts he had read, and from what Pat had said, he had had good grounds for expecting the animals to be fairly tame. He put the matter up to Pat as they tramped homeward, but his reply was evasive and unsatisfactory. In fact, the big fellow was not inclined to talk. He appeared to have something on his mind, and strode along with a black scowl darkening his usually good-humored face. Once Walter thought he detected a slight {{shake of his head}} at Sparrer as the latter <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something. He was sure of it when the latter abruptly changed the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘I {{was walking}} {{down one of the}} main streets of Jacksonville, looking into the shop windows, when what do you think? I saw Link Merwell and Nick Jasniff. You could have knocked me over with a feather, for I hadn’t {{imagined}} that they were anywhere near. They were nattily dressed and each carried a small valise, and they were buying caps and some other things for a sea voyage. I went into the shop and called to them, and my! both of them jumped as if they were shot, and Merwell got so pale I {{thought he was going to}} faint. I said “Hello,” but they didn’t answer to that, and Jasniff at once wanted to know if I was alone. When I told him I was he seemed mightily relieved, and Merwell looked relieved, too. They wanted to know what I was doing there and I told them. Then I asked what they were doing, but I couldn’t get any straight answer. Merwell <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something about going to sea, but Jasniff stopped him short, and said they guessed they would go back to New York, where they had come from.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hain't but oncet. Oncet {{is enough}} for me. I run away, while I was in Venice, and went ashore--if {{you can call it}} ashore; it's all water, and you got to go round in boats: gondolas they call 'em there--and went to see the American counsul, and told him I was an American boy, and {{tried to get him to}} get me off. But he couldn't do anything. If you ship under the Swedish flag you're a Swede, and the whole United States couldn't get you off. If I'd 'a' shipped under the American flag I'd 'a' been an American, I don't care if I was born in Hottentot. That's what the counsul said. I never want to see that town ag'in. I used to hear songs about Venice--'Beautiful Venice, Bride of the Sea;' but I think it's a kind of a hole of a place. Well, what I <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was that when I turn up in Boston, now,--and I most {{generally}} do,--I don't go to no sailor boardin'-house; I break for the Wayfarer's Lodge, every time. It's a temperance house, and they give you the worth o' your money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I {{wanted to talk}} to you about," [...] she said, seizing the {{opportunity}} offered by this display of humility. [...] "I've been looking for you all day to go on with what I was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the lift last night when we were interrupted. Do you mind if I talk to you like an aunt--or a sister, suppose we say? Really, the best plan would be for you to adopt me as an honorary sister. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} can't be {{anything}} else," [...] smiled Doris. She knew that Penelope had <b>started</b> out <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "a new dress." [...] She cut the strings {{and removed the}} wrappings. Both girls stared.|$|R
