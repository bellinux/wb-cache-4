40|$|Although over a {{third of}} all {{arbitration}} proceedings result in settlement agreements very little has been written on the legal status of consent awards in international arbitration. Drawing on comparative analysis of procedural rules and practice of major arbitration tribunals, domestic law of common and civil law jurisdictions, this Article presents the first major study of consent awards in international arbitration. Consent awards, being effectively <b>settlement</b> agreements recorded <b>by</b> <b>arbitration</b> tribunals as awards, raise a number of difficult legal questions, ranging from the right of arbitrators to refuse recoding the settlement as a consent award to the possible use of consent awards to cover illegal activities. Understanding what makes consent awards different from “normal” arbitration awards will help successfully navigate from settlement to enforcement...|$|R

40|$|Growth in {{international}} trade has led to considerable expansion {{of the scope of}} matters capable of <b>settlement</b> <b>by</b> <b>arbitration.</b> In spite of sustained scholarly activity on arbitrability, the question of what is arbitrable remains controversial but relevant in many regions of the world, including Africa. Arbitrability has the potential to affect the validity of an arbitration agreement, strip an arbitrator of jurisdiction, or derail enforcement of an award. Given the significance of the concept, it is vital that entities involved {{in international}} transactions do not speciously extrapolate knowledge of what pertains in Europe and America across all jurisdictions and regions of the world. This study draws a comparison between arbitrability and its relationship with public policy in Europe and America on one hand, and the trend in Africa in an attempt to critically investigate the extent to which African states are willing to extend the scope of arbitrable subject matters. A number of trends on arbitrability are discernible. Most commercial disputes are arbitrable and this observation generally aligns with practice in Europe and America. Beyond this, there are three significant differences in the areas of scope of subject matter, approaches to arbitrability regulation and the role of public policy...|$|E
40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} {{perception}} of the legal profession, multi-tier arbitrations are neither new, nor uncommon phenomenon. With growing need {{of the community to}} arbitration becomes real, not just theoretical, alternative to judicial resolution of disputes, arbitration accepts more judicial characteristics, among {{which is one of the}} most important and at the same time controversial - multi-tiered dispute resolution. Multi-tiered arbitration proceeding is traditionally present in commercial and investment arbitrations. However, in recent decades, significant international arbitration institutions introduced the option for consensual review of arbitration awards. Sports law is an area where, by the end of the twentieth century, the phenomenon was unnoticed present. The international sports community, as a precondition for the survival of autonomous settlement of disputes, choose dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>by</b> <b>arbitration,</b> but with a number of significant modifications. One of the most specific is multi-tiered arbitration, especially regarding the most important cases. The main reason for such behaviour is the aspiration of the international sports community, following the example of national courts, to organize efficient, quality and final way of resolving disputes within its jurisdiction. Permanent Court of arbitration of the Olympic Committee of Serbia follows the mentioned logic, thanks to the provisions of the Sports Act and contrary to the Arbitration act, and introduces the possibility of reviewing its decision in front of the Court of arbitration for sport based in Lausanne...|$|E

Technical obstacles consist {{of the lack of}} arbiters, the lack of information about the existence of BANI, and the highly dominant skill of arbiters. The attempts made by BANI to cope with the obstacles are by setting up a standard for arbitration clause such as the types of problem which can be settled through arbitration, the appointment of arbitration, the prevailing legal provisions, laws, and regulation, and the publication of quarterly bulletins, either in Indonesian or in foreign languages, so that people will know and understand the existence of arbitration board with all its functions as an alternative in settling disputes in business outside of Court...|$|R

2500|$|Coffin found {{guidance}} in resolving this problem first from an opinion he'd written {{in another case}} two years earlier which led him to exclude from Convention coverage those arbitration clauses found defective though fraud, mistake, duress, and waiver.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} forms and {{significance}} of dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>by</b> <b>arbitration,</b> or ‘δίκη’, in the Iliad. I take as my focus the ‘storm simile’ of Iliad XVI: 384 - 393, which describes Zeus’ theodical reaction to corruption within the δίκη-court, and the ‘shield trial’ of Iliad XVIII: 498 - 508, which presents a detailed picture of such a court in action, and compare {{the forms and}} conception of arbitration that emerge from these two ecphrastic passages with {{those found in the}} narrative body of the poem. Analysing the terminology and procedures associated with dispute settlement in the Iliad, I explore the evidence for the development of an ‘ideology of δίκη’, that valorises arbitrated settlement as a solution to conflict, and that identifies δίκη as a procedure and a civic institution with an objective standard of fairness: the foundation of a civic concept of ‘justice’. I argue that this ideology is fully articulated in the storm simile and the shield trial, as well as Hesiod’s Works and Days, but that it is also detectable in the narrative body of the Iliad. I further argue that the poet of the Iliad employs references to this ideology, through the narrative media of speech and ecphrasis, to prompt and direct his audience’s evaluation of the nature and outcome of the poem’s central conflict: the dispute of Achilles and Agamemnon. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{agreeing that}} courts should {{exercise}} great caution concerning anti-foreign-suit injunctions, the author argues {{in favor of}} such a remedy in a particular setting where enforcing an agreement to arbitrate is at stake. That setting occurs when the parties to an arbitration agreement place the arbitration seat in a particular country (F 1) and also choose that country 2 ̆ 7 s law to govern the arbitration agreement (its existence, validity and scope). Such an agreement should be understood as choosing F 1 courts to resolve any differences over the 2 ̆ 2 ordinary arbitrability 2 ̆ 2 of the dispute (existence, validity, {{and scope of the}} arbitration clause). Thus, if one of the parties tries to litigate the dispute in a different country (F 2), that party acts in breach of the arbitration agreement and may be enjoined from doing so. The author argues that parties wanting a strongly enforceable arbitration clause will favor this remedy and will want to place the arbitration seat in, and choose the law of, a country that will provide it. The author would make an exception where F 2 may have a strong public policy reason to treat the subject matter as not capable of <b>settlement</b> <b>by</b> <b>arbitration</b> - a 2 ̆ 2 public policy 2 ̆ 2 challenge to arbitrability, as opposed to a 2 ̆ 2 garden variety 2 ̆ 2 existence, validity, or scope challenge to arbitrability. In a 2 ̆ 2 public policy 2 ̆ 2 case an F 1 court should not issue an anti-foreign-suit injunction. The author discusses two recent court decisions in the UK (Through Transport and West Tankers) that exemplify the approach advocated...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of our globalised world {{open the way}} for international trade and transactions between different countries; this may lead to conflicts in laws where transactions and trade {{may be subject to}} different legal systems. One of the biggest issues in international commercial law is disputes over the charging of interest, for example with regard to late payment, interest-based loans, or compensation for damages. Interest disputes are considered to be a complex area of law and even more complex in the international field. At the international level, interest claims may be connected to many areas of commerce and thus governed by various laws, which are different from one country to another; moreover, each country has its own interest rate and such rates are changeable according to the nature of law and economics under some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the concept of interest itself is affected by influences such as religious beliefs and economic, political and cultural trends. Interest can be treated as a substantive or a procedural matter. The settlement of these disputes therefore faces difficulties. Arbitration, as a method for settlement of disputes, is characterised by special features that assist in resolving these issues; but it faces some obstructions, especially in international commercial arbitration. The practices of arbitral tribunals and national courts in this regard are different. The results of different interpretations, approaches, and theories with regard to arbitration, at the pre-arbitration, during arbitration and post-arbitration stages, may also differ widely due to the diversity of financial and legal systems such as Common Law, Civil Law and the Islamic legal system – Sharia Law – across different countries. Each legal system has a different methodology and theories, even within an individual country under one legal system, and a state within a federal system has its own laws, which may have different interpretations in this respect. The New York Convention of 1958 on enforcing foreign arbitral awards was established in favour of arbitral awards and for the purpose of unifying international rules of arbitration. This Convention provides some procedural and substantive rules for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, but also provides some grounds for refusal. These rules have been affected by different interpretations under different jurisdictions and legal systems, which lead to different perspectives on the matter of charging interest and <b>settlement</b> <b>by</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The outcome of applying the NYC under these interpretations often has the opposite of its intended effect: the rejection of foreign arbitral awards. Due to such ambiguities, courts occasionally intervene in arbitration in all its stages. The interventions of national courts occur in three stages: enforcement of the arbitration agreement, enforcement of the contract under the applicable law to the agreement, and enforcement of the foreign arbitral award. The confusion between substantive and procedural laws also creates confusion with respect to public policy, non-arbitrability and enforceability. In addition, there may be a lack of clarity on the scope of arbitration with respect to the parties’ agreement, whether or not the parties have agreed to the interest rates and periods {{and whether or not they}} have agreed to the authority of the arbitrator. These issues affect the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, the law applicable to the disputed contract, the freedom of parties, the authority of the arbitrators and the enforceability of the awarded interest. The thesis studies how arbitral awards containing interest have been interpreted across the three aforementioned legal systems under the NYC 1958 in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, England, France, and the US and the enforceability of such awards...|$|E
