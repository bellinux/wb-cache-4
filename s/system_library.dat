5|$|The arcade {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land amassed {{moderate}} sales, and the Master System version received overall positive reviews {{in all aspects}} and has been highly {{regarded as one of}} the better titles in the Master <b>System</b> <b>library.</b> Reviews praised the game for its colorful graphics, smooth controls, gameplay, and replay value. Other ports received mixed reception: criticisms included very slow multi-load times on the home computer versions, sub-quality sound, and smaller play areas. The arcade version would later be re-released in emulated form as a digital download for Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} reference {{implementation of the}} PNG format is the programming library libpng. It is published as free software {{under the terms of}} a permissive free software licence.

25|$|In {{most modern}} {{operating}} systems (OSs), {{a large body}} of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer's job. This code is typically provided as a set of dynamically loadable libraries that applications can call at runtime. Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the pre-existing OS libraries. Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of its own standard class libraries containing many of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems. Most of the <b>system</b> <b>library</b> is also written in Java. For instance, the Swing library paints the user interface and handles the events itself, eliminating many subtle differences between how different platforms handle components.|$|E
