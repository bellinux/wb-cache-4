5|$|The Peninsular War was not {{developing}} favourably for Spain, and by May 1810 a ship {{arrived with}} {{the news of the}} defeat of <b>Seville</b> and the disbanding of the Junta of <b>Seville.</b> Without either a recognised Spanish king or the Junta that had appointed Cisneros, many people thought that the viceroy no longer had any authority. Cisneros tried to conceal the news by gathering all the newspapers brought by the ship, but Belgrano and Castelli managed to get one. Cisneros then explained the European developments to the public. Belgrano {{and the members of the}} Carlotist party, despite having given up their original idea, plotted to remove the viceroy and replace him with a junta. Under the advice of Cornelio Saavedra, they waited for the news of the defeat in Spain to take action.|$|E

5|$|Amongst his British contemporaries Chambers ranks {{top with}} two 9.97s finishes; {{the first in}} 1999 in <b>Seville,</b> Spain and the second in 2001 in Edmonton, Canada. Compatriot Mark Lewis Francis also scored a {{personal}} best of 9.97s at the Edmonton World Championships. Great Britain teammate Jason Gardener's personal best of 9.98s falls just short of Chambers'. None of his British contemporaries have broken the ten second barrier {{on more than one}} occasion; Chambers has done so five times.|$|E
5|$|Chambers is {{the current}} European record holder in the 60m with 6.42s and is the third fastest {{sprinter}} {{in the history of}} the event after Andre Cason and Maurice Greene. Chambers shares the British and European records for the 4×100metres relay with Gardener, Darren Campbell and Marlon Devonish with their 37.73s finish at the 1999 <b>Seville</b> World Championships. It is also the fastest time recorded by a team outside of the IAAF's North, Central American and Caribbean region.|$|E

5|$|His {{scholarship}} and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 {{when he was}} declared a Doctor of the Church. He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church.

5|$|In August 1932 {{there was}} an {{unsuccessful}} uprising by General José Sanjurjo, who had been particularly appalled by events in Castilblanco. The aims of the insurrection were vague, and it quickly turned into a fiasco. Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who {{would go on to}} distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: the Duke of <b>Seville,</b> Martin Alonso, Ricardo Serrador Santés, and Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} major outing on the world stage, Chambers {{attained}} a new personal best at the 1999 World Championships in <b>Seville,</b> registering a time of 9.97s for third place in the 100m final. This made the 21-year-old the youngest ever World Championships 100m medallist. North Americans dominated the event as Maurice Greene and Bruny Surin took first and second place respectively, with record runs of 9.80s and 9.84s, respectively. The British sprint team Chambers, Gardener, Campbell and Marlon Devonish performed well in the 4×100metres relay event as runners-up {{in a time of}} 37.73s behind the US team led by Greene. World record holder Maurice Greene was hitting his peak, winning three gold medals in <b>Seville.</b> However, at 21 years old, Chambers had achieved more than Greene had at that age: Greene's best was 10.08s in 1996 and he had never reached a major final.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, Celtic reached the 2003 UEFA Cup Final in <b>Seville,</b> which they lost 3–2 after {{extra time to}} Porto, and also reached the last 16 of the Champions League on three {{occasions}} in the 2006–07, 2007–08 and 2012–13 seasons.

5000|$|In hip hop culture, this {{generation}} of <b>Sevilles</b> were known as [...] "slantbacks." [...] Sales were respectable at first, but disastrous experimentation with diesel engines and the ill-fated 1981 V8-6-4 variable displacement engine (1980s technology could not make it work reliably), along with poor quality control and lackluster performance from engines severely detuned to meet more stringent CAFE standards, began to erode the <b>Seville's</b> standing in the marketplace. A new but underpowered 4.1 liter V8 was fitted to post-1981 models. It was prone to the block becoming porous and coolant mixing with the oil, resulting in early engine failure. Some 1981-1982 models were also fitted with an optional 4.1 liter Buick V6 which was a reliable enough engine but not powerful enough for the <b>Seville's</b> weight and performance was lacking.|$|R
