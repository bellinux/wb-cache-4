Here we prove that such graphs exist <b>for</b> <b>girth</b> g= 4 if and only if n is even and at least 20. We provide an example <b>for</b> <b>girth</b> g= 5 consisting of 180 vertices.

40|$|The best-yielding, best vigour {{and most}} stable Hevea clones are {{identified}} by growing clones in different environments. However, {{research on the}} stability in Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. Adr. ex Juss.) Muell. -Arg. is scarce. The objectives of this work were to assess genotype-environment interaction and determine stable genotypes. Stability analysis were performed on results <b>for</b> <b>girth</b> growth and rubber yield of seven clones from five comparative trials conducted over 10 years (girth growth) and four years (rubber yield) in São Paulo State, Brazil. Stability was estimated using the Eberhart and Russell (1966) method. Year by location and location variability were the dominant sources of interactions. The stability analysis identified GT 1 and IAN 873 as the most stable clones <b>for</b> <b>girth</b> growth and rubber yield respectively since their regression coefficients were almost the unity (b = 1) and they {{had one of the}} lowest deviations from regressions (S 2 di). Their coefficient of determination (R²) was as high as 89. 5 % and 89. 8 % confirming their stability. In contrast, clones such as PB 235, PR 261, and RRIM 701 <b>for</b> <b>girth</b> growth and clones such as GT 1 for rubber yield with regression coefficients greater than one were regarded as sensitive to environment changes...|$|R
