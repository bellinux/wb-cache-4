40|$|AbstractBackgroundSince 1994, French {{population-based}} knowledge, attitudes, {{beliefs and}} practices surveys have enabled researchers to estimate trends in sexual behavioural indicators. MethodsWe estimated trends and prevalence of self-reported <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> during the previous 5 years among 16, 095 sexually active adults aged 18 – 54 through five cross-sectional telephone surveys between 1994 and 2010. We then studied the factors associated with participants’ most recent <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> other than genital candidiasis. ResultsOverall, 2. 5 % (95 % confidence interval: 2. 2 %– 2. 9 %) of women reported <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> within the previous 5 years, increases being continuously reported between 1998 and 2010. In contrast, men reported lower prevalence of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> (1. 4 %; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 %– 1. 7 %), which remained stable over time. General practitioners and gynaecologists managed most <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections.</b> Men notified their stable partners about infection less often than women (66 % vs. 84 %). Self-reported <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> were associated with younger age, multiple sexual partnerships and fear of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> in both genders, with exclusively homosexual practices in men, and with a high educational level and recent HIV testing in women. ConclusionSelf-reported <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> clearly reflect risky sexual behaviours. The lower prevalence of self-reported <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> among men than among women may reflect less access to screening activities for <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> in men...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> are a {{major public}} health problem in South Africa. The high {{incidence}} and prevalence of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> in South Africa pose {{a serious threat to}} public health for two main reasons. Firstly, the long-term consequences of these infections {{are a major}} cause of loss of health or life, and secondly, <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> are important co-factors in driving the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. The control and prevention of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> has become an urgent priority. At a primary health care clinic, the nursing personnel experienced an increasing number of persons daily seeking treatment for <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of people seeking treatment at Stanza Bopape Clinic regarding <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections.</b> The study was a contextual, quantitative survey. The population was all patients (15 years and older) who visited the clinic for a health-related problem during November 2004 to January 2005. The sampling method was convenient. The data gathering method was self-report using a structured questionnaire basic on current knowledge. The data analysis was done with descriptive statistics...|$|R
5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection.</b> It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} Hollyoaks, Mercedes meets Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) and flirts with him, angering his girlfriend, Sophie Burton (Connie Powney). Mercedes {{develops}} feelings for Russ {{and they have}} sex. They begin a relationship after Sophie dies. Russ is diagnosed with a <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection</b> and wrongly accuses Mercedes of having an affair. She is angry with Russ and sleeps with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Mercedes discovers that her mother, Myra (Nicole Barber-Lane), {{is the cause of}} infection and Russ apologieses to Mercedes. Mercedes sleeps with Warren once again and feeling guilty, proposes marriage to Russ. He agrees, revealing that he was also going to propose. On the night before their wedding, Mercedes becomes intoxicated and has sex with Warren for a third time. On the same night, someone attempts to murder Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) and Warren is arrested. Warren tries to prove his innocence as he was with Mercedes, but she denies it. At the wedding, Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) interrupts the proceedings and confronts Mercedes. Mercedes' half-sister, Tina (Leah Hackett), lies and gives her an alibi. Mercedes and Russ then marry and Warren is charged with Clare's attempted murder. Mercedes agrees to be a witness at Warren's trial and explains their affair, with Russ listening on. Russ then ends their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection</b> resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E

40|$|Coinfections of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> are {{frequent}} {{due to the}} same transmission routes which may facilitate the transmission of other <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections.</b> <b>Sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> coinfections are associated with atypical and generally more severe clinical features, more complications, resistency to treatment, unfavourable outcome, and worse prognosis. <b>Sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> may {{increase the likelihood of}} acquiring and transmission of HIV infection. The authors summarize the most important characteristics of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> (such as HIV and hepatitis B virus, HIV and hepatitis C virus, HIV and syphilis, HIV and gonorrhoeae, HIV and chlamydia coinfections). These infections are more frequent in HIV infected patients than in the normal population. The shared transmission routes, impairment of the immune response, elevated cytokine levels and the associated inflammatory milieu produce local tissue damage, breaches in mucosal epithelium, which increases the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection.

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{recommended}} <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection</b> as the preferred term since 1999. <b>Sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection</b> is a broader term than sexually transmitted disease. An infection is a colonization by a parasitic species, {{which may not}} cause any adverse effects. In a disease, the infection leads to impaired or abnormal function. In either case, the condition may not exhibit signs or symptoms. Increased understanding of infections like HPV, which infects {{a significant portion of}} sexually active individuals but cause disease in only a few, has led to increased use of the term STI. Public health officials originally introduced the term <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection,</b> which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term sexually transmitted disease in order to distinguish it from the former.|$|E

However, the medicinal plants used for <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> and data on the usage of plants in Sesheke District in particular and Western Province in general have not been documented. In this study, an ethnobotanical survey was conducted to document the indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants that alleviate symptoms of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> in Sesheke District, Western Province, Zambia. Using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, ethnobotanical {{data were collected from}} twenty traditional healers that manage patients presenting with <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections.</b> The results showed that 52 plant species in 25 families and 43 genera were used to treat gonorrhoea, syphilis, chancroid, chlamydia, genital herpes, and ano-genital warts. <b>Sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infections</b> were frequently managed using the following plants: Terminalia sericea, Strychnos cocculoides, Ximenia caffra, Cassia abbreviata, Cassia occidentalis, Combretum hereroense, Combretum imberbe, Dichrostachys cinerea, Boscia albitrunca, Momordica balsamina and Peltophorum africanum.

25|$|BV {{is caused}} by an {{imbalance}} of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There {{is a change in}} {{the most common type of}} bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Typically, bacteria other than Lactobacilli become more common. Risk factors include douching, new or multiple sex partners, antibiotics, and using an intrauterine device, among others. However, it is not considered a <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection.</b> Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms, and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal pH, and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a vaginal yeast infection or infection with Trichomonas.|$|E
25|$|For HSV-2, {{subclinical}} shedding {{may account}} {{for most of the}} transmission. Studies on discordant partners (one infected with HSV-2, one not) show that the transmission rate is approximately 5 per 10,000 sexual contacts. (Effect of Condoms on Reducing the Transmission of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 From Men to Women. A Wald, AGM Langenberg, K Link, et al. JAMA. 2001;285(24):3197) Atypical symptoms are often attributed to other causes such as a yeast infection. HSV-1 is often acquired orally during childhood. It may also be sexually transmitted, including contact with saliva, such as kissing and mouth-to-genital contact (oral sex). HSV-2 is primarily a <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>infection,</b> but rates of HSV-1 genital infections are increasing.|$|E
