25|$|Jordan's first {{wastewater}} treatment plant was established in 1968 in Ain Ghazal near Amman (the plant now serves as a pre-treatment plant for the As-Samra plant). The construction of other treatment plants started in the early 1980s. The total number of treatment plants was 28 as of 2013, treating about 324,000 m3 per day (118 million m3/year), or about 98% of the collected wastewater. By far the largest treatment plant is the As-Samra plant that treats the wastewater of Amman-Zarqa, accounting for about 80% of all wastewater treated. The plant initially used the <b>stabilization</b> <b>pond</b> technology, but was rebuilt using the activated sludge technology in 2008 under a Build-Operate-Transfer contract signed in 2002. In June 2012 the government signed a contract {{for the expansion of}} the treatment plant to a capacity of 365,000 m3.

25|$|So {{far there}} is limited planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} water in Morocco, given that only 21% of the collected wastewater undergoes any treatment. In 2009 {{there were more than}} 100 wastewater treatment plants in Morocco, mostly serving small and medium-sized towns located in the interior or the country. The first wastewater treatment plants in Morocco were built by small municipalities using a wide range of technologies. Because of the limited financial and technical capacities of those municipalities practically all of these 28 plants ceased functioning shortly after they were completed. This triggered a decision in 2000 to gradually transfer the responsibility for sanitation in small and medium-sized towns to the national utility ONEP. In 2009 the latter has built or {{was in the process of}} building 43 plants, mostly using the <b>stabilization</b> <b>pond</b> technology, but also one activated sludge plant and a few trickling filter plants. The track record of operating these plants is better than for the plants operated by municipalities, partly because the predominant technology - stabilization ponds - does not require electricity. Its lower operating costs make it less vulnerable to disruptions in the case of strained operating budgets. In larger cities, only very few municipal utilities (Régies) operate wastewater treatment plants. Their track record at operating them is mixed: A plant operated by the Agadir utility works well, while plants operated by the utilities of Beni Mellal and Nador do not function. These plants use the activated sludge technology which requires electricity. The Marakkech utility was constructing a large plant in 2009, and the Fes utility was in the process of bidding for a plant. This process experienced a setback when the French development agency AFD and the European Investment Bank withdrew their financing for the plant, citing non-respect of tender procedures as the reason.|$|E

A World Bank study carried out in Sana’a, Yemen, in 1983 makes a detailed economic comparison of waste stabilization ponds, aerated lagoons, oxidation ditches and trickling filters. According to this study, <b>stabilization</b> <b>pond</b> technology is a cheaper option up to a land cost of US$ 7.8 per square meter. Above this cost, oxidation ditches become the cheapest option. However, often the main constraint against selecting this technology is not land cost but land availability. If land is available, stabilization ponds have the advantage of very low operating costs since they use no energy compared to other wastewater treatment technologies.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 a {{substantial}} {{expansion of the}} plant was completed, making it the largest plant of its kind - a <b>stabilization</b> <b>pond</b> plant - in Africa.

With the new infrastructure the discharge of liquid waste in open drains declined considerably and for a period between 1987 and 1995 the water quality of the Nairobi River improved. However, the discharge of untreated wastewater in non-sewered areas continued. Because of inadequate garbage collection and poor maintenance sewers became clogged and overflowed, so that the benefits of the sewerage were less than expected. Furthermore, the Kariobangi plant was poorly maintained and stopped functioning so that the wastewater bypassed it and was discharged without treatment to the Nairobi river.|$|E

There is large morphological variation in this group, which suggests that they infect a variety of host species. At the point of attachment between the long tail and the head there is a base plate where short pins are attached, a contractile sheath, and an internal core, similar to other bacteriophages in the Myoviridae.|$|E

For this purpose, we tested the hypothesis that eutrophic discharges of sewage results in the maintenance of high-density phytoplankton community, mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyceae, both spatially and seasonally, as well as the occurrence of a spatial and seasonal similarity between phytoplankton richness and density in <b>stabilization</b> <b>ponds.</b> Methods: We carried out monthly samplings of the phytoplankton community and environmental variables, between March 2011 and February 2012, in two <b>stabilization</b> <b>ponds</b> located in the city of Cascavel, West Paraná State, Brazil. Results: We observed that the sampled months presented a clear distinction regarding environmental variability, which did not occur for the ponds. We identified 39 taxa, with Cyanobacteria as the most representative group both in richness and density. We records low diversity and evenness of species and low phytoplankton spatial and temporal variability without significant differences between the richness and density mean values according to the periods and sampling station. Conductivity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen and turbidity were the major structuring environmental variables of phytoplankton. Conclusion: Our results corroborated our hypotheses considering the similar spatial and temporal phytoplankton distributions because of abiotic conditions behaving similarly, as well as the direct connection of the ponds. This paper points out the importance of such studies to proper management, including cyanobacteria control and operational decisions regarding <b>stabilization</b> <b>ponds</b> and the export of undesirable inoculum for receiving water bodies...|$|R

Landfill leachate basically originates from the percolation process of different types of water and is considered a wastewater to cause in significant environmental impact on the environment, given in possession of high concentration of ammonia nitrogen, organic matter difficult to biodegradation, metals heavy and xenobiotics.

The applied surface charge (λs) the series of <b>stabilization</b> <b>ponds</b> was 320 kg DBO 5 ha- 1 day- 1 with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 17 days for the series. The average removal efficiency of BOD 5 and ammonia was 69 and 86 % respectively, while removing coliform efficiency always in the 99. 9 % threshold during the monitoring period was 220 days.
