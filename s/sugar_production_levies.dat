40|$|How {{affected}} are the <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> in Mozambique and Tanzania by EU sugar regime? What {{does the}} EU sugar reform constitute in these countries? Using theories regarding {{free trade and}} anti-free trade, I am able to answer these questions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to study how the various sugar agreements with EU affect the <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> in Mozambique and Tanzania. Therefore I am using a method called a most similar system design in this comparative case study. The conclusion is that the EU sugar regime is the main reason to how the <b>sugar</b> <b>productions</b> in developing countries are. This conclusion is drawn since the difference in their developed <b>sugar</b> <b>production</b> is based on the importance of an advantageous sugar agreement. This can be applied to the case in Tanzania, which had a higher sugar export when the country had an advantageous sugar agreement with EU. Now when the trade has been more liberalized with the sugar reform the country does not have the same advantageous agreements with EU and the sugar export has been smaller. Compared to Tanzania Mozambique has had a better development in their <b>sugar</b> <b>production,</b> since their trade agreements with EU is better today than before 2001...|$|R

40|$|Dissolved {{carbohydrate}} {{obtained from}} 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) pretreated sago waste was saccharified by Amberlyst 15 (A 15) {{to study the}} kinetics of the ionic liquid-mediated solid acid saccharification of the lignocellulosic biomass. Besides the kinetics of both reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> and reducing <b>sugars</b> degradation reactions, emphasis {{was given to the}} recovery and reusability of the ionic liquid and solid acid catalyst. The hydrolysis reaction follows a first order sugars production-first order sugars degradation reaction that agreed well with the generalized Saeman kinetic model. Both the rates of reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> and degradation varied with temperature and catalyst loading. Higher temperature and catalyst loading promoted the rates of <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> reaction more than the rate of degradation reaction. This is evident from the relatively larger rate constant of <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> (k(1)) than the rate constant of degradation (k(2)). The activation energy for <b>sugars</b> <b>production</b> and degradation was 125. 1 kJ mol(- 1) and 60. 8 kJ mol(- 1) respectively. These values are lower than the literature reported values for sulfuric acid-catalyzed saccharification confirming its employment suitability for reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>production.</b> The good recovery of [BMIM]Cl and good reusability of A 15 further substantiated the feasibility of the process. The recovery of ionic liquid was improved by employing a multiple step aqueous biphasic system in this study. Approximately 60 % of the ionic liquid was recovered by 3 -step aqueous biphasic system. This finding is on par with the reported literatures using aqueous biphasic system to recover ionic liquid. Equally robust, the solid acid catalyst regained its saccharification performance after regeneration for a total of three cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
