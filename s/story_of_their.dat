5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> romance.|$|E

25|$|Comstock, Jameson, and Triplett {{surrendered}} in late November and Richards {{arrived in}} Omaha on December 7, 1910.

25|$|The {{opening of}} the novel {{introduces}} the Karamazov family and relates the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> distant and recent past. The details of Fyodor's two marriages {{as well as his}} indifference to the upbringing of his three children is chronicled. The narrator also establishes the widely varying personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led to their return to Fyodor's town. The first book concludes by describing the mysterious religious order of Elders to which Alyosha has become devoted.|$|E
25|$|His sister, the Honourable Marian Cecilia Brodrick, married Sir James Whitehead, {{son of the}} {{inventor}} Robert Whitehead. Sir James Whitehead was to become the British Ambassador to Austria, and his daughter Agathe was the first wife of Georg Johannes von Trapp; the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children and his second wife, Maria von Trapp, was {{the basis of the}} musical The Sound of Music. Another sister, Albinia, became an early supporter of Sinn Féin and became well known in Ireland under the name Gobnait Ní Bhruadair. Edith Mary Gell was another sister who was a published author with works such as The Cloud of Witness and her autobiography, Under Three Reigns: 1860-1944.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{libretto}} is original. The main {{plots of}} acts {{two and three}} are the librettists' invention, {{with only a few}} passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the novel, piecing together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the novel. The <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mimì's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mimì's.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} quite how {{the letters of}} Abelard and Héloïse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual {{references}} to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and Walter Map. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore {{seems likely that the}} letters sent between Abelard and Héloïse were kept by Héloïse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied. At this time, the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> love affair was summarised by Jean de Meun in his continuation to Le Roman de la Rose.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} part, Henriquez’ brother, Myrtano, succeeds as Idalia’s {{principal}} adorer, and she reciprocates his love. She then receives a letter informing her about Myrtano’s engagement to another woman, so she leaves for Verona, hoping {{to enter a}} convent. On the road her guide takes her to a rural retreat {{with the intention of}} killing her, but she escapes to Ancona from where she takes ship for Naples. The sea captain pays her crude court, but just in time to save her from his embraces the ship is captured by corsairs commanded by a young married couple. Though the heroine is in peasant dress, she is treated with distinction by her captors. Her history moves them to tears and they in turn {{are in the midst of}} relating to Idalia the involved <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> courtship when the vessel is wrecked in a gale.|$|E
25|$|Privation {{had made}} a man of him, and in these little books he proves himself a poet of deep feeling and {{considerable}} power of expression. The stirring incidents in the political emancipation of Portugal inspired his muse, and he describes the bitterness of exile, the adventurous expedition to Terceira, the heroic defence of Porto, and the final combats of liberty. In 1837 he founded the Panorama in imitation of the English Penny Magazine, and there and in Illustração he published the historical tales which were afterwards collected into Lendas e Narrativas; {{in the same year}} he became royal librarian at the Ajuda Palace, which enabled him to continue his studies of the past. The Panorama had a large circulation and influence, and Herculano's biographical sketches of great men and his articles of literary and historical criticism did much to educate the middle class by acquainting them with the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nation, and with the progress of knowledge and the state of letters in foreign countries.|$|E
