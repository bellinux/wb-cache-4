40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the theme of involvement of the South Bohemia in the <b>European</b> <b>region</b> Dunaj-Vltava. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter deals with the development of cross-border cooperation, including the definition of a region, a list of the theories of regional development, explanation of border effect and familiarization with individual European cross-border cooperation programs. The second chapter concentrates on the <b>European</b> <b>regions,</b> their organizational structure, membership, funding and activities, and gives examples of their association. The third chapter is devoted to the <b>European</b> <b>region</b> Dunaj-Vltava and involvement of one of the member regions, the South Bohemia, in its activities. The chapter describes the establishment of this <b>European</b> <b>region,</b> the way of its functioning and its participation in the development of cross-border cooperation. The fourth chapter is a practical part of this thesis. It includes a questionnaire survey, conducted among South Bohemia residents, and the analysis of its results. This survey should show us, how people, living in the <b>European</b> <b>region,</b> perceive the relationships between the Czech republic, Germany and Austria, how well they are informed about the existence and activities of the <b>European</b> <b>region</b> Dunaj-Vltava and what they think about it...|$|R

40|$|Background. In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{adopted a}} goal to {{eliminate}} measles in the <b>European</b> <b>Region</b> by 2010. Measles elimination {{is defined as the}} interruption of indigenous measles virus (MV) transmission. The molecular epidemiology of MV transmission in the WHO <b>European</b> <b>Region</b> was studied through the investigation of reported cases and outbreaks to monitor the region’s progress toward its measles elimination goal. Methods. National and regional laboratories performed molecular characterization of MV detected between 2007 and 2009 in the WHO <b>European</b> <b>Region.</b> To document indigenous transmission and importations into the region, we analyzed genotyping results and epidemiological data on measles outbreaks reported by the member states. Results. Since 2007, MV genotype D 6 has not been reported in the WHO <b>European</b> <b>Region,</b> suggesting that its chains of transmission have been interrupted, whereas several other MV genotypes are still circulating. Although several European countries have already interrupted indigenous MV transmission, genotyping showed that 3 endemic MV transmission chains have been reestablished in other countries. Conclusions. The WHO <b>European</b> <b>Region</b> 2010 goal will not be met, as indigenous transmission of MV has no...|$|R

40|$|Background. Poliovirus importations {{and related}} {{outbreaks}} continue {{to occur in}} polio-free countries, including those in the World Health Organization (WHO) <b>European</b> <b>Region.</b> National preparedness plans for responding to poliovirus introduction are insufficient in many countries of the <b>European</b> <b>Region.</b> We describe a series of polio outbreak simulation exercises that were implemented to formally test polio outbreak preparedness plans in the <b>European</b> <b>Region.</b> Methods. We designed and implemented the exercises, reviewed the results, made recommendations, and as-sessed the role of outbreak simulation exercises in maintaining regional polio-free status. In addition, we performed {{a comprehensive review of}} the national plans of all WHO Member States in the <b>European</b> <b>Region.</b> Results. Three exercises, delivered during 2011 – 2013 (for the Balkans, United Kingdom, and the Caucasus and Ukraine), revealed that participating countries were generally prepared for poliovirus introduction, but the level of preparedness needed improvement. The areas in particular need of strengthening were national preparedness plans, initial response, plans for securing vaccine supply, and communications. Conclusions. Polio outbreak simulation exercises can be valuable tools to help maintain polio-free status and should be extended to other high-risk countries and subnational areas in the <b>European</b> <b>Region</b> and elsewhere...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} {{offered a}} number of subsidies during the 1970s to assist farmers after the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community and by the early 1980s government support provided some farmers with 40 percent of their income. In 1984 the Labour government ended all farm subsidies under Rogernomics, and by 1990 the agricultural industry became the most deregulated sector in New Zealand. To stay competitive in the heavily <b>subsidised</b> <b>European</b> and US markets New Zealand farmers had {{to increase the efficiency}} of their operations. Animal farming is pasture based; cows and sheep are rarely housed or fed large quantities of grain, with most farmers using grass based supplements such as hay and silage during feed shortages. Pigs are usually kept indoors, either in gestation crates, farrowing crates, fattening pens, or group housing.|$|R

40|$|Since its introduction, {{social support}} theory has {{received}} generally consistent empirical support. Tests {{of social support}} theory have, however, mostly been cross-sectional and restricted to U. S. and Western European analyses. Measures of social support {{have tended to be}} inconsistent across studies and narrowly operationalized. The present project offers a longitudinal test of Cullen’s (1994) social support theory using a more broadly defined measure of social support that is comparable across both Eastern and Western European countries. Using data gathered by Eurostat, this study applies “hybrid” regression panel analysis to test the effects of social support on homicide rates across <b>European</b> <b>regions</b> for 2000, 2005 and 2009. Results provide evidence for an effect of social support on homicide between Western and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>regions</b> and within those regions over time.
