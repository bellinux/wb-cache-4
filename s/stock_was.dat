These were supplemented by three two-car Class 68 electric multiple units. The 48 freight cars the company used were owned by Nord-Norsk Spedisjon. Of these, 19 were timber cars. All <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> painted dark green. All motorized <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> used stock that NSB has chosen to take out of service.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} peasantry, many {{soldiers}} performed ancillary activities, like medics and technicians. Selection for military duty was annual with yearly call-ups and great <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> placed on military exercises, {{during the winter}} months, which formed {{a large part of}} a soldier's life.|$|E
50|$|Another common way for {{accounting}} for treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> the par value method. In the par value method, when the <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> purchased {{back from the}} market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> debited and treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> credited. However, when the treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> resold back to the market the entry in the books {{will be the same}} as the cost method.|$|R

5|$|Between 1927 and 1933 {{multiple}} unit compartment <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> {{built by the}} Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of 'MW' <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase {{the length of the}} previous 'MW' batch trains to eight coaches. These had GEC WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice. After the Met became part of London Underground, the MV <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> fitted with Westinghouse brakes and the cars with GEC motors were re-geared to allow them to work in multiple with the MV153-motored cars. In 1938, nine 8-coach and ten 6-coach MW units were re-designated T Stock. A trailer coach built in 1904/5 is stored at London Transport Museum's Acton Depot, although it has been badly damaged by fire, and the Spa Valley Railway is home to two T stock coaches.|$|E
5|$|Bogie <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> {{built by}} Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and at Neasden Works in 1900. This gave a better ride quality, steam heating, {{automatic}} vacuum brakes, electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes. The Bluebell Railway has four 1898–1900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages and a fifth, built at Neasden, {{is at the}} London Transport Museum.|$|E
5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} into electric multiple units. Some Dreadnought carriages were used with electric motor cars, although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the extension line.|$|E
40|$|Can Noise Create the Size and Value Effects? Small-capitalization {{and value}} <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> likely to {{predominantly}} have negative noise, while large-capitalization and growth <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> {{likely to have}} positive noise, if prices contain random noise. Negative price noise implies that small-capitalization and value <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> more likely undervalued and thus have higher expected return than justified by risk, while the large-capitalization and growth <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> more likel...|$|R
50|$|Definition 1: If a {{particular}} <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> selling for $500 and the analyst {{feels that the}} <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> worth $600, the analyst would <b>be</b> declaring the <b>stock</b> to <b>be</b> overweight.|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, the European Parliament defined {{lands that}} were ineligible for {{producing}} biofuel feedstocks {{for the purpose}} of the Directives. This category included wetlands and continuously forested areas with canopy cover of more than 30 percent or cover between 10 and 30 percent given evidence that its existing carbon <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> low enough to justify conversion.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{claimed that}} Enron was {{planning}} to explain its business practices more fully within the coming days, as a confidence-building gesture. Enron's <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> now trading at around $7, as investors worried that the company {{would not be able}} to find a buyer.|$|E

Third, and finally, ΔC 2 <b>stocks</b> <b>were</b> calculated with the K-MSN prediction weighted by flux footprint probability density.|$|R
5|$|The story began {{serialisation}} in Belgium's Tintin {{magazine in}} October 1956, before being serialised in the French {{edition of the}} magazine from December 1956. It was then published in book form by Casterman in 1958. Upon the story's British publication in 1960, Coke en <b>Stock</b> <b>was</b> renamed The Red Sea Sharks.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s country {{passenger}} services were run down, and older wooden rolling <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> now approaching their use by date. As a result, the N type carriages were introduced from 1981, {{followed by the}} converted H type stock from 1984. Since then, diesel multiple units have become the norm for new purchases, with the Sprinter introduced in 1992, and the VLocity from 2005.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s Enron's <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> trading for $80–90 per share, and few seemed to concern {{themselves}} with the opacity of the company's financial disclosures. In mid-July 2001, Enron reported revenues of $50.1 billion, almost triple year-to-date, and beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share. Despite this, Enron's profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2.1%, and its share price had decreased by more than 30% since the same quarter of 2000.|$|E

5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} into multiple units by fitting cabs, control equipment and motors. In 1910, two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. They started work on the Uxbridge-South Harrow shuttle service, being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles were used between Watford and Rickmansworth.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic sliding doors {{along the length of the}} carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s. In 1985, work started {{on the development of}} a modified version for the western suburban lines. The stock on the Holmenkoll and Kolsås Line was the first that needed to be replaced. The new <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> considered to be a limited trial. If it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock when the latter reached the end of its economical life in around 2000. The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988.|$|E
5000|$|If a <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> nearing its sell by date, <b>stock</b> may <b>be</b> reduced; {{its price}} is lowered {{in order to}} be more {{appealing}} to customers [...] Reduced <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> usually included in the rotation of <b>stock,</b> and <b>is</b> therefore moved {{to the front of the}} shelf ahead of any unreduced stock.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>stocks</b> <b>were</b> {{employed}} by civil and military authorities from medieval to early modern times including Colonial America.

5|$|The {{coaching}} <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> extremely solidly constructed, {{and offered}} levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway.

5|$|The first {{evacuation}} of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when {{the horses were}} evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> consolidated at Piber.|$|E
5|$|Until 1907 all horse tram {{operations}} were by private companies, {{with the government}} passing legislation authorising line construction. Growth of the network and rolling <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> driven largely by commercial considerations.

50|$|One way of {{accounting}} for treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> {{with the cost}} method. In this method, the paid-in capital account is reduced in the balance sheet when the treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> bought. When the treasury <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> sold back on the open market, the paid-in capital is either debited or credited if it is sold for less or more than the initial cost respectively.|$|R
30|$|Using {{figures from}} 2011, {{we find that}} TFP is 1.0345 if the capital <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> proportionately used (proportion of capital stock used by the {{financial}} sector is found {{in terms of the}} ratio financial sector value added to GDP), 1.563 if half the proportional capital <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> used, and 2.3767 if one quarter the proportional capital <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> used. The capital stock estimate includes not only machinery but also computers and software, which are intensively used in the financial sector. Therefore, we do not believe the capital <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> lower than ¼ the proportional capital stock.|$|R
