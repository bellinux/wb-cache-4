40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{strapping}} rowers to their <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> on performance during 75 m on-water starting trials was investigated. Well-trained rowers performed 75 m maximum-effort starts using an instrumented single scull equipped with a redesigned <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> system, both under normal conditions and while strapped to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat.</b> Strapping rowers to their <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> resulted in a 0. 45 s lead after 75 m, corresponding {{to an increase in}} average boat velocity of about 2. 5 %. Corresponding effect sizes were large. No significant changes were observed in general stroke cycle characteristics. No indications of additional boat heaving and pitching under strapped conditions were found. The increase in boat velocity is estimated to correspond to an increase in average mechanical power output during the start of on-water rowing between 5 % and 10 %, which is substantial but smaller than the 12 % increase found in a previous study on ergometer starting. We conclude that, after {{a very short period of}} adaptation to the strapped condition, single-scull starting performance is substantially improved when the rower is strapped to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R

50|$|The races were rowed from 1868-1897 in string-test gigs with fixed seats. In {{the period}} 1898-1900 {{the race was}} competed for in best boat {{outrigger}} fours with <b>sliding</b> <b>seats.</b> In 1901 clinker outrigged eights with <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> were used. At various times later cedar boats, followed by plywood boats, then fibre glass and finally then composite construction boats have been used.|$|R

40|$|Rowers {{sit on a}} <b>seat</b> that <b>slides</b> {{relative}} to the boat/ergometer. If a rower lifts him or herself from this <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> at any time, the seat will move away from under them and the rowing action is disrupted. From a mechanical perspective, {{it is clear that}} the need for the rower to remain in contact with the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> at all times imposes position-dependent constraints on the forces exerted at the oar handle and the footstretcher. Here we investigate if the mechanical power output during rowing, which is strongly related to these forces, might be improved if the contact with the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> was of no concern to the rower. In particular, we examine if elimination of these constraints by strapping the rower to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> leads to an increase in performance during the start on a standard rowing ergometer. Eleven well-trained female rowers performed 5 -stroke starts in normal and strapped conditions. Handle force, vertical seat force, footstretcher force, and handle kinematics were recorded, from which mechanical power and work output were calculated. Most of the relevant mechanical variables differed significantly between the normal and strapped conditions. Most importantly, mechanical power output (averaged over the 5 -stroke start) in the strapped condition was 12 % higher than in the normal condition. We conclude that strapping a rower's pelvis to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> allows more vigorous execution of the stroke phases, resulting in a substantial improvement in performance during the start of ergometer rowing...|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{the giants}} in PCBC history, two leading Pembroke oarsmen of the 1870-1873 period were the three times President of the Oxford University Boat Club, Robert Lesley, {{who came up}} from Radley College and R S Mitchison, an old Etonian. Rowing historians {{indicate}} that <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> were first used during the Fours racing at Oxford in 1872 by PCBC and that “the new system of <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> was first used in Oxford by Lesley’s crew and also by the College (Pembroke) Eight at Henley “. Pembroke were the first known crew to use seats with wheels. In the club minutes it is recorded that the Pembroke crew were the pioneers of the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> at Oxford, using it in the Fours before they left for Henley, and of the seat with wheels {{for the first time}} worldwide.|$|R
50|$|A rower on a {{fixed seat}} is limited {{in the amount of}} power he can apply to the oars by the {{strength}} in his upper body and the distance he can pull the oars on each stroke. After riggers were added to the shell allowing the use of longer oars, rowers took advantage by taking longer strokes and using their legs during the stroke. At first, the athletes wore trousers with wear resistant leather bottoms covered in grease and the shells had concave, longitudinal seats. The athletes could then use their legs to <b>slide</b> along the <b>seat,</b> adding the power of their legs and letting them greatly lengthen the stroke. This eventually led to the modern <b>sliding</b> <b>seat,</b> mounted on rollers, which allows nearly frictionless movement of the rower's body.The first <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> was developed by George Warren of Toronto, a boat builder and famous decoy maker, who at the time was coach to world rowing champion Ned Hanlen. With the advent of the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> Ned was able to greatly outperform his English and American counterparts.|$|R

5000|$|Dodd {{states that}} London Rowing Club and Pembroke {{were the first}} to use the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> at Henley. Pembroke’s win of the Visitors’ Cup at Henley has been {{described}} as [...] "one of the best races of the whole Regatta". Pembroke won by approximately half a length from University College Dublin, who were using fixed seats. The Dublin crew were {{regarded as one of the}} best ever sent to Henley. What is also significant is that Pembroke were using wheels, which were soon discarded by boat builders in favour of greased glass or steel grooves or tubes, but wheels were to return to favour again in 1885. Pembroke then, were not only early adopters of the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat,</b> ahead of others in Oxford, but also pioneers in terms of the materials being used, as they anticipated the later wheeled models of <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> which did not become current until 1885 and remain until the modern day.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} improvement of helicopter occupant safety {{can be obtained}} by the optimisation of energy absorbing seat properties, specifically the introduction of variable load/stroke attenuators and the reduction of overall seat stroke length. This paper reviews these devices and investigates the feasibility of forward <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> and airbags in the helicopter environment. Results indicate that seat attenuators vastly reduce occupant lumbar loads in crash scenarios. Moreover, analysis has shown that the introduction of forward <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> coupled with seat attenuators improved occupant safety by translating crash loads to the forward axis, reducing vertical loads. Finally, the introduction of airbags was found to increase the available space for stroking devices, improving energy absorption of the safety system and acted to reduce the potential for hard contact between the occupant and instrument panel...|$|R
5000|$|Sculling {{involves}} a seated rower who pulls on two oars or sculls, {{attached to the}} boat, thereby moving the boat in the direction opposite that which the rower faces. In some multiple-seat boats seated rowers each pull on a single [...] "sweep" [...] oar, usually with both hands. Boats in which the rowers are coordinated by a coxswain {{are referred to as}} a [...] "coxed" [...] pair/four/eight. Sometimes <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> are used to enable the rower to use the leg muscles, substantially increasing the power available. An alternative to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat,</b> called a <b>sliding</b> rigger, uses a stationary seat and the rower moves the oarlocks with his feet. On a craft used in Italy, the catamaran moscone, the rower stands and takes advantage of his body weight to increase leverage while sculling.|$|R
