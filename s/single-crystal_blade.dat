40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no creep model of single crystal {{material}} in the popular finite element software. That is why the Hill model as well as assumption of blade consideration as isotropic is widely used. Crystallographic model based approaches described in the technical literature are difficult to implement in every day calculations and they require {{a large amount of}} experimental data including those of indefinable under tests. Another problems with which structural analysts face are {{that it is impossible to}} describe a diversity of creep curves by a single equation and a set of experimental data is limited. Despite the fact that there are numerous creep models and theories {{there is no}} current theory that correctly describes all varieties of creep curves in a wide range of stresses and temperatures, even for isotropic materials. This paper discusses a novel approach of taking into account material properties anisotropy in combination with ANSYS finite element analysis software to predict the stress–strain state kinetics of single-crystal nickel-based turbine blades. The approach is based on using “equivalent direction” of stress state and has been implemented in ANSYS as a user creep routine. Thus, using the proposed approach enables us to generalize the characteristics defined under uniaxial tensile tests of specimens with different crystallographic orientations on the complex stress in single crystal blade. One of the main advantages of the developed creep model, in addition to the possible taking into account the anisotropy of the characteristics, are that it allows using a limited set of experimental data and their relatively easy processing. The model can be adapted to new data in case of obtaining characteristics in different crystallographic orientations. This approach can be easily reduced down to the level of isotropic materials. Based on comparative calculations results of a <b>single-crystal</b> <b>blade</b> using the developed model with and without consideration of characteristics anisotropy a significant effect of this consideration was shown. </p...|$|E

40|$|High-temperature {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} a Ni-base superalloy, PWA 1480, developed for use as <b>single-crystal</b> <b>blades</b> and vanes in advanced gas turbines, has been assessed. Isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests up to 200 hours were conducted at 1323, 1410, and 1473 K. The alloy was evaluated as to sample weight change, type of scale formed, type and amount of spall, and microstructural changes. The oxidation attack was more severe in cyclic as compared with isothermal oxidation. Also, enormous growth of the gamma-prime precipitate was observed at 1423 K during cyclic oxidation...|$|R

40|$|Fretting fatigue is the {{phenomenon}} of combined contact and fatigue loads which may accelerate crack initiation and reduce the operational life of components. One of the most relevant problems of fretting fatigue occurs in the blade to disc assemblies, particularly those in the hot stages of gas turbines. The 'fir-tree' blade to disc assemblies in gas turbines operate at extreme conditions of loading and temperature, {{and the presence of}} multiple frictional contact points, often interacting with other stress concentrators, makes it an extremely challenging problems in solid mechanics. This thesis focus on two aspects of the problem found in 'fir-tree' assemblies: i) what is the impact of using <b>single-crystal</b> <b>blades</b> on the contact tractions and fretting fatigue behaviour; and ii) what is the effect of edge rounding on the contact tractions between the blade and disc?</p...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{extensive}} development work {{carried out in}} the 1990 's, gas turbine combined-cycle (GTCC) systems burning natural gas represent a reliable and efficient power generation technology widely used {{in many parts of the}} world. A critical factor was that, in order to operate at the high turbine entry temperatures required for high efficiency operation, aero-engine technology, i. e., <b>single-crystal</b> <b>blades,</b> thermal barrier coatings, and sophisticated cooling techniques had to be rapidly scaled up and introduced into these large gas turbines. The problems with reliability that resulted have been largely overcome, so that the high-efficiency GTCC power generation system is now a mature technology, capable of achieving high levels of availability. The high price of natural gas and concern about emission of greenhouse gases has focused attention on the desirability of replacing natural gas with gas derived from coal (syngas) in these gas turbine systems, since typical systems analyses indicate that IGCC plants have some potential to fulfil the requirement for a zero-emissions power generation system. In this review, the current status of materials for the critical hot gas path parts in large gas turbines is briefly considered in the context of the need to burn syngas. A critical factor is that the syngas is a low-Btu fuel, and the higher mass flow compared to natural gas will tend to increase the power output of the engine. However, modifications to the turbine and to the combustion system also will be necessary. It will be shown that many of the materials used in current engines will also be applicable to units burning syngas but, since the combustion environment will contain a greater level of impurities (especially sulfur, water vapor, and particulates), the durability of some components may be prejudiced. Consequently, some effort will be needed to develop improved coatings to resist attack by sulfur-containing compounds, and also erosion...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} rapid solidification {{technology for}} processing reactive and refractory alloys, utilized to produce {{large quantities of}} melt-spun filaments of NiAl, is presented. The melt-spun filaments are pulverized to fine particle sizes, and subsequently consolidated by hot extrusion or hot isostatic pressing. Rapid solidification process gives rise to very fine-grained microstructures. However, exposure to elevated temperature during hot consolidation leads to grain growth. Alloying agents such as borides, carbides, and tungsten can pin the grain boundaries and retard the grain growth. Various alloy compositions are investigated. The eventual goal is to utilize the hot-extruded and forged stock to grow <b>single-crystal</b> NiAl <b>blades</b> for advanced gas-turbine engine applications. Single-crystal NiAl, containing a uniform dispersion of carbide strengthening precipitates, is expected to lead to highly creep-resistant turbine blades, and is of considerable interest to the aerospace propulsion industry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of modern nickel-based superalloys evolution for casting single-crys-tal turbine blades was performed. The influence of rhenium {{as a new}} alloying element on the physicochemical, kinetic, and structural parameters of nickel-based superalloys and phase stability is discussed. The following experimental data are generalized: the coefficients of segregation and distribution of alloying elements in nickel-based superalloys γ- and γ′-phases, the influence of alloying elements on the melting temperature, γ- and γ′-phases crystal lattice parameters, diffusion rate of atoms and probability of topologically close-packed (TCP) phase formation. The principles of the balanced alloying and computerized de-sign method for developing fourth-generation single-crystal nickel-based superalloys with high Re content (9 – 10 %) are considered. The role of high gradient directional solidification (200 – 220 °Ccm– 1) in producing <b>single-crystal</b> turbine <b>blades</b> of nickel-based superalloys with high Re content is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Another way {{to improve}} {{efficiency}} {{is to increase the}} combustion temperature. This requires improved materials able to retain their strength at high temperature, and the development of engine cores has largely followed advances in the materials available, for example through the development of precision-made ceramic parts and <b>single-crystal</b> metal turbine <b>blades.</b> Rolls-Royce developed a carbon composite fan for the Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan but in the event found the material did not have sufficient damage tolerance and they reverted to the more conventional titanium metal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of cracks in <b>single-crystal</b> (SX) turbine <b>blades</b> is a common problem for aero-engines. If cracks are located under the tip-area, the blade-repair is not possible. Anew method to repair these cracks is to clad with single-crystal-technology. To reduce the loss of material and working time,notches are used to remove the affected crack zone. The usednotch geometries must be weldable and also permit the material solidification in the same oriented plane as the original microstructure. For that, a thermal gradient has to be introduced in order to guide the grain growth. The process characteristics of laser cladding, such as small local heat input and controlled material supply, make it an efficient process to fill the notch. However, there are challenges to achieve a SX structure without cracks and pores. The unstable energy distribution {{may result in a}} polycrystalline structure. Current achievements and further challenges are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{primary and secondary}} orientations on the elastic response of a hollow core, (001) -oriented nickel base <b>single-crystal</b> superalloy turbine <b>blade,</b> was investigated under combined thermal and mechanical conditions. Finite element techniques is employed through MARC finite element code to conduct the analyses on a hollow core SSME turbine blade made out of PWA 1480 single crystal material. Primary orientation of the single crystal superalloy was varied in increments of 2 deg, from 0 to 10 deg, from the (001) direction. Two secondary orientations (0 and 45 deg) were considered {{with respect to the}} global coordinate system, as the primary orientation angle was varied. The stresses developed within the single crystal blade were determined for different orientations of the blade. The {{influence of}} angular offsets such as the single crystal's primary and secondary orientations and the loading conditions on the elastic stress response of the PWA 1480 hollow blade are summarized. The influence of he primary orientation angle, when constrained between the bounds considered, was not found to be as significant as the influence of the secondary orientation angle...|$|R
