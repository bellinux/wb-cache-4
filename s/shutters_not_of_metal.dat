Expelled plastic as bars, pieces, pellets, poles, sheets and tubes for utilization in assembling; extended plastic pellets for bundling; elastic plugs; protecting materials; and adaptable pipes <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Also, the DURA-GRADE fill is made of injected polypropylene grids, connected by clasps, making blocks of excellent mechanical resistance. The peculiar configuration causes water to whirlpool, maximizing the thermal exchange with extraordinary resistance against solids retention. It is recommended for treated waters, with high concentration of solids and without the presence of oils and/or organic materials. It is possible to perfectly clean them using low pressure water.|$|R

60|$|Our next {{visit was}} to the church which stands close by, and is quite as ancient as the {{remnants}} of the castle. In a chapel or side-aisle, dedicated to the Harcourts, are found some very interesting family monuments,--and among them, recumbent on a tombstone, the figure of an armed knight of the Lancastrian party, who was slain in the Wars of the Roses. His features, dress, and armor are painted in colors, still wonderfully fresh, and there still blushes the symbol of the Red Rose, denoting the faction for which he fought and died. His head rests on a marble or alabaster helmet; and on the tomb lies the veritable helmet, it is to be presumed, which he wore in battle,--a ponderous iron ease, with the visor complete, and remnants of the gilding that once covered it. The crest is a large peacock, <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> but <b>of</b> wood.|$|R

25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{windows on}} the south, east, north wing of the east wall, the west wall, and all walls in the north wing are similar. They consist of two rectangular, facing guillotine sashed windows covered by heavy wooden shutters painted dark green and fixed with wrought iron H or H-L hinges. The <b>shutters</b> are <b>not</b> <b>of</b> colonial origin. The east façade had two window openings: a large rectangular one that is 9 feet wide and 8’ 2” high with 16 over 16 glass panes and a circular window above it with an inner section in quarters and an outer section in eighths. The circular window, in particular, is of uncertain authenticity as it is claimed that until restorations in 1930 it contained not the present type of window but either plastered over stone and rubble or a millstone. All of the other windows have 12 over 12 glass panes. The single south window is 7’ 2” wide and 8 feet high white the north wing has two smaller windows on its east and west walls and another on its north face. The frames for all the windows are flat with painted wood. The wooden, bottom sill projects slightly from the frame. All have brick sills with ovolo cast bricks marking them.|$|R

Though Elend's music is <b>not</b> any form <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> Elend's members are associated with numerous metal acts and the metal record label Holy Records, and their harsh sound has led to Elend's music being embraced by a metal-listening audience.|$|R
5000|$|An {{eddy current}} brake {{consists}} of a conductive piece <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> either a straight bar or a disk, which moves through the magnetic field of a magnet, either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. When it moves past the stationary magnet, the magnet exerts a drag force on the metal which opposes its motion, due to circular electric currents called eddy currents induced in the metal by the magnetic field. Note that the conductive sheet is <b>not</b> made <b>of</b> ferromagnetic <b>metal</b> such as iron or steel; usually copper or aluminum are used, which are not attracted to a magnet. The brake does not work by the simple attraction <b>of</b> a ferromagnetic <b>metal</b> to the magnet.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} deity is Lord Vishnu. One of the {{key features}} of the temple is that the original idols in the sanctum sanctorum were <b>not</b> made <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> or stone, but of a rare combination of more than 70 medicinal materials called `kadu-sharkara-yogam.' These idols were replaced by panchaloha metals in 1972. They were donated by Kaanchi Kaamakoti Mathaadhipathi His Holiness Jayendra Saraswathy Thiruvatikal. Efforts are going on now to reinstall the idols made with `kadu-sharkara-yogam.' The Lord Vishnu idol is in a sitting pose over a five-hooded serpent king Lord Anantha.

6000|$|For linen corslets, such as Homer mentions, {{in actual}} use and {{represented}} in {{works of art}} we consult Mr. Leaf on The Armour of Homeric Heroes.' He finds Memnon in a white corslet, on a black-figured vase in the British Museum. There is another white corsleted [Footnote: Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. iv. pp. 82, 83, 85.] Memnon figured in the Vases Peints of the Duc de Luynes (plate xii.). Mr. Leaf suggests that the white colour represents [...] "a corslet <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> but <b>of</b> linen," [...] and cites Iliad, II. 529, 5 30. [...] "Xenophon mentions linen corslets as being worn by the Chalybes" [...] (Anabasis, iv. 15). Two linen corslets, sent from Egypt to Sparta by King Amasis, are recorded by Herodotus (ii. 182; iii. 47). The corslets were of linen, embroidered in cotton and gold. Such a piece of armour or attire might easily develop into the [Greek: streptos chitoon] of Iliad, V. 113, in which Aristarchus appears to have recognised chain or scale armour; but we find no such object represented in Mycenaean art, which, <b>of</b> course, does <b>not</b> depict Homeric armour or costume, and it seems probable that the bronze corslets mentioned by Homer were plate armour. The linen corslet lasted into the early sixth century B.C. In the poem called Stasiotica, Alcaeus (No. 5) speaks of his helmets, bronze greaves and corslets of linen ([Choorakes te neoi linoo]) as a defence against arrows.|$|R

To do so, we propose an operational definition for the sustainable extraction rate <b>of</b> <b>metals.</b> We have divided 42 metals in 4 groups according to their geologic scarcity. Applying the proposed sustainability definition to the 17 scarcest metals, shows that for almost all considered metals the global consumption of primary resources needs to be reduced to stay within sustainable limits as defined in our analysis.
