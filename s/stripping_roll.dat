VisualNastran 4 D software of the finite element analysis was used for computer modelling of the longitudinal cold rolling process of the strip and it was calculated the stressstrain state and the vibration of the heavy-duty elements of the longitudinal-wedge mill (LWM) with bearings stands and without the bearings stands. As a result of modelling it was established that <b>strips,</b> <b>rolled</b> in the LWM without bearings stands, have longitudinal and transverse flatness, that is the consequence of the working rolls vibration. It was shown that <b>strips,</b> <b>rolled</b> in the LWM with the bearings stands, have not got any wavy surface. It was proved that during rolling in LWM the dangerous vibrations do not fall into the working space of the external loads, therefore construction of the new mill is good enough, {{in terms of strength}} at the vibrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of magnesium strips, {{based on a}} twin-roll casting (TRC) and Hot <b>Strip</b> <b>Rolling,</b> has a promising application especially in automobile industry. Recently, the TRC line extends by further rolling mills to produce strips with fewer thicknesses. The additional rolling requires re-heating of the TRC strip coil to improve the deformation properties. The heating process affects the microstructure and final properties of the strips. Therefore, {{it is important to}} control the heat treatment process. The aim {{of this study is to}} create a bundle of models to calculate the temperature development in process of magnesium strip production. The first model calculates the temperature distribution in the TRC magnesium coils during pre-heating process and after rolling.

30|$|Shape {{quality was}} {{improved}} by optimizing the emulsion flux {{of the process}} cooling and multi-zone cooling [62]. The steel-sticking phenomenon caused by the bad shape of the strip head was avoided by optimizing the roll-bending force [63]. Shape control difficulty was reduced by optimizing the strip elongation rate of the temper mill [64]. The shape quality, mechanical properties, and surface roughness of a <b>strip</b> <b>rolled</b> by a cold rolling mill were guaranteed by optimizing the rolling force and tension [65]. Comprehensive improvement of strip shape and surface quality could also be realized by optimizing the rolling force, strip elongation rate, and tension [66]. Under the premise of ensuring good strip shape, the flux, concentration, and temperature of the emulsion were optimized to prevent slipping and thermal scratching between the <b>strip</b> and <b>rolls</b> [67]. As a result, the cleaning degree of the strip surface is improved, and the emulsion consumption is reduced.|$|R

40|$|Centerline {{segregation}} {{occurs as}} a positive concentration of alloying elements in the mid-thickness region of continuously cast slab. Depending upon its severity, it may affect mechanical properties and potentially downstream processing such as weldability, particularly for high-strength line pipe. The segregation fraction in continuously cast slabs and corresponding hot-rolled strips was assessed on API 5 L grade X 65 line pipe steels with different levels of segregation, rated as Mannesmann 2. 0 and 1. 4. The {{results showed that the}} segregation fraction in hot-rolled strip samples was in accordance with that assessed in the cast slabs, and the segregated regions in hot-rolled strip samples were found to be discontinuous. Transverse and z-direction CVN impact tests were conducted on the two strips and the results showed that centerline segregation does have an influence on the Charpy impact properties of line pipe steel. Specimens located at segregated regions exhibited lower Charpy impact toughness and <b>strips</b> <b>rolled</b> from slabs with higher segregation levels are more likely to exhibit greater variability in Charpy impact toughness. The influence of centerline segregation on z-direction Charpy impact toughness is more severe than on transverse Charpy impact toughness. Lower Charpy impact toughness and brittle fracture surface with cleavage facets along with rod-shaped MnS inclusions were observed for the <b>strip</b> <b>rolled</b> from slab with 2. 0 segregation rating if the Charpy specimens were located at segregated regions. The influence on Charpy impact toughness can be associated with the pearlite structure at the centerline and level of MnS inclusions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{ferritic}} rolling strategy {{allows for the}} production of two different hot strip grades, a "soft " and a "hard " hot strip. The "soft " hot <b>strip</b> is <b>rolled</b> in the upper ferrite region and a sufficiently high coiling temperature ensures direct recrystallisation in the coil. The "hard " hot <b>strip</b> is <b>rolled</b> at relatively lower temperatures in the ferrite temperature region and exhibits a strained microstructure with a desirable rolling texture. Furthermore, these ferritic <b>rolled</b> hot <b>strips</b> can be used as initial strip for subsequent cold rolling. The current investigation focuses {{on the development of the}} recrystalli-sation texture of cold rolled and annealed ferritic <b>rolled</b> hot <b>strip</b> for different cold reductions. For this purpose "soft " and "hard " hot strips were produced on a laboratory hot rolling mill. These <b>strips</b> were cold <b>rolled</b> with a total reduction of 40 to 80 % to a final thickness of 0. 5 mm. Subsequently the strips were subjected to simulated continuous annealing, using a salt bath furnace. The macro texture of both types of specimens was measured and correlated to the mechanical properties, including the Lankford values. A very different development of the recrystallisation texture and hence mechanical properties has been observed. However, both grades yielded improved deep-drawing properties...|$|R

For this purpose, a six channel FM-FM telemetry system was developed at N A L for measuring gear stresses using foil strain gauges. In the <b>Strip</b> <b>Rolling</b> Mill, the thickness of the sheet was depending on the roller load.

50|$|Spring clamps are {{typically}} {{made from a}} strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, {{and the other side}} a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the <b>strip</b> <b>rolled</b> to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the ring, and the clamp is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the barb. The hose is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the hose over the barb, then released, compressing the hose onto the barb. Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough clamping force, and be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive cooling system hoses several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.|$|R
