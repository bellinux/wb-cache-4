40|$|Covered {{bonds are}} a {{specific}} example of <b>senior</b> secured <b>debt.</b> If the issuer of the bonds defaults {{the proceeds of}} the assets in the cover pool are used for their debt service. If in this situation the cover pool proceeds do not suffice for the debt service, the creditors of the bonds have recourse to the issuer's assets and their claims are pari passu with {{the claims of the}} creditors of <b>senior</b> unsecured <b>debt.</b> Historically, covered bonds have been very safe investments. During their more than two hundred years of existence, investors never suffered losses due to missed payments from covered bonds. From a risk management perspective, therefore modelling covered bonds losses is mainly of interest for estimating the impact that the asset encumbrance by the cover pool has on the loss characteristics of the issuer's <b>senior</b> unsecured <b>debt.</b> We explore one-period structural modelling approaches for covered bonds and <b>senior</b> unsecured <b>debt</b> losses with one and two asset value variables respectively. Obviously, two-assets models with separate values of the cover pool and the issuer's remaining portfolio allow for more realistic modelling. However, we demonstrate that exact calibration of such models may be impossible. We also investigate a one-asset model in which the riskiness of the cover pool is reflected by a risk-based adjustment of the encumbrance ratio of the issuer's assets.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{relative}} seniority of debt and managerial compensation {{has important implications for}} the design of remuneration contracts. Whereas the traditional literature assumes that <b>debt</b> is <b>senior</b> to remuneration, there are in reality many cases in which remuneration contracts are de facto <b>senior</b> to <b>debt</b> claims in financially distressed firms and in workouts. We theoretically show that risky debt changes the incentive to provide the manager with performance-related incentives (a "contract substitution" effect). In other words, the relative degree of seniority of managers' claims and creditors' claims in case a bankruptcy procedure starts is crucial to determine the optimal incentive contract ex-ante. If managerial compensation is more <b>senior</b> than <b>debt,</b> higher leverage leads to lower power incentive schemes (lower bonuses and option grants) and a higher base salary. In contrast, when compensation is junior, we expect more emphasis on pay-for-performance incentives in highly-levered firms. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
