500|$|In the {{following}} verse, Lewis and Haynes are seen having several embraces, some joyful {{while others are}} more tense as Lewis is sad. The couple are then seen leaving the party; Haynes walks over to Lewis and attempts to kiss, but she proceeds to push him away. During the second airing of the chorus, more images of happy scenes between the couple are spliced with Lewis waking up in bed to find Haynes has slept on the sofa. More passionate embraces between the couple are seen before Lewis is seen breaking down in tears. At the breakfast that follows, the couple break {{into a series of}} arguments. Lewis shoves Haynes onto the sofa, and Haynes grabs Lewis as <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away.</b> Lewis then slaps Hayne around the face. During the middle eight breakdown in the song, [...] Haynes throws books from a shelf, and Lewis throws objects at Haynes including a cushion, as well as pushing over a lamp. Haynes subsequently leaves, driving away into the distance, and Lewis falls to the wall and breaks down in tears.|$|E
2500|$|Flutes (Captivity): The stage {{returns to}} the Archer's Den, where the Twin Brother is imprisoned in a small cage. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches from a distance, holding the flutes that the twins played before their lives were changed forever. All seems lost for the Twin Brother until he finds {{a friend in the}} kind-natured Chief Archer's Daughter, who dares to {{approach}} him. She passes the flutes to the Twin Brother, he begins to play and when she leans towards the cage for a closer look at him, he leans forward to steal a brief kiss. Although the Chief Archer's Daughter is taken aback, as <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> from the Twin Brother it is obvious that she has also become smitten by him. After their tender moment and after great hesitation, the Chief Archer's Daughter sets the Twin Brother free from his cage, begging him to flee. Before he does, the Twin Brother makes a decision [...] he returns to her his flutes, the precious ceremonial gifts that were treasured by their kingdom. The Twin Brother then escapes, leaving the Chief Archer's Daughter in hope they will meet again. She cannot hide her joy [...] she expresses her love through a touching performance of dance using the twins' flutes. All of this is secretly witnessed by the Counselor's Son, who has desired the Chief Archer's Daughter for years. Engulfed by rage and jelousy of his unrequited love, he prepares for war.|$|E
