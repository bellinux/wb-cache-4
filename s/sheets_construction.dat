We also establish a nearly power 1. 5 separation between quantum query complexity and subcube partition complexity, the first superlinear separation between the two measures. Lastly, we show a quadratic separation between quantum query complexity and one-sided subcube partition complexity. 	 Our query complexity separations use the recent cheat sheet framework of Aaronson, Ben-David, and Kothari.

[...] Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. [...] Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water filler caps were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. [...] The original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when water surges caused the welded joints to split.
