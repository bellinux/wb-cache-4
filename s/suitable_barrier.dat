40|$|Geomembranes {{are thin}} sheets of {{polymeric}} materials {{which have been}} widely used as linings and covers of containers for liquid or solid waste. In this research various types and thicknesses of geomembranes were evaluated in order to determine which geomembranes could be used as <b>suitable</b> <b>barriers</b> for radon. ^ The permeation of radioactive gases through geomembranes cannot be measured using the method described by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The ASTM method estimates the permeation of a single pure gas through a polymeric membrane. The radioactivity of radon would be very high if this method was used. The method developed in this study utilized radon permeation scintillation cell which consisted of a source chamber, a measuring chamber, a radium source, and a geomembrane specimen. The concentration of radon within the source chamber and the measuring chamber was quantified by counting the alpha particles emitted by the decay of radon and its daughters. Based on the percentage of radon permeation through the membranes (defined as the reduction factor), the permeance was calculated. ^ The data indicated that 0. 8 -mm thick geomembranes such as chlorinated polyethylene, polyurethane and ethylene interpolymer alloy provided a permeance that was less than 500 fmol m- 2 s- 1 Pa- 1. These geomembranes are <b>suitable</b> <b>barriers</b> for radon. The permeance of 0. 15 -mm polyethylene sheet, which {{has been used as a}} radon barrier, is 1. 47 × 104 fmol m- 2 s- 1 Pa- 1. ^ The effect of certain parameters on radon permeation was quantitatively studied. Such parameters included the difference in air pressure between the two sides of a geomembrane, the thickness of the geomembrane, and the temperature. It was found that a difference of 5 cm Hg in air pressure between the two sides of a geomembrane did not significantly influence the radon permeation. Radon permeation decreased exponentially with increasing thickness of the geomembranes. Radon permeation increased according to an exponential function as the temperature increased. The values measured for the activation energy for the permeation of radon through different geomembranes were between 26 and 110 kJ mol- 1. In studies of the effect of temperature on radon permeation our results showed that the values of the activation energies and the pre-exponential factors measured for radon through a wide range of geomembranes gave very good linear plots of the activation energies and the logarithm of the pre-exponential factors. This relationship implies that a general mechanism of permeation is utilized in all geomembranes studied, differing only in magnitude. ...|$|R
40|$|Branchcut methods {{represent}} an important class of phase unwrapping (PU) approaches in SAR interferometry (InSAR). Their main {{idea is to}} circumvent the problem of path dependency for {{the integration of the}} wrapped gradient of the wrapped interferometric phase by placing <b>suitable</b> <b>barriers</b> (branchcuts) to the possible integration paths in the image. In 1996 M. Costantini proposed to transform the problem of InSAR PU to a minimum cost flow (MCF) problem. The critical point of this new approach is to generate cost functions which represent the a priori knowledge necessary for phase unwrapping. Since many algorithms for generating cost functions from a priori knowledge have been proposed in the last years, it has become important to decide whether two given methods of computing cost functions lead to the same branchcut system on every interferogram. A formal tool to treat this problem mathematically are universal MCF-homomorphisms. Any mapping a from the space of cost functions into itself is called an universal MCF-homomorphism if every cost function c and its image /spl alpha/(c) have the same MCF solution and if /spl alpha/ can be defined separately for each arc. This paper presents the proof of the following mathematical theorem: The only existing universal MCF-homomorphisms are the componentwise multiplications with a fixed positive scalar...|$|R

Next, we consider the heat equation on a bounded domain with no-flow Neumann boundary conditions. We show that we can approximate the solution by writing the equation on all of R^n by introducing a convection term that pushes mass back inside the domain. As we take the strength of the convection to infinity, we obtain locally uniform convergence to the heat equation solution, with an optimal error rate.
