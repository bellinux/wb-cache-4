5000|$|A Patent with diagram (2006) (doesn't {{seem to say}} how brake <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> <b>disc</b> brakes {{are changed}} as well) ...|$|R
50|$|An {{incorrect}} explanation sometimes {{given for}} brake fade is heated brake shoes evaporate to generate gas that separate {{them from the}} drum. Such effects are easy to imagine, but physically impossible, due to the large volume of gas {{that would be required}} for such an effect. A gas bearing would need gas replenishment as fast as the <b>disc</b> <b>or</b> drum moves, since it has no gas on its surface as it approaches the pad <b>or</b> <b>shoe.</b> Also, <b>disc</b> brakes use much the same materials and operate well with little fade, even when the discs are glowing hot. If brake materials outgassed at drum temperatures, they would also outgas at disc temperatures and would fade substantially. Since discs have little fade, they also demonstrate outgassing is not a source of fade. Some disc brakes are drilled or slotted, but smooth discs show no more fade.|$|R
5000|$|Durability - Friction brakes have wear {{surfaces}} {{that must}} be renewed periodically. Wear surfaces include the brake <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> pads, and also the brake <b>disc</b> <b>or</b> drum. There may be tradeoffs, for example a wear surface that generates high peak force may also wear quickly.|$|R
