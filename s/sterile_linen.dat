40|$|Linen {{is one of}} {{the health}} {{supplies}} needed by the hospital in large quantities. The availability of clean and <b>sterile</b> <b>linen</b> {{is one of the}} supporting facilities for the health of hospitalized patients. To obtain clean linen is done through several processes, including cleaning, disinfection, washing, drying, and sterilization. Linen sterilization was carried out by steam sterilizer at 134 oC for 3 minutes, with the final result in wet conditions. In wet conditions the microbe is easy to grow, so it is necessary to do sterility testing. Therefore performed sterility test by direct inoculation method using cotton swab. Samples for the sterility test were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. Each was taken 4 samples. Replicated 3 times to ensure the accuracy of the results. Sterility test, fertility test and LAFC effectiveness test was performed to avoid the occurrence of false positives. As control of the implementation of aseptic technique, sterility test of cotton swab and wetting fluid was performed. As a guarantee that the sterilization process is running well, validation of sterilization process using physical, chemical and biological indicators. Growth media used is Fluid Thyoglycollate Medium to detect the presence of bacteria and Soybean Casein Digest Medium to detect the fungus. The results showed that the linen with wet end results can be guaranteed for sterility during storage until day 0, since the growth of fungus occurs on day 1 and bacterial growth occurs on day 2 during storage...|$|E
