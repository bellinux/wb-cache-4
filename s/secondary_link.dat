We consider a similar experiment as presented in [17], but unlike that work, we evaluate HetNets which include primary and secondary users. Secondary transmitters are restricted by a distance of 1, 000 m with respect to the secondary receiver.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we develop}} a switch and examine {{transmit}} diversity algorithm for spectrum sharing cognitive networks. We consider a cognitive network {{composed of a}} primary link that employs constant rate and constant power transmission scheme with automatic-and-repeat request (ARQ) protocol, while the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> is composed of a fixed power multiple-antenna secondary transmitter and a single antenna receiver. Our objective {{is to develop a}} low complex transmit diversity algorithm at the secondary transmitter that maximizes the performance of the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> in terms of the effective throughput while maintaining a predetermined maximum loss in the packet rate of the primary link. In achieving this objective, we develop an algorithm that selects the best antenna, which maintains the quality of the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> in terms of signal-to-noise ratio above a specific threshold, based on overhearing the acknowledgment (ACK) and negative acknowledgment (NACK) feedback messages transmitted over the primary link.

30|$|From Figure  7 a,b,c,d, the {{observation}} is as the SINR thresholds values increase, {{the number of}} secondary users that the HetNet admits to share a primary channel decreases. On the other hand, when the SINR thresholds values decrease, the HetNet can admit {{a greater number of}} secondary users but at the cost of sacrificing QoS. The above is also true, for the average number of selected <b>secondary</b> <b>links,</b> except for the cases of 20 secondary users and 25 secondary users.|$|R

30|$|From Figure  3, it {{is assumed}} that each <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> (transmitter-receiver pair) {{represents}} a secondary network or femtocell network. In this case, the secondary transmitter is able to assign a communication channel to its secondary receiver when it requests. Assuming that in an instant of time, the secondary transceiver does not have available channels to assign to its user, it can use its cognitive abilities to exploit any of the primary channels that are assigned to the primary network; so that a primary channel will be allocated to its requested secondary user. Under this situation, the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> can exploit concurrently with the primary link the channel, as long as a minimum distance is placed between them; so that the transmission of the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> does not interfere with the transmission of the primary link.|$|E
40|$|Spectrum sharing {{systems have}} been {{introduced}} to alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity by allowing secondary unlicensed networks to share the spectrum with primary licensed networks under acceptable interference levels to the primary users. In this paper, we develop interference-aware random beam selection schemes that provide enhanced throughput for the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> {{under the condition that}} the interference observed at the primary link is within a predetermined acceptable value. For a secondary transmitter equipped with multiple antennas, our schemes select a random beam, among a set of power- optimized orthogonal random beams, that maximizes the capacity of the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> while satisfying the interference constraint at the primary receiver for different levels of feedback information describing the interference level at the primary receiver. For the proposed schemes, we develop a statistical analysis for the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) statistics as well as the capacity of the <b>secondary</b> <b>link.</b> Finally, we present numerical results that study the effect of system parameters including number of beams and the maximum transmission power on the capacity of the <b>secondary</b> <b>link</b> attained using the proposed schemes. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E
