This unit is force divided by mass which is {{acceleration}} per Newton's second law. But one must multiply kilograms of force by g (gravity) to get force in the metric units of Newtons. So the specific force (the result) is the deceleration multiplied by a constant which is 1/g times a factor to account for the equivalent mass due to wheel rotation. Then this specific force in kgf/kg must be multiplied by 1000 to get kgf/tonne since a tonne is 1000 kg.|$|E

40|$|The {{sport of}} track cycling is an Olympic disciplined event, {{commonly}} {{classified as a}} sprint sport due to {{the high levels of}} maximal or repeated maximal sprints required during events ranging from 250 m to 30 km in length. A major determinant of sprint cycling performance is a rider’s ability to produce high levels of sustained power, regardless of event distance. As a result practitioners must ensure that mechanical and physiological components contributing to power are improved. This thesis sought to gain insight into the relationship between muscular strength and power capabilities of well trained sprint cyclists. From the literature review, significant improvements in force generating capability and muscle architecture characteristics were found as a result of externally loaded <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> Research had also reported that sport <b>specific</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> could elicit greater adaptations within trained individuals. Only one study had attempted to analyse the effects of traditional <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> and cycling <b>specific</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> on endurance based cyclists, with no reporting of sprint cyclists found. Study One of the thesis showed significant relationships between muscular force and maximal torque production at all tested pedalling velocities (r = 0. 890 - 0. 925), while muscular force and power production were found to not be significantly related. Study Two was conducted using well trained sprint cyclists and sought greater understanding on optimal training modalities. No substantial differences in the relationship of muscular force and maximal torque were found as a result of traditional gym based <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> (Effect size (ES) = 0. 06) or cycling <b>specific</b> isokinetic <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> (ES = - 0. 12). Additionally no worthwhile changes in maximal cycling power were found as a result of either traditional (ES = 0. 02) or isokinetic (ES = 0. 09) training modalities. It is suggested that the use of traditional and cycling <b>specific</b> strength <b>training</b> should be carried out regardless of training level, in order to elicit muscular adaptations and maintain sprint cycling performance...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the time-wise effect of <b>specific</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> on neck pain among industrial technicians with frequent neck pain symptoms. METHODS: Secondary {{analysis of a}} parallel-group cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 weeks performed at two large industrial production units in Copenhagen, Denmark. Women with neck pain > 30 mm VAS (N =  131) {{were included in the}} present analysis. The training group (N =  77) performed <b>specific</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> for the neck/shoulder muscles three times a week, and the control group (N =  54) received advice to stay active. Participants of both groups registered neck pain intensity (0 - 100 mm VAS) once a week. RESULTS: Neck pain intensity was 55 mm (SD 23) at baseline. There was a significant group by time interaction for neck pain (F-value 2. 61, P< 0. 001, DF =  19). Between-group differences in neck pain reached significance after 4 weeks (11 mm, 95 % CI 2 to 20). The time-wise change in pain showed three phases; a rapid decrease in the training group compared with the control group during the initial 7 weeks, a slower decrease in pain during the following weeks (week 8 - 15), and a plateau during the last weeks (week 16 - 20). Adherence to training followed a two-phase pattern, i. e. weekly participation rate was between 70 - 86 % during the initial 7 weeks, dropping towards 55 - 63 % during {{the latter half of the}} training period. CONCLUSION: Four weeks of <b>specific</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> reduced neck pain significantly, but 15 weeks is required to achieve maximal pain reduction. The time-wise change in pain followed a three-phase pattern with a rapid effect during the initial 7 weeks followed by a slower but still positive effect, and finally a plateau from week 15 and onwards. Decreased participation rate may explain the decreased efficacy during the latter phase of the intervention...|$|R

For novice (untrained individuals with no RT experience or who have not trained for several years) training, it is recommended that loads correspond to a repetition range of an 8 – 12 repetition maximum (RM).

There was no change in either strength or flexibility {{in the control group}} (p. 0. 05). <b>Resistance</b> <b>training</b> improved muscle strength either alone (114 %; effect size 5 0. 53; p, 0. 001) or in combination with flexibility training (116 %; effect size 5 0. 66; p 5 0. 032), but did not change flexibility (p 5 0. 610).

30|$|A hypoxic {{environment}} {{appears to}} create advantageous {{responses in the}} development of muscle performance with increased hypertrophy and gains in both muscle strength and speed of explosive movements. Despite the importance of <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> to performance, the muscle response under conditions of hypoxia has not been studied in detail. Very few studies have evaluated the effect of induced hypoxia on anaerobic and aerobic metabolism or the capacity for recovery from different work/rest ratios in repeated exercise training [6, 7], as used during <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> The combination of the load, sets, repetition of sets, rest, and speed of movement are key factors in understanding the physical and functional muscle changes derived from <b>specific</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> as well as the influence that “hypoxic conditions” could have on the results. For hypertrophy and strength gains, when looking for increased muscular cell swelling and metabolite accumulation, traditional methodology usually combines 6 – 12 sets of 8 – 12 repetitions at low velocity with loads of 65 – 80 % of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) and 1 – 3  min of rest in between sets [8, 9]. For muscle power <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> geared to a neuromuscular goal and avoiding metabolic fatigue, sessions usually combine 4 – 6 sets of 4 – 6 repetitions with loads of 0 – 50 % 1 RM for ballistic exercises [10] and 3 – 5  min of rest (sometimes this method includes inter-repetition rests of 10 – 60  s, cluster training).|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{improvements}} in sprinting, throwing, and jumping at altitude {{have been reported}} [1, 2, 5, 32].

However, although the underlying mechanisms are not completely defined, modified motor unit recruitment patterns due to increased anaerobic metabolism release [34, 35] could also partly explain these improvements.

30|$|Lower body {{strength}} is an underlying physical characteristic that affects force generation, thus influencing both injury prevention and power production in team sport athletes’ [33, 66 – 69]. Unfortunately, only one group [66] reported Elite AFL 1 RM back squat and one [33] reported Senior State 1 RM front squat as measures of lower body strength. No 1 RM strength measures in any lower body exercise were reported for junior and developing AF players. The absence of strength testing literature {{may relate to}} concerns regarding the safety and reliability of 1 RM testing in inexperienced athletes; however, the 1 RM back squat is a reliable measure provided to players who have had 6 – 12  months of familiarisation with the exercise [70, 71]. Tackling and fending off opponents during AF game play require upper body strength [25, 72]; however, the upper body strength literature was also limited. A gradual increase in bench press and bench pull measures was noted as players progress through the AFL participation pathway.
