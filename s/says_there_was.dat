5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E

25|$|The film {{makes his}} son a key theme, {{but in the}} book, Harrer does not mention his wife or son. He had in fact been married and divorced, as the film shows, but his ex-wife's new husband {{was killed in the}} war and Harrer's son was raised by his ex-wife's mother. In his autobiography, Harrer gives details of his contact with his son, but nothing to support what the film shows. In the book, Harrer <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little to tie him to home as {{one of the reasons for}} staying in Tibet and not {{returning}} to Europe.|$|E

25|$|According to a Hindu American Foundation report, {{the rights}} and {{religious}} freedom of Kashmiri Hindus have been severely curtailed since 1989, when there was an organised and systematic campaign by Islamist militants to cleanse Hindus from Kashmir. Less than 4,000 Kashmiri Hindus remain in the valley, reportedly living with daily threats of violence and terrorism. Sanjay Tickoo, who heads the KPSS, an organisation which looks after Pandits who remain in the Valley, says the situation is complex. On one hand the community did face intimidation and violence {{but on the other}} hand he <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no genocide or mass murder as suggested by Pandits who are based outside of Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} in the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that anything found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go {{and look for the}} device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} co-produced by Daniels's company, Lee Daniels Entertainment, and the Sarah Siegel-Magness and Gary Magness-owned Smokewood Entertainment Group. The two {{production}} companies had previously collaborated with Daniels on Tennessee (2008). Precious had, in total, thirteen producers: Daniels, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Heller, Tyler Perry, Lisa Cortes, Gary Magness, Valerie Hoffman, Asger Hussain, Mark G. Mathis, Andrew Sforzini, Bergen Swason, Simone Sheffield and Sarah Siegel-Magness. Initially, Daniels {{did not expect}} the movie to generate much buzz, expecting the movie {{to go straight to}} video, stating [...] "That it made it to the big screen <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an angel looking after me." [...] Principal photography (filming) for the film took place on location in various parts of New York City. Despite the dark subject matter, Sidibe has stated that the mood on the set was lighthearted, that [...] "Every day was a party" [...] and that the cast would frequently sing and tell jokes to [...] "lighten the atmosphere." [...] The production budget was $10million.|$|E

500|$|Dean Martin's song [...] "Naughty Lady of Shady Lane" [...] was {{the first}} to have a number-one in the Record Mirror chart but not to be awarded the top spot in NME 's chart. There are five more songs that, like Martin's, reached number-one on the Record Mirror chart but are not {{classified}} as number-one by the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, the Record Mirror and other charts differed about what they classified as the top song of the year. Record Mirror classified The Everly Brothers' [...] "All I Have to Do Is Dream"/"Claudette" [...] as the top single of 1958 while the UK Singles Chart best-selling single of that year was Elvis Presley's [...] "Jailhouse Rock". Furthermore, despite never reaching number-one, Pat Boone's [...] "Love Letters in the Sand" [...] was classified by Record Mirror as the best-selling song of 1957; the song entered the chart at number eleven on 13 July and, later, charted in the top three positions for 9 consecutive weeks. This is because the top lists for the whole year, were based on a points system. It has to be noted that Tony Jasper's Top 20 book (which takes info from Record Mirror) does actually fall into mistakes between August & December 1958, as Tony <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no chart for the first week of August, but there was. The charts he prints for 9th Aug onwards are all dated wrongly. The 9th Aug is the 2nd Aug, the 16th is the 9th & so on until 27th Dec 1958, when the dated chart for 27th is actually 20th Dec. He then fails to print the 27th Dec chart. From 1959, he gets it correct again. Though through this mistake, he misses a top 20 entry by Martinas & His Orchestra [...] "Cha Cha Momma Brown", which sneaked into the chart at #18 at the end of December 1958, & then quickly fell out again.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Henry Reynolds <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a {{widespread}} call from settlers during the frontier wars for the [...] "extirpation" [...] or [...] "extermination" [...] of the Aboriginal people. But he has {{contended that the}} British government acted {{as a source of}} restraint on settlers' actions. Reynolds says there is no evidence the British government deliberately planned the wholesale destruction of indigenous Tasmanians—a November 1830 letter to Arthur by Sir George Murray warned that the extinction of the race would leave [...] "an indelible stain upon the character of the British Government"—and therefore what eventuated does not meet the definition of genocide codified in the 1948 United Nations convention. He says Arthur was determined to defeat the Aboriginal people and take their land, but believes there is little evidence he had aims beyond that objective and wished to destroy the Tasmanian race.|$|E

[...] However, once Romney took up the challenge, his stake in success became enormous, and his reputation would have been diminished if Bain & Company went bankrupt. [...] He proceeded to apply the [...] "Bain way" [...] to Bain & Company itself.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} abortion {{was performed in}} the classical world, but there is disagreement about {{the frequency with which}} abortion was performed and which cultures influenced early Christian thought on abortion. Some writers point to the Hippocratic Oath as evidence that condemnation of abortion was not a novelty introduced by the early Christians. Some writers state that there is evidence that some early Christians believed, as the Greeks did, in delayed ensoulment, or that a fetus does not have a soul until quickening, and therefore early abortion was not murder; Luker <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> disagreement on whether early abortion was wrong. Other writers say that early Christians considered abortion a sin even before ensoulment. According to some, the magnitude of the sin was, for the early Christians, on a level with general sexual immorality or other lapses; according to others, they saw it as [...] "an evil no less severe and social than oppression of the poor and needy".|$|E

2500|$|According to BJ Terwiel, {{there are}} ten {{different}} {{accounts of the}} battle by indigenous, European and Persian authors: (four Siamese, one Burmese, four late 16th and early 17th century European accounts and late 17th century one Persian account). Only the Siamese royal chronicle account <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a formal elephant duel between Naresuan and Swa. Per Terwiel's analysis of the ten accounts, Swa and Naresuan both fought on their war elephant in the battle but no formal duel probably ever took place. According to Terwiel, {{it is highly unlikely}} that Swa would have agreed to a formal duel since agreeing to do so would have [...] "jeopardized the costly invasion that had thus far progressed without a hitch." [...] During the battle, Naresuan's elephant got surrounded by the Burmese forces. During that crucial moment, a Burmese war elephant went musth, and attacked Swa's elephant. Seeing that Swa was in difficulty, Naresuan [...] "closed in, and he (or one of the warriors riding with him, maybe a Portuguese) fired a gun which mortally wounded the crown prince" [...] Swa. Naresuan was [...] "lucky to escape from a very dangerous situation" [...] but also quick to take advantage of it. According to Terwiel, the [...] "Burmese and European accounts stayed closer to what actually may have happened", and [...] "Naresuan's much repeated challenge to hold a duel, even though it looms large in many Thai history books, should be relegated to a legendary tale." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nik Wallenda {{was born}} in Sarasota, Florida, on January 24, 1979, to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer. At age two, his parents bought him a swing set. [...] Before Troffer had even {{finished}} assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. [...] "And he did it perfectly," [...] Troffer recalls. [...] "I didn't teach him that." [...] Around the same time, he began performing {{with his family in}} their circus act. Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. [...] He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. [...] Wallenda's parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. [...] He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. [...] However, Wallenda <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> never any family pressure to become a circus performer.|$|E
