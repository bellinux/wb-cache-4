5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it from the window. He {{never had a chance to}} drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, {{and over the}} fences of the mansion) <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although {{this may have been}} justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
5|$|In Tarner Park, {{an area of}} {{open space}} formed from part of number 1 Tilbury Place's grounds, there is a {{circular}} tower which {{is believed to have}} been built by Edward Tilbury Tarner (son of the original occupants Edward and Laetitia Tarner) as an observation tower <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> ships in the English Channel. The mid-19th-century structure has two storeys and about 70 steps; the upper level is recessed and has a walkway around it. The walls are of knapped flint with some brick and stonework. Part of an iron weather vane remains at the top. Both storeys have segmental-arched entrances, but these are now closed. The structure is in good condition but has some missing flints.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 1876, Hickok {{was playing}} poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened {{up at the}} table, a drunk man named Jack McCall sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok {{encouraged}} McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Though McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted. The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat {{with his back to}} a wall <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him twice, but Rich refused.|$|E
25|$|The book rose to #84 on the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bestseller lists in June 2011 {{shortly after}} its title was announced. Green promised that every pre-order would be hand-signed by him, {{requiring}} {{him to sign}} every copy of the first printing. He proposed that the general public vote on the color Sharpie he would use to sign the books, resulting in him signing the 150,000 books {{with a variety of}} Sharpie colors, each in proportion to the amount of votes received for that color. However, some people who ordered from international booksellers received unsigned copies because those bookstores, including Amazon UK, underestimated how many books they needed and ordered more after the signing was complete, but Green agreed to fix this problem, telling people with unsigned pre-orders to email him so they could be sent a signed bookplate. Many fans submitted their book cover designs to various outlets including Tumblr and Twitter, tagging Green in these posts <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them. The sizeable number of posts received has prompted Green's publisher Penguin to seek a fan-designed cover for a reprint of one of Green's other books, An Abundance of Katherines. The Fault in Our Stars debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Chapter Books and remained in that spot for seven consecutive weeks. A Hebrew edition of The Fault in Our Stars was published in Israel in August 2012 and more editions of the novel are forthcoming in Dutch, German, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Chinese, and Portuguese. The Fault in Our Stars has also gained places on several bestseller lists. It was #1 on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, #1 on the Indiebound bestseller list, and #9 on The Bookseller bestseller list. The novel was also The New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice. As of January 2013, there are nearly 1 million copies of the novel in print. In December 2012, it was announced that a special edition with a silver cover and an expanded Q, dubbed the 'Exclusive Collector's Edition', would be available from Barnes and Noble. All or at least most of the copies first available for purchase of this edition of the book contained a printing error wherein several pages of the first chapter were replaced with pages from the Q section {{at the back of the}} book.|$|E
500|$|Back at the [...] "Hanoi Hilton" [...] from November 1971 onward, McCain and {{the other}} POWs cheered the resumed bombing of the north {{starting}} in April 1972, whose targets included the Hanoi area and whose daily orders were issued by Jack McCain, knowing his son was in the vicinity. Jack McCain's tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972, despite his desire to have it extended <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the war to its conclusion. The old-time POWs cheered even more during the intense [...] "Christmas Bombing" [...] campaign of December 1972, when Hanoi was subjected {{for the first time}} to repeated B-52 Stratofortress raids. Although its explosions lit the night sky and shook the walls of the camp, scaring some of the newer POWs, most saw it as a forceful measure to compel North Vietnam to finally come to terms.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Dylan {{arrives in}} Genoa City, having survived {{the war and}} wanting to make sure Avery is happy. He runs into Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), Nick's ex-wife who gives him {{directions}} to Nick's club, The Underground. While posing under the name [...] "Mack", Dylan gets a job as bartender at The Underground, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Avery from afar. During The Underground's opening night, Avery sees a rock which she gave to Dylan years ago sitting on the bar. She later goes to the basement and comes {{face to face with}} Dylan. In a state of confusion, shock and disbelief, Avery hides her emotions when Nick closely follows. Later, she confronts Dylan at his apartment, angry for not telling her he was alive earlier. She tells Nick about this, who fires Dylan. Despite spending a friendly night with Dylan, Avery chooses to remain with Nick, leaving Dylan shattered.|$|E

60|$|A {{minute after}} the last of Lew Flapp's crowd left the hermit's den Dick leaped to his feet, went to the doorway, and listened intently. It was quite dark, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> little or nothing.|$|E
60|$|This {{was soon}} done, and Walter seizing the bar, hauled himself up <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through the loophole.|$|R
6000|$|... “O, famously,” said Rollo. “There is the tally,” said he, {{turning up}} the side of the {{wheelbarrow}} towards his father, <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all the marks.|$|R
60|$|Stimson got a light, {{and when}} he had {{released}} and picketed the plunging horse, held it <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his prisoner. Then he nodded with evident contentment.|$|R
60|$|The Guardian {{unlocked}} {{a closet}} and took from it a white robe, which the soldier threw over Ojo. It covered him {{from head to}} foot, but had two holes {{just in front of}} his eyes, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> where to go. In this attire the boy presented a very quaint appearance.|$|E
60|$|The Nome King {{had left}} his throne and pressed through his warriors to the front ranks, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what was going on; but as he faced Ozma and her friends the Scarecrow, as if aroused to action by the valor of the private, drew one of Billina's eggs from his right jacket pocket and hurled it {{straight}} at the little monarch's head.|$|E
60|$|While Andy and Pepper {{were doing}} their best to get the sapling out of the snow and drag it over the ice, Jack circled the spot where the Rosebud was drifting. The iceboat was now within ten feet of the ice, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Coulter quite plainly. The poor fellow had been ducked in the water and was shaking from head to feet from cold.|$|E
60|$|He ran to {{the door}} in {{question}} and pushed upon it. It gave way, and with caution he entered the building. All was <b>so</b> dark <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> absolutely nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah,"--and Carrie {{moved her}} head <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the sparkle in her eyes--"you have heard those tales, and {{believed}} them--about {{a relative of}} mine. Presumably, you have heard nothing about Captain Heaton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom, who had hastily {{placed his}} father in a chair, <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the Eddystone, seized his hat, and exclaiming, [...] "I'll go and see, my dear," [...] ran out and {{proceeded}} to the shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{not agree}} again? You'll not set another day?" [...] demanded Moore, passionately. He {{strained}} her to him, yet held her <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her face, thus dominating her with both strength and will. His face was corded now, and darkly flushed. His jaw quivered. [...] "You'll never marry Jack Belllounds! You'll not let sudden impulse--sudden persuasion or force change you? Promise! Swear you'll never marry him. Swear!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} room, and {{hurried into the}} hall and out of the house; but as he did <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he was watched by Lady Fitzgerald. She was on the alert to go to her husband as soon as she should know that he was alone. Of what then took place between those two we need say nothing, but will wander forth for a while with Mr. Prendergast into the wide-spreading park.|$|E
60|$|Snap {{was a good}} swimmer, but {{the object}} out on the lake was further away than he had calculated, and it took him fully five minutes {{to get in the}} {{vicinity}} of it. The sky had clouded over a bit, hiding the stars, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> little or nothing on the water. On the shore he could see the two torches that the doctor's son was waving and that was all.|$|E
60|$|That fearlessly frank {{confession}} silenced him. He {{happened to}} be sitting opposite to the glass, <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his face. The poor wretch abruptly moved his chair, so as to turn his back on it.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{was willing}} to do his share of the work, and all the more <b>so</b> because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that Abner, from his cosy seat under the bushes, was deeply {{interested}} in all that was going on.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time the fair-haired little tourist, who had been dragged so submissively into their midst, {{suffered}} a gleam of intelligence to appear in his face. He changed his position <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his captor better.|$|R
60|$|But even <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a {{good deal}} of hard wornness under her satisfaction. She had had her suffering, sure enough. But none the less, she was in the main satisfied. She sat there, a good hostess, and {{expected}} the homage due to her success. And of course she got it. Aaron himself did his little share of shoe-licking, and swallowed the taste of boot-polish with a grimace, knowing what he was about.|$|E
60|$|He {{come back}} about ten {{a little bit}} uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no {{occasion}} to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this one turn {{up in the morning}} all sound and right. So she had to be satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, {{that struck}} him just right, {{and for the}} life of him he couldn't help turning his head to look at it, though, between you and me, it wasn't {{anything}} extra {{in the way of a}} tail; except for the size, Cheeko had a better one--more bushy and with much finer hair. Young Mr. Fox took all I said in sober earnest and began waving that fly-brush of his to and fro <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it the more plainly and then was come the time I'd been playing for! ...|$|E
60|$|Anthea, <b>so</b> far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> did {{not notice}} this, and {{it was she who}} spoke first.|$|R

60|$|The {{sight of}} her face seemed to have given the artist an idea. Propping his door open, he brought an easel and canvas, and setting them <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the corner where she had gone in, began to sketch.|$|R
