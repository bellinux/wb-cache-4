500|$|The South China Morning Post {{praised the}} game's formula, noting that it {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing to SimCity 2000, the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the [...] "homely" [...] feeling of SimTower, in contrast with other Sim games such as SimEarth and SimLife, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly praised the game and commented that it is [...] "more fun than [...] sounds". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: [...] "There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, SimTower <b>sees</b> <b>you</b> standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all." [...] Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that SimTower had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game 4 stars out of 5.|$|E

2500|$|Once there, Jill seduces Alan {{and the two}} undress {{and attempt}} to have sex. However, Alan breaks this off when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath, which he decides {{is the reason for}} his {{inability}} to get an erection. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill dresses and walks out of the stables, the still nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness, as he sees the horses as God-like figures. [...] "Mine!...You're mine!...I am yours and you are mine!" [...] cries Equus through Dysart's voice, but then he becomes threatening: [...] "The Lord thy God is a jealous God," [...] Equus/Dysart seethes, [...] "He <b>sees</b> <b>you,</b> he <b>sees</b> <b>you</b> forever and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!" [...] Alan screams, [...] "God sees!" [...] and then he says [...] "No more. No more, Equus!"

2500|$|As {{noted by}} {{literary}} critic Dumitru Hîncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments. He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: [...] "Iorga is jealous that he <b>sees</b> <b>you</b> {{coming over to}} visit with us." [...] Tzigara was still an art columnist for Convorbiri Literare, and, in 1921, became its new editor in chief. According to ASTRA's newspaper, Transilvania, Tzigara rescued Convorbiri from bankruptcy, but only catered to a niche audience. He was thus unable to steer the magazine back into the cultural mainstream, its previous dominance replicated by the left-wing Viața Românească.|$|E
