40|$|We {{examine the}} pricing of {{aggregate}} volatility {{risk in the}} cross-section of <b>stock</b> returns. Consistent <b>with</b> theory, we find that <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility have low average returns. In addition, we find that <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama and French (1993) model have abysmally low average returns. This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average returns of <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high idiosyncratic volatility. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the speed of price adjustment and stock ownership by foreign and local institutional investors using data from the Korean stock market. We show that returns of <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high foreign institutional ownership lead returns of <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> low foreign institutional ownership, especially after foreign ownership restriction is lifted. Likewise, returns of <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high local institutional ownership lead returns of <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> low local institutional ownership. These results support the idea that foreign institutional (local institutional) investors have faster access to or processing power of new information than local institutional (local individual) investors.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to reconcile two papers that provide contradictory {{findings on the}} cross-sectional relation between news coverage and expected stock returns. I first identify elements of their research designs that {{may be responsible for}} their discrepancies and then directly examine the existence of news coverage premium using Ravenpack data. I find that <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> little news coverage earn higher returns than <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high news coverage even after controlling for well-known risk factors, but <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> zero news coverage do not seem to outperform <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high news coverage. My findings suggest that the news coverage premium may be sensitive to the time period of the analyses as well as the presence of market crashes...|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{theoretical}} {{limitations of the}} price-book ratio, academic research has persistently shown that <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> low price-book ratios persistently outperform <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high price-book ratios. Fama and French incorporated a price-book term in their influential three factor model. Penman Richardson and Tuna (2013) show how the ratio can be decomposed into financing and operating components. Foye and Mramor (2016) show that while <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> low price-book ratios normally outperform, the ratios decomposed elements exhibit a different relationship with returns in different countries, implying that the price-book ratio may have a country-specific interpretation.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between stock returns and the implied volatility smile slope of call and put options. <b>Stocks</b> <b>with</b> a steeper put slope earn lower future returns, while <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> a steeper call slope earn higher future returns. Using dispersion of opinion {{as a proxy for}} belief differences, we find that the slope-stock return relation is strongest for <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high belief differences. The idiosyncratic component of the put slope fully explains the negative risk-adjusted stock returns. For the call slope, the idiosyncratic component dominates the systematic one, and explains the positive risk-adjusted returns...|$|R
5|$|Briar Creek Reservoir {{is located}} in the Briar Creek watershed, on East Branch Briar Creek. It is owned by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Columbia County. It was {{originally}} constructed to control floods, but most recreational activities in the watershed take place at this lake. These include fishing, picnicking, and weddings. There are also Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed. The waters of Briar Creek are approved trout waters and the stream is <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> trout.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 207 {{are located}} in the southeastern part of the Solomon Creek Watershed. They take up 6.7% of the watershed. Parts of Pinchot State Forest are also in the watershed; the forest {{occupies}} 12.6% of it. Two of the trails in the 139-acre Sugar Notch Trail System {{are located in}} the sub-watershed of Sugar Notch Run. The creek is <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> trout in some places. There are ATV trails in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is located}} in the south east part of the park. Fishing is {{permitted}} in the lake, which is <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> large mouth bass, crappie, bream, and catfish. A 2002 renovation of the lake added a new bridge connecting the two bodies of water and three fishing piers located around the lake.|$|E
40|$|Do <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> faster growth {{potential}} exhibit superior average returns? Exploiting a parameterized equity-valuation model, we analytically solve for the expected rate of return. We develop theoretical restrictions under which growth outlook induces a higher expected rate of return. Empirically, {{we find that}} in certain cyclical segments of the market, <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> higher (ex-ante) growth expectation perform better than their slower growing counterparts. Growth outlook also enhances the profitability of momentum strategies: Winners with accelerated earnings {{growth potential}} experience superior returns compared to winners with sluggish growth potential. Controlling for cross-sectional movements in earnings yield, higher growth outlook stocks {{tend to have more}} pronounced average returns. Intriguingly, small-cap <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> low growth outlook outperform small-cap <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high growth outlook. Growth outlook has investment value beyond traditional strategy drivers (momentum, value and size) ...|$|R

5|$|Fishing is {{permitted}} {{at the state}} park, though anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek. This has been designated as approved trout waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, which means the waters will be <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> trout and may be fished during trout season. Other species of fish found in Pine Creek include smallmouth bass and some panfish. Several small trout streams are accessible from within the park, which had 2,597anglers in 2003. Historically, fishermen of note on the stretch of Pine Creek in the park include President Theodore Roosevelt and Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone.|$|E

IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE VOLATILITY OF STOCK RETURNS varies over time. While considerable research has examined the time-series relation between the volatility {{of the market and}} the expected return on the market (see, among others, Campbell and Hentschel (1992) and Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993)), the question of how aggregate volatility affects the cross-section of expected stoc...|$|R

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek was {{historically}} <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> trout {{from near}} the border between Columbia County and Schuylkill County downstream {{to the mouth of}} the creek. The creek was surveyed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission nine times between 1939 and 1985. The first survey was performed in 1936. This {{was the first time that}} the creek was recommended for trout stocking. The creek was also surveyed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission several times in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|Sulphur Creek Reservoir is {{the primary}} {{recreational}} facility in the watershed and {{is said to be}} one of the largest fisheries of Southern Orange County. The lake is annually <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> bluegill, catfish, and bass. Aside from the reservoir, there is no body of water in the watershed that is navigable. There are several other parks in the watershed; these are Crown Valley Park, Sulphur Creek Park, and others. A paved trail follows Sulphur Creek from near the terminus of Crown Valley Park to near its mouth at Alicia Parkway.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between ownership structure (or number of financial analysts following) and liquidity and trade informativeness. We find that insider ownership is negatively correlated with liquidity after controlling for price, volatility, trading volume, and market capitalization. In addition, <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> higher institutional ownership or larger number of financial analysts following have better liquidity. Furthermore, we find a <b>stock</b> <b>with</b> higher insider and institutional ownership has higher informativeness of trades. These results imply that there is more informed trading for <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> higher insider and institutional ownership, and market makers believe that insiders and institutional investors are informed traders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stocks</b> <b>with</b> greater {{downside}} risk, {{which is}} measured by higher correlations conditional on downside moves of the market, have higher returns. After controlling for the market beta, the size effect and the book-to-market effect, the average {{rate of return on}} <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> the greatest downside risk exceeds the average rate of return on <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> the least downside risk by 6. 55 % per annum. Downside risk is important for explaining the cross-section of expected returns. In particular of the profitability of investing in momentum strategies can be explained as compensation for bearing high exposure to downside risk. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stocks</b> <b>with</b> high {{sentiment}} betas {{are more}} sensitive to investor sentiment, with more subjective valuations. We contend that sentiment beta also captures the duration of mispricing. Accordingly, <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high (low) sentiment betas provide opportunities for momentum (contrarian) traders. We form hypothetical zero investment portfolios of high (low) sentiment betas stocks, and show that momentum profits decompose to reveal positive (negative) serial correlation of idiosyncratic returns, that contribute to momentum (contrarian) profits. Furthermore, actual mutual funds identified as momentum (contrarian) traders hold <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> higher (lower) sentiment betas. Additionally, funds adjust sentiment betas to enhance performance as sentiment changes...|$|R

After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point. Gibraltar's defenders were well <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Spanish position was untenable and on the morning of 4 August, the governor, Diego de Salinas, agreed to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E

After acquiring a book to learn what is needed to track the dragon to its lair, Rincewind searches the city for the various components needed to assemble a dragon detector and brings them back to the Archchancellor. After the Archancellor lets slip that the dragon's lair is <b>stocked</b> <b>with</b> gold, Rincewind snatches the dragon detector from him, searches the city, finds the lair, and takes all the gold within it. Just before he leaves, the dragon stops him and requests his aid in removing the brotherhood's hold upon her, claiming they are using her for evil and are planning to make her go on a major rampage.|$|E
