6000|$|Now, {{you know}} I told {{you in my}} fourth lecture, that the {{beginning}} of art was in getting our country clean and our people beautiful, and you supposed {{that to be a}} statement irrelevant to my subject; just as, at this moment, you perhaps think, I am quitting the great subject of this present lecture--the method of likeness-making--and letting myself branch into the discussion of what things we are to make likeness of. But you shall see hereafter that the method of imitating a beautiful thing must be different from the method of imitating an ugly one; and that, with the change in subject from what is dishonourable to what is honourable, there will be involved a parallel change in the management of tools, of lines, and of colours. So that before I can determine for you how you are to imitate, you must tell me what kind of face you wish to imitate. The best draughtsmen in the world could not draw this Apollo in ten scratches, though he can draw the self-made man. Still less this nobler Apollo of Ionian Greece, (Plate IX.) in which the incisions are softened into a harmony like that of Correggio's painting. So that you see the method itself,--the choice between black incision or fine sculpture, and perhaps, presently, the choice between colour or no colour, will depend on what you have to represent. Colour may be expedient for a glistening dolphin or a spotted fawn;--perhaps inexpedient for white Poseidon, and gleaming Dian. So that, before defining the laws of sculpture, I am compelled to ask you, what you mean to carve; and that, little as you think it, is asking you how you mean to live, and what the laws of your State are to be, for they determine those of your statue. You can only have this kind of face to study from, in the sort of state that produced it. And you will find that sort of state described {{in the beginning of the}} fourth book of the laws of Plato; as founded, for one thing, on the conviction that of all the evils that can happen to a <b>state,</b> <b>quantity</b> of money is the greatest! [Greek: meizon kakon, ôs epos eipein, polei ouden an gignoito, eis gennaiôn kai dikaiôn êthôn ktêsin], [...] "for, to speak shortly, no greater evil, matching each against each, can possibly happen to a city, as adverse to its forming just or generous character," [...] than its being full of silver and gold.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947, Kirkendall {{found that}} an inert marker set {{at a point in}} a binary alloy moves from the initial sate point after the {{diffusion}} treatment. [...] The phenomena are so called Kirkendall effect and it was considered that we cannot understand it from the existing theory of binary interdiffusion in those days. As a result, a new concept of intrinsic diffusion was then introduced for understanding the Kirkendall effect in the interdiffusion problems. Based on the intrinsic diffusion concept, Darken derived a relation between an interdiffusion coefficient and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in a binary interdiffusion in 1948. At present, however, it is revealed that the so-called Darken equation itself is mathematically wrong in the derivation process. Although the concentration of diffusion particles is a real quantity in physics, the temperature is a thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>quantity.</b> As far as the shape of heat conduction material is unchangeable during a thermal treatment, the coordinate system of heat equation set in a material is a fixed one, since the coordinate system is not influenced by variations of the material internal structure. On the other hand, strictly speaking, the coordinate system of diffusion equation set in the diffusion field (solvent) is a moving one, since the origin of coordinate system is generally influenced by such variations.|$|E

However, the magnitudes of the stable <b>state</b> <b>quantities</b> are small, and can become even smaller when taking into consideration of the compensation effect of the Petersen coil, the fault path resistance and any CT errors. As a result, the success rate for this type of faulty line selection device is very low, especially when large fault resistance and arcing fault are involved. Although there are many installations on-site, power engineers have generally lost faith in this type of device due to its low accuracy.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to apply a {{non-linear}} filtering methods (Particle Filter) to a flood prediction system to improve the accuracy of flood water level. The uniqueness of the flood prediction system is to estimates the water level considering temporal change of the sandbar collapse at the backwater reach in the Kumano River. A one dimensional hydrodynamic model of unsteady flow was applied to predict the longitudinal profile of the water level at the reach affected by the sandbar collapse of the river mouth. It was shown that the bed deformation height as one of the <b>state</b> <b>quantities</b> could explain the timing of the sandbar collapse. Other <b>state</b> <b>quantities</b> are discharge at the upstream and the lateral discharge from the branches. These were given from the results of a distributed rainfall-runoff model. Error coefficients are included to update the <b>state</b> <b>quantities</b> by using filtering method with the observed water level.

30|$|For the {{temperature}} within the cylinder space the theoretical investigations showed an isentropic change in {{state for the}} influence of the process pressure depending on the isentropic exponent. To retain the isothermal state a heat transfer to the surrounding must be carried out, whereby {{the influence of the}} overall heat transfer coefficient would have to be very pronounced to compensate the pressure change. In addition, {{the temperature}} change by the pressure is pulsating. However, the heat flow has only one direction: cooling down or heating up. Finally, the temperature of the gas taking up cylinder depends on the temperature of the incoming volumetric flow, which {{is a function of the}} bordering component. Some people assume that the process takes place without an increase or decrease in a <b>state</b> <b>quantity</b> of the system like the temperature. The impact of the investigated parameters indicates this assumption is not always correct; the general solution appears indispensable for realistic simulation.|$|E

In real terms its share in the GDP shows more likely stagnation (from 29 % in 1995 to 28 % in 2008). But correlation between GDP and investment in the Czech Republic is weaker compared to EU 27. The increases of the various types of fixed assets in the Czech economy in constant prices of the year 2000 show clearly more dynamic growth in machinery and equipment in comparison with the dwellings and other buildings and structures.

40|$|In {{order to}} find more {{correlations}} between entropy and other related quantities, an analogical analysis is conducted between thermal science and other branches of physics. Potential energy in various forms {{is the product of}} a conserved extensive quantity (for example, mass or electric charge) and an intensive quantity which is its potential (for example, gravitational potential or electrical voltage), while energy in specific form is a dissipative quantity during irreversible transfer process (for example mechanical or electrical energy will be dissipated as thermal energy). However, it has been shown that heat or thermal energy, like mass or electric charge, is conserved during heat transfer processes. When a heat transfer process is for object heating or cooling, the potential of internal energy U is the temperature T and its potential “energy” is UT/ 2 (called entransy and it is the simplified expression of thermomass potential energy); when a heat transfer process is for heat-work conversion, the potential of internal energy U is (1 − T 0 /T), and the available potential energy of a system in reversible heat interaction with the environment is U − U 0 − T 0 (S − S 0), then T 0 /T and T 0 (S − S 0) are the unavailable potential and the unavailable potential energy of a system respectively. Hence, entropy is related to the unavailable potential energy per unit environmental temperature for heat-work conversion during reversible heat interaction between the system and its environment. Entropy transfer, like other forms of potential energy transfer, is the product of the heat and its potential, the reciprocal of temperature, although it is in form of the quotient of the heat and the temperature. Thus, the physical essence of entropy transfer is the unavailable potential energy transfer per unit environmental temperature. Entropy is a non-conserved, extensive, <b>state</b> <b>quantity</b> of a system, and entropy generation in an irreversible heat transfer process is proportional to the destruction of available potential energy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel PDE solver {{using the}} multidimensional wave digital {{filtering}} (MDWDF) technique {{to achieve the}} solution of a 2 D seismic wave system is presented. In essence, the continuous physical system served by a linear Kirchhoff circuit is transformed to an equivalent discrete dynamic system implemented by a MD wave digital filtering (MDWDF) circuit. This amounts to numerically approximating the differential equations used to describe elements of a MD passive electronic circuit by a grid-based difference equations implemented by the so-called <b>state</b> <b>quantities</b> within the passive MDWDF circuit.
