40|$|First {{observations}} on reproduction of Neorossia caroli {{from the southern}} Sardinian sea are reported, based on the analyses of an egg clutch and specimens collected by bottom trawl on sandy and muddy grounds. The egg clutch, consisting of 13 white eggs of 9 mm length with embryos at an advanced developmental stage, was found at 1200 m depth, attached {{to a piece of}} hard substrate. Adult specimens were collected in a depth range between 400 and 1600 metres. DNA sequences indicated that embryos, spermatangia and adults belonged to the same species, the carol bobtail <b>squid,</b> <b>N.</b> caroli. Fecundity analysis made on 40 females showed a variable number of eggs (20 - 611) in the ovaries, with the combined presence of advanced and developing oocytes, and few smooth eggs ready to be spawned in the oviducts of mature females. Several sperm reservoirs (spermatangia) were embedded in the mantle of some of the females, in the anterior ventral area overlying the oviduct...|$|R
40|$|Organotins, {{especially}} tributyltins (TBT) {{are highly}} toxic to many marine organisms. These compounds are introduced {{in marine waters}} by ship trafficking, ship scrapping activities, as antifouling compounds and sewage disposal. Marine fishes, crustaceans and molluscans are easily prone to organotins contamination. In View of this, a baseline monitoring {{study was conducted in}} order to establish the levels of organotins in edible marine fishes (n = 35), bivalves (n = 9), shrimps (<b>n</b> = 3), <b>squids</b> (<b>n</b> = 2) and crabs (n = 3) collected from Mumbai, Goa and Karwar on the west coast of India. At these locations average organotin concentration found in fishes, clams, shrimps, squids and crabs was 108 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 852 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 179 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 70 ng Sn g- 1 dw and 89 ng Sn g- 1 dw respectively. In all the samples butyltins dominated over phenyltins. The levels of organotins suggest that all the organisms were contaminated with organotins and their consumption may pose health problems to humans especially the clams...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on the food of the <b>squid</b> <b>N.</b> gouldi, based on 1277 {{individuals}} collected by Japanese vessels jigging in Bass Strait from November 1979 to April 1980. Most of the food consisted of crustaceans, fish and cephalopods, with crustaceans being more common in smaller animals and cephalopods in larger ones. The crustaceans, which included several benthic species, were {{more common in the}} diet at night than by day. Cannibalism by N. gouldi did not appear to increase appreciably after the animals were brought aboard and laid together in the collecting troughs. By frequency of occurrence, the contributions to the diet, averaged over all sizes sampled, were fish 37 %, crustaceans 36 %, and squid 26 %; but in terms of biomass fish contributed more. From the size of the beaks of squid taken, it could be shown that the mantle length of these prey was usually not more than half that of the predator. N. gouldi feeds primarily at night, probably moving up from the bottom into the water column. Larger specimens, both male and female, were less likely to contain food in the stomach than smaller ones, and possible explanations are considered. There are some indications about the timing of spawning in 1979 - 1980, from records of the size and sexual maturation of the animals sampled...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} fabrication, {{measurements and}} analysisof two different Josephson junction circuits; the Cooper pairtransistor (CPT) {{and the one}} dimensional Josephson junctionarray (JJA). All experiments are conducted in a dilutionrefrigerator with a base temperature of 15 { 30 mK. In the experiments on CPTs the maximum supercurrent,called the switch- ing current, is measured versus the gatecharge. The importance of filtering of the measurement leads inorder to suppress quasi-particle excitations and to get 2 e-periodic switching currents is demonstrated. Normal metalgold leads close to the CPTs are introduced to further reducethe effect of quasi-particles. To prove that switching currentis 2 e-periodic, magnetic fields and increased temperatures areused to induce a transition to e-periodicity. CPTs where eachJosephson junction {{is replaced by a}} Superconducting QuantumInterference de- vice (SQUID) have also been fabricated andmeasured. The SQUIDs make it possible to tune the effectiveJosephson energy with an external magnetic field. The measuredswitching current is tunable in magnitude and 2 e-periodic. Theswitching currents are compared with theory. Good agreementbetween the- ory and experiments is found using a model of theCPT in an electrodynamic environment with a high effectivetemperature. The JJAs are also fabricated with a SQUID geometry toenable tuning of the effective Josephson energy. The currentvoltage characteristics (IVCs) of the measured JJAs exhibit aCoulomb blockade of Cooper pair tunneling which is tunable withmagnetic field and periodic with the ux quanta. The IVCs of theJJA show a region of negative differential resistance, alsocalled back- bending. This is interpreted as evidence of Blochoscillations in the JJAs. Two different models are discussed toexplain the measured IVC. The thesis ends by presenting a theoretical proposal ona Josephson junction charge qubit, called the array-qubit. Thearray-qubit consists of an array with <b>N</b> <b>SQUIDs</b> and <b>N</b> + 1 islands. The two basis states of the qubit corresponds to anexcess Cooper pair on either island 1 or N + 1. These two statesare coupled through an Nth-order tunneling process which makesit possible to effectively suppress the Josephson coupling. This facilitate a long relaxation time so that the state of thequbit can be read with a slow detector. NR 2014080...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} way to realize a n-qubit {{controlled}} phase gate with superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) by coupling them to a superconducting resonator. In this proposal, the two logical states of a qubit are represented by the two lowest levels of a SQUID. An intermediate level of each SQUID is utilized to facilitate coherent control and manipulation of quantum states of the qubits. It {{is interesting to note}} that a n-qubit controlled phase gate can be achieved with <b>n</b> <b>SQUIDs</b> by successively applying a π / 2 Jaynes-Cummings pulse to each of the n- 1 control SQUIDs before and after a π Jaynes-Cummings pulse on the target SQUID.

40|$|We have designed, {{fabricated}} {{and tested}} an XY-addressable readout {{system that is}} specifically tailored for the reading of superconducting flux qubits in an integrated circuit that could enable adiabatic quantum optimization. In such a system, the flux qubits only need to be read {{at the end of}} an adiabatic evolution when quantum mechanical tunneling has been suppressed, thus simplifying many aspects of the readout process. The readout architecture for an N-qubit adiabatic quantum optimization system comprises <b>N</b> hysteretic dc <b>SQUIDs</b> and <b>N</b> rf <b>SQUID</b> latches controlled by 2 √(N) + 2 bias lines. The latching elements are coupled to the qubits and the dc SQUIDs are then coupled to the latching elements. This readout scheme provides two key advantages: First, the latching elements provide exceptional flux sensitivity that significantly exceeds what may be achieved by directly coupling the flux qubits to the dc SQUIDs using a practical mutual inductance. Second, the states of the latching elements are robust against the influence of ac currents generated by the switching of the hysteretic dc SQUIDs, thus allowing one to interrogate the latching elements repeatedly so as to mitigate the effects of stochastic switching of the dc SQUIDs. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve single qubit read error rates of < 10 ^- 6 with this readout scheme. We have characterized the system-level performance of a 128 -qubit readout system and have measured a readout error probability of 8 × 10 ^- 5 in the presence of optimal latching element bias conditions.

40|$|King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus {{which were}} rearing chicks were studied during three summers from November 1991 to March 1994 at South Georgia. Stomach samples (n= 115) {{collected}} by flushing {{had a mean}} mass of 1308 g. Fish mass was allocated to each species based {{on the relationship between}} fish mass and otolith length. Three mesopelagic lanternfishes (Myctophidae), Krefftichthys anderssoni, Electrona carlsbergi and Protomyctophum choriodon, dominated the diet both by numbers and mass. They were small fish with mean mass of 3 – 7 g. Overall, K. anderssoni dominated the diet in terms of numbers and mass. Although Barracudina Notolepis coatsi occurred in < 3 % of the diet by numbers, it was large (106 g) and was second most important in terms of mass. Squid represented < 3 % of the diet by mass. Although the chick-rearing success was poor in the 1993 – 1994 summer, meal size was not reduced but foraging trips were longer. In the 1993 – 1994 summer, a larger proportion of the otoliths were not identifiable because they were more completely digested. Fewer otoliths were identified as being those of K. anderssoni, but we argue that about 90 % of the unidentified otoliths were K. anderssoni. There was also more <b>squid</b> and <b>N.</b> coatsi in the diet during the poor summer. A consistent trend was that P. choriodon was rare or absent in early summer but more important later in the year, {{and at the end of}} 1992 – 1993, it was the dominant prey. We conclude that myctophid fish, especially K. anderssoni, are the main summer prey of King Penguins rearing chicks at South Georgia, as found in other recent studies in the Southern Ocean...|$|R

Because of their high feeding rates and abundance, squids {{have the potential to}} exert control on the recruitment of commercially important fishes. In this review, we synthesize the available information for two intrinsic markers (δ 15 N and δ 13 C isotopic values) in squids for all oceans and several types of ecosystems to obtain a global view of the trophic niches of squids in marine ecosystems. In particular, we aimed to examine whether the trophic positions and trophic widths of squid species vary among oceans and ecosystem types.
