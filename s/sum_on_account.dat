60|$|THE SOUDAN {{campaign}} and Dick's broken head {{had been some}} months ended and mended, and the Central Southern Syndicate had paid Dick a certain <b>sum</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> for work done, which work they were careful to assure him was not altogether up to their standard. Dick heaved the letter into the Nile at Cairo, cashed the draft in the same town, and bade a warm farewell to Torpenhow at the station.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} induce {{him to give}} me a small <b>sum</b> <b>on</b> <b>account.</b> I was about to take terrible risks, remember; housebreaking, larceny, theft--call it what you will, it meant the police correctionelle and a couple of years in New Orleans for sure. He finally gave me fifty francs, and once more {{threatened}} to take his business elsewhere, so I had to accept and to look as urbane and dignified as I could.|$|E

50|$|He {{joined the}} Bombay Marine, {{received}} his first commission in 1771 and in 1792 was promoted captain. In 1772, as a midshipman, {{he went on}} his first survey mission along the coasts of India, Iran and Arabia. In 1780 he was lieutenant on a ship captured by a French man-of-war off the Cape of Good Hope. He was kept prisoner by the French until 1784 when they handed {{him over to the}} Dutch who returned him to the Bombay Marine that same year. He was given the then considerable <b>sum</b> of £200 <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of his long captivity and suffering. Between 1786 and 1788 he took part in a number of survey missions, to the Chagos archipelago, to Diamond Harbour south of Calcutta and to adjacent parts of the Hooghly river.|$|R
2500|$|The {{revenue of}} Selangor in 1875 {{amounted}} to only $115,656; in 1905 it had increased to $8,857,793. [...] Of this latter sum $3,195,318 {{was derived from}} duty on tin exported, $1,972,628 from finance, federal receipts, and $340,360 from land revenue.

5000|$|In their perjured {{narrative}} of the Popish Plot, Titus Oates and Israel Tonge declared that Wakeman had been offered £10,000 to poison Charles II's posset, {{and that he could}} easily effect this through the agency of the Queen. The story went that Wakeman refused the task, and held out until £15,000 was offered him. Then, they said, he attended the [...] "Jesuit Consult" [...] on 30 August 1678, received a large <b>sum</b> of money <b>on</b> <b>account,</b> and, the further reward of a post as physician-general in the army having been promised him, he definitely engaged to poison the king. At his first appearance before the King and his Privy Council, Wakeman defended himself with such vigour, pointing to his lifetime of loyal service to the Stuart monarchy, that the Council, somewhat taken aback, did not order his arrest.|$|R
60|$|Their {{commercial}} {{school days}} were {{a period of}} disgrace and despair for the young couple. They seemed to be learning nothing about flower shops. At last they gave it up as hopeless, and shook the dust of the shorthand schools, and the polytechnics, and the London School of Economics from their feet for ever. Besides, the business was in some mysterious way beginning {{to take care of}} itself. They had somehow forgotten their objections to employing other people. They {{came to the conclusion that}} their own way was the best, and that they had really a remarkable talent for business. The Colonel, who had been compelled for some years to keep a sufficient <b>sum</b> <b>on</b> current <b>account</b> at his bankers to make up their deficits, found that the provision was unnecessary: the young people were prospering. It is true that there was not quite fair play between them and their competitors in trade. Their week-ends in the country cost them nothing, and saved them the price of their Sunday dinners; for the motor car was the Colonel's; and he and Higgins paid the hotel bills. Mr. F. Hill, florist and greengrocer (they soon discovered that there was money in asparagus; and asparagus led to other vegetables), had an air which stamped the business as classy; and in private life he was still Frederick Eynsford Hill, Esquire. Not that there was any swank about him: nobody but Eliza knew that he had been christened Frederick Challoner. Eliza herself swanked like anything.|$|R
60|$|I feel rather {{surprised}} {{to have heard}} nothing from you or your father in answer to Fletcher's last letter. I wish to know whether you intend taking a share in a farm with your brother, or prefer to wait for some other situation in Lancashire;--the first will be the best, because, at your time of life, it is highly improper to remain idle. If this marriage which is spoken of for you is at all advantageous, I can have no objection; but I should suppose, after being in my service from your infancy, you will at least let me {{know the name of}} your intended, and her expectations. If at all respectable, nothing can be better for your settlement in life, and a proper provision will be made for you; at all events let me hear something on the subject, for, as I have some intention of leaving England in the Summer, I wish to make my arrangements with regard to yourself before that period. As you and Mr. Murray have not received any money for some time, if you will draw on me for fifty pounds (payable at Messrs. Hoare's, Bankers, Fleet Street), and tell Mr. J[oseph] Murray to draw for the same <b>sum</b> <b>on</b> his own <b>account,</b> both will be paid by me.|$|R
60|$|My {{aunt and}} I, {{when we were}} left alone, talked far into the night. How the emigrants never wrote home, {{otherwise}} than cheerfully and hopefully; how Mr. Micawber had actually remitted divers small <b>sums</b> of money, <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of those 'pecuniary liabilities', in reference {{to which he had}} been so business-like as between man and man; how Janet, returning into my aunt's service when she came back to Dover, had finally carried out her renunciation of mankind by entering into wedlock with a thriving tavern-keeper; and how my aunt had finally set her seal on the same great principle, by aiding and abetting the bride, and crowning the marriage-ceremony with her presence; were among our topics--already more or less familiar to me through the letters I had had. Mr. Dick, as usual, was not forgotten. My aunt informed me how he incessantly occupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on, and kept King Charles the First at a respectful distance by that semblance of employment; how {{it was one of the}} main joys and rewards of her life that he was free and happy, instead of pining in monotonous restraint; and how (as a novel general conclusion) nobody but she could ever fully know what he was.|$|R
