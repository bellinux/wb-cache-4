40|$|Aims: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the clinicopathological and molecular profile of lung cancer patients along with the evaluation of their clinical characteristics at a tertiary care hospital in Northern India. Subjects and Methods: A total of 421 patients with lung cancer histology who were treated at Max Super <b>Speciality</b> <b>Hospitals</b> were included in the study. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and permission was obtained from the Ethics Committee before the start of the study.

Results: There were 330 (78. 4 %) men and 91 (21. 6 %) women with a median age of 62 years (range: 30 – 93 years). Of the 421 patients, 388 (92. 2 %) patients had the nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histology whereas 33 (7. 8 %) patients were of SCLC histology.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or Hughes syndrome) in two major teaching hospitals in Kuwait. Patients with suspected Hughes syndrome were investigated with tests for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and lupus anticoagulants (LAC) over 1 yr. Diagnosis was considered confirmed if significant levels of either or both antibodies with no obvious cause (primary), or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-lilce illness (including SLE serology) (secondary) were present. Twelve (37. 5 %; seven females, 58 %) primary and 20 (62. 5 %; 18 females, 90 %) secondary Hughes syndrome patients were seen during this period. Patients were Kuwaiti, Middle-Eastern and North-African Arabs (29), Filipinos (2) and White (1). None were from the Indian subcontinent. The main presentation was thrombosis in 75 % (arterial in 25 % and venous in 50 %), and recurrent abortions in 50 % of married women. Haematological and dermatological manifestations were limited entirely to the secondary variety, seen in 25 % and 19 %, respectively. Clinical manifestations were severe, leading to death in one, intensive-care management in 31 % and with partial or complete warfarin resistance or brittleness in 25 %. Neurological/eye and cardiac manifestations were not seen, as these patients may be attending separate <b>speciality</b> <b>hospitals</b> for these diseases in Kuwait.
