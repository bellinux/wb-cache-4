5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard <b>sponge,</b> {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the <b>sponge.</b> This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small <b>sponge</b> applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E
40|$|Recently self-affine <b>sponges</b> {{have been}} shown to be {{interesting}} examples and counter-examples to several previously open problems. One class of recently discovered <b>sponges</b> are partially affine Bedford-McMullen <b>sponges</b> whose Assouad type dimensions cannot be calculated like the dimensions of regular Bedford-McMullen <b>sponges</b> are. We calculate the Assouad type dimensions for such partially affine <b>sponges</b> and discuss some of their more subtle details...|$|R
30|$|Compared to marine <b>sponges,</b> {{information}} on the microbial diversity, composition, host-microbiota interactions and the roles of their symbiont, etc. of the freshwater <b>sponges</b> are rare. The microbial diversity of two fresh water <b>sponges</b> (E. carteri and C. lapidosa) is explored {{for the first time}} using NGS technology. The present study demonstrated that like marine <b>sponges,</b> the microbial community structure of freshwater <b>sponges</b> is also highly diverse. Our study also provided compelling evidences for the distinct microbial composition of freshwater and marine <b>sponges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hexactinellid <b>sponges</b> are <b>sponges</b> with a {{skeleton}} made of four- and/or six-pointed siliceous spicules, {{often referred to}} as glass <b>sponges.</b> They are usually classified along with other <b>sponges</b> in the phylum Porifera, but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their own phylum, Symplasma.|$|R
5|$|<b>Sponge</b> flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the <b>sponge</b> and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling {{to the surface of}} the <b>sponge</b> while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of the Cold War, {{titanium}} was considered a strategic material by the U.S. government, and a large stockpile of titanium <b>sponge</b> was maintained by the Defense National Stockpile Center, which was finally depleted in the 2000s. According to 2006 data, the world's largest producer, Russian-based VSMPO-AVISMA, was estimated to account for about 29% of the world market share. As of 2015, titanium <b>sponge</b> metal was produced in six countries: China, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan, the USA, Ukraine, and India. (in order of output).|$|E
40|$|<b>Sponges</b> are the {{simplest}} multicellular animals. Farming of <b>sponges</b> is facilitated by their asexual reproduction and great ability of regeneration. Farming of filter-feeding <b>sponges</b> is environment friendly, {{and it can}} positively influence on environmental impact of other aquaculture activities. Natural populations of <b>sponges</b> in Mediterranean Sea are endangered by inappropriate overfishing. Farming of <b>sponges</b> is possible solution for regeneration and protection of natural populations...|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen <b>sponge</b> alloys {{can contain}} lanthanum. These alloys {{are capable of}} storing up to 400 times their own volume of {{hydrogen}} gas in a reversible adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sponges</b> were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous <b>sponges</b> (Calcarea), glass <b>sponges</b> (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, {{studies have shown}} that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought to belong to the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of <b>sponges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides <b>sponges</b> {{formed from}} plastic polymers, {{the three other}} {{categories}} of widely available synthetic <b>sponges</b> are low-density polyether (known as non-absorbent <b>sponges),</b> PVA (a highly absorbent material for use in medicine), and polyester.|$|R
40|$|Porifera (<b>sponges)</b> are {{a diverse}} taxon of benthic aquatic (marine and limnic) animals, with over 8, 500 {{described}} species distributed over four main extant lineages: Demospongiae (83 % of living species; demosponges, including bath <b>sponges),</b> Hexactinellida (glass <b>sponges),</b> Calcarea (calcareous <b>sponges),</b> and Homoscleromorpha (flesh <b>sponges)</b> (Van Soest et al. 2012) (Fig. 2). Traditionally, <b>sponges</b> were considered the sister {{group to the}} rest of Metazoa, and therefore of great significance for the reconstruction of early metazoan evolution. <b>Sponges</b> are now regarded to be monophyletic (reviewed in Wörheide et al. 2012), though further work is needed to unequivocally resolve their placement among the other non-bilaterian animals (i. e., those without bilateral symmetry) (Fig. 1). Although <b>sponges</b> are of great importance ecologically (as filter-feeders, bioeroders, and habitat formers), commercially (e. g., bath <b>sponges)</b> and pharmaceutically (as producers of bioactive secondary metabolites), their internal phylogeny and genomic diversity remains unresolved and understudied (Lavrov et al, 2008; Wörheide et al., 2012; Hill et al 2013). Comparative genomic approaches will not only shed light on the early evolution o...|$|R
5|$|In {{anaerobic}} protozoa, such as Plagiopyla frontata, archaea reside {{inside the}} protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within (is an endosymbiont of) the <b>sponge</b> Axinella mexicana.|$|E
5|$|Proton <b>sponge,</b> 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a pKa {{value of}} 12.1. It {{is one of}} the strongest amine bases known. The high {{basicity}} is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} to prevent loss of {{mitomycin}} C soaked <b>sponges</b> under the conjunctiva during trabeculectomy Surgically acquired foreign {{body is a}} serious complication of microscopic surgery. 1 In fornix-based trabeculectomy with mito-mycin C, <b>sponges</b> soaked with mitomycin C are placed under the conjunctival flap for 3 e 5 min, after which the <b>sponges</b> are removed with a toothed forceps. <b>Sponges</b> may be lost under the conjunctival flap because in fornix-based trabeculectomy, the <b>sponges</b> are inserted deep into the conjunc-tivalescleral interface. Numerous complica-tions due to retained cellulose <b>sponges</b> after trabeculectomy with mitomycin C such as granulomas or conjunctival hole formation have already been reported. 2...|$|R
30|$|Marine <b>sponges</b> are {{promising}} sources for delivering of bioactive compounds. Four marine <b>sponges,</b> collected from Red Sea at Egyptian coasts, {{were identified as}} Smenospongia (SP 1), Callyspongia (SP 2), Niphates (SP 3), and Stylissa (SP 4). The results demonstrated that different <b>sponges</b> extracts exhibited inhibitory effects on oxidative stress indices and carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes in linear relationships to some extent with concentration of inhibitors (dose dependant). The extracts of <b>sponges</b> (3, 1, and 2) showed, respectively, potent-reducing power. Chemical characterizations of <b>sponges</b> SP 1 and SP 3 were discussed. Based on this study, marine <b>sponges</b> are considered as talented sources for production of diverse and multiple biologically active compounds.|$|R

5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a <b>sponge</b> base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of <b>sponge</b> cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting <b>sponge</b> which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The <b>sponge</b> provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
50|$|Sea <b>sponges</b> {{are also}} marketed as menstrual hygiene products. A 1980 {{study by the}} University of Iowa found that commercially sold sea <b>sponges</b> {{contained}} sand, grit, and bacteria. Hence, sea <b>sponges</b> could also potentially cause toxic shock syndrome.|$|R
