The direct cost of reprocessing cotton-woven <b>surgical</b> <b>drapes</b> {{was calculated by}} multiplying the time spent by professionals involved in reprocessing the unit with the direct cost of labor, adding {{to the cost of}} materials. The Brazilian currency (R$) originally used for the calculations was converted to US currency at the rate of US$ 0. 42 /R$. RESULTS The average total cost for surgical LAP package was US$ 9. 72, with the predominance being in the cost of materials (US$ 8. 70 or 89. 65 %). It is noteworthy that the average total cost of materials was mostly impacted by the cost of the cotton-woven drapes (US$ 7. 99 or 91. 90 %).

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesThere {{are several}} factors in {{operating}} rooms {{that increase the}} risk of fire. Besides being an oxygen-enriched environment, it contains combustible materials and equipment with available ignition sources. Although fires in operating rooms are a relatively rare event, the consequences are potentially serious and mostly avoidable. We present a case report of a fire occurring in the <b>surgical</b> <b>drape</b> during a blepharoplasty in which oxygen was supplemented by nasal catheter. Case ReportFemale patient, 52 -years old, without comorbidities, admitted to hospital for a bilateral blepharoplasty. After monitoring and venoclysis, the patient underwent intravenous sedation and additional oxygen given via spectacle-type catheter at a flow rate of 4 L. min− 1, followed by local anesthesia in the eyelids. During surgery, the use of electric scalpel provoked combustion in the surgical drapes and burns on the patient's face. ConclusionsAnesthesiologists play an important role preventing fire in operating rooms, as they can recognize possible ignition sources and rationally administer the oxygen, especially in open systems. The first step toward prevention is to be constantly aware of potential fire...|$|E

S. is {{currently}} used in Galdakao-modified supine Valdivia position, {{since it is}} thought to be capable of allowing the retrograde approach to the high urinary diseases. Our school developed some good experience in percutaneous procedures in the prone position, with no significant anesthetic complications; we have performed an evaluation of flexible retrograde endoscopy with percutaneous nephrolithotripsy in this position. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 patients (14 M - 7 F), with a mean age 44. 5 years (range 27 - 62), with complex urolithiasis, underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy associated with flexible retrograde endoscopy (E. C. I. R. S.) in the prone position. The technique has followed these steps: patient's positioning in the prone position; flexible cystoscopy and insertion of guide 0. 038 " stiff Lubriglide flexible tip; ureteral sheath 11 / 13 Ch until the lumbar ureter; fixing the end of the sheath to the <b>surgical</b> <b>drape</b> with sutures or surgical instrument; catheter Nelaton transurethral 10 Ch {{to the side of the}} sheath; renal puncture and routine procedure for the nephrolithotripsy assisted by the flexible instrumentation by retrograde approach.

One segment on each side was antimicrobial. The locations of the treated segments were randomly varied. At the end of each operation, test strips were removed. Bacteria were harvested from each segment by mechanical agitation. Bacterial CFU were counted. There were 110 surgical cases in the study, including clean, clean contaminated, and contaminated procedures. Data analysis divided the cases into two distinct groups. Group 1 was composed of 59 cases in which less than 30 total CFU was recovered from the four test samples. The average duration of surgery for this group was 1. 8 h.

The junction between normal and abnormal tissue should be biopsied. Punch biopsies are used to get skin samples. The skin directly over the selected site is clipped and cleaned with a surgical scrub. A local anaesthetic is injected around the lesion and the biopsy site is scrubbed again. The skin is stretched and the biopsy punch is placed at right angles to the skin surface. The punch is rotated in one direction and firm downward pressure is applied. The punch is then angled parallel to the skin while still applying pressure. The punch is rotated to sever the base of the biopsied material and is then removed. The tissue core is elevated with the point of a needle and the base severed with a scalpel.

40|$|AIM: To {{quantify}} {{and reduce}} the errors in visual estimation of knee flexion contractures during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: This study was divided into two parts: Quantification of error and reduction of error. To quantify error, 3 orthopedic surgeons visually estimated preoperative knee flexion contractures from lateral digital images of 23 patients prior to and after <b>surgical</b> <b>draping.</b> A repeated-measure {{analysis of variance was}} used to compare the estimated angles prior to and following the placement of the <b>surgical</b> <b>drapes</b> with the true knee angle measured with a long-arm goniometer. In an effort to reduce the error of visual estimation, a dual set of inclinometers was developed to improve intra-operative measurement of knee flexion contracture during TKA. A single surgeon performed 6 knee extension measurements with the device during 146 consecutive TKA cases. Three measurements were taken with the desired tibial liner trial thickness, and 3 were taken with a trial that was 2 mm thicker. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess the test-retest reliability for the 3 measurements taken with the desired liner thickness, and a paired t test was used to determine if the knee extension measurements differed when a thicker tibial trial liner was placed. RESULTS: The surgeons significantly overestimated flexion contractures in 23 TKAs prior to draping and significantly underestimated the contractures after draping (actual knee angle = 6. 1 0; 1; 6. 4 0;, pre-drape estimate = 6. 9 0; 1; 6. 8 0;, post-drape estimate = 4. 3 0; 1; 6. 1 0;, P = 0. 003). Following the development and application of the measurement devices, the measurements were highly reliable (ICC = 0. 98), and the device indicated that 2. 7 0; 1; 2. 2 0; of knee extension was lost with the insertion of a 2 mm thicker tibial liner. The device failed to detect a difference in knee extension angle with the insertion of the 2 mm thicker liner in 9 / 146 cases (6. 2 %).

30|$|Inflow and outflow fluid {{monitoring}} {{involves the}} calculation of the volume infused in the uterine cavity and the fluid returned from the outflow channel of the hysteroscope and the fluid leaking through the cervix. Liquid media can be delivered into the uterine cavity via an open or closed system. In an open system the medium freely escapes through the cervix and the outflow channel onto the drape and into a bucket or the theatre floor, thus making precise fluid monitoring inaccurate or even impossible. In a closed system the fluid is returned through suction to a reservoir. This set up also improves visibility by removing debris and blood from the endometrial cavity. However, even with suction, there is still fluid escaping through the cervix and the perineum. To overcome this problem drapes with a fluid reservoir for collection of fluid should be used. The fluid collected in the reservoir can be measured and added in the outflow volume. These drapes should be used instead of the standard <b>surgical</b> <b>drapes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{procedure}} is {{performed with the}} patient asleep (general anaesthetic) or under spinal anaesthesia. There are two widely used methods, one with the patient on their back (supine) {{and the other on}} their side (lateral decubitus). Which is used is down to the surgeon's preference. To gain access to the central compartment of the hip joint (between the ball and socket), traction is applied to the affected leg after placing the foot into a special boot. (See fig. 2) There is specifically designed equipment for this, although some surgeons use a 'traction table', initially designed to help in the operative fixation of broken thigh and lower leg bones. The amount of traction (or pull) needed is assessed with the help of fluoroscopy (low-dose portable x-ray). (See fig. 3) It is usually not possible to distract the ball from the socket with traction alone by more than a few millimetres. Once the surgeon is happy that {{he will be able to}} gain access to the hip joint (i.e. the ball will distract from the socket by a small amount), the patient is then painted with antiseptic and the <b>surgical</b> <b>drapes</b> applied.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Videoscopic herniorrhaphy {{is being}} {{performed}} more frequently with advantages claimed over the conventional open approach. This clinical report describes a pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema occurring {{at the end}} of an extraperitoneal videoscopic herniorrhaphy. Clinical Features: A 25 yr old ASA 1 man presented for elective extraperitoneal videoscopic hernia repair. Following intravenous induction with fentanyl, midazolam and propofol a balanced anesthetic technique using enflurane in N 2 O and O 2 was used. Apart from a prolonged operating time (195 min), the procedure and anesthetic was uneventful. At the conclusion of the operation, prior to reversal of neuromuscular blockade extensive subcutaneous emphysema was noted on removal of the <b>surgical</b> <b>drapes.</b> Chest radiography revealed a pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. A 25 FG intercostal tube was inserted and connected to an underwater seal drain. Sedation and positive pressure ventilation was maintained overnight to permit resolution and avoid airway compromise. The clinical and radiological features had resolved by the next morning and the patient’s trachea was extubated. His subsequent recovery was uneventful. Conclusion: Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are well recognised complications of laparoscopic techniques but have not been described following extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy. In this report we postulate possible mechanisms which may have contributed to their development, including inadvertent breach of the peritoneum and leakage of ga...|$|R
