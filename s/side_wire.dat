50|$|The Weymann WEL-80 was an unequal span single bay biplane. It {{had strong}} stagger, no {{dihedral}} {{and a lower}} wing which was smaller not only in span (14%) but also in chord (20%) and so in area (40%). The wings were similar in plan, rectangular out to angled, blunted tips, though with differently shaped cut-outs for better upward and downward views from the cockpit. They had all-dural structures with two I-section spars and were fabric covered. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings which occupied most of each trailing edge and were linked together by external rods. Upper and lower wings were braced by outward leaning duralumin N-form interplane struts; the lower wing was mounted on the lower fuselage and the upper one joined to the upper fuselage with outward leaning, parallel pairs of cabane struts on each <b>side.</b> <b>Wire</b> bracing completed the structure.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of modern switchers are diesels, but countries with near-total electrification, like Switzerland, use electric switchers. Prior {{to the introduction of}} diesel-electric locomotives, electric shunting locomotives were used to an extent in Great Britain where heavy trains needed to be started on steep gradients. The steeply-graded Quayside Branch in Newcastle upon Tyne was electrified by the North Eastern Railway in 1905, and two steeplecab locomotives were built to handle all traffic on the line. One of these, No. 1, is now part of the National Collection and resides at Locomotion in Shildon. On {{the opposite side of the}} Tyne, the electrified lines owned by the Harton Coal Company in South Shields for the movement of coal and colliery waste to shipping facilities on the river was one of the more extensive industrial networks. A number of the early German locomotives built for use on these lines have been preserved. Electric locomotives were also extensively employed for moving the coke cars at cokeworks, obtaining power from a <b>side</b> <b>wire,</b> as third rail or overhead line electrification would have been impractical. These specialised locomotives were tall steeple-cab types not seen anywhere else, and operated on a short length of track between the ovens and the quenching tower. Despite their ubiquity, very few have survived into preservation as there is very little scope of operating them due to their unique means of obtaining power, slow speed and the fact they greatly exceed the loading gauge of most railway lines. One example built by Greenwood and Batley in Armley, Leeds is preserved at the Middleton Railway, not far from where it was built. Small industrial shunters are sometimes of the battery-electric type. An early battery-electric shunting locomotive is shown here. The Tyne and Wear Metro has three battery electric shunters built by Hunslet, which are used to haul engineering trains when the overhead supply is switched off. Flywheel energy storage was also used experimentally by Sentinel.|$|E
30|$|The {{simplest}} side weirs have {{a rectangular}} shape. Many {{studies have been}} conducted to specify the characteristics of rectangular side weirs. However, besides the advantages of rectangular side weirs like easy construction, such side weirs have low efficiency (Bilhan et al. 2011). In case of overflow, there are two choices: first, the length of the rectangular side weir can be increased, and second, <b>side</b> <b>wire</b> efficiency can be increased. Increasing the side weir length leads to increasing the tributary channel—a choice that seems costly. The economical alternative is to increase the side weir efficiency. Modifying side weir shape could increase side weir efficiency between 1.5 and 4.5 times (Kumar and Pathak 1987; Cosar and Agaccioglu 2004; Ghodsian 2004; Emiroglu et al. 2010 b; Aydin and Emiroglu 2013; Mirnaseri and Emadi 2013).|$|E

5000|$|Rice-hull bagwall {{construction}} {{is a system}} of building, with results aesthetically similar {{to the use of}} earthbag or cob construction, in which woven polypropylene bags (or tubes) are tightly filled with raw rice-hulls, and these are stacked up, layer upon layer, with strands of four-pronged barbed wire between, within a surrounding [...] "cage" [...] composed of mats of welded or woven steel mesh (remesh or [...] "poultry wire") on both <b>sides</b> (<b>wired</b> together between bag layers with, for example, rebar tie-wire) and then stuccoed, to form building walls. Advantages (compared to earth-bag or cob) include less weight to handle/process, far better insulation values (around 3 - 4 per inch), use of an agricultural-waste product and the sequestration of CO2. This building approach was originally innovated and tested by Don Stephens, in the northwestern U.S. in 2005.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} requisites {{for evaluating}} the comfortable clothing pressure of brassieres, I measured changes in clothing pressure that felt comfortable at rest (normal standing posture) and subjective evaluation during movement. Clothing pressure data were measured at 0. 1 -second intervals, and the average of those was considered the synthetic value of the clothing pressure. The difference between the maximum and the minimum values of clothing pressure that varied according to respiration and movement was considered the change in clothing pressure. Changes in clothing pressure and subjective evaluation due to the removal of straps were also studied. Samples were four types of underwired brassieres of different designs including strapless brassieres. Points measured were the six points where thick fabric with wires or rubber tapes may tightly press the skin; the intersections of the lower hem and mammillary lines (points a and a 2 ̆ 7), those of the lower hem and <b>side</b> <b>wires</b> (points b and b 2 ̆ 7), {{and those of the}} upper hem and <b>side</b> <b>wires</b> (points c and c 2 ̆ 7). The results are reported as follows: 1) The brassieres that felt comfortable at rest were not necessarily comfortable during movement. It may be necessary to confirm subjective evaluation during movement to evaluate the comfortable clothing pressure. 2) The brassieres with small changes in clothing pressure tended to give a slightly tight impression. Thus, the changes in clothing pressure during movement should be studied when evaluating the comfortable clothing pressure. 3) The positions of straps tended to influence the distribution of clothing pressure at the lower hem of the brassieres. Therefore, it was difficult to determine a comfortable clothing pressure collectively for brassieres of different designs. The comfortable clothing pressure of brassieres should be determined in relation to their designs. 4) For strapless brassieres, movement caused a large shift and significantly ruined comfortableness. Rotation of the arms slightly increased pressure at points a and a 2 ̆ 7, and the change in clothing pressure at points b and b 2 ̆ 7 or c and c 2 ̆ 7 tended to be slightly small. The removal of straps may cause changes in the pressure applied to the body...|$|R
40|$|Silicon interposers with through silicon vias (TSVs) {{have become}} {{important}} {{key components of}} 3 D architectures. They are used as intermediate carrier and wiring device for IC components like logics, memories and sensors. Due to custom specific front and back <b>side</b> <b>wiring</b> interposers enable to adapt the fine pitch IO terminals of the mounted ICs to the IO geometries of the package level. High density copper filled TSVs with high aspect ratio as well as high density multi layer wiring using electro plated copper as conductive material and low loss dielectrics enable high performance signal transmission at interposer level without serious losses by parasitic effects. This paper presents the fabrication steps for wafer level processing of silicon interposers with copper filled TSVs {{as well as their}} wafer level assembly with IC components. Special focus is drawn on the TSV formation process including via etching, isolation and filling as well as front <b>side</b> high density <b>wiring</b> and subsequent backside processing of the thin TSV wafers. In this context, also temporary wafer to wafer bonding which is required for backside processing of thin TSV wafers is discussed. The final interposers which carry one or more IC components have lateral dimensions up to several square centimeters and thicknesses between 50 - 100 m.

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{the use of}} Auxiliary {{power supply}} (APS) systems to {{energize}} low power rating appliances (e. g. televisions, water dispensers, etc.) and lighting (e. g. CFL lamps) has become pervasive in countries where long power rationing schemes are applied. Although the existing APS systems offer overload protection, it cannot be directly connected to the existing electric circuit unless heavy loads such as refrigerators, microwaves, washing machines, electric water heaters, etc. are disconnected {{in the absence of}} the grid. This is usually overcome by separating the wiring circuits feeding these loads from those devoted for lighting and other low power loads like TV and stereo sets, food processors, etc. However, such a separation is very costly and sometimes infeasible in places with narrow wires tubing circuit if a new by <b>side</b> <b>wiring</b> circuit is to be installed. This paper details a module developed from on-shelf cheap components to wirelessly make heavy loads disconnect themselves as soon as the grid is off. The core idea behind our load self-disconnection module is inspired by the low price remote power plugs which use the 434 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) technology to remotely on/off as many as 256 electric appliances up to a 30 M distance away. Thus, no transmission obstacle, wide coverage and no nearby products interference are achieved as results. Index Terms — Remote control system, load self-disconnection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} best {{technique}} for the surgical treatment of supracondylar fracture of the humerus (SFH) in children, evaluating percutaneous pinning with <b>side</b> <b>wires</b> vs. cross-pinning. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials using the Medline, CAPES, and BIREME. The criteria for inclusion of articles criteria were: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous wire fixation techniques, (2) SFH Gartland II B, III, and IV, and (3) children aged 1 - 14 years. The following {{were used as}} main variables: incidence of iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve and loss reduction. RESULTS: Eight studies were selected (521 patients) comparing surgical treatment with pinning in supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children Gartland II type B, III or IV. Iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve was greater with the cross-pinning technique, with RR 0. 28 and p= 0. 03, while the mini-open technique presented RR 0. 14 and p= 0. 2. A statistically significant greater loss of reduction in the lateral pinning was observed in FSU Gartland III and IV(p= 0. 04). CONCLUSION: Based upon this meta-analysis of prospective randomized clinical trials, the following is recommended: (1) percutaneous pinning with lateral wires in supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children classified as Gartland II type B; (2) use of crossed wires for Gartland type III or IV, using the mini-open technique for the medial wire...|$|R

50|$|For example, if two wires {{carrying}} the same alternating current lie parallel to one another, {{as would be}} found in a coil used in an inductor or transformer, the magnetic field of one wire will induce longitudinal eddy currents in the adjacent wire, that flow in long loops along the wire, {{in the same direction as}} the main current on the <b>side</b> of the <b>wire</b> facing away from the other wire, and back in the opposite direction on the <b>side</b> of the <b>wire</b> facing the other wire. Thus the eddy current will reinforce the main current on the side facing away from the first wire, and oppose the main current on the side facing the first wire. The net effect is to redistribute the current in the cross section of the wire into a thin strip on the side facing away from the other wire. Since the current is concentrated into a smaller area of the wire, the resistance is increased.|$|R

For spin-independent specularity factors at the <b>sides</b> of the <b>wires</b> {{we find that the}} GMR due to bulk and surface scattering decreases with lateral confinement. The length scale at which this occurs is of order the film thickness and the mean free paths. The precise prefactor depends on the relative importance of surface and bulk scattering anisotropies. For spin-dependent specularity factors at the <b>sides</b> of the <b>wires</b> the GMR can increase in some cases with decreasing width. The origin of the change in the GMR in both cases can be understood in terms of lateral confinement changing the e#ective mean free paths within the layers. PACS numbers: 75. 70. -i, 75. 70.
