50|$|On September 1, 1892, Franklin assumed {{his duties}} at Temple Israel. He {{immediately}} began advocating changes to strengthen Reform Judaism in his congregation, suggesting {{the adoption of}} the Union Prayer Book and the ritual endorsed by the Central Conference of American Rabbis. The congregation adopted his suggestions enthusiastically. However, due to a business recession in the early 1890s, temple income slowly decreased, and the congregation at Temple Israel shrank (from 114 to 84). Despite circumstances, Franklin was able to augment the Temple Building <b>fund,</b> <b>slated</b> {{for the construction of a}} new building to house the congregation. The congregation re-elected him to a five-year term in 1896, with a ringing endorsement.|$|R

He had an {{agreement}} to sell the cotton from this and other villages under his control exclusively to the Dutch trader Paul Maashook. In return, Maashook would pay the miri (tax <b>slated</b> for <b>funding</b> the annual Hajj caravan), which was normally payable by the village shaykhs (chiefs). The Syrian Sufi teacher and traveler Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688-1748/9), who traveled through {{the region in the}} first half of the 18th century, said that he prayed in the village after visiting the citadel of Atlit. In 1776 the village was used as a base by Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar to suppress a revolt led by Ali al-Zahir, one of the sons of Sheikh Zahir al-Umar, who ruled the Galilee between 1730 and 1775.A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 showed the place, misnamed as El Mead, In the late 19th century, the village was described as being built of stone, situated on a slight rise in a valley, surrounded by olive and fig trees, and arable land. There were an estimated 300 Druze living there. Later, the residents were described as Muslims who maintained a village mosque. In 1887, the Ottoman authorities built a school in ´Amqa.|$|R
2500|$|On March 5, 2012, the {{feasibility}} report was published and made public {{jointly by the}} Maryland Stadium Authority and Baltimore City which strongly makes the recommendation for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center and replacing 1st Mariner Arena, reiterating that Baltimore's tourism industry will be harmed {{in the long run}} if no action is taken. Also, on April 11, 2012, the Baltimore Business Journal published an article stating that the Maryland General Assembly in approved $2.5 million for the convention center project allocated for [...] "initial design [...] $400 million expansion of the convention center (<b>slated</b> to be <b>funded</b> using public money from the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore), as well as a $500 million, 18,500-seat arena and hotel project (<b>slated</b> to be <b>funded</b> using private funding from a group led by local business magnate Willard Hackerman)" [...] however the Maryland General Assembly's budget committees added a prerequisite before they will approve the release of the $2.5 million. [...] The prerequisite required that the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore and the private financiers of the project submit a memorandum of understanding to the Maryland General Assembly's budget committees with a detailed explanation of how this project would be funded, how much of the $400 million would be shared between the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore and exactly who would operate the new arena. The proponent of this project and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, Donald Fry, stated {{in an interview with the}} Baltimore Business Journal that the approval of initial design funds by the Maryland General Assembly gives the green light to both the Greater Baltimore Committee and Willard Hackerman to enter into serious negotiations with private investors regarding [...] "naming rights or concession agreements for the arena" [...] and he feels that this is a good sign that the Maryland General Assembly will, in fact, provide even more state funding towards this project in the future.|$|R
