50|$|Early {{versions}} of the device were produced and refined in the lab. The first official release of the Fab@Home model 1 coincided with a presentation at the Solid Freeform Fabrication conference in 2006. After its first release, undergraduate and graduate students at Cornell and other locations joined the team and developed an improved version, later released as the Fab@Home Model 2. The main improvements included easier assembly, no soldering, and fewer parts. The team then expanded and developed the model 3. One important variation of Fab@Home was the Fab@School project, which explored the use of 3D printers suitable for classroom use in elementary grades. Fab@School printers could print with benign materials such as Play-Doh and included a <b>safety</b> <b>enclosure.</b>|$|E

The proposed change allows Mode 2 (startup) operation with two required intermediate range monitor (IRM) channels per trip system and will be in effect from May 1, 2001 (the proposed date of NRC issuance of this amendment request) until the Fall 2001 Unit 2 refueling outage. Since the IRMs are not required for power operation, they were retracted from the Unit 2 reactor core following start up from the Spring 2000 refueling outage. Unfortunately, two IRMs began experiencing erratic operation during the run cycle, and troubleshooting indicated the problem is inside the inerted Unit 2 drywell. Shutting down the unit prior to the fall outage to repair the IRMs requires an unnecessary power maneuver that involves proceeding to cold shutdown and de-inerting the drywell.

40|$|The {{design of}} the {{gastight}} <b>safety</b> <b>enclosure</b> for {{a nuclear power plant}} depends on the estimate of the energy release during the warst credible accident postulated for the primary system. The potential sources of energy include nuclear excursions, chemical reactions of liquid·metal coolonts with oir, release of stored thermal energy from pressurized systems, and chemical reactions between reactor core materials and water. Same of the factors to be evaluated in designing a containment shell are: Vessel size and shape, static and dynamic loading, construction materials, supporting structure, protection of the shell from damage by effects of explosive energy releases, tightness requirements, and leakage testing procedures. In the majority of cases the vertical cylindrical steel shell is used as containment vessel for small (prototype-) plants and the spherical steel shell for large power plants. Representative examples are the cylindrical container enclosing the EBWR-plant and the spherical container enclosing the primary system of the Dresden nuclear power plant. - Alternatively, reactor systems can be enclosed in chambers loated in rock.
