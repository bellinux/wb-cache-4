50|$|A Panhard rod (also called Panhard bar or track bar) is a <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> that {{provides}} lateral {{location of the}} axle. Originally invented by the Panhard automobile company of France {{in the early twentieth}} century, this device has been widely used ever since.|$|E
50|$|The fixed-length {{driveshaft}} as {{the upper}} <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> remained, but the lower wishbone became a fabricated steel box section {{with a much}} wider base. Putting {{the front and rear}} pivots of the wishbones so far apart meant that the radius arms could be (and were) eliminated.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the wheel and tire's motion is {{constrained}} by the <b>suspension</b> <b>links</b> on the vehicle, the motion of the wheel package in the front view will scribe an imaginary arc in space with an [...] "instantaneous center" [...] of rotation at any given point along its path. The instant center for any wheel package can be found by following imaginary lines drawn through the <b>suspension</b> <b>links</b> to their intersection point.|$|R
5000|$|The {{speed at}} which weight {{transfer}} occurs {{as well as through}} which components it transfers is complex and is determined by many factors including but not limited to roll center height, spring and damper rates, anti-roll bar stiffness and the kinematic design of the <b>suspension</b> <b>links.</b> In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements such as springs, dampers and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be [...] "elastic", while the weight which is transferred through more rigid <b>suspension</b> <b>links</b> such as A-arms and toe links is said to be [...] "geometric".|$|R
50|$|The 2016 all {{wheel drive}} version of the Fiat 500X {{crossover}} based on the Jeep Renegade uses multi-link Chapman strut suspension at the rear, with MacPherson struts at the front. Although the driveshafts are a <b>suspension</b> <b>link,</b> making this a Chapman strut, there are additional transverse links as well.|$|E
50|$|For 2004, a new, {{inverted}} rear <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> was added, {{and a new}} exhaust {{was introduced}} at the Sachsenring round. The RC211V riders were unable to keep Rossi (now on a Yamaha YZR-M1) from winning his fourth premier-class championship, and no clear candidate appeared to take over Rossi's role of lead development rider for Honda.|$|E
5000|$|Today {{the only}} {{use of the}} name Panhard is the [...] "Panhard rod" [...] (also called Panhard bar). This is a <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> invented by Panhard that {{provides}} lateral location of the axle. This device has been widely used ever since on other automobiles or as after-market upgrade to rear axles for vintage American cars.|$|E
5000|$|Aerodynamically, bargeboards act {{primarily}} as flow conditioners, smoothing and redirecting the turbulent or [...] "dirty" [...] {{air in the}} wake of the front wing, the front <b>suspension</b> <b>links,</b> and the rotating front wheels.|$|R
50|$|Radius rods are customarily made of stamped {{steel or}} {{aluminum}} for lightness, {{as they are}} part of the vehicle's unsprung weight. Improvements in composite materials technology make possible plastic <b>suspension</b> <b>links,</b> although they are still uncommon.|$|R
50|$|Jacking {{forces are}} {{the sum of}} the {{vertical}} force components experienced by the <b>suspension</b> <b>links.</b> The resultant force acts to lift the sprung mass if the roll center is above ground, or compress it if underground. Generally, the higher the roll center, the more jacking force is experienced.|$|R
5000|$|Transverse {{leaf springs}} when {{used as a}} <b>suspension</b> <b>link,</b> or four quarter elliptics {{on one end of}} a car are similar to {{wishbones}} in geometry, but are more compliant. Examples are the front of the original Fiat 500, the Panhard Dyna Z and the early examples of Peugeot 403 and the back of the AC Ace and AC Aceca.|$|E
50|$|A {{radius rod}} (also called a radius arm or a torque arm) is a <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> {{intended}} to control wheel {{motion in the}} longitudinal (fore-aft) direction. The link is connected (with a rubber or solid bushing) on {{one end to the}} wheel carrier or axle, on the other to the chassis or unibody of the vehicle. Radius rods are also sometimes used in aircraft with fixed (non retractable) undercarriages.|$|E

The strut-based suspension uses a {{transverse leaf spring}} to function as both ride and anti-roll spring. The ZF concept differs from the system used on the Corvette by using the leaf spring {{as one of the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>links.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium front subframe. Aluminium {{is used for}} the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of [...] V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several <b>suspension</b> <b>links,</b> to compensate for the heavier steel subframe.|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} suspensions, a <b>suspension</b> <b>link,</b> {{control link}} or link is a suspension member, that attaches at only two points. One point being the body or {{frame of the}} vehicle and the other point attaching to the knuckle, upright, axle or another link. The link pivots on either a bushing or a ball joint at each attachment point. A link differs from a control arm because it can only control one of the degrees of freedom by itself.|$|E
50|$|The 43 bhp, 948 cc OHV engine (coded 9CC) {{was derived}} from the Austin A35 and Morris Minor 1000 models, also BMC products, but {{upgraded}} with twin 1 inch SU carburettors. The rack and pinion steering {{was derived from}} the Morris Minor 1000 and the front suspension from the Austin A35. The front suspension was a coil spring and wishbone arrangement, with the arm of the Armstrong lever shock absorber serving as the top <b>suspension</b> <b>link.</b> The rear axle was both located and sprung by quarter-elliptic leaf springs, again with lever-arm shock absorbers and top links. There were no exterior door handles; the driver and passenger were required to reach inside to open the door. There was also no boot lid, owing to the need to retain as much structural integrity as possible, and access to the spare wheel and luggage compartment was achieved by tilting the seat-backs forward and reaching under the rear deck, a process likened to potholing by many owners, but which resulted in a large space available to store soft baggage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{badge of}} the Order is a blue {{enamelled}} gold Maltese cross with white enamelled borders with small gold balls on the points and blue diagonal lozenges between the arms also with white enamelled borders. Each of these lozenges bears a gold letter, V. I. B. I., representing the words Virgini Immaculatae Bavaria Immaculata ("Immaculate Bavaria for the Immaculate Virgin"). The round gold medallion {{in the center}} has {{the image of the}} Virgin Mary within a white enamelled border. The reverse of the badge has the same design except that the arms of the cross are enamelled red, the blue lozenges bear the letters I. V. P. F., representing the words Justis Vt Palma Fiorebit ("Distinguished for Justice and Glory") and the center gold medallion is of Saint George slaying the Dragon within a green enamelled laurel wreath. The badge hangs from a light blue silk moire ribbon with white stripes near its border with narrow dark blue stripes on the inside of these white stripes by means of a <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> {{in the form of a}} gold lion's head holding in its mouth a blue reverse crescent shaped handle of the gold and enamel strapwork supporting the badge proper.The officials of the order wore a special heraldic cross, a Maltese cross like the former, but with its round central medallion bearing the red cross of St. George on a white background and on its upper and lower arms a gold lion rampart on black background (i.e., the arms of the Electorate of the Palatinate) and on the right and left arms three blue lozenges on a white background (i.e., the arms of the Duchy of Bavaria). Between the arms of the cross are lozenges bearing the letters I. V. I. B. on a blue background, but without the white enameled borders. This cross hangs from the same gold lionâ€™s head suspension cross as the badge of the order.|$|E
5000|$|It was a {{front wheel}} drive car, with an all {{independent}} <b>suspension</b> <b>linked</b> by fluid filled chambers, which was called Hydrolastic suspension by the company. The suspension gave a comfortable ride, only suffering a little from [...] "droop" [...] if overloaded in the boot, and sometimes going into oversteer if the body rolled too much with hard cornering.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the <b>suspension</b> <b>links,</b> with <b>suspension</b> forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The swing axle shafts were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] Ä°zmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, Ä°zmir, 2006 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 40 - 41) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiii, 41 leavesIn this study, {{the natural}} frequencies, body displacements, velocities, and accelerations of a quarter-car with double wishbone suspension are examined {{by considering the}} proportionally damped system. Two models of quarter-car suspension system are idealized employing two different assumptions due to the suspension links to describe the dynamic behaviour of vehicles running on base excitation. In the first model, the links of the suspension {{are assumed to be}} rigid and the stiffness and mass matrices of the model are obtained by using the analytical method. In the second model, the links of the suspension are assumed to be flexible and the elastic stiffness, mass, and geometric stiffness matrices are obtained by using Finite Element Method. In order to express the linear equation of motion, <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> forces required for the geometric stiffness matrices are assumed as constant. Also, the oscillations of the suspension links are neglected since the base displacement is chosen in small amplitude. Two Matlab programs regarding the aforementioned models have been developed. Firstly, the natural frequencies of the models are found. Then, the displacements, velocities, and acceleration of the car body are presented in graphical forms for the specified car speed. The excellent agreement between results of the analytical model and finite element model is observed for both natural frequencies and the time reponses. The effect of loads on <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> on the dynamic behaviour of suspension system is also studied...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{wishbone}} is a hinged <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> between the chassis and the suspension hub that carries the wheel. This paper describes the failure analysis of a lower wishbone (control arm) in a light commercial vehicle which {{had been involved in}} service loading. The wishbone was analyzed in two ways. In order to investigate reason of the failure, finite element modelling was conducted to evaluate stress distribution and reliability of wishbone. Moreover, the metallographic and hardness evaluation were made on weld seam of the failed part. From metallographic observations, the presence of porosity was found in weld seam. Hardness distributions from the parent material to weld region are measured in the expected range. The results of finite element analysis and metallographic examination showed that the fatigue failure was initiated from highly stressed region in weld seam, and the presence of porosity stimulated crack initiation as well as crack growth...|$|E
30|$|It {{is a big}} {{challenge}} to reduce part weight without decreasing its performance. Many scholars have conducted the research on this topic. Nguyen et al. [3] presented a heuristic optimization method in combination with additive manufacturing for synthesizing large mesoscale lattice structure of complex shaped parts. Park et al. [4] proposed a weight reduction design process of <b>suspension</b> <b>link,</b> {{which was based on}} the variation of von-Mises stress contour by substituting an aluminum alloys (A 356) having tensile strength of 310 MPa grade instead of STKM 11 A steels. Raj et al. [5] evaluated the performance of two different design configurations of a bimetal brake drum by means of dynamometer test in order toÂ improve heat dissipation and to reduce its weight. Zhang et al. [6] used the orthogonal experiment method to optimize the structure of ship unloader and realized the light weight design. Tan et al. [7] proposed a linkage-based evolutionary design method of the part structure to solve the unified representation problem between the geometric elements and the design intent attached to the geometric elements. Zhang et al. [8] established the design guidelines of equivalent static toughness for using aluminum hubs and rims instead of the original steel components to reduce the weight of action components of heavy vehicle. Qu et al. [9] proposed an algorithm by combining ant colony algorithm with a mutation-based local search and used for a real crane metal structure optimal design.|$|E
50|$|Like the NGR Class Hendrie D {{which it}} was based on and which was later {{designated}} the SAR Class 3, the Class 3B had plate frames, Walschaerts valve gear and Belpaire fireboxes. They were the first of Hendrie's designs to have superheaters and, as a result, piston valves instead of slide valves. They also sported a new design of leading bogie with cast-steel framing and three-point <b>suspension</b> <b>links.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{typically}} {{used with a}} MacPherson strut, but can also be applied to a double wishbone suspension. In either case, {{the difference is that}} the single bottom wishbone is replaced by a pair of <b>suspension</b> <b>links</b> forming a trapezoidal four-bar linkage. This allows the kingpin to pivot about a pivot point nearer the center of the wheel's contact patch instead of the traditional pivot point at the ball joint of the bottom wishbone.|$|R
40|$|Copyright Â© 2003 SAE International The {{existing}} vehicle designs {{exhibit a}} high level of coupling. For instance the coupling in the suspension and steering systems manifests itself through the change in wheel alignment parameters (WAP) due to suspension travel. This change in the WAP causes directional instability and tire-wear. The approach of the industry to solve this problem has been twofold. The first approach has been optimization of <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> lengths to reduce the change in WAP to zero. Since this is not possible with the existing architecture, the solution used is the optimization of the spring stiffness K to get a compromise solution for comfort (which requires significant suspension travel and hence a soft spring) and directional stability (which demands least possible change in wheel alignment parameters and hence a stiff spring). This paper presents an axiomatic design solution to this problem and an attempt to remove the coupling in the steering and suspension systems by making the WAP independent of suspension travel. The four-bar linkages used in the existing independent suspension systems are incapable of satisfying their FRs and cause coupling at a higher level. The proposed solution uses a six-bar Watt-I linkage suspension, which removes the coupling. It offers other advantages like the hardening characteristics for the suspension. A new steering system conformal to the new suspension system has been proposed. FR/DP decomposition of the vehicle systems is presented. This indicates other couplings and DP redundancies in the vehicle system and also provides the framework for design of novel vehicles...|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} double-wishbone front suspension {{was replaced}} with a dual joint multilink design, with an all-electric system. To increase rigidity and lower unsprung weight, forged aluminum is now used for the <b>suspension</b> <b>links,</b> front steering knuckles, and rear hub carriers. along with a single-piece hollow die-cast aluminum front subframe with machined mounting points, and {{approximately half of the}} body uses high-tensile steel. Overall the amount of laser welding has been doubled compared to the previous model.|$|R
