40|$|Abstract — The {{second heart}} sound, S 2, is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} comprised of aortic (A 2) and pulmonary (P 2) components. Previously, the normalized splitting interval (NSI) between the A 2 and P 2 components {{has been shown to}} be proportional to the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). A set of fully automated algorithms based on adaptive modeling of A 2 /P 2 components using chirplets were developed to provide real-time estimates of PAP. The method was tested on 16 pigs which were administered drugs to induce pulmonary hypertension. Simultaneous reference pressure measurements were obtained with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC). Estimation of PAP in pigs using the new techniques resulted in a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 84 and <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> (<b>SEE)</b> of 9. 2 mmHg. This is in line with echocardiography studies, which have a performance ranging from r= 0. 69 - 0. 91 and SEE from 5 to 12 mmHg when compared to PAC measurements. It is also consistent with previous results based on a manual estimation of PAP derived through image processing methods. Based on these findings, this method has the potential to offer continuous non-invasive monitoring of PAP...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} a DIF flaggbzg method {{based on}} loss functions. The approach builds on earlier research {{that involved the}} development of an empirical Bayes (EB) enhancement to Mantel-Haenszel (MH) DIF analysis. The posterior dis-tribution of DIF parameters was estimated nd used to obtain the posterior expected loss for the proposed approach ndfor competing classification rules. Under reasonable assumptions about the relative seriousness of Type I and Type II errors, the loss-function-based DIF etection rule was found to perform better than the comnzonly used "A, " "B, " and "C " DIF classification system, especially in small samples. The results of a ManteI-Haenszel (MH; 1959) analysis of differential item functioning (DIF) typically include an index of the magnitude of DIF, along with an estimated <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> (<b>see</b> Holland & Thayer, 1988). Decisions about whether to discard items or flag them for review are typically based on the statistical significance of the MH chi-square or the magnitude of the MH odds ratio estimate. An approach to DIF classification that incorporates both these criteria is the system developed by Educational Testing Service (ETS) for categorizing DIF as negligible ("A"), slight to moderate ("B"), or moderate to severe ("C"). In this study, we explore an alternative DIF detection method based on loss functions. A decision is made to identify an item as a potential DIF item if the expected loss associated with failing to flag the item is greater than that associ-ated with flagging the item. The work was a spin-off of earlier research (Zwick, Thayer, & Lewis, 1997; in press) in which we used a Bayesian variant of the ETS DIF classification system to estimate the probabilities that the true DIF fo...|$|E
40|$|Planting and {{harvesting}} times drive cropland phenology. There are few datasets that derive explicit phenological metrics, and these datasets use the visible to near infrared (VNIR) spectrum. Many different {{methods have been}} used to derive phenometrics such as Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS), leading to differing results. This discrepancy is partly due to spatial and temporal compositing of the VNIR satellite data to minimize data gaps resulting from cloud cover, atmospheric aerosols, and solar illumination constraints. Phenometrics derived from the downward Convex Quadratic model (CxQ) include Peak Height (PH) and Thermal Time to Peak (TTP), which are more consistent than SOS and EOS because they are minimally affected by snow and frost and other non-vegetation related issues. Here, we have determined PH using the vegetation optical depth (VOD) in three microwave frequencies (6. 925, 10. 65 and 18. 7 GHz) and accumulated growing degree-days derived from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS) data at a spatial resolution of 25 km. We focus on 50 AMSR-E cropland pixels in the major grain production areas of Northern Eurasia (Ukraine, southwestern Russia, and northern Kazakhstan) for 2003 – 2010. We compared the land surface phenologies of AMSR-E VOD and MODIS NDVI data. VOD time series tracked cropland seasonal dynamics similar to that recorded by the NDVI. The coefficients of determination for the CxQ model fit of the NDVI data were high for all sites (0. 78 < R 2 < 0. 99). The 10. 65 GHz VOD (VOD 1065 GHz) achieved the best linear regression fit (R 2 = 0. 84) with lowest <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> (<b>SEE</b> = 0. 128); it is therefore recommended for microwave VOD studies of cropland land surface phenology. Based on an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) analysis, the slopes from the linear regression fit were not significantly different by microwave frequency, whereas the intercepts were significantly different, given the different magnitudes of the VODs. PHs for NDVI and VOD were highly correlated. Despite their strong correspondence, there was generally a lag of AMSR-E PH VOD 10. 65 GHz by about two weeks compared to MODIS peak greenness. To evaluate the utility of the PH determination based on maximum value, we correlated the CxQ derived and maximum value determined PHs of NDVI and found that they were highly correlated with R 2 of 0. 87, but with a one-week bias. Considering the one-week bias between the two methods, we find that PH of VOD 10. 65 GHz lags PH of NDVI by three weeks. We conclude, therefore, that maximum-value based PH of VOD can be a complementary phenometric for the CxQ model derived PH NDVI, especially in cloud and aerosol obscured regions of the world...|$|E

Variable selection procedures included factor analysis followed by forward-stepping regression and polynomial analysis. For both {{the male and female}} samples, two quadratic equations utilizing either the sum of three or seven skinfold measures were derived.

40|$|Incremental {{treadmill}} VO 2 max protocols {{are often}} considered the superior method of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness. These exercise test protocols stress aerobic energy production pathways. However, {{at the point}} of VO 2 max attainment anaerobic energy systems are the predominant mechanisms of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Likewise, the Wingate cycle test, a commonly accepted method of anaerobic capacity assessment stresses anaerobic energy pathways. Based on the utilization of energy production pathways {{at the point of}} VO 2 max and maximal anaerobic capacity attainment a relationship between VO 2 max and Wingate exercise test protocols may exist. This potential relationship may facilitate the prediction of cardiorespiratory fitness from maximal anaerobic capacity assessed by an incremental treadmill VO 2 max test and Wingate cycle test respectively. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop prediction equations (gender-independent, gender specific) that predict maximal aerobic capacity using anaerobic power measurements (peak power, mean power, fatigue index) obtained during a 30 second Wingate cycle test as the primary predictor variables along with demographics (sex, age), anthropometrics (height, weight, body fat, seven site skinfolds, thigh girth, hip girth) and resting heart rate as secondary predictor variables.

When the performance of the parametric bootstrap method was investigated, bivariate polynomial log-linear models were employed to fit the data. With the consideration of the different polynomial degrees and two different numbers of cross-product moments, a total of eight parametric bootstrap models were examined. Two real datasets were used as the basis to define the population distributions and the 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 SEEs. A simulation study was conducted reflecting three levels for group proficiency differences, three levels of sample sizes, two test lengths and two ratios of the number of common items and the total number of items. Bias of the <b>SEE,</b> <b>standard</b> <b>errors</b> of the <b>SEE,</b> root mean square <b>errors</b> of the <b>SEE,</b> and their corresponding weighted indices were calculated and used to evaluate and compare the simulation results. The main findings from this simulation study were as follows: (1) The parametric bootstrap models with larger polynomial degrees generally produced smaller bias but larger <b>standard</b> <b>errors</b> than those with lower polynomial degrees. (2) The parametric bootstrap models with a higher order cross product moment (CPM) of two generally yielded more accurate estimates of the SEE than the corresponding models with the CPM of one.

40|$|For fMRI time-series {{analysis}} to be statistically valid, {{it is important}} to deal correctly with temporal autocorrelation in the noise. Most of the approaches in the literature adopt a two-stage approach in which the autocorrelation structure is estimated using the residuals of an initial model fit. This estimate is then used to "prewhiten" the data and the model before the model is refit to obtain final activation parameter estimates. An assumption implicit in this scheme is that the residuals from the initial model fit represent a realization of the "true" noise process. In general this assumption will not be correct as certain components of the noise will be removed by the model fit. In this paper we examine (i) the form of the bias induced by the initial model fit, (ii) methods of correcting for the bias, and (iii) the impact of bias correction on the model parameter estimates. We find that while bias correction does result in more accurate estimates of the correlation structure, this does not translate into improved estimates of the model parameters.

The obtained CoMFA model showed high predictive ability with q 2 = 0. 556, r 2 = 0. 936 and <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of estimation (<b>SEE)</b> = 0. 231, explaining a majority of the variance in the data with four principal components. The result of the present study shows good correlation between descriptors and biological activity. On the basis of statistical significance of the generated model the results can be utilized in the design of new more potent benzyl vinylogous derivatives as PDE 3 B inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{miniaturized}} assay, referred to as Carrier-Mediated Distribution System (CAMDIS) for fast and reliable measurement of octanol/water distribution coefficients, log D(oct). By introducing a filter support for octanol, phase separation from water is facilitated and the tendency of emulsion formation (emulsification) at the interface is reduced. A guideline for the best practice of CAMDIS is given, describing a strategy to manage drug adsorption at the filter-supported octanol/buffer interface. We validated the assay {{on a set of}} 52 structurally diverse drugs with known shake flask log D(oct) values. Excellent agreement with literature data (r(2) = 0. 996, <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of estimate, <b>SEE</b> = 0. 111), high reproducibility (standard deviation, SD < 0. 1 log D(oct) units), minimal sample consumption (10 μL of 100 μM DMSO stock solution) and a broad analytical range (log D(oct) range = - 0. 5 to 4. 2) make CAMDIS a valuable tool for the high-throughput assessment of log D(oc) t...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{estimates}} of human body composition determined from single-frequency bioelectrical impedance methods (S-BIM) and multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance methods (M-BIM). The human body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 5 brands of S-BIM, and 2 brands of M-BIM. Forty-five women, aged 26 - 58 years, served as subjects. The S-BIM and M-BIM fat-free mass (FFM) estimates were highly correlated with the FFM measured by DEXA (r= 0. 82 - 0. 93). The <b>standard</b> <b>errors</b> of estimate (<b>SEE)</b> for FFM were approximately 2 kg. With the exception of the MLT- 100 (which slightly underestimated FFM), all brands of BIM slightly overestimated FFM. The absolute mean differences between FFM_ and each of the 7 BIM estimates ranged from - 3. 02 kg to 3. 46 kg. Although the 7 brands of BIM provided slightly different estimates, the results of this study suggest that S-BIM and M-BIM are relatively valid in human body composition...|$|R
40|$|Reliability, {{precision}} and smallest detectable change The reliability {{of a test}} refers to {{the proportion of the}} total variance that is error-free. In clinical practice our interest usually concerns a patient’s “true score ” on the variable that we are trying to measure. The observed score is an estimate of this unmeasurable true score, and the question is how far the observed score can be “off the mark”. This can be calculated using the <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of measurement (SEM). [1] When we are trying to evaluate change scores, then we are dealing with two measurements, each with a measurement error. The question is how big a change should be before we can confidently conclude that there is a real change instead of chance fluctuation. This can be calculated using the <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of estimate (<b>SEE).</b> [1] Methods We used the data of studies C through J pooled together (total n = 1, 424). As an estimate of the reliability of the 4 DSQ scales we calculated the internal consistency coefficient Cronbach’s α [1]. The <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of measurement (SEM), being the standard deviation of infinite repeated measurements (under the same condition) around their mean, and thus the standard deviation of infinite repeated measurements around the “true score”, can be used to determine how far one measurement can be off the mark as an estimate of the “true score ” [1]. We calculated the SEM from the standard deviation and the α coefficient of the scores, using the formula: SEM...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to (a) modify previously published VO 2 (max) equations using the constant error (CE) values for aerobically trained females, (b) cross-validate the modified equations to determine their accuracy for estimating VO 2 (max) in aerobically trained females, (c) derive a new nonexercise-based equation for estimating VO 2 (max) in aerobically trained females if the modified equations are found to be inaccurate, and (d) cross-validate the new VO 2 (max) equation using the PRESS statistic and an independent sample of aerobically trained females. METHODS: A total of 115 aerobically trained females (mean +/- SD: age = 38. 5 +/- 9. 4 yr) performed a maximal incremental test on a cycle ergometer to determine actual VO 2 (max). The predicted VO 2 (max) values from nine published equations were compared with actual VO 2 (max) by examining the CE, <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of estimate (<b>SEE),</b> validity coefficient (r), and total error (TE). RESULTS: Cross-validation of the modified nonexercise-based equations on a random subsample of 50 subjects resulted in a...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted on simultaneous flow through culvert and over broad-crested weir. The flow at the culvert outlet is considered as submerged flow. Both the culvert and the broad-crested weir (BCW) widths {{are smaller than}} the channel width. The characteristics of the simultaneous flow through both structures {{and the effects of}} flow and geometrical parameters of the structure were presented {{in the first part of}} this paper. In this part, discharge prediction models are developed using (a) multiple linear regression, (b) basic discharge equations of BCW and culvert and (c) artificial neural networks. The prediction and performance of each of the three models are compared using four criteria, namely, (i) mean relative absolute error, MRAE, (ii) root mean square error RMSE, (iii) coefficient of correlation, R, and <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of estimate, <b>SEE.</b> Analysis of results indicated that the ANNs are powerful prediction tool compared to other models followed by the model based on the basic discharge equations of BCW and culvert. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to reflect the relative importance of the involved variables...|$|R
