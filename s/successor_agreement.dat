40|$|The Bristol Accord, agreed at an EU Ministerial Informal {{meeting in}} December 2005, was the UK‟s {{contribution}} to the emerging EU urban agenda. Although nominally positioned within contemporary European debates on sustainable urban development and linked to previous Ministerial Informals on urban policy, {{it can be seen}} {{as an example of the}} „uploading‟ of national policy to the EU policy arena. This paper argues that by drawing too closely on domestic policy agendas (as well as the very wide-ranging nature of the sustainable communities agenda) little has resulted from the Accord. This contrasts with the more sustained legacy of the Leipzig Charter, the 2007 <b>successor</b> <b>agreement</b> to the Bristol Accord which, while also an example of the uploading of national policy, has been more successful in tapping into the mainstream of EU urban policy...|$|E
40|$|Avoided {{deforestation}} can {{be characterized}} as the use of financial incentives to reduce rates of deforestation and forest degradation, with much of the focus on forests in tropical countries. While avoided deforestation, as a policy issue, is not new, the current debate in academic and policy circles on including it in future climate change mitigation strategies such as the Clean Development Mechanism is gathering pace – and this debate is only likely to intensify as negotiations continue over what {{should be included in the}} <b>successor</b> <b>agreement</b> to the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012. Up until now, however, the debate in terms of the scientific and economic implications of avoided deforestation has not been brought together. This book aims to bring together important research findings in the area along with their policy implications, whilst linking avoided deforestation to political economy as well as to the latest developments in environmental and natural resource economics...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} family-related {{factors that can}} {{influence}} the succession process in small and medium-sized family businesses are empirically investigated.  The dependent variable {{in this study is}} measured by two underlying dimensions, namely satisfaction with the process and continued profitability of the business.  The empirical results indicate that the family-related factors that influence both the aforementioned dimensions are the mutual acceptance of roles, the relationship between the owner-manager and successor, and family harmony.  The continued profitability of the business is also influenced by the agreement to continue the business. The existence of family harmony in itself influences the relationship between the owner-manager and <b>successor,</b> the <b>agreement</b> to continue the business, as well as the mutual acceptance of roles.  The managerial implications of these empirical findings are discussed and recommendations offered...|$|R

40|$|One way {{to obtain}} a global public good {{is to set up}} an {{institution}} to buy it, with {{the nations of the world}} contributing to the cost according to whatever sharing arrangements make political sense. An example would be the purchase of the services of national armed forces to carry out peacekeeping, with the cost separately apportioned. In these notes I suggest a way to exploit this approach to limiting accumulations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The “service ” that produces the control is the reduction, by nations, in the levels of emissions over time from what they would otherwise choose, also known as the “business as usual ” emissions path. In the scheme as envisioned, which could be used in a <b>successor</b> <b>agreement</b> to the Kyoto Protocol, the fact that all nations are sellers of reductions ameliorates the enforcement problems typical of commitments to particular emission paths. Another difference from the Kyoto-style system: In the scheme sketched here, the distributive of burdens is explicit, rather than implicit in the allowable emission amounts. The conflation of distributive and allocational issues is, arguably, an unnecessary source of contention in the design of institutions to contro...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{research}} paper, and hence it represents research in progress. The views expressed in this paper should {{be attributed to the}} author. Comments are welcome. 2 The Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAS) is currently engaged in negotiations with the European Union over the <b>successor</b> <b>agreement</b> to the Lome IV Convention which grants non-reciprocal preferential access to the European market for exports of African Caribbean and Pacific countries. The main objective of the new Economic partnership agreement (EPA) is the ‘‘eradication of poverty in a consistent manner with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries in the world economy’’. Preliminary discussions have suggested the establishment of a Free Trade Area (FTA) between ECOWAS and European Union in accordance with the relevant WTO rules, eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers progressively and help further integration among West African countries. The new regime adopted under the Cotonou Agreement also addresses the issue of trade related aid in particular to compensate fiscal revenue loss and address supply-side constraints. In this paper, we use the standard Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model to assess the prospectiv...|$|E
40|$|Any post-Kyoto {{climate change}} treaty regime must seek to fully engage {{the use of}} carbon sinks to {{complement}} emissions reduction measures in order {{to comply with the}} treaty 2 ̆ 7 s mandates. The Kyoto Protocol did not include avoided deforestation as a mechanism for earning emission reduction credits. However, reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) quickly gained popularity as a viable climate change compliance strategy in the period immediately preceding the negotiations at the Fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP 15) in Copenhagen in 2009. The Copenhagen Accord is replete with references to REDD as a focus for the international community 2 ̆ 7 s progression toward a binding <b>successor</b> <b>agreement</b> to the Kyoto Protocol. Ocean iron fertilization (OlF) is an emerging and controversial strategy to promote climate change treaty compliance, and may be the next step in engaging the creative use of carbon sinks to fulfill carbon reduction mandates. Both REDD and OIF must overcome challenges such as developing effective monitoring techniques, ensuring the 2 ̆ 2 permanence 2 ̆ 2 of emission reductions, and avoiding 2 ̆ 2 leakage 2 ̆ 2 of such reductions. Like REDD, OIF could promote a global carbon trading market that may help ensure the success of a post-Kyoto climate change treaty.

40|$|The Cotonou <b>Agreement,</b> <b>successor</b> to the Lome Convention, offers African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) {{countries}} {{preferential access}} to EU markets by establishing economic partnership agreements (EPAs) between the EU and blocks of ACP {{countries that are}} members of regional trading arrangements. ACP countries entering such arrangements could retain preferential access to the EU market, but on a reciprocal basis. This paper presents a relatively simple method (with moderate data requirements) to measure the likely short-run welfare consequences, static effects on trade flows and tariff revenue, of such an arrangement for ACP countries. The partial equilibrium method is illustrated for {{the case of the}} East African Cooperation (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). The analysis suggests that the welfare effects (excluding revenue effects) from a reciprocal agreement with the EU will be small, whether positive or negative, but ACP countries will experience short-run adjustment costs, especially in the form of revenue losses...|$|R

Mr Greenidge, who trained as an economist with a specialisation in agricultural economics, is the third person to lead the organisation. Prior to taking up his new assignment, he was Deputy Secretary General of the General Secretariat of the ACP Group of States in Brussels, a position he held since 1992. In his native Guyana, Mr Greenidge first lectured in agricultural economics and subsequently served as Minister of Finance for almost a decade. As architect of the country s Structural Adjustment Programme, he is credited with helping to rescue Guyana from {{a long period of}} economic decline. His professional interests have been in agricultural planning, with particular reference to the effect of agricultural innovations on rural incomes in Africa, the role of rural markets in development and the management of fisheries resources. His book on land settlement schemes in Guyana, which deals with the empowerment of the peasantry, is about to be published. Mr Greenidge comes to CTA well versed in ACP-EU affairs having experienced the negotiation of many ACP-EU cooperation agreements at first-hand, including the protracted negotiations to establish a <b>successor</b> <b>agreement</b> to Lomé IV.

Paper versions also available for check out or consultation in the University of Oregon's library under the call number: K 3884. S 74 2006 In the anarchical structure of international politics, relative treaty effectiveness {{has proven to}} be a difficult task to accomplish concerning environmental issues. Not only do the authors of these agreements face the challenge of negotiating a functional structure of rules and regulations amongst diversified interests, but they are also confronted with the undertakings of implementation and compliance. As each environmental issue varies in scope and urgency, the number of actors, the kinds of obligations, the type of monitoring, and their related responses fluctuate according to the distinct individual situation. Because of this oscillation, evaluating the overall effectiveness of these environmental treaties proves to be extremely complicated, as no two treaties are the same. Theory on successful regimes, thus, can only be achieved through the comparison of different agreements with similar treaty mechanisms. Through this type of analysis, political scientists hope to develop an increasingly comprehensive model for treaty effectiveness pertaining to environmental issues. The International Tropical Timber Agreements of 1983 and 1994 were established with the hopes of lowering the deforestation rate of tropical timber without encumbering the market growth of developing member nations. This objective would be achieved through forest conservation and management efforts that would produce a growing market of timber from sustainably managed sources. After careful examination of these two treaties, one can conclude that the 1983 and 1994 Tropical Timber Agreements were both effective in altering m(,nber state behavior in the pursuance of decreased deforestation levels and increased sustainability in timber products. While the increased market transparency promoted in both agreements was successful in reducing member exports of tropical timber, the Bali Fund, established in the <b>successor</b> <b>agreement,</b> 1 encouraged the increased exportation of resources from only sustainably managed resources by the year 2000 through enhanced financial assistance. Together, the two International Tropical Timber Agreements gave consuming and producing parties strong incentive to decrease the rate of tropical timber deforestation...|$|E
