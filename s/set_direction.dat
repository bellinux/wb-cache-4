25|$|After the Great Depression hit {{the world}} economy in 1929, the Fascist regime {{followed}} other nations in enacting protectionist tariffs and attempted to <b>set</b> <b>direction</b> for the economy. In the 1930s, the government increased wheat production and made Italy self-sufficient for wheat, ending imports of wheat from Canada and the United States. However, the transfer of agricultural land to wheat production reduced the production of vegetables and fruit. Despite improving production for wheat, the situation for peasants themselves did not improve, as 0.5% of the Italian population (usually wealthy) owned 42 percent of all agricultural land in Italy and income for peasants did not increase while taxes did increase. The Depression caused unemployment to rise from 300,000 to 1 million in 1933. It also caused a 10 percent drop in real income and a fall in exports. Italy fared better than most western nations during the Depression: its welfare services did reduce {{the impact of the}} Depression. Its industrial growth from 1913 to 1938 was even greater than that of Germany for the same time period. Only the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian nations had a higher industrial growth during that period.|$|E

2500|$|While {{strategies}} are established to <b>set</b> <b>direction,</b> focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance {{in response to}} the environment, these very elements also mean that certain signals are excluded from consideration or de-emphasized. Mintzberg wrote in 1987: [...] "Strategy is a categorizing scheme by which incoming stimuli can be ordered and dispatched." [...] Since a strategy orients the organization in a particular manner or direction, that direction may not effectively match the environment, initially (if a bad strategy) or over time as circumstances change. As such, Mintzberg continued, [...] "Strategy [...] is a force that resists change, not encourages it." ...|$|E
