5000|$|Thorn EMI House, 5 Upper St. Martin's Lane, London (1959) (Spence's {{original}} exterior was demolished in the 1990s; reborn as Orion House with a full-height {{floor plate}} addition and re-skinned elevations. A 60 ft metal sculpture by Geoffrey Clarke {{for the original}} façade (incorporating allusions to electric lamp filaments) has been remounted onto the added lift and <b>service</b> <b>riser.)</b> ...|$|E
25|$|The service core {{contains}} <b>service</b> <b>risers</b> {{and shared}} facilities, including lifts, a fire stair, dumb waiter for office files, tearooms, and large toilet and shower rooms. The fire stair {{in the service}} core retains original finishes, including black and white terrazzo stair treads and risers, black-painted metal balustrades with black plastic handrails, textured stair undersides, and vinyl tile clad walls with contrasting inset floor numerals.|$|R
2500|$|The {{structure}} is of concrete frame, with a conventionally reinforced jump-formed core containing {{all of the}} lifts, stairs and <b>service</b> <b>risers.</b> The office floors are formed from post-tensioned band beams supporting conventional reinforced slabs. The perimeter of the building has columns spaced [...] apart and supporting post-tensioned edge beams. The support columns were formed from [...] concrete to minimise the column size at ground level.|$|R
50|$|The {{dramatic}} twisting {{geometry of}} the tower posed a significant structural engineering challenge, resolved using a column structure of inclined columns following the twist {{of the building and}} the stiff circular core for torsional stability. 26.6 m² floor plates twist by an equal amount per storey about the circular core, housing lifts and <b>services</b> <b>risers</b> as well as a double-deck lift for service/firefighting and penthouse access.|$|R

5000|$|The {{structure}} is of concrete frame, with a conventionally reinforced jump-formed core containing {{all of the}} lifts, stairs and <b>service</b> <b>risers.</b> The office floors are formed from post-tensioned band beams supporting conventional reinforced slabs. The perimeter of the building has columns spaced 8.2 m apart and supporting post-tensioned edge beams. The support columns were formed from [...] concrete to minimise the column size at ground level.|$|R
50|$|In {{multi-story}} commercial buildings, shear walls form {{at least}} one core (Figure 3). From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including stairs, lifts, toilets and <b>service</b> <b>risers.</b> Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core. From the structural point of view, a shear core could strengthen the building’s resistance to lateral loads, i.e., wind load and seismic load, and significantly increase the building safety.|$|R
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, <b>service</b> <b>risers,</b> store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|R
40|$|Bakalaura darba ietvaros pētīts jautājums par vienu no kopīpašuma aspektiem, t. i., lietošanas kārtības tiesisko regulējumu nekustamam īpašumam. Darbs sastāv no piecām nodaļām, kurās autore apzināja un analizēja lietošanas kārtības jēdzienu, akcentējot ar lietošanas kārtības noteikšanu saistītās problēmas un sniedzot to iespējamos risinājumus. Darbs galvenokārt balstīts uz normatīvo aktu, tiesu prakses un praktiskas dabas situāciju analīzi, kā arī praktizējošu speciālistu viedokļu kritisku vērtēšanu. Pamatojoties uz praksē sastopamo problēmu apkopošanu un analīzi, autore atklāja un darbā atspoguļoja tiesību aktu nepilnības, kam nepieciešams risinājums. Svarīgākās atziņas, kas gūtas no darba - pētījuma procesā būtiska nozīme ir apzināt praksē pastāvošās problēmas saistībā ar lietošanas kārtības nodibināšanu un izbeigšanu, lai tiesību normas pilnveidotu atbilstoši faktiskajai situācijai. The {{issues of}} {{arrangements}} of co-ownership legislation {{have been examined}} in this Bachelor's Paper. The Bachelor`s Paper consists of five chapters, where the author has investigated the practical importance of legislation, highlighted the problems, related to the creation, use and termination of the road easement as well as provided possible solution. The research is mainly based on jurisprudence and the practical situation- analysis as well as critical evaluation of the opinions and amendments offered by law professionals. On {{the basis of the}} analysis of the problems encountered in practice and the information gathered, discovered and reflected on the drawbacks in arrangements of co-ownership legislation and the provision gaps in legal procedure, which should be amended. In research process it is essential to identify practical problems related to the arrangements of co-ownership. Author came to the conclusion law needs improwement regulating the situation, when co-owners participates in court about procedures which govern joint estate use. It could be provisional regulation until court makes decision regarding order of joint iestate use or until sides conclude a settlement. Next important conclusion- should improve law to enlarge question categories in wich can be made with qualified majority. Author offer 2 / 3 quorum version in decisions that are urgent like procedures of electricity payment, roof maintenance and repair, drain and <b>riser</b> <b>service,</b> repair...|$|R
