5000|$|Although the {{applications}} of pharmacometabolomics to personalized medicine are largely only being realized now, {{the study of}} an individual’s metabolism {{has been used to}} treat disease since the Middle Ages. Early physicians employed a primitive form of metabolomic analysis by smelling, tasting and looking at urine to diagnose disease. Obviously the measurement techniques needed to look at specific metabolites were unavailable at that time, but such technologies have evolved dramatically over the last decade to develop precise, high-throughput devices, as well as the accompanying data analysis software to analyze output. Currently, <b>sample</b> <b>purification</b> processes, such as liquid or gas chromatography, are coupled with either mass spectrometry (MS)-based or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analytical methods to characterize the metabolite profiles of individual patients. Continually advancing informatics tools allow for the identification, quantification and classification of metabolites to determine which pathways may influence certain pharmaceutical interventions. One of the earliest studies discussing the principle and applications of pharmacometabolomics was conducted in an animal model to look at the metabolism of paracetamol and liver damage. NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the urinary metabolic profiles of rats pre- and post-treatment with paracetamol. The analysis revealed a certain metabolic profile associated with increased liver damage following paracetamol treatment. [...] At this point, it was eagerly anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches could be applied to personalized human medicine. Since this publication in 2006, the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network led by Duke University researchers and that included partnerships between centers of excellence in metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and informatics (over sixteen academic centers funded by NIGMS) has been able to illustrate {{for the first time the}} power of the pharmacometabolomics approach in informing about treatment outcomes in large clinical studies and with use of drugs that include antidepressants, statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapies and antipsychotics. Totally new concepts emerged from these studies on use of pharmacometabolomics as a tool that can bring a paradigm shift in the field of pharmacology. It illustrated how pharmacometabolomics can enable a Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology approach. Pharmacometabolomics has been applied for the treatment of numerous human diseases, such as schizophrenia, diabetes, neural disease, depression and cancer.|$|E

DNase treatment of diluted total RNA samples followed by phenol extraction is the optimal way to remove genomic DNA contamination.

40|$|Formestane (4 -hydroxy-androstenedione) is an {{aromatase}} inhibitor prohibited {{in sports}} and included, since 2004, {{in the list of}} prohibited substances updated yearly by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Since the endogenous production of formestane has been described, it is mandatory for the anti-doping laboratories to use isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to establish the exogenous origin before issuing an adverse analytical finding. The described IRMS methods for formestane detection are time-consuming, requiring usually two consecutive liquid chromatographic <b>sample</b> <b>purifications</b> in order to have final extracts of adequate purity before the mass spectrometric analysis. After establishing a procedure for the determination of the origin of formestane by IRMS without the need of derivatization, and integrated in the overall analytical strategy of the laboratory for pseudo-endogenous steroids, a mass spectrometric analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) of formestane metabolites was carried out in order to investigate whether other biomarkers of formestane abuse could be integrated in order to avoid time-consuming and expensive IRMS confirmations for formestane.

40|$|AbstractProtocols for the {{analysis}} of the sulfhydryl content in peptides and proteins using chemical derivatization by organomercurial reagents and analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) have been developed. The number of reactive cysteine residues in peptides and proteins can be determined by exploiting the affinity and selectivity of organomercurial reagents for macromolecular thiols. Mass shifts observed in MALDI mass spectra obtained before and after cysteine derivatization with p-hydroxy-mercuribenzoate (pHMB) permit the number of free sulfhydryl groups to be determined. The pHMB derivative of each free cysteine residue provides a mass shift of 321 u, overcoming limitations in the mass resolution of MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Reactive cysteine residues in a macromolecule can be selectively derivatized by using a fivefold molar excess of pHMB reagent. Total sulfhydryl content (i. e., cysteine and cystine) can be determined after disulfide reduction. However, analyses for total cysteine content are more complex, requiring protein denaturation, cystine reduction, and <b>sample</b> <b>purification</b> before derivatization and analysis by MALDI-MS.

Many peptides clustered into sets of overlapping sequences with ladder-like truncation clearly associated to proteolytic processes of both endo-and exoproteases activity.
