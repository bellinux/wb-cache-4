5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, the second <b>stage</b> cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second <b>stage</b> {{attitude}} control system was pressurised.

Towards the end of the coast period, the third <b>stage</b> was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third <b>stage</b> separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third <b>stage</b> was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E

A return to France saw the next <b>stage</b> take place between Arc-et-Senans to Besançon. The next stages, ten and eleven, went into the Alps, and stages twelve and {{thirteen}} took the Tour down to the Mediterranean coast at Cap d'Agde. <b>Stage</b> fourteen moved the race into the east of Pyrenees, before a transitional <b>stage</b> {{taking it to the}} western side of the mountains for the next two stages. <b>Stage</b> eighteen was held between Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde in the south of the country, before a long transfer took the race back to the north-east for two further stages, with the finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the most appropriate system for categorization of metastatic lymph nodes among N <b>staging</b> (according to the 7 th edition UICC/AJCC TNM Classification for Gastric Cancer), ratio between metastatic and examined lymph nodes (RML) <b>staging,</b> negative lymph nodes (NLN) <b>staging</b> and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) <b>staging</b> for evaluation the overall survival (OS) of gastric cancer. MethodsWe reviewed clinicopathological data of 372 gastric cancer patients who underwent radical gastrectomy plus extended lymphadenectomy with the purpose of evaluating the differences in the OS according to different categories of metastatic lymph nodes. ResultsUnivariate and multivariate analysis of data significantly identified the degree of differentiation (HR =  1. 404, p =  0. 015), T <b>staging</b> (according to the 7 th edition UICC/AJCC TNM Classification for Gastric Cancer) (HR =  1. 568, p =  0. 024) and the RML <b>staging</b> (HR =  1. 479, p =  0. 030) as independent predictors of the OS. However, RML <b>staging</b> was identified as the most appropriate for evaluating the OS of gastric cancer patients following radical gastrectomy plus extended lymphadenectomy rather than N <b>staging,</b> NLN <b>staging</b> and LODDS <b>staging</b> by using the case–control matched analysis. With the further stratified analysis, we demonstrated that RML <b>staging</b> had the best prognostic homogeneity than LODDS <b>staging,</b> NLN <b>staging</b> or N <b>staging.</b> ConclusionsRML <b>staging</b> was the best system for prediction the OS of the gastric cancer patients following radical gastrectomy plus extended lymphadenectomy, rather than LODDS <b>staging,</b> NLN <b>staging</b> or N <b>staging...</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first <b>stage,</b> and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the second <b>stage,</b> Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third <b>stage,</b> the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that <b>stage,</b> a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the <b>stage.</b> Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second <b>stage,</b> which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during <b>stage</b> fourteen. The {{eventual}} <b>stage</b> winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the <b>stage,</b> the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next <b>stage</b> saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth <b>stage</b> took {{a break from the}} mountains with the <b>stage</b> being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's <b>stage</b> after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
5|$|Astana's Vuelta {{was a quiet}} one. Vinokourov {{placed in}} the top ten of the opening {{individual}} time trial but he {{fell out of the}} top ten of the overall standings the next day due to a crash. Haimar Zubeldia's 18th-place finish on <b>stage</b> 8, which was the Vuelta's first high mountain <b>stage,</b> propelled him into eighth overall until the next day, when he lost time and fell to ninth. In <b>stage</b> 10, Vinokourov figured in a winning breakaway, but his poor positioning in the four-man sprint finish meant the <b>stage</b> victory went to 's Simon Gerrans. Before <b>stage</b> 12, Astana held ninth overall. They continued to hold it after the <b>stage,</b> but the rider in that position changed; Zubeldia had been in the top ten, but finished further behind <b>stage</b> winner Ryder Hesjedal than Daniel Navarro, so it was Navarro who was the team's highest-placed rider after the <b>stage.</b> After the next two stages, Navarro also fell from the top ten, and the team did not achieve anything further, with Navarro in 13th their highest-placed rider in the race's final standings.|$|E

De Las Cuevas held the lead for a single <b>stage</b> before losing it to Moreno Argentin who won the race's second <b>stage.</b> Argentin held the general classification lead for two stages, before Berzin took it after <b>stage</b> 4.

5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} <b>stage</b> with his {{victory in the}} seventh <b>stage,</b> out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second <b>stage</b> of the race two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final <b>stage,</b> Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race and finish the final <b>stage.</b> Borgarello won his third <b>stage</b> of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E
