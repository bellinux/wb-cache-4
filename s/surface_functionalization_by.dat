30|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA {{can further}} be {{confirmed}} by XRD spectrum. Figure  1 i represents the XRD of pristine ferrite. The diffractogram exhibits d 311, d 400, d 511 and d 533 crystal planes at 31.8 °, 45.5 °, 56.7 ° and 75.7 °, respectively. A sharp crystalline peak at 31.8 ° {{is responsible for the}} increase in basal spacing (the distance between the two crystal planes) of ferrite. Figure  1 j enumerates the XRD of ferrite after the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> with FA. Here also one can observe crystalline peaks corresponding to d 311 and d 400 crystal planes [29]. After the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> reaction there is no change in the peak position. At the same time the peak intensity was suppressed. If there is any change in peak position or disappearance of d 311 crystal plane, one can come to an idea about the intercalation or exfoliation reaction. In fact such a change in peak position was not observed. This confirmed the absence of intercalation or exfoliation reaction during the <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA. The important point noted here is the peak intensity which was drastically reduced, resulted in the appearance of the peaks at 56.7 ° and 75.7 ° disappeared. By noting the decrease in the peak intensity of d 311 and d 400 one can easily predict the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA. In the case of FA one can see six different functionalities such as –NH 2, –OH, –NH–, –CO 2 –H, CO–NH, C=N. Among those, the amino group has good metal surface binding activity. Moreover, the FTIR spectrum confirmed the presence of –NH stretching. This urged us to suggest the amino group of FA which might interact with the ferrite surface in an alkaline pH. The present investigation on XRD of ferrite before and after functionalization with FA concludes the simple surface adsorptions of FA onto ferrite, i.e., <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA.|$|R

These solutions offer a mechanical support, adhesion substrates, and, with Schwann cells (SC), a source of neurotropic factors for axonal growth. The technical limits are the donor side damage, multiple surgical accesses, and the unavailability of large amounts of grafts. In recent years, several researchers focused their attention on the interaction between cells (nervous and glial) and physic-chemical cues that arise from the extracellular milieu. Nanotechnologies produce surfaces that mimic the topographical signals (physical stimuli) that arise from enterprise content management (ECM) to modulate the forces acting during axonal elongation.

Unlike DHI, which gives a typical black insoluble eumelanin polymer on oxidation, DHBT is converted to a grayish amorphous solid (referred to as thiomelanin) with visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance properties {{different from those of}} DHI melanin. Mass spectrometry experiments revealed gradational mixtures of oligomers up to the decamer level. Quite unexpectedly, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the early oligomer fractions indicated linear, 4 -, and 7 -linked structures in marked contrast with DHI, which gives highly complex mixtures of partially degraded oligomers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the tendency of DHBT to couple via the 4 - and 7 -positions. These results uncover the role of nitrogen as a major determinant of the structural diversity generated by the polymerization of DHI, and point to replacement by sulfur as a viable entry to regioregular eumelanin-type materials for potential applications for <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> dip coating...|$|E

The reduction was carried out using cyclo voltammetry coupled with micro gravimetric measurements by means of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance EQCM. The overall deposited mass on gold was higher than on graphene. However, the Faradaic efficiency was lower on Au 14 compared to graphene 22 after the first potential scan. Subsequently, the maleimide functional groups have been tested for immobilization of terminal thiols using 2 4 nitrobenzene ethane thiol for the functionalized graphene surface and a cysteine modified peptide for the functionalized gold <b>surface.</b> The <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> p N maleimido phenyl groups and the following thiol coupling of the particular surface was proven by infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry IRSE. In addition, {{the interaction of the}} tetrabutylammonium and tetrafluoroborate ions present in the electrolyte with the Au and graphene electrodes was investigated by EQCM and revealed less electrostatic interaction of graphene with these ions in solution compared to the metal Au surfac...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} of {{lead dioxide}} from lead(II) nitrate in an acid medium {{has been used}} as a test reaction to study the effects of an ultrasound field. The different behaviours found between platinum and glassy carbon electrodes have been compared by means of cyclic voltammetry and simple potential steps. The current-time response for platinum has not been affected by the presence or absence of ultrasound, but in the case of glassy carbon, by contrast, significant changes have been observed in the characteristic regions of these curves (induction time to). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been employed to follow changes in the surface topography after the electrodes had been exposed to ultrasound. Results indicate that neither pits nor structural modifications that may increase the electrode surface occur with the device used. It is concluded that the activation of glassy carbon electrodes by the action of an ultrasound field for electrodeposition of lead dioxide is associated with the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> caused <b>by</b> the reaction of OH× radicals (derived from aqueous sonolysis) with the carbon surface.
