50|$|The {{concept of}} the use of push-buttons in {{telephony}} originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood later. This use even predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. The Bell System in the United States relied on manual <b>switched</b> <b>service</b> until 1919, when it reversed its decisions and embraced dialed, automatic switching. The 1951 introduction of direct distance dialing required automatic transmission of dialed numbers between distant exchanges, leading to use of inband multi-frequency signaling within the Long Lines network while individual local subscribers continued to dial using standard pulses.|$|E

50|$|ARP {{operated}} on 150 MHz frequency (80 channels on 147.9 - 154.875 MHz band). Transmission power ranged from 1 watt to 5 watts. It first used only half-duplex transmission, meaning that receiving and transmitting voice could not {{happen at the}} same time. Later, full-duplex car phones were introduced. Being analog, it had no encryption and calls could be listened to with scanners. It started as a manually <b>switched</b> <b>service,</b> but was fully automated in 1990; however, {{by that time the}} number of subscribers had dwindled down to 980 users. ARP did not support handover, so calls would disconnect when moving to a new cell area. The cell size was approximately 30 km.|$|E
30|$|UMTS is the third-generation (3 G) mobile {{telecommunications}} technology that evolved from GSM {{of the second}} generation (2 G). UMTS is widely compatible than GSM and has thus gradually replaced it {{to become the most}} ideal system for mobile phone communication. Compared with GSM, UMTS contains bigger bandwidth to allow larger downloads and uses reliable safety mechanisms. Its convenience has been widely appreciated, and thus it proliferated all over the globe. GSM makes two types of services: CS (circuit <b>switched)</b> <b>service</b> and PS (packet <b>switched)</b> <b>service.</b> CS service is responsible for traditional speech telecommunication. PS service provides the forerunner's packet switching to support IP. It has the security characteristics [31] required by ITS environments, and can attain the goals outlined earlier. UMTS is also a wide-area wireless infrastructure that can support the delivery {{of a large number of}} packets as well as many broadcasts or multicast information. Through a special BS (basic station), it can also support short-range information transfer. In contrast, dedicated wireless systems are not easily supported by UMTS. However, we think our technique can accomplish this. In this section, we first introduce the UMTS-AKA protocol [32], the UMTS-IMS-AKA protocol [33], and the UMTS-MBMS protocol [34, 35]. In the following section, we describe how they are suitable to an ITS environment.|$|E
40|$|A future {{satellite}} communications system is envisioned {{that will provide}} a number of enhancements over predecessor satellite communication systems. It will employ high capacity packet <b>switched</b> <b>service</b> in space, high rate circuits between terminals, and utilize Dynamic Bandwidth Resource Allocation which dynamically assigns resources to terminals based on current channel conditions and traffic demand. However, to realize these potential benefits, we {{must be able to}} integrate the future satellite network seamlessly with the existing communication networks. In this paper, we assess the impact of variable rate satellite links on the existing communication network and propose possible solutions to mitigate the adverse impact. With no awareness of the variable rate uplink in the future satellite network, the data routed by the existing user network into the satellite network may be dropped {{at the edge of the}} two different networks due to a rate mismatch, or conversely, the satellite links may be underutilized. Here, our proposed method will prevent significant packet drop and make more efficient use of available links by dynamically rerouting traffic based on the real-time link capacity of the satellite network.

40|$|Optical {{networks}} {{became very}} important in the latest years, thanks totheir high trac capacity, because of the continuous growth of totalexchanged data and the request of real-time communication. Since they have (relatively) long adaptation times, this technology isnot inherently the most suitable to carry bursty traffic like the currentone. Hybrid networks {{try to get the}} best from optical circuit switchingand optical packet switching. This work is focused on an hybrid network architecture called 3 LIHON (3 -Level Integrated Hybrid Optical Network). It has three different quality of service (QoS) levels, in order to meet different requirements:- Guaranteed Service Type (GST) : resembling an optical circuitswitched service, it does not allow data loss. - Statistically Multiplexed Real Time (SM/RT) : resembling anoptical packet <b>switched</b> <b>service,</b> it ensures none or very smalldelay inside the network, it allows a low data loss ratio andbandwidth contention. - Statistically Multiplexed Best Effort (SM/BE) : resembling anoptical packet <b>switched</b> <b>service</b> with very small overall packetloss but no guaranteed delay inside the nodes. In a 3 LIHON node, SM/BE traffic interrupted by packets with higherpriority is dropped. This means that time and resources spent sendingthe SM/BE packet until the interruption are wasted. In this work we try to avoid this behaviour, by implementing andcomparing three new output scheduling algorithms. They are differentversions of the standard 3 LIHON node:- 3 LIHON-RS: SM/BE interrupted packets are resumed oncehigher priority trac has been sent. - 3 LIHON-RT: SM/BE interrupted packets are retransmitted. - 3 LIHON- 2 R: since GST packets are usually much longer thanSM/RT ones, resuming an interruption caused by GST trafficleads to a long wait. This architecture resumes SM/BE packetsinterrupted by SM/RT traffic and retransmits them if they havebeen interrupted by GST traffic. A proper (Fragment End) Optical Code can be used to implement andsignal packets interruption and resuming, Every 3 LIHON version hasbeen tested with increasing traffic loads, but never so high to overloadthe node. Three different simulators have been written in order tostudy the behaviour of the different architectures, by using the Simula programming language and its context class DEMOS, specificallyintended for discrete event modelling. The node input part has justbeen modelled, since it does not directly influences results. As a function of system load, performances of these new architectureshave been analysed, paying attention especially to SM/BE packetsmean delay, SM/BE queues, delay distribution of SM/BE traffic,wavelengths utilization, GST and SM/RT interruptions over SM/BEtraffic, standard deviation of SM/BE delay and SM/RT packet loss. It has been observed that 3 LIHON- 2 R does not have the best absoluteperformances, but is the best trade off among all the systemsand is very well balanced when system load increases. It is the architectureshowing the lowest mean SM/BE packet delay. 3 LIHON-RS proved to have the lowest SM/BE queue values and less interruptions of SM/BE traffic. Furthermore, it has the best wavelengths utilization performances. 3 LIHON-RT achieved the worst results and is the first architecture overloading. </p...|$|E
