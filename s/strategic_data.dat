International entrepreneurial orientation was analyzed using three dimensions; innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness.

The first barrier is, it often necessitates field research, which is expensive and time-consuming. Second, it is impossible to get accurate <b>strategic</b> <b>data</b> on a large number of customers. Third, if gathered, the analysis of the data can be a daunting task. These barriers lead most companies to use more qualitative and intuitive methods in measuring customer data, and more persuasive methods while selling, hoping to compensate for the gap of accurate data measurement.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{founding}} of the organization, several independent studies have been conducted to gauge the effectiveness of Teach For America corps members relative to teachers who entered the teaching profession via other channels. Most prominently, a 2015 Mathematica Policy Research study found that Teach For America teachers produce 1.3 months of extra reading gains in pre-K through second grade classrooms when compared to non-TFA teachers in the same elementary schools. The same study also found that Teach For America teachers across 10 states are as effective as other teachers in math and reading. A separate study by the Calder Center and the American Institutes for Research found that Teach For America teachers provide students in Miami with the equivalent of 3 additional months of math instruction, according to analyses of test score data from state-mandated tests. The Harvard <b>Strategic</b> <b>Data</b> Project found in 2012 that Teach For America teachers in Los Angeles Unified School District produce 1-2 extra months of English and math learning outcomes relative to the gains produced by other novice teachers. Recent studies in North Carolina and Tennessee suggest that Teach For America is consistently the most effective source of new teachers in the two states, according to studies that looked at student achievement across a variety of subjects and grade levels across the states.|$|E
