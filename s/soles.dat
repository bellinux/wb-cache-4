After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their <b>soles</b> to the air.|$|E

The <b>soles</b> of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads.

5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and <b>soles.</b> Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The {{first five}} growth zones of 744 yellowfin <b>sole</b> and 512 {{northern}} rock <b>sole</b> otoliths were measured from year-classes 1974 - 1989, to identify patterns of annual growth {{and sources of}} temporal variation. Growth patterns were observed graphically and temporal variation was examined by partitioning growth into year and age effects via linear models. Growth and recruitment relationships with biological and environmental variables were explored through correlation analysis and stepwise regression. Results indicate that growth of yellowfin <b>sole</b> and rock <b>sole</b> declined from the late 1970 s to the mid 1980 s. Yellowfin <b>sole</b> length at age rebounded after 1985, while rock <b>sole</b> length at age continued to decline until at least the early 1990 s. Density-dependent factors such as competition during early growth years overshadow the impacts of environmental variables on growth for both yellowfin <b>sole</b> and rock <b>sole,</b> possibly due to the complex oceanographic and atmospheric relationships {{that exist in the}} Bering Sea. Recruitment strengths of yellowfin <b>sole</b> and rock <b>sole</b> have significant environmental components suggesting that survival rates may be influenced by environmental conditions. Also, interspecific competition with yellowfin <b>sole</b> may be influencing rock <b>sole</b> recruitment in the eastern Bering Sea...|$|R

40|$|Scientifically, {{this study}} aimed to {{validate}} the potential of ragworm to alleviate anaemia in common <b>sole</b> and to identify the dietary requirements of common <b>sole</b> to alleviate this anaemia. At {{the same time it}} was aimed to explain part of the difference in growth between <b>sole</b> fed a commercial pellet and <b>sole</b> fed ragworm. Practically, this study aimed to develop a diet that achieves similar growth rates in <b>sole</b> as when fed ragworm. <b>Sole</b> fed commercial pellets developed nutritional anaemia. Feeding ragworm or mussel alleviates this nutritional anaemia. It is suggested that the ability of mussel or ragworm (meal) to alleviate anaemia and improve growth in <b>sole</b> can be explained by  heme iron and high B 12 levels. Yet, iron absorption in <b>sole</b> is high and independent of iron source. Still, heme increases the absorption of copper. The high absorption of iron and copper in <b>sole</b> fed heme does not affect the haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin (Hb) levels, which indicates the anaemia in <b>sole</b> is not an iron or a copper deficiency anaemia. The Hct and Hb levels in <b>sole</b> are affected by dietary B 12. Yet, the applied levels are unable to alleviate the anaemia in <b>sole</b> induced by feeding commercial pellets. More options to alleviate the nutritional anaemia in common <b>sole</b> are discussed. Nutrients as vitamin C, B 1, B 2, B 5 and a possible role of dietary EPO are discussed. It is suggested that the slow growth of pellet-fed <b>sole</b> might be due to the low Hct and Hb levels, which hampers the uptake of oxygen, and thus also the overall metabolic capacity, including the scope for growth. Discussed is a 7 °C difference in the “optimal” temperature between <b>sole</b> fed ragworm and the 2 nd generation pellet and that the “worm effect” is dependent on temperature. However, the growth rate of <b>sole</b> fed the 3 rd generation pellet at 18. 4 °C was comparable to the growth rate of <b>sole</b> fed ragworm, which could not have been the consequence of increasing Hct and Hb levels as these were comparable to levels found in <b>sole</b> fed commercial pellets. Yet, B 12 levels in blood plasma of <b>sole</b> are up to 200 times those of other (fish) species. Hence, we inferred on the possibility of a specific metabolic function of B 12 in respiration in <b>sole.</b> In addition, the economic and practical impact of the improved growth rate in <b>sole</b> culture is discussed.

Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh.

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable <b>soles</b> and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
