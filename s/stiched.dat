50|$|Although these {{policies}} have existed since 1964, {{they were not}} enforced until general managers voted to enforce it in the 2013-14 season. Some reporters suggested that enforcing uniform rules was the National Hockey League's attempt to reduce freak accidents where a player's body was cut by skate blade while others said the league was laying down rules for eventually selling advertising space that would display prominently on the entire jersey. In a September 2013 pre-season game between the Carolina Hurricanes and the Columbus Blue Jackets, Alexander Semin became the first player penalized for this infraction. After receiving an official's initial warning in that game, his jersey became tucked in again after scoring the second goal in that game. He received the minor penalty 15 minutes later for violating the tuck rule a second time in the game. In response, Semin later <b>stiched</b> his jersey to his pants. However, by early October in the same year, {{it was reported that}} the league's hockey operations department would relax on enforcing the tuck rule. The penalty would not be enforced if the jersey was tucked in while skating as long as the jersey was untucked {{at the beginning of a}} shift.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to confirm the {{generalizability}} of the conclusions of the <b>STICH</b> (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial. BackgroundSurgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) added to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) did not decrease death or cardiac hospitalization in <b>STICH</b> patients randomized to CABG with (n = 501) or without (n = 499) SVR. MethodsBaseline clinical characteristics of 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> SVR hypothesis patients and 1, 036 STICH-eligible Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Cardiac Database patients undergoing CABG plus SVR were entered into a multivariate model equation to predict a mortality that placed these 2, 036 patients in 1 of 32 risk at randomization (RAR) groups. The number of patients in each RAR group profiled the risk of <b>STICH</b> treatment arms and of <b>STICH</b> and STS STICH-eligible patients. ResultsThat 85 % of the 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> patients known to have no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 treatment arms shared the same RAR group suggests that the RAR methodology has sufficient accuracy to compare RAR profiles of <b>STICH</b> and STS patients. RAR group was shared by 1, 522 of 2, 036 <b>STICH</b> and STS STICH-eligible patients (75 %) who underwent CABG plus SVR. Differences in baseline characteristics responsible for more low-risk <b>STICH</b> patients and more high-risk STS patients were modest. Cox proportional hazard ratios of 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> patients in 3 RAR groups suggested by <b>STICH</b> and STS RAR differences showed no differential treatment effect on survival across the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. ConclusionsThe <b>STICH</b> conclusion of no benefit from adding SVR to CABG applies to a broad spectrum of CABG-eligible patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

40|$|From the {{experience}} of treating 21 cases of the bladder tumor, which are in different grades and stages, with external irradiation using 250 curie 60 Co source, following conclusions were obtained. 1. So f a r as the relation between tumor doses over all time and clinical results concerns, the method of choice is administration of 5000 - 7000 γ. in 5 - 8 weeks. 2. Conspicuous degeneration and karyolysis of tumor cells are de m onstrated in the cases treated with dose over 4000 γ [...] No specific difference in radiation sensitivity was noted in various types of tumor cells by radiation of 60 Co. 3. Careful consideration must be paied to the count o f W. B. C. and behavior of potassiummetabolism during radiation treatment. Three of eight patients, who were given over 40001., revealed hypokaliemic syndrome {{in the course of}} treatment. 4. External irradiation of the direct exposed bladder opened 4 c m. long at the abdominal wall after carrying out urinary diversion has the advantage that location of the tumor in the evacuated bladder can be indicated exactly on an x-ray film by a silber wire pre viously <b>stiched</b> {{around the base of the}} tumor and accurate beaming of the tumor is possible. Direct observation of the radiation effect and frequent biopsies during treatme nt are also possible. Experimental irradiation of the bladder using 40 curie 60 Co source was carried out in fourteen adult mongorel dogs with a daily increment dose of 300 r. to the bladder (measured at 4 cm below the skin surface). A total dose of 3000 γ. and 5000 γ. was delivered to four dogs, and 8000 γ. to six dogs respectively. Biopsies were done three times, that is, immediately, three months and six months after irradiation. The radiation effects were studied by the histological examination and following conclusions were obtained. 1. Immediately after irradiation the 3000 γ. group shows slight degeneration and partial exfoliation of the epithelial cells. Remarkable dilation of the submucous capillaries is seen. In 5000 γ. and 8000 γ. group, the greater part of the epithelium is exfoliated, remaining only the basal membrane. Submucous congestion is more extensive. 2. Three months later, 3000 γ. group shows regeneration of epithelium in several layers and submucous tissue appears to be atrophic. In the 5000 γ. group, exfoliation of epithelium still remains, but shows partial regeneration of epithelium. In the 8000 γ. group, regeneration of the epithelium is hardly found. 3. Six months later, the 8000 γ. group shows partial regeneration of epithelium. 4. Concerning the mesenchymal tissues, few changes are observed i n the 3000 γ. and 5000 γ. group. In the 8000 γ. group, both three and six months' specimen reveal increasing of connective tissue and wandering of the fibroblasts which signify formation of the granulation tissue...|$|E
