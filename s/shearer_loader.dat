50|$|The <b>Shearer</b> <b>Loader</b> {{was mainly}} {{developed}} by James Anderton OBE, {{who was the}} National Coal Board (St Helens Area) production manager and later chairman of the NCB's North-Western Division. The first Anderton <b>shearer</b> <b>loader</b> was commissioned in 1954. It was utilised by Anderton's employers at Groves Ravenhead Colliery in St Helens.|$|E

50|$|The Anderton <b>Shearer</b> <b>Loader</b> is a {{coal cutting}} machine {{which was used}} in the UK coal {{industry}} after 1953. The Anderton Power Loader with its cutting drum up to five feet in diameter was patented in 1953. It was successfully used throughout the British coalfields and by 1966 cut half the coal produced and by 1977 it produced 80% of the coal mined in Britain.|$|E
50|$|The coal is {{cut from}} the coalface by a machine called the <b>shearer</b> (power <b>loader).</b> This machine can weigh 75-120 tonnes {{typically}} and comprises a main body, housing the electrical functions, the tractive motive units to move the shearer along the coalface and pumping units (to power both hydraulic and water functions). At {{either end of the}} main body are fitted the ranging arms which can be ranged vertically up down by means of hydraulic rams, and onto which are mounted the shearer cutting drums which are fitted with 40-60 cutting picks. Within the ranging arms are housed very powerful electric motors (typically up to 850 kW) which transfer their power through a series of lay gears within the body and through the arms to the drum mounting locations at the extreme ends of the ranging arms where the cutting drums are. The cutting drums are rotated at a speed of 20-50 revs/min to cut the mineral from coal seam.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of desired work inside the long tunnel drilling, rating of electrical drives at tunnel face has significantly increased. Due to the high rating concentration of electrical drives at tunnel face significant voltage must be required which is need of an hour to finish the work in given time interval and to avoid the various dangers. Therefore, planning of electrical power distribution is required and voltage drop across each electrical drives must be taken into account. While power planning drill machine, Armored Face Conveyors (AFC), <b>Shearer,</b> breaker, Stage <b>loader,</b> face lightning, etc. must be given due importance as starting power required to them is very high. Breakaway torque of the AFC is not maintained because of low power, so it is required to start constantly requiring high power as well as it will heat the environment, which is often hazardous. In order to provide the required power drop and reduce the dangers, some alternative methods must be used. In the present investigation voltage drop compensation technique is developed by providing with optimization of position of transformer. Even though the voltage drop cannot be maintained in such cases boosting transformer with the power thyristor with tap changing is used to control the power instead of tap changer mechanism. In order to operate the various drives in long drilling tunnel and finish the work in desired period one must know the various parameters involved in the system. On line parameter such as voltage, currents, temperature, etc. of electrical drives and environment are measured through PC using various sensors, the sensed data is compared with the standard data. The comparison will help to take necessary decision and helps to reduce the forth-coming dangers in the tunnel or electrical drives...|$|R
5000|$|Lancashire {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of innovation in coal mining from James Brindley's 1756 water wheel at Wet Earth Colliery to the Duke of Bridgewaters's underground canals. Edward Ormerod patented a [...] "Butterfly" [...] safety link to improve cage safety in 1867 that is used globally. Lancashire had the first pithead baths in the country at Gibfield Colliery in Atherton and the first mines rescue station at to cover an entire coalfield at Howe Bridge in 1908. The Anderton <b>Shearer</b> <b>Loader</b> invented by James Anderton produced more than half the total output of British coal in the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Automation in {{underground}} mining enhances safety {{and leads to}} economic efficiencies. After more than 50 years of research, automation tasks have gradually been growing out of the classic engineering/mechanical environment and require a sophisticated data-mining treatment. The success of (mechanical) process automation has left only one remaining place in the coal-excavation process where human labor is still indispensable: {{the operation of the}} excavation machine, the <b>shearer</b> <b>loader.</b> The necessity to utilize human labor is due to the unknown exact position of the underground coal seam to be excavated. Therefore, at each point in time, a human has to detect the direction in which to excavate further. In the harsh underground conditions, this brings about serious safety and health hazards. The operator is surrounded by dust, which obstructs his vision, among others. In addition, human mistakes in coal-layer detection mean that more rock is excavated rather than coal, which lowers the economic efficiency of the whole coal-mining process. In this paper we fill in the gap in the coal-excavation automation by building a pattern recognition system inside the <b>shearer</b> <b>loader</b> that turns it into a “smart ” machine that is capable of detecting the correct position of the coal to be excavated and enable human-free coal mining. The success of such a system would mean that mines with very harsh human conditions could potentially become fully operational, since human presence would not any more be required for coal excavation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The mining {{production}} systems, {{both for}} underground and open pit extraction consist mainly {{in a string}} of equipment starting with the winning equipment (<b>shearer</b> <b>loader,</b> in case of underground longwall mining or bucket wheel excavator in case of open pit mining), hauling equipment (armored face conveyor in longwall mining or the on-board belt conveyor in case of excavators), main conveying equipment (belt conveyor in both cases), transfer devices, stock pile or bunker feeding equipment. This system of mainly serially connected elements is characterized by the throughput (overall amount of bulk coal respectively overburden rock produced), which is dependent on the functioning state of each involved equipment, and is strongly affected also by the process inherent variability due to the randomness of the involved processes (e. g. the cutting properties of the rock). In order to model and simulate such production systems, some probabilistic methods are applied arising from the artificial intelligence approach, involving unit operations and equipment, as the overall system as a whole, namely the Monte Carlo simulation, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and the Load Strength Interference methods. The results obtained are convergent and offer the opportunity for further developments of their application in the study of mining production systems...|$|E
