40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} on both local and global dielectric properties for a random wound single tooth winding, which represents {{a segment of the}} in-field electrical machine used on an Hybrid Wheel Loader. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to predict the temperature stress while loading and illustrate the influences of dielectric properties (i. e. conductivity and dielectric constant) on the global dielectric properties (i. e. dielectric resistance and capacitance). Based on the thermal simulation, dielectric response measurements are performed in the most thermally stressed region, which is between two randomly grouped winding strands. Both DC and AC dielectric characteristics are measured and analyzed, which provide a good insight to understand 1) the dielectric response 2) temperature dependent dielectric properties for strand to <b>strand</b> <b>insulation.</b> This provides a great foundation for the future work on stator winding degradation...|$|E
50|$|Although the {{construction}} of a portable cord varies depending on the type, a standard cord has at least two stranded copper conductors sized between #18 and #2 American wire gauge (AWG). The copper <b>stranding,</b> <b>insulation,</b> and outer jacket directly influence the physical properties of the cord and its permitted uses.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} magnetic {{and mechanical}} designs and {{analyses of the}} quadrupole mirror structure to test single shell-type quadrupole coils. Several quadrupole coils made of different Nb{sub 3 }Sn <b>strands,</b> cable <b>insulation</b> and pole materials were tested using this structure at 4. 5 and 1. 9 K. The coils were instrumented with voltage taps, spot heaters, temperature sensors and strain gauges to study their mechanical and thermal properties and quench performance. The results of the quadrupole mirror model assembly and test are reported and discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLow-temperature superconductors {{are widely}} used in high-field magnets, mostly within Rutherford-type cables. The run for higher fields leads to greater forces on the conductor, which is pushed closer to its {{mechanical}} limit. Managing the higher strain and stress levels on the conductor supposes to perform simulation at the strand level, especially with strain-sensitive superconductors such as Nb 3 Sn. Three-dimensional models are necessary because inside of a magnet, the conductor is subject to a complex combination of axial and transverse loads. Superconducting cables are anisotropic composite structures that can comprise superconducting <b>strands,</b> <b>insulation</b> materials, stabilizing parts, porosities, etc. They have a multiscale architecture, the performance at the magnet scale being driven by the filament scale. This paper proposes a numerical approach for 3 -D finite-element (FE) modeling of Rutherford cables, at {{the scale of the}} strand. The 3 -D mesh of two reference cables is built with a simplified cable forming model. The accuracy of this geometrical model is assessed by comparing sections of the simulated mesh with tomographic data, using relevant criteria and specific geometry analysis tools. In this approach, the strand is considered as bimetallic, with a copper core, a superconducting bundle ring, and an outer copper ring. After mechanical 3 -D FE computation on this bimetallic mesh, the strain/stress state on the local compounds of the strand (including Nb 3 Sn filaments) is obtained by strain projection. The strain/stress state on the Nb 3 Sn filaments can be used to estimate the cable current transport capability, thanks to the existing scaling laws...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{products}} {{industry is not}} generally recognized as having a creative, innovative approach to product development and marketing. Yet dramatic changes in {{wood products}} have occurred {{over the past several}} decades. A recent tour of a new home under construction revealed those changes in great clarity. Less than 5 % of the wood in the house was traditional solid wood framing lumber. Instead there were finger jointed and oriented strand studs, both floor and roof trusses, laminated veneer lumber headers and carrying beams, pressure treated oriented <b>strand</b> posts, <b>insulation</b> board wall sheathing, and oriented strand board roof sheathing. This is not to mention the wood plastic composite decking and rail systems as well as the fiber-cement based siding and trim. This i...|$|R
50|$|X-ray cables {{are used}} in lengths of several meters to connect the HV source with an X-ray tube or any other HV device in {{scientific}} equipment. They transmit small currents, {{in the order of}} milliamperes at DC voltages of 30 to 200 kV, or sometimes higher. The cables are flexible, with rubber or other elastomer <b>insulation,</b> <b>stranded</b> conductors, and an outer sheath of braided copper-wire. The construction has the same elements as other HV power cables.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} parameters of a quadrupole mirror structure for testing the mechanical, thermal and quench performance of single shell-type superconducting quadrupole coils at field, current and force levels {{similar to that of}} real magnet. The concept was experimentally verified by testing two quadrupole coils, previously used in quadrupole models, in the developed mirror structure in the temperature range from 4. 5 to 1. 9 K. The coils were instrumented with voltage taps, heaters, and strain gauges to monitor their mechanical and thermal properties and quench performance. A new quadrupole coil made of improved Nb{sub 3 }Sn RRP- 108 / 127 <b>strand</b> and cable <b>insulation</b> based on E-glass tape was also tested using this structure. The fabrication and test results of the quadrupole mirror models are reported and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The future {{run of the}} Large Hadron Collider {{with lead}} ions will require {{important}} modifications in the synchrotron radiation profile monitor system, which at present comprises two superconducting undulators wound from Nb-Ti conductor, delivering 5 T in a 60 mm gap, and with a period of 280 mm. Whilst the gap and the nominal field of the future undulators will remain the same, the period shall be 140 mm, which translates to a peak field of over 8 T in the coils and hence {{requires the use of}} Nb 3 Sn technology. In this paper the electromagnetic design of the undulator is summarized. We describe the fabrication of a race-track coil wound with a 0. 8 mm diameter Nb 3 Sn <b>strand</b> with ceramic <b>insulation.</b> Finally, the results of successful tests made at 4. 3 K and 1. 9 K in a mirror configuration are presented. 10 T at 4. 3 K and 11. 5 T at 1. 9 K were measured in the yoke gap, thus validating this concept for the future undulator...|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to other}} older Antarctic bases, {{the station is}} rather small and stands out among the often overlarge {{buildings}} previously built in Antarctica by other countries. The design of the whole complex revolves around the Climate conditions in the area. The main building is a one-storey Wooden structure (26.5 Ã— 11.5 m, 2.8-3.6 m high) used for accommodation, cooking, and eating {{as well as for}} leisure and research activities. There are twelve single or twin rooms, two shared studies, a dining room, a small kitchen, sanitary facilities, and a drying room. There is a grating made of Oak railway sleepers embedded in the shallow foundations of the building; this structure is no less than 40 cm above the ground to reduce Heat losses caused by the cold Antarctic soil. The walls are 265 mm thick and they are built using the K-Kontrolsystem. They consist of two oriented <b>strand</b> boards with <b>insulation</b> filling in between the boards. The external surface of the walls is covered with Plywood to protect the structure from adverse effects of the environment (sea salt aerosol, occasional Dust storms). The floor and the ceilings are constructed in a similar way, but they are thicker - 320 mm. The roof slopes to the south at a pitch of 5% and is covered with a PVC board, which protects the building from Ultraviolet radiation.|$|R
