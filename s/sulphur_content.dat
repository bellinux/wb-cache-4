5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (petroleum coke) {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E
5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E

500|$|A common local {{belief is}} that the durian is harmful when eaten with coffee or {{alcoholic}} beverages. The latter belief {{can be traced back}} at least to the 18th century when Rumphius stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and bad breath. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette wrote in his Malay Poisons and Charm Cures that the durian fruit must not be eaten with brandy. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea that [...] "a feeling of morbidity" [...] often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions, though a study by the University of Tsukuba finds the fruit's high <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> inhibits the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a 70% reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body.|$|E

40|$|Arc {{volcanism}} {{is known}} for his dangerousness because of the high contents H_ 2 O, CO_ 2 and S (H_ 2 S or SO_ 2 depending on the fO_ 2 of the system). The behaviour of the volatiles C, H, O and S in basaltic melts is poorly known, yet the knowledge of the solubility of these volatiles is critical to understand volcanic degassing. A significant amount of work has been done to define the solubility laws of H_ 2 O, CO_ 2 an S in silicic melts. However, such data are still scarce for basaltic liquids. To remedy this gap, we are conducting experiments on basaltic liquids at 1200 C, at pressures varying between 250 and 2000 bar and at high fO_ 2 (NNO+ 2). Basaltic compositions from Vesuvius, Etna and Stromboli are equilibrated with an H_ 2 O+S and H_ 2 O+CO_ 2 +S rich fluid phase. After rapid quench, contents of H_ 2 O and CO_ 2 in glasses are determined by using KFT and near/mid infrared spectroscopic measurements. Major elements and <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> are determined by electron microprobe analyses. Microprobe analyses show that, at near H_ 2 O saturation, <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> increase with pressure (from 2500 ppm at 250 bar, to 6700 ppm at 2000 bar for Etna and Stromboli compositions).

40|$|The {{phosphorous}} laden Koton Karfe {{iron ore}} is a medium grade iron ore deposit in Nigeria {{that can be}} upgraded as a super-concentrate for use at the Aladja Steel Midrex plant. The 75 μm size sample fraction of the ore was preconcentrated with shaking table and leached in the oven at atmospheric pressure with dilute hydrochloric acid in single and multistage leaching sequences of H 2 O-HCl-H 2 O and HCl-H 2 O-H 2 O. The as-received, as-tabled and asleached samples were then subjected to X-ray fluorescence and microscopic analyses. The results obtained showed that the H 2 O-HCl-H 2 O route produced a higher grade concentrate that assayed 68. 54 % Fe indicating about 58 % upgrade in iron content; while the phosphorus and <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> were reduced by about 77 and 99. 6 % respectively. In addition, the silicon, manganese, and titanium contents were drastically reduced, while potassium was completely eliminated.

500|$|A 20th-century {{modification}} of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge [...] "C" [...] power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were rigidly connected, and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where a hoist lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the final load left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried {{on top of the}} coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.|$|E
500|$|Onions {{are best}} {{cultivated}} in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are {{good as they}} are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require {{a high level of}} nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity.

40|$|Two main coal-bearing {{sequences}} {{developed during}} the Oligocene in the Tertiary Ebro Basin, the Calaf (early Oligocene) and Mequinenza (late Oligocene) coal basins. Coal deposition took place in shallow marsh-swamp-lake complexes which sometimes became closed and evolved under warm climatic conditions with fluctuating humidity. These shallow lacustrine systems are closely interrelated with the terminal parts of the distributive fluvial systems which spread from the tectonically active Ebro basin margins. Laterally extensive lignite-bearing sequences, including rather thin, lenticular autochthonous and/or hypautochthonous coal seams with high ash and <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents,</b> characterized coal deposition in the shallow lacustrine systems. Coal seam geometry, which makes them nearly subeconomic, resulted from the tectonic instability during basin margin evolution and the sometimes closed, arid conditions under which the lacustrine systems evolved. High ash and <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> resulted from the inadequate isolation of peat forming environments from clastic influx and from the very low acidity and sometimes high sulphate contents of the lacustrine waters. Coal exploration in shallow lacustrine sequences similar to those described here {{must take into account}} that the spread of coal-forming environments and maxima of coal deposition are usually coincident with lake expansions and retraction or shifting of the terminal fluvial zones interrelated with the lacustrine areas...|$|R

40|$|Decrease {{in carbon}} dioxide {{emissions}} was not the driver when shipping started to investigate fuel alternatives to replace the traditional heavy fuel oil. Instead it was regulations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> in fuel in sulphur emission control areas (SECA). The dominating driving forces for a ship-owner to change fuel are regulations and price. The result will thus be an economic based fuel choice among those fuels fulfilling present regulations rather than a long term sustainable alternative. A fuel change is usually also connected to a capital cost for conversion and infrastructure {{that has to be}} compensated by lower fuel price. Fuels used in SECA areas today are low sulphur marine gas oil (LSMGO), “hybrid fuels” (heavy fuel oils that has been blended to low <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents),</b> LNG or methanol. LNG and methanol in addition to fulfilling sulphur regulations also provide a pathway to renewable fuel and have low emissions of nitrogen oxides and particles. However, in the past years, the economic incentive has changed from a favourable situation for the “clean” fuels like LNG or methanol towards traditional fuels fulfilling only sulphur regulations. Decisions are today based entirely on the fast changing prices, providing a selection of fuels that fulfil only present regulations and excluding possible future regulations or customer demands. The long-term pathway towards sustainability with a change into fossil free fuel production is not taken into account.
