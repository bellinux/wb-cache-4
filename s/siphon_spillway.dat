50|$|A <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway</b> in a dam {{is usually}} not {{technically}} a siphon as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels. However, a <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway</b> operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than {{the surface of the}} source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation. In operation, a <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway</b> is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'. A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a siphon flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet. Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to prime the siphon. Such a design includes the volute siphon.|$|E

Estimation of pressure distribution within this structure and head-discharge, relationship are the most important designâ€™s parameters of siphon. At present the hydraulic of <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway</b> usually is done by physical modeling. Physical modeling requires many times. On the other hand, numerical modeling has the advantage of doing very fast. Therefore it is the main purpose of this study to show that, the numerical model also can be performed to have accurate results. To reach {{the purpose of this study}} first a physical model of <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway</b> was constructed and placed in a test flume in hydraulic laboratory of Azad university- Garmsar branch. At the same time an available CFD program, which solves the Navier-Stokes equations, was run by using data obtained from physical model. The result of investigations shows that: Comparison of discharge coefficient in pressurized spillway with both free and submerged outlet shows that submerging in outlet is effective in promotion of spillway efficiency. It is shown that there is reasonably good agreement between the physical and numerical models for both pressures and discharges and CFD modeling can be used for this purpose.

40|$|Abstract: Siphon spillways are {{hydraulic}} structures {{which can}} pass surplus storm water automatically. Hence their stability has more importance. The reliable predictor derived physical modeling have {{significant role in}} this case. Different types of equations can be derived using statistical methods which each type has its applied limitations. This paper has been attempted to derive non-linear equations to predict scour hole dimensions downstream <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway.</b> Scour hole dimesions as: d s(the maximum depth of scour hole), l 2 (upstream hill distance from the bucket), h u (height of upstream hill) and h d (height of downstream hill) were investigated through this research work. Using Bukingham pi theorem, three dimensionless parameters were derived as d 50 Q ht...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] Murrum Silli Dam, also spelled Madam Silli and Mordem Silli, is an earth-fill {{embankment}} dam on the Sillari River, {{a tributary of}} the Mahanadi River. It is located in Dhamtari District of Chhattisgarh. Built between 1914 and 1923, it is the first dam in Asia to have <b>Siphon</b> <b>Spillways.</b> Madamsilli is about 95 km from Raipur.It {{is one of the most}} prominent architectural marvels in Chhattisgarh. Its primary purpose is irrigation.|$|R
50|$|A siphon {{makes use}} of the {{difference}} in the height between the intake and the outlet to create a pressure difference needed to remove excess water. Siphons however require priming or the removal of air in the bend {{in order for them to}} function and most <b>siphon</b> <b>spillways</b> are designed with a system that {{makes use of}} water to remove the air and automatically prime the siphon. One such design is the volute siphon which makes use of water forced into a spiral vortex by volutes or fins on a funnel that draw air out of the system. The priming happens automatically when the water level rises above the inlets that are used to drive the priming process.|$|R
40|$|A {{brief summary}} of {{conclusions}} drawn from this work is as follows: 1. The coefficient of discharge increases directly as the operating head on a <b>siphon</b> <b>spillway</b> while discharging into deep water, and decreases rapidly with increase of head when discharge is in shallow water and air. The rate of discharge increases with the head, and approaches a nearly constant value for higher heads. Similar tests made on the model without the air trap seal {{has the effect of}} increasing the rate of discharge when discharging into air, and a slight increase of the coefficient of discharge at lower heads. 2. Better means of measuring pressure must be sought, and until then, accurate means of obtaining losses from point to point are not available. A Pitot tube exploration seems the best suggestion. The maximum losses are in the entrance, throat, and bend over the crest. Q = AV does not hold for ordimry piezometer tube measurements, and Bernoulli's theorem may not be applied. 3. The principles of similitude my be applied to the siphon, and the scale factor may be increased to 4, with all characteristics remaining the same. The discharge varies as the five halves power of the scale factor...|$|E
50|$|The Boulder Canyon Project Act in 1928 would signal {{change for}} the Yuma Project. The Act {{authorized}} {{the construction of the}} Hoover Dam which curtailed flooding on the Colorado River but it also authorized the All-American Canal and the Imperial Dam. The Imperial Dam would serve as the lower Colorado's diversion dam and would also supply the Yuma Project with water. The dam was completed in 1938 and in 1941, the Bureau of Reclamation sealed off the Yuma Main Canal from the Laguna Diversion Dam. All outlets from the Laguna Dam were sealed on June 23, 1948 allowing for full supply from the Imperial Dam. Becoming obsolete, the Bureau decommissioned the power plant at the <b>Siphon</b> Drop <b>Spillway</b> in 1972.|$|R
40|$|The Study {{investigates the}} use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyze the mean {{characteristics}} of curvilinear flows in selected hydraulic structures. Three chosen turbulence models {{are associated with the}} Volume of Fluid (VOF) scheme to predict the characteristics of the mean flow. Many hydraulic structures in engineering practice involve highly curvilinear flows. Five typical hydraulic structures commonly used for flow regulation or flow measurement are considered in the present study; cut-throat flumes, lateral weirs, sharp-crested weirs, circular <b>spillways,</b> and <b>siphon</b> <b>spillways.</b> Velocity distributions, pressure distributions, water surface profiles, secondary flows, and discharge coefficients are the mean characteristics of flows that are studied. Presently, computing methods and high speed computers are strong tools for engineers. With the help of a properly validated numerical model, one can avoid the time consuming and expensive experimental tests based on the physical models to obtain the characteristics of highly curvilinear flows encountered in hydraulic practices. This is {{based on the fact that}} unlike physical models, it is far simpler to apply changing boundary conditions and flow parameters to a solved numerical model and obtain a flow characteristics for hydraulic structures associated with highly curvilinear flows. The flows in hydraulic structures are turbulent. Hence, one needs to solve numerically the continuity equation and momentum equations, including turbulent stresses, as the governing equations of turbulent flows. Because the above mentioned flows are generally complex and highly curvilinear, the transport equations are needed to model the turbulent stresses in the momentum equations. In the present study, three Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) schemes are used to simulate the turbulent flows. Specifically, the Reynolds stress model (RSM), the Standard k-[varepsilon] model, and the RNG k-[varepsilon] model were used in the present study. Further, the VOF scheme is adopted to find the shape of free surface profile...|$|R
50|$|Construction on the Yuma Canal which {{branched}} off the California {{side of the}} Laguna Dam {{began in}} 1909. One and half miles from the dam, at Indian Heading, the Yuma Canal splits into the Reservation Main Canal and the Yuma Main Canal. The Yuma Main Canal continues 10.5 mi southwest until it reaches the 9.9 ft <b>Siphon</b> Drop <b>Spillway</b> where a power plant was later built in 1926. After another 3.5 mi, it reaches the Colorado River Siphon which siphons the water under the Colorado River. After it reaches Yuma, it split into the East and West Main canals {{to pass through the}} Valley Division and to the Mexican border. The Yuma Main Canal along with the East Main Canal and part of the West Main Canal were complete by 1912. The rest of the West Main Canal started again in 1913 and was completed in 1915.|$|R

The Little Rock Dam on Little Rock Creek overtopped during the flood due to a damaged <b>spillway</b> <b>siphon</b> that had been plugged by debris; hundreds of people in downstream Palmdale were evacuted. Further east, the Mojave River burst its banks, damaging long stretches of the ATSF railroad and causing damage in Victorville and Barstow. The main line between Barstow and Los Angeles was closed for a week. The Southern Pacific Railroad main line over Tehachapi Pass was closed for two weeks, requiring emergency service via buses and trucks.|$|R
