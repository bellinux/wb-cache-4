IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society; Shanghai University of Engineering Science; City University of Hongkong; Changsha University of Science and Technology; Hunan University of Science and TechnologyAiming at {{solving the}} dead zone {{and other issues}} caused by the method that the optical-electronic mutual {{inductors}} gain energy from the bus bar current, the laser and solar power hybrid method is put forward. Power collection by solar energy battery panel and power transmitted by laser are combined to supply energy and realize constant power output. The system which applies <b>solar</b> <b>battery</b> <b>panel</b> could supply electricity for a long times, in addition, the PPC- 6 E photo-battery could heighten the efficiency of optical-electronic transformation. The whole system can ensure the electronic source to supply power continuously and avoid the contradiction that if a laser power supply supplies power continuously, its life will be decreased.

A process that changes one DC voltage to a different DC voltage is called DC to DC conversion. A boost converter is a DC to DC converter with an output voltage greater than the source voltage.

5000|$|Transverters {{are used}} to convert and combine {{different}} types of electrical power such as <b>solar</b> <b>panels,</b> <b>batteries,</b> wind generators, fuel cells, the grid, generators and both DC and AC loads. By automatically analyzing and converting the power between different voltages and AC or DC, it allows for energy to flow between all types of devices. With {{the advent of the}} Smart Grid it is becoming very popular since it combines renewable energy, demand management and community energy storage within the home or office.

30|$|These simple {{structure}} roadside infrastructures are massively deployed in locations like the highway. Normally, {{they use the}} solar as power input due to the unavailability or excess expense of wired electrical power. While the provisioning cost of a solar-powered roadside infrastructure is a strong function of its average energy consumption. According to the analysis in [13] which {{is a part of}} the US Department of Transportation’s Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Initiative, a breakdown of the deployment costs also found that over 63 % of these roadside infrastructure costs would be consumed by solar energy provisioning, e.g., <b>solar</b> <b>panels,</b> <b>batteries,</b> and their associated electronics. So, it is important to reduce the energy consumption of the {{simple structure}} roadside infrastructures.|$|R

50|$|Gastrobotics {{could allow}} users to deploy {{self-sustaining}} robots for extended times without human supervision. Common robots of today—powered by <b>solar</b> <b>panels,</b> <b>batteries,</b> or other energy sources—tend to become unreliable without human supervision for battery replacement, etc. Other robots must {{plug in to}} recharge, so they require constant access to an electrical outlet, which limits range. Solar powered robots are more independent but need a large surface area of solar panels to be efficient. This adds bulk and depends on weather conditions and clean panels to remain efficient. Gastrobotics {{might be able to}} live entirely off available natural resources. The main goal of this new technology is produce robots that can go on missions where human supervision is not feasible or desirable.|$|R

40|$|Power for {{portable}} {{electronic devices}} such as smartphones, GPS navigation systems, and tablets can come from low voltage <b>solar</b> <b>panels,</b> <b>batteries,</b> or ac-to-dc power supplies. Battery-powered systems often stack cells in series to achieve higher voltages, {{but this is not}} always possible {{due to a lack of}} space. Switching convert-ers use an inductor’s magnetic field to alternately store energy and release it to the load at a different voltage. With low losses, they are a good choice for high efficiency. Capacitors connected to the converter’s output reduce output voltage ripple. Boost, or step-up, converters provide higher output voltage; buck, or step-down, converters, described in the AN- 1125 Application Note, How to Apply DC-to-DC Step-Down (Buck) Regulators, provide lower output voltage. Switching converters that include internal FETs as switches are called switching regulators, whereas devices requiring external FETs are called switching controllers...|$|R

In some remote areas however {{electricity}} is unreachable and poses a taboo subject and cannot be enjoyed by local people such as in Tigaraja Village Sub-District of Tigadolok Regency of Simalungun. The sun is a renewable energy that it is beneficial for power plant use. With PLTS solar energy can be changed into the sun through the <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> <b>Battery</b> Charge Regulator BCR operates stabilizing voltage from <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> to <b>battery.</b> The battery will save electrical power to be distributed for household consumption. Since battery power has direct current however Inverter operates changing its direct current into alternating current. To optimize absorption of solar energy a servo motor is used to make solar panel moving by following the suns path. Arduino Uno as direct control of solar panel using solar sensor gives current for servo motor. Then the servo motor can move in reverse and forward.

30|$|Agent-based {{modelling}} (ABM) {{has been}} used successfully {{over the last decade}} to model different aspects of the electricity sector. Its use was initially mainly for the analysis of power market design for large-scale electricity systems when deregulation happened (North et al. 2002; Batten et al. 2006; Weidlich 2008). These models aimed at investigating the interactions between the physical infrastructure at the transmission level (high voltage networks), and the economic behaviour of market participants to help engineer markets in the electricity sector. The application of ABM to the electricity distribution network (medium and low voltage networks) is not as widespread as that of the transmission networks, but is becoming more studied, especially as new technologies (rooftop <b>solar</b> <b>panels,</b> <b>batteries,</b> …) are appearing on the market and transforming the way electricity is consumed, produced and traded (Cai et al. 2011; Institute for Energy and Transport 2014).|$|R
