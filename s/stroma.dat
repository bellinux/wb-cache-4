5|$|It is more {{reliably}} recorded that in 1455 the Bishop of Caithness, William Mudy, granted <b>Stroma</b> {{and other}} lands and castles {{to his brother}} Gilbert. It eventually passed {{into the hands of}} the Sinclair family, who have held the title of Earl of Caithness since 1455. In 1659 George Sinclair, the 6th Earl of Caithness, granted the wadset of <b>Stroma</b> to John Kennedy of Kermuck, who had fled to the far north after being outlawed following the fatal wounding of John Forbes of Watertown.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that <b>Stroma</b> gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem the exodus of people from the island, <b>Stroma</b> was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E

50|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Henry Scholfield, {{was released on}} YouTube on 18 December 2013 and features <b>Stromae</b> partly dressed as a woman. The track shows the life of female <b>Stromae,</b> annoyed as she is with the attitude of men and what they do. Throughout the video, <b>Stromae</b> depicts various stereotypical remarks women make about men, accompanied by the non-verbal cues the other characters in the video make. The lighting effects in the video (green light for male <b>Stromae,</b> pink light for female <b>Stromae)</b> aid {{the interpretation of the}} song. The video has received over 157 million views as of June 2017.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stromae</b> {{interpreted}} the song alongside Arno during De Eregallerij 2012 in Belgium and also during Les Victoires de la musique 2012 in France. A recorded version {{was included in}} Aerno's compilation album Le coffret essentiel released on 19 mai 2014 credited as Arno featuring <b>Stromae.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Stroma</b> is {{bisected}} by a fault {{which runs}} in a north-south direction through its centre, intersected by another fault running in an east-northeast direction across {{the north of the}} island. The soil {{on either side of the}} fault line is significantly different; the eastern and southern parts of <b>Stroma</b> are covered by fertile clay fed by bedrock minerals, while less fertile boggy ground predominates on the west side.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stroma</b> {{lacked a}} regular {{connection}} to the mainland until 1879, when the Post Office subsidised a weekly boat service from Huna on the mainland and established a post office on the island. However, the volume of mail from <b>Stroma</b> proved so small that the service was grossly uneconomical. By the 1950s, the Post Office was spending 1s. 2d. for each letter worth 2½d. in postage.|$|E
5|$|Today, <b>Stroma</b> has no regular {{communications}} with the mainland. The island's owner runs occasional boat trips there on weekends.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 July 2013, <b>Stromae</b> {{announced}} on his Facebook and Twitter accounts {{that he had}} completed his second studio album Racine carrée or √ {{and that it would}} be released on 16 August 2013. On 25 August 2013, <b>Stromae</b> joined Major Lazer's show at French festival Rock en Seine, where he performed Papaoutai. In September 2013, Belgian rock band Mintzkov covered his song [...] "Formidable/Wonderful" [...] for a live session on Studio Brussel, with lyrics in English. In November 2013, <b>Stromae</b> received the award for Best Belgian Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{to the song}} was uploaded to YouTube by <b>Stromae</b> on 15 September 2010. The video shows <b>Stromae</b> as a priest of a religion based around house music. The congregation watches him sing on a large screen while initially standing still and, later, starting to sing and dance.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tous les mêmes" [...] {{was officially}} {{released}} {{as the third}} single from the album in December 2013. The song displays the various stereotypical traits and behaviours {{of men and women}} alike. The music video for the single shows <b>Stromae</b> half-dressed as a woman and acting annoyed by the attitude of men and what they do; to further aid the interpretation, green lighting effects are used for male <b>Stromae</b> and pink ones for female <b>Stromae.</b> The single became Stromae's third consecutive number one from Racine carrée in France and Wallonia, while reaching the top five in Flanders and charting in the Netherlands and Switzerland.|$|R
5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on <b>Stroma,</b> which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave <b>Stroma</b> to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways {{looked into the}} {{possibility}} of including <b>Stroma</b> in the hospital ambulance plane service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of <b>Stroma,</b> and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclairs of Mey {{sold their}} {{portion of the}} island to Colonel F.B. Imbert-Terry in 1929, who sold it in turn to John Hoyland, an {{umbrella}} manufacturer from Yorkshire, in 1947. Hoyland also acquired the remaining island estate of the Sinclairs of Freswick, uniting <b>Stroma</b> for a reported cost of £4,000. His tenure coincided with the final collapse of the island's population. As the tenants left, Hoyland put <b>Stroma</b> on the market but found no buyers. A Caithness councilman suggested various schemes for <b>Stroma,</b> including establishing a nudist colony and {{using it as a}} site for a crematorium, but the council rejected suggestions that it should take on responsibility for the island. As the population left, the local economy disintegrated; there were no longer enough able-bodied men to man the fishing boats, and the remaining facilities on the island were closed down for lack of custom. The last store on the island, the Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society shop, closed in 1956. Only three families, numbering 16 people in total, were left by 1957; that year, the island's school closed, by which time it only had two pupils. The Post Office closed in 1958 when the family which operated it left for the mainland.|$|E
5000|$|In early December 2010 the VRT {{announced}} the nominees for the 2010 MIA's. The most nominated artists with {{four or more}} nominations were <b>Stromae,</b> Tom Dice, Bart Peeters and Admiral Freebee. The distribution happened live at Eén on 7 January 2011. <b>Stromae</b> won the most important MIA, [...] "Hit van het Jaar", as well as [...] "Best Breaktrough". There was no clear-cut winner of the event. The most successful artists, all with two winners were <b>Stromae,</b> The Black Box Revelation, Goose and Triggerfinger. Only at the 2010 show a MIA for [...] "Kidspop" [...] was awarded, with Kapitein Winokio as winner.|$|R

5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of <b>Stroma</b> {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off <b>Stroma</b> support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other factors}} {{have often been}} cited in Stroma's depopulation: the {{building}} of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs on the mainland, and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on <b>Stroma</b> on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from <b>Stroma</b> to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland, while others found alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.|$|E
5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic <b>stroma</b> and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E

5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic <b>stroma</b> and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on <b>Stroma</b> in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{settlements}} {{existed on}} Stroma: Nethertown, {{in the north}} of the island, and Uppertown or Overtown, in the south. They originally belonged to the Freswick estate, which owned Nethertown, and the Mey estate, which owned Uppertown. Between the two was Mains of <b>Stroma,</b> the island's principal farm. A track runs {{the entire length of the}} island, connecting the lighthouse at the north tip with the two settlements and the harbour on the south coast.|$|E

5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} {{testify to}} the presence of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although <b>Stroma</b> lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stroma</b> is now abandoned, {{with the}} houses of its former {{inhabitants}} unoccupied and falling into ruin. Its population fell gradually through {{the first half of}} the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere, as economic problems and Stroma's isolation made life on the island increasingly unsupportable. From an all-time peak of 375 people in 1901, the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year. Stroma's final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed. The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it to graze cattle and sheep.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of <b>Stroma,</b> leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of <b>Stroma,</b> with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E
