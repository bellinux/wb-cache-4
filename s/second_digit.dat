5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than {{than that of the}} <b>second</b> <b>digit,</b> as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. As in most coelurosaurs, the <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> of the hand is the largest, even when the third digit is not present.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E

5000|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} {{features a}} separate carpus and manus in the forelimb.

25|$|Similar to phalangerids {{though in}} a {{different}} order, koalas have five digits on their fore and hind feet with sharp curved claws except for the first digit of the hind foot. The first and <b>second</b> <b>digits</b> of the forefeet are opposable to the other three, which enables the koala to grip smaller branches and search for fresh leaves in the outer canopy. Similar to the phalangerids, the <b>second</b> and third <b>digits</b> of the hind foot are fused but have separate claws.|$|R
40|$|First {{and higher}} order digits in data sets {{of natural and}} {{socio-economic}} processes often follow a distribution called Benford’s law. This phenomenon {{has been used in}} many business and scientific applications, especially in fraud detection for financial data. In this paper, we analyse whether Benford’s law holds in economic research and forecasting. First, we examine the distribution of leading digits of regression coefficients and standard errors in research papers, published in Empirica and Applied Economics Letters. Second, we analyse forecasts of GDP growth and CPI inflation in Germany, published in Consensus Forecasts. There are two main findings: The relative frequencies of the first and <b>second</b> <b>digits</b> in economic research are broadly consistent with Benford’s law. In sharp contrast, the <b>second</b> <b>digits</b> of Consensus Forecasts exhibit a massive excess of zeros and fives, raising doubts on their information content...|$|R
25|$|In {{non-twisting}} armstand dives, the <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> {{indicates the}} direction of rotation (0 = no rotation, 1 = forward, 2 = backward, 3 = reverse, 4 = inward) and the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults. Inward-rotating armstand dives have never been performed, and are generally regarded as physically impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of Benford's law {{goes back to}} 1881, when the American astronomer Simon Newcomb noticed that in logarithm tables the earlier pages (that started with 1) were much more worn than the other pages. Newcomb's published result is the first known instance of this observation and includes a distribution on the <b>second</b> <b>digit,</b> as well. Newcomb proposed a law that {{the probability of a}} single number N being the first digit of a number was equal to log(N+1)−log(N).|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than using}} a base-10 scheme, like Western numbering, the Long Count days were tallied in a {{modified}} base-20 scheme. In a pure base-20 scheme, 0.0.0.1.5 {{is equal to}} 25 and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. The Long Count is not pure base-20, however, since the <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> from the right (and only that digit) rolls over to zero when it reaches 18. Thus 0.0.1.0.0 does not represent 400 days, but rather only 360 days and 0.0.0.17.19 represents 359 days.|$|E

25|$|Deinonychosaurs, {{named after}} the {{enlarged}} sickle-shaped <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> of the foot, {{are closely related to}} birds. They have two distinct families, Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Troodontid fossils are known from 127 to 65Ma. They have a more slender build and longer limbs. The earliest named troodontid fossil known is Sinornithoides. Dromaeosaurid fossils are known from about 127 to 65Ma with the exception of Utahraptor. The skeletal remains of Utahraptor are about 127-144Ma. This is interesting because according to a recent cladistic analysis, Utahraptor is about as far from the ancestral Theropoda as it is possible to get, further than Archaeopteryx. Dromaeosaurids have a larger second digit; this family includes the well known dinosaurs Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus and Velociraptor.|$|E

25|$|Trains are sorted {{into various}} {{categories}} that dictate the number of stops along their route, the priority they enjoy on the network, and the fare structure.

The first digit as 5 denotes a passenger train. The <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> indicates the zone that operates the train, the third the division within the zone that controls the train and is responsible for its regular maintenance and cleanliness, and the last two digits are the train's serial number.

25|$|Despite {{its small}} arms, the {{feathers}} {{that made up}} the wings were very long, more than twice the length of the humerus (upper arm). The wings were broad, with a total surface area of about one square meter each, but their precise shape is unknown due to taphonomic distortion. The specimen's right wing shows an overlapping complex of primary feathers (which attach to the <b>second</b> <b>digit</b> of the hand), secondary feathers (which attach to the forearm), and coverts (which cover both sets). The overall feather architecture of the wings {{is similar to that of}} Microraptor, Changyuraptor, Anchiornis, Eosinopteryx, and basal avialans like Archaeopteryx, but the coverts are noteworthy for being more similar in size and shape to these feathers in modern birds. These are preserved as a row of approximately 30 feathers of a consistent small size that attach perpendicularly to the ulna and third metacarpal of the specimen. The coverts of Archaeopteryx and other basal paravians that preserve them are, by contrast, considerably longer and cover much of the wing.|$|E
