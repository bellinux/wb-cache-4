40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} study in human-centered {{automation}} that has potential to reduce patient side effects from high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT). To efficiently deliver radiation to the prostate while minimizing trauma to sensitive structures such as the penile bulb, we modified the Acubot-RND 7 -axis robot to guide insertion of diamond-tip needles into desired <b>skew-line</b> geometric arrangements. We extend and integrate two algorithms: Needle Planning with Integer Programming (NPIP) and Inverse Planning with Integer Programming (IPIP) to compute <b>skew-line</b> needle and dose plans. We performed three physical experiments with anatomically-correct phantom models to study performance: two with the robot and one control experiment with an expert human physician (co-author Hsu) without the robot. All were able to achieve needle arrangements that meet the RTOG- 0321 clinical dose objectives with zero trauma to the penile bulb. We analyze systematic and random errors in needle placement; total RMS error for the robot system operating without feedback ranged from 2. 6 mm to 4. 3 mm, which {{is comparable to the}} RMS error of 2. 7 mm obtained in an earlier study for PPI-BT treatment using a robot with 3 D ultrasound feedback. Note to Practitioners Brachytherapy treats cancer by delivering radioactive sources proximal to cancer sites via needles. Current methods use standardized fixed mechanical templates that force needles into parallel arrangements that may prevent needles from reaching prostate volumes blocked by the pubic arch and often require needles to puncture sensitive organs. <b>Skew-line</b> (non-parallel) arrangements of needles can reach targets under the pubic arch and avoid sensitive organs. However these arrangements cannot be achieved with standard templates, motivating the use of automation. We present a human-centered automation system that integrates state-of-the...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Automation {{seeks to}} improve the {{reliability}} and quality of processes. This study aims to automate high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT), a radiation therapy that places radioactive sources {{at the site of}} the tumor using needles. Although HDR-BT has a high rate of clinical success in curing prostate cancer, it also has several side effects related to needle and dose trauma. A new planning algorithm from previous work optimizes needle arrangements using skew-lines (non-parallel, non-intersecting lines). This paper presents initial experiments towards an automated system for implanting <b>skew-line</b> needle arrangements computed from a planning system. We describe the interface, calibration and integration of the robotic hardware with the planning system, and present experiments using our robotic system to implant needles into anatomically-correct tissue phantoms. Results suggest that this system can achieve HDR-BT treatment objectives with reduced trauma to organs and low demands on operator skill, thus making the procedure more reliable and repeatable. In the future, we believe that robotic HDR-BT will improve overall treatment quality with reduced dependence on physician skill. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — When {{planning}} <b>skew-line</b> needle {{arrangements for}} automated brachytherapy, one {{objective is to}} identify a set of candidate needles that enter from a specified entry region, avoid specified organs-at-risk and sufficiently cover the target (tumor) volume. Existing methods use uniform or random sampling to generate a set of candidate needles, which may not adequately cover the target volume. In this paper we present an exact reachability analysis {{that can be used}} to guide the selection of candidate needles and to identify which subset of the target volume may not be reachable. Assuming linear needles, a polyhedral entry zone, organs at risk modeled as the union of convex polyhedra, and a polyhedral target volume, we give an exact polynomial time algorithm for checking existence and calculation of the non-reachable set in the target volume. We perform experiments using patient data from 18 brachytherapy cases and found that 11 cases had non-empty occluded volume ranging from 0. 01 % to 4. 3 % of target volume. We also report a sensitivity study showing the change in the occluded volume with dilation of the avoidance volume and entry region. I...|$|E
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} fundamental mode of a propagating Gaussian beam is presented. The model is two-fold, consisting of a mathematical expression and a corresponding geometrical representation which interprets the expression {{in the light of}} geometrical optics. The mathematical description arises from the (0, 0) order of a new family of exact, closed-form solutions to the scalar Helmholtz equation. The family consists of nonseparable functions in the oblate spheroidal coordinate system and can easily be transformed to a different set of solutions in the prolate spheroidal coordinate system, where the (0, 0) order is a spherical wave. This transformation consists of two substitutions in the coordinate system parameters and represents a more general method of obtaining a Gaussian beam from a spherical wave than assuming a complex point source on axis. Further, each higher-order member of the family of solutions possesses an amplitude consisting of a finite number of higher-order terms with a zero-order term that is Gaussian. The geometrical interpretation employs the <b>skew-line</b> generator of a hyperboloid of one sheet as a ray-like element on a contour of constant amplitude in the Gaussian beam. The geometrical characteristics of the skew line and the consequences of treating it as a ray are explored in depth. The skew line is ultimately used to build a nonorthogonal coordinate system which allows straight-line propagation of a Gaussian beam in three-dimensional space. Highlights of the research into other methods used to model a propagating Gaussian beam [...] such as complex rays, complex point sources and complex argument functions [...] are reviewed and compared with this work...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to enhance}} automation in healthcare applications, specifically: brachytherapy delivery for cancer treatment and robot-assisted surgery, used for over 500, 000 procedures annually in US alone. Brachytherapy uses cutting-edge computer-assisted planning, but assumes a fixed hardware design. On the contrary, Robot-Assisted Surgery uses high-precision state-of-the-art hardware under complete manual control with little automation. This dissertation is a step towards addressing this gap {{using a combination of}} optimization and design. Case studies show that performance of autonomous systems can be improved by leveraging the interaction between optimization based algorithms and the design of hardware systems. For Brachytherapy, this dissertation has developed a new approach for treatment delivery in Intracavitary Brachytherapy using patient specific 3 D printed implants and implemented it on a clinical case of oral cancer. I present an algorithm to quantify reachability with straight-line needles for a given anatomy in prostate cancer. I integrate optimization based needle and dose planning algorithms in interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer using two methods of <b>skew-line</b> needle configuration implants: robot-assisted procedures and customized needle guides. The procedures are demonstrated on physical phantoms and performance is compared with an expert physician. For Robot-Assisted Surgery, this dissertation highlights the interplay between the design ofhardware to reduce uncertainty and optimization based motion planning to enable automated multi-throw suturing. A novel algorithm, Transition State Clustering (TSC) extracts the latent task structure from task demonstrations by segmenting robot trajectories using hierarchical clustering and fitting Gaussian mixture model to identify transitions. I extend TSC with deep learning to perform trajectory segmentation for multi-modal data consisting of kinematics and videos...|$|E
