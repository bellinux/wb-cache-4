The study assessed {{the effects of a}} one-time reduction in the tax rate applied to the repatriation of foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> on spending, output, and employment in the U.S. economy. The study found that a temporary reduction to approximately 5.25 percent would lead to a significant increase in repatriations, making $942 billion available for domestic use by U.S. multinational corporations.|$|E
40|$|Japanese firms report both parent-only and {{consolidated}} financial statements. Because of {{the unique}} business environment in Japan, there is a widely held view that parent-only data provides a better means for assessing {{the value of the}} entire firm. We find that both parent-only and <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> are important in predicting future consolidated earnings. However, while stock prices accurately reflect the persistence of parent-only earnings, the Japanese stock market appears to underestimate the persistence of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings,</b> causing a significant positive relation between changes in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> in year "t" and stock returns in year "t"+ 1. This relation between <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> and future stock returns does not persist beyond year "t" 7 plus; 1. Taking a long (short) position in firms with large, positive (negative) changes in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> results in an average annual abnormal return of 7. 06 % with positive returns in 12 of the 13 years in the test period.

40|$|This paper investigates {{factors that}} {{influence}} the amount of foreign retained earnings permanently reinvested abroad and the market valuation of these earnings. I {{examine the effects of}} repatriation taxes and the difference between foreign and domestic profitability on the amount of foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> that firms reinvest abroad using the permanently reinvested earnings designation as a proxy for foreign retained earnings. This extends prior work that examines the effect of repatriation taxes on repatriations by including both foreign and domestic profitability and by allowing the effects to vary by the firm's foreign tax credit position. The results are consistent with the hypotheses and indicate that foreign retained earnings increase with the difference between foreign and domestic after-tax-returns. Foreign retained earnings decrease with the foreign tax rate for firms in binding foreign tax credit positions, but are not related to the foreign tax rate for firms in nonbinding foreign tax credit positions. Next, I examine how earnings management incentives affect the amount of foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> designated as permanently reinvested, controlling for the effects of profitability and repatriation taxes. I examine whether firms that are close to debt covenant violation or that fail to meet their target earnings have higher permanently reinvested earnings. The permanently reinvested earnings designation provides the opportunity to manage earnings because U. S. repatriation taxes need not be recognized in financial statement income if the earnings are designated as permanently reinvested. I find no evidence of earnings management to meet debt covenants; however, I do find evidence of earnings management to meet target earnings. Finally, I examine the market valuation of taxes on permanently reinvested earnings and whether this valuation differs for earnings managers and non-earnings managers. I hypothesize that because the tax estimate is undiscounted, the market values taxes on permanently reinvested earnings more negatively for earnings managers than for non-earnings managers because it perceives the investment to be of a shorter duration. The results support this hypothesis and suggest that the market recognizes earnings management attempts and values the tax estimate as if the reinvestment of foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> by earnings managers is not permanent...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the marginal {{source of funds}} for foreign investment using both aggregate and micro data on the intrafirm transactions of U. S. international firms. Tax arbitrage regarding the form and timing of transactions, combined with risks involved with foreign operations and {{the desire of the}} parent to control subsidiaries, suggests that parent transfers provide the marginal source of funds for most foreign investment. Our conclusion is consistent with the seemingly puzzling evidence that some subsidiaries have positive dividends and transfers simultaneously despite the associated tax penalties, and others neither pay dividends nor receive transfers. Our analysis and empirical evidence are in sharp conflict with the widely-held tax capitalization view that retained <b>subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> are the marginal source of financing foreign investment. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper shows that u. s. tax policy can have significant effects on u. s. direct investment outflows through various channels. It is stressed that a sensible choice of specification and data in an empirical model entails a rigorous examination of the theoretical underpinnings behind the model. In particular, we emphasize the difference between foreign fixed investment undertaken by the foreign subsidiary and direct investment of the entire international firm, and the need to use different theoretical frameworks in each case. We present estimated equations relating the balance of payments direct investment outflows [...] distinguishing between retained <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>earnings</b> and parent transfers [...] to various measures of the u. s. net rate of return and the cost of funds. The evidence shows that u. s. tax policy toward domestic investment has an important effect on direct investment outflows by influencing the relative net rate of return between the U. S. and abroad. We estimate that a 16 cent reduction in transfers made by U. S. parents firms occurs for every dollar increase in U. S. domestic investment. In contrast to previous studies, transfers equations fit much better than retained earnings equations for every net return variable used in our estimation. Of the various specifications tested, the transfers equation containing a marginal, forward-looking and corporate-investor net return variable fits best, a result which is consistent with the predictions of our theoretical framework. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} {{research}} on how, why, and when companies manage earnings, there is a paucity of evidence about the geographic location of earnings management within multinational firms. In this study, we examine where companies manage earnings using a sample of 2, 067 U. S. multinational firms from 1994 to 2009. We predict and find that firms with extensive foreign operations in weak rule of law countries have more foreign earnings management than companies with subsidiaries in locations where {{the rule of law}} is strong. We also find some evidence that profitable firms with extensive tax haven <b>subsidiaries</b> manage <b>earnings</b> more than other firms and that the earnings management is concentrated in foreign income. Apart from these results, we find that most earnings management takes place in domestic income, not foreign income. Arthur Andersen (Firm) (Arthur Andersen Faculty Fund...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} empirically the value relevance of, first, the total reported consolidated accounting earnings and, secondly, the <b>earnings</b> of the <b>subsidiaries</b> {{attributed to the}} parent company, under a cost of acquisition regime, via an association study. Various alternative models were formed and tested empirically against data obtained from the Athens Stock Exchange for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995. It was found that, when undeflated, total reported consolidated earnings were value relevant but {{to a lesser degree}} than the total reported earnings of the parent company, probably because they are the sum of a set of heterogeneous earnings components. Similarly, consolidation did not improve the explanatory power of the valuation models. However, decomposition of the total reported consolidated earnings into the part contributed by the parent company and the part contributed by the <b>subsidiaries</b> (excess group <b>earnings),</b> in order to account for the different legal (and tax) status of these two earnings components provided two earnings measures with different degree of value relevance, thus verifying expectations. ...|$|R
