Considering the necessity of strengthening the financial discipline in the formation, administration and use of public funds, the Court of Accounts (CoA) assumes its role of watchdog in upholding the law in all matters mentioned above. Such a role is even more important as besides national public funds there are also an important number of non-reimbursable credits granted to our country by the European Union.

In recent times, the ILO has profiled as the <b>specialised</b> <b>institution</b> of the UN with the aim to promote the internationally accepted human and labor rights and social justice. Due to a unique tri-partite structure (consisting of representatives of employees, employers and governments in its bodies) the ILO has contributed not only to the creation of international labor law, but especially influenced domestic labor laws of all its member states including the Czech Republic. The reason for chosing this topic was my interest in international labor law aspects during my studies at the Law faculty of the Passau university. The ILO conventions are main sources of international labor law which are approved by its superior body - International Labor Conference and then ratified by member states. The ILO conventions have mostly contributed to the support of social justice and internationally accepted human and labor rights. The results of legislative activities are demonstrated in my thesis especially by a detailed analysis of eight most important conventions which are referred to as the Core Labor Standards.

Many of these—such as diabetes, cancer, and inherited inborn metabolic diseases—have no definite treatments or cure. Meanwhile, advanced health biotechnology has been found, in principle, {{to be an effective}} solution for these health problems. Methods Qualitative approaches were employed to analyse the current situation and examine existing public policies related to advanced health biotechnologies in Thailand. The results of this analysis were then used to formulate policy recommendations. Results Our research revealed that the system in Thailand in relation to advanced health biotechnologies is fragmented, with multiple unaddressed gaps, underfunding of research and development (R&D), and a lack of incentives for the private sector. In addition, there are no clear definitions of advanced health biotechnologies, and coverage pathways are absent. Meanwhile, false advertising and misinformation are prevalent, with no responsible bodies to actively and effectively provide appropriate information and education (I&E). The establishment of a <b>specialised</b> <b>institution</b> to fill the gaps in this area is warranted. Conclusion The development and implementation of a comprehensive national strategic plan related to advanced health biotechnologies, greater investment in R&D and I&E for all stakeholders, collaboration among agencies, harmonisation of reimbursement across public health schemes, and provision of targeted I&E are specifically recommended. </p...|$|E

Data of 281 children referred to the Baby and Toddler Consultation at the Charité University Hospital {{between the ages of}} zero to 4. 9 years has been analysed. Of those children 112 had at least one mentally ill parent. These subjects constitute the index group where as the other 169 form the control group. The psychosocial situation of the children has been assessed via the parental education, the fifth axis of the Multiaxial Classification Scheme of the ICD 10, as well as the Family Adversity Index. Infantile emotional and behavioural disorders have been measured with the Clinical Assessment Scale of Child and Adolescent Psychopathology and the parents´ questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist 1 ½- 5 for preschool children. The children of the index and control group were significantly different in regards to age and diagnoses in DC: 0 - 3. The children of the index group are younger at first admission and more frequently, suffer from conduct disorders. In index families, lower educational levels of the parents, more psychosocial adversities and more familiar risk factors were found. Psychopathological symptoms were more intense, e. g. treatment-requiring, in index children. Parents rate infantile behaviour problems as noticeable rather than borderline.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{multidisciplinary}} {{outpatient department}} {{was set up}} {{in the northern part of}} the Netherlands because of a local lack of adequate treatment and care for Huntington's disease (HD) patients. Outreaching multidisciplinary care is a novel way to optimise functioning and quality of life of HD patients. The vast majority of patients want to stay home as long as possible. Huntington's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder leading to complete disability and long term residence in a <b>specialised</b> <b>institution.</b> In this paper we outline this new type of treatment and give the results of 1. 5 year, we also present the results of an inquiry on the appreciation of the working method. Methods In the first project half (1. 5 yr) 28 patients were seen as had been anticipated. The multidisciplinary team consisting of an institutional physician, a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, a social worker, an occupational therapist and a case manager, assesses the stage of the disease and formulates, coordinates and implements the individual care and treatment plan in the home situation. After 1. 5 year a questionnaire on the appreciation of the department was sent to patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, the lay organisation and Dutch "experts in the field". Results For the 28 HD patients a total of 242 problems and actions were verbalised in the care plan, which was accepted by the majority of the patients. Especially informal caregivers, the lay organisation and the Dutch "experts in the field" were enthusiastic on the outreaching and multidisciplinary nature of the department. The verdict over the continuance of the clinic was positive and unanimous. Conclusions We concluded that coordinating outreaching multidisciplinary care from an outpatient clinic into the dwelling place of the patient is feasible and appreciated. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Children’s Court of New South Wales is a <b>specialised</b> <b>institution</b> {{in legal}} {{decision-making}} regarding {{children and parents}} subject to statutory child protection intervention. The Children’s Court Clinic of New South Wales provides the forensic assessment reports, which evaluate the parenting capacity of adults about whom protective concerns exist. The research uses de-identified clinical assessment reports prepared by Authorised Clinicians within the Children’s Court Clinic. The research evaluates {{the nature of the}} work referred to the Children’s Court Clinic and the content of assessment reports in parenting capacity. The study utilises the methodology of grounded theory principles and forensic practice guidelines to analyse the issues relevant to the written reports completed in this legal setting. The assessment issues considered significant by the Children’s Court are illustrated using grounded theory principles. These assessment issues are then explored through the content of analysis contained within a sample of reports. The analytical process of the Authorised Clinicians is then considered in more detail through the theme of the parental capacity to change and the core concept of insight. This theme is illustrated through a detailed discussion of clinical assessment practice, in terms of the specific issues of a parent’s family history, the relevance of culture and the analysis of interventions within the reports. The assessment reports are then evaluated using forensic practice guidelines. The characteristics and limitations of parenting capacity assessment within this context are illustrated with reference to specific practice guidelines. Two crucial priorities are identified in the assessment task and these are the distillation of risk issues and the use of formal forensic practice guidelines. The broader issues emerging from this study are then evaluated. These issues include the situational tensions inherent within the forensic assessment context, the nature of interdisciplinary practice and recommendations for future research...|$|E

Therefore, the petroleum industry is fraught with conflicts of interests, primarily between developing petroleum exporting countries and petroleum companies sustained by their home states, most of which are developed countries. The majority of disputes have been settled by arbitration, most of which have been controversial. The question of the applicable law to the merits of a dispute is intimately related to the controversies surrounding arbitral tribunals. The prevailing perspective of western scholars during the 20 `h century, and still to an extent today, was that host state law was inadequate, and host state courts were partial. Therefore, these scholars held any dispute arising between a host state and a petroleum company should be dealt with as an international dispute and should be settled far away from the host state's court and governed by laws or rules other than that of the host state. This thesis examines the past and present of petroleum arbitration, the perceptions and the practice, and aims to suggest a modified method of determining the applicable law to petroleum disputes. It argues that contrary to the previous allegations, the legal infrastructure of host states has developed over the years and today offers an adequate law to govern the merits of petroleum disputes. It further suggests a semi-localisation approach. The thesis focuses only on arbitration as a method of resolving such disputes, and limits itself to Arab petroleum countries.

40|$|Teaching and {{learning}} {{are not in}} themselves new phenomena; they once took place within the routines of daily life. During the early industrialised era, however, these practices came to be increasingly confined to a separate and <b>specialised</b> <b>institution,</b> whose features evolved to encompass, among others, a specific teaching profession, school textbooks aimed at particular stages of the schooling process, weekly teaching schedules and standardised tests. Industrialisation dismantled what had been viewed as social coherence; the “new” sociologies of Weber, Durkheim and Marx were concerned with attempting to understand the consequences for society of the profound changes in the economy, morality, religion, and {{in the distribution of}} social wealth which emerged in industrialisation’s wake. These changes did not pass the field of education by. In Germany, Herbart, and later Nohl and Weniger, tried to formulate a philosophy for a reform-oriented education, while in the US Dewey, followed by Kilpatrick and Counts, tried to address this issue. Their work offers us insights into the tension between principles promulgated by and centred around state, national or federal authorities and progressivist ideas focusing on the individual, as well as that between more general ideas of “Bildung”, education as an aim in and of itself, and concepts of a more specific nature revolving around education for the labour market and for trades and professions. We now appear to find ourselves facing a new kind of social revolution, whose core manifestation appears in the changes sweeping the world with the advance of globalisation, multimedia and digitised communication, which once again appear to be changing the social structures as well as, among other things, relationships between producers and consumers of information. These changes have profound implications for teaching {{and learning}} in schools and for the ways in which we respond to the new challenges they bring.
