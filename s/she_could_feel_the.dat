500|$|The filming {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical challenges, with the producer Adam Tandy explaining that the simultaneous singing and conversing made production particularly difficult: [...] "To record it all 'clean' and have options in the edit, that was technically hard on everybody." [...] Typically, karaoke scenes in television will see characters sing only the opening lines, {{but because of the}} format of Inside No. 9, the characters in [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] sing the whole song. Each character sang a song, with the vocals recorded live. The actors wore an earpiece to listen to the music while singing; Howlett's, used so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> beat, was taped under her wig, and she was counted in by Outhwaite. Filming took a week, with days focussed on particular songs.|$|E
60|$|Through the open-worked {{sleeves of}} her dress <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sun bite vigorously.|$|E
60|$|Blanche breathed {{more freely}} {{when she found}} herself alone. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> relief now of seeing Anne revive.|$|E
60|$|Marjorie {{felt she}} had to hurry. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> feet of Theodore coming up that tower.|$|R
50|$|Pat's next horse, {{the grey}} mare Carmena, {{came after the}} parting with Finality. Although Carmena was a talented and {{successful}} horse, Pat admitted that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same closeness she had had with Finality.|$|R
60|$|Fanny {{left the}} room with a very sorrowful heart; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} to be so small, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily {{she closed}} her eyes as Billy's thumb-ends pressed into them. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> fore-running ache of a dull and terrible hurt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. d'Alcacer would express this {{by saying}} that {{everything}} rested on honour," [...] commented Mrs. Travers with lips that did not tremble, though {{from time to time}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> accelerated beating of her heart.|$|E
60|$|School {{was fairly}} quiet. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> class {{watching}} her, ready to spring on her. Her instinct {{was aware of}} the class instinct to catch her if she were weak. But she kept cold and was guarded.|$|E
60|$|In a kind {{of spiritual}} trance, she yielded, she gave way, and all was dark. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> within <b>the</b> darkness, the terrible {{assertion}} of her body, the unutterable anguish of dissolution, the only anguish that is too much, the far-off, awful nausea of dissolution set in within the body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had furs on," [...] said Mabel. [...] "What {{a lovely}} spot it is, {{even in this}} weather." [...] Then dinner was announced. She had not been cold. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{tingling}} heat of her blood as she had implored him to love her.|$|R
60|$|Jill {{had listened}} to this {{diatribe}} with a certain uneasiness. Her brief encounters with Mr. Goble told her that every word was probably true. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> unpleasant sensation of being inspected by the eye which Wally had compared--quite justly--to that of a codfish. But her pride forbade any admission of weakness.|$|R
60|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering in Mercy had attained its term. Alone in the library, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> physical relief of repose; she could vaguely recall Julian's parting words to her, and sadly {{wonder what they}} meant--she could do no more.|$|E
60|$|Milt {{was devoted}} to persuading the huge cat of a car to tiptoe down the {{slippery}} gouged ruts of the road, and Claire's mind was driving with him. Every time he touched the foot-brake, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> strain in the tendons of her own ankle.|$|E
60|$|They walked home. Carol took Erik's arm. Through {{her thin}} linen sleeve <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> crumply {{warmth of his}} {{familiar}} brown jersey coat. She observed that there were purple and red gold threads interwoven with the brown. She remembered {{the first time she}} had seen it.|$|E
60|$|Rose sat in silence. This {{had been}} another great period of growth. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> heat and turmoil in her brain. It {{was as if}} upon a {{seed-bed}} of quick-shooting plants a bright, warm light had been turned, resulting in instant, magical activity. At her door they put her down, and once more she thanked them.|$|R
60|$|Ursula was dazed. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{touch of}} the mistress's body against her own--only this, only this. The rest of the {{swimming}} time passed like a trance. When the call was given to leave the water, Miss Inger walked down the bath towards Ursula. Her rust-red, thin tunic was clinging to her, the whole body was defined, firm and magnificent, as it seemed to the girl.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} {{they sat in}} silence. Then Dot reached out her hand to see if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> anything; but <b>the</b> cool, damp air was all around them. Then she reached upward, and her hand struck against a piece of {{projecting}} rock which hurt her.|$|R
60|$|The {{terror of}} seeing {{him as she}} saw him now was not the terror she had felt when her eyes first lighted on him--an {{apparition}} in the moon-light, a specter in the ghostly Hall. This time she could struggle against the shock; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> depth of her own fear.|$|E
60|$|Her mind reverted {{often to}} the torture cell {{of a certain}} Bishop of France, in which the victim could neither stand nor lie {{stretched}} out, never. Not that she thought of herself in any connection with this. But often there came into her mind the wonder, how the cell was built, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> horror of the crampedness, as something very real.|$|E
6000|$|Presently the girl's {{eyes went}} wide in horror. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> scalp upon her head {{contract}} with fright. Her terror-filled gaze was frozen upon that awful figure that loomed {{so large and}} sinister above her, for the thing had moved! She had seen it with her own eyes. There could be no mistake--no hallucination of overwrought nerves about it. The Blentz Princess was moving slowly toward her! ...|$|E
60|$|Then, quite suddenly, with a quiver, down <b>she</b> went. You <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> boat sink, sink,--down, down,--would {{it never}} get to the bottom? The water came flush up to the lower deck, and then,--thank heaven,--the sinking stopped {{and there was the}} Mariposa Belle safe and tight on a reed bank.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed so}} {{balanced}} and sure, he {{made such a}} confident presence. He was a great rider, so there was about him some of a horseman's sureness and habitual definiteness of decision, also some of the horseman's animal darkness. Yet his soul was only the more wavering, vague. He seemed {{made up of a}} set of habitual actions and decisions. The vulnerable, variable quick of the man was inaccessible. She knew nothing of it. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> dark, heavy fixity of his animal desire.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{stirring}} {{memory of}} the day's adventure, {{the feeling of the}} beauty of the night, and a strange, deep-seated, sweetly vague consciousness of happiness portending, were all burned out in hot, pressing pain at the remembrance of Stewart's disgrace in her eyes. Something had changed within her so that what had been anger at herself was sorrow for him. He was such a splendid man. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same; <b>she</b> knew her debt to him, yet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not thank him, could not speak to him. She fought an unintelligible bitterness.|$|R
60|$|So {{she waited}} till Friday. Kingston-on-Thames {{had been an}} {{exciting}} dream. Here <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> hard, raw reality. So she knew that this would come to pass. Because nothing was ever fulfilled, she found, except in the hard limited reality. She {{did not want to}} be a teacher in Ilkeston, because she knew Ilkeston, and hated it. But she wanted to be free, so she must take her freedom where she could.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed his}} arm close to her, as she went. But {{she longed to}} see him, to look at him. She was nervous. He walked erect, with face rather lifted, but with a curious {{tentative}} movement of his powerful, muscular legs. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> clever, careful, strong contact of his feet with the earth, as she balanced against him. For a moment he was a tower of darkness to her, as if he rose out of the earth.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{consciousness}} in his eyes, {{when she came}} downstairs. She tried to bear herself as if nothing at all had happened, and she succeeded. She had the calm self-control, self-indifference, of one who has suffered and borne her suffering. She looked at him from her darkish, almost drugged blue eyes, she met the spark of consciousness in his eyes, and quenched it. And with her long, fine hand she put the sugar in his coffee.|$|E
60|$|Hetty did {{not answer}} at first, but, with that indescribable feeling that awakens sympathy and {{intelligence}} among the youthful and unpracticed of her sex, she hung her head, and the blood suffused her cheek ere she found her tongue. It would have exceeded her stock of intelligence to explain this embarrassment, but, though poor Hetty could not reason, on every emergency, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> always <b>feel.</b> <b>The</b> colour slowly receded from her cheeks, and the girl looked up archly at the Indian, smiling with the innocence of a child, mingled with the interest of a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, for in that case, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> passion. You {{perceive that}} he avoids oppressing {{her with his}} notice, and that the meeting passes off without embarrassment. I do believe there is an elevating principle in love, that, by causing us to wish to be worthy of the object most prized, produces the desired effects by stimulating exertion. There, now, are two as perfect beings as one ordinarily meets with, each oppressed {{by a sense of}} his or her unworthiness to be the choice of the other." ...|$|R
50|$|Walking down a corridor, Janeway {{suggests}} that Tuvok missed those days, a suggestion Tuvok rejects. However, {{he admits that}} he is pleased to {{have been a part of}} them, and having experienced the memories, Janeway says she feels she was a part of them as well. As a result, Tuvok {{suggests that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> nostalgic for <b>the</b> both of them.|$|R
60|$|As {{they came}} out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests, and a modest peal of three notes broke forth--that limited amount of {{expression}} having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the joys of such a small parish. Passing by the tower with her husband on the path to the gate <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> vibrant air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of sound, and it matched the highly-charged mental atmosphere in which she was living.|$|E
60|$|Seating herself {{where she}} could lean against the saddle she {{prepared}} to maintain a sleepless vigil throughout the night. For an hour the silence was {{broken only by the}} distant booming of the guns and the low noises of the feeding horse and then, from possibly a mile away, came the rumbling thunder of a lion's roar. The girl started and laid her hand upon the rifle at her side. A little shudder ran through her slight frame and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> goose flesh rise upon her body.|$|E
60|$|The lady {{surveyed}} the long low clear room so cleverly prepared for life, with its white wall, its Dutch clock, its Dutch dresser, its pretty seats about the open fireplace, its cleverly placed bureau, its sun-trap {{at the garden}} end; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> rich intention of living in its every arrangement {{and a sense of}} uncertainty in things struck home to her. She seemed to see a woman, a woman like herself--only very, very much cleverer--flitting about the room and making it. And then this woman had vanished--nowhither. Leaving this gentleman--sadly left--in the care of Mrs. Rabbit.|$|E
60|$|There she {{remained}} {{for what seemed}} to her a cruelly long time; she became so cold that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> ground beneath her feet; and her teeth shook in {{her head as she}} sat there alone in the cold night air of an October night, with no warmer wrapping than a slight shawl thrown over her shoulders. There she sat, listening for every sound--longing to catch the rattle of the wheels that were to carry her away--fancying every moment that she heard footsteps approaching, and dreading lest the awful creak of the house-door opening should reach her ears.|$|R
5000|$|Lindsay {{claimed to}} have written the novel based on an idea she had in a dream. In a 2017 article in The Age, it was noted: [...] "The dream had centred on a summer picnic {{at a place called}} Hanging Rock, which Joan knew well from her {{childhood}} holidays. Joan told Rae housekeeper that the dream had felt so real that when she awoke at 7.30am, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> hot summer breeze blowing through the gum trees and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> still hear the peals of laughter and conversation of the people she'd imagined, and their gaiety and lightness of spirit as they set out on their joyful picnic expedition." ...|$|R
60|$|After a long bout of hostility, Anna at last {{closed with}} him. She had now four children, all girls. For seven {{years she had}} been absorbed in wifehood and motherhood. For years he had gone on beside her, never really {{encroaching}} upon her. Then gradually another self seemed to assert its being within him. He was still silent and separate. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him all <b>the</b> while coming near upon her, as if his breast and his body were threatening her, {{and he was always}} coming closer. Gradually he became indifferent of responsibility. He would do what pleased him, and no more.|$|R
