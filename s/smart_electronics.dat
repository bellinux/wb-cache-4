One of the challenges is to devise ways to tailor its electronic properties and to control its charge carriers. Here we show that a single atom vacancy in graphene can stably host a local charge and that this charge can be gradually built up by applying voltage pulses with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The response of the conduction electrons in graphene to the local charge is monitored with scanning tunneling and Landau level spectroscopy, and compared to numerical simulations. As the charge is increased, its interaction with the conduction electrons undergoes a transition into a supercritical regime 6 - 11 where itinerant electrons are trapped in a sequence of quasi-bound states which resemble an artificial atom.

However, the most challenging part of this combination is prediction of the bending stress effects on bendable ICs. Because bending stress changes the transistor characteristics such as current-voltage or drain-current variation and threshold-voltage shift.

Many of these emerging applications require shape-conforming, light-weight and low-cost detectors rather than existing solid-state detection technology. Graphene, which possesses impressive electrical and mechanical properties, {{is a promising material}} for enabling flexible devices at THz frequencies. This thesis reports on the modelling, design, fabrication and characterisation of graphene THz detectors on plastic substrates. These detectors are based on field-effect transistors (FETs) fabricated using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) -grown graphene and integrated with split broadband bow-tie antennas. A fabrication process has been developed to achieve high-performance THz detectors on plastic substrates. Since the properties of the dielectric film on graphene are very sensitive to the growth conditions, parallel-plate capacitor test structures on graphene on flexible substrates are fabricated for characterising the electrical properties of the dielectric films. THz power detection in the frequency range from 330 GHz to 500 GHz at room temperature is demonstrated. The devices operate well above the cutoff frequency of the transistors. At room temperature, the voltage responsivity is above 2 V/W, and the noise-equivalent power (NEP) is below 3 nW/√Hz at 487 GHz. The effects of bending strain on the dc characteristics, voltage responsivity and NEP of these detectors have been investigated.
