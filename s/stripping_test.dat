40|$|Development of {{one-step}} <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> {{for detecting}} chemical compounds with small molecule weight {{is a very}} challenging task. Since the detection limit of <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> format is usually one or two orders of magnitude less than ELISA format, the success of assembling <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> is strictly limited {{by the quality of}} antibodies, e. g. sensitivity and specificity. Thus, the production of hapten-specific antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity is crucial and a prerequisite for successful assembling of <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b> This project aims at developing ELISA format and <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> that can quickly detect the presence of two antibiotics, i. e. Trimethoprim (TMP) and Enrofloxacin (ENR), in animal body fluid and products. In order to increase the immunogenicity of chemical compounds, different conjugation strategies were used to couple the antibiotics, TMP and ENR to carrier proteins, followed by a comprehensive screening by using different immunogens to immunize animals to produce highly sensitive and specific antibodies against free TMPs or ENRs. In this project, prototype one-step <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and indirect competitive ELISA format for detection of TMP was developed by using anti-TMP polyclonal antibodies. Under the most optimized condition, the detection limit for one-step <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and for indirect competitive ELISA format can reach up to 0. 25 μg/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively. In addition, anti-ENR polyclonal antibodies were also produced. Indirect and direct competitive ELISA formats for detection of ENR were developed by using anti-ENR polyclonal antibodies. The preliminary data showed the detection limit of both formats was less than 1 ng/ml. The successful production of one prototype <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and ELISA formats will provide the technical rout to further produce commercial products for the rapid detection of TMP and ENR residues in animal body fluid and food animal products...|$|R

Sera and urine samples from 455 subjects— 150 confirmed visceral leishmaniasis cases, 160 endemic controls, 100 non-endemic controls, and 45 other febrile diseases—were included in the study. The sensitivity of the KAtex, DAT, and rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> was 87 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 80 - 96], 93. 3 % (95 % CI 88 - 100), and 98 % (95 % CI 93 - 100) respectively. The specificity of these tests was 98 % (95 % CI 93 - 100), 93 % (95 % CI 87 - 100), and 89 % (95 % CI 82 - 97) for the KAtex, DAT, and rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> respectively. Fifty cases were followed up and subjected to the KAtex, DAT, and rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> after 30 days of successful treatment.

Correlations among the membrane properties, i. e. contact angle, gas permeation, mean pore size, nodule aggregates and surface roughness obtained from experimental analysis were discussed. The overall trend showed that increasing lithium chloride concentration has decreased the mean pore size, mean nodule aggregates and mean surface roughness of the membrane. On the contrary, the membrane liquid entry pressure has been significantly improved. It {{was found that the}} mean pore size determined by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) is 2. 3 to 2. 7 times larger than that of obtained from gas permeation test. The decreases in nodule size, mean pore size and low surface roughness have contributed to the enhancement of CO 2 stripping performance in membrane contactor system.

The leach liquor of LiB cathode material obtained with H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2 as the lixiviant was purified by precipitating the leached aluminum, iron and copper as hydroxides by adjusting the pH to ~ 5. To extract nickel, the effect of Versatic 10 acid concentration was the experimental variable in the mixture of extractants. The pH-isotherms revealed the synergistic effect on nickel caused by the increasing concentration of Versatic 10 acid which decreased the pH 50 for nickel extraction and pH 5 {{was chosen as the}} most suitable pH for solvent extraction.

In this research a new magnetron configuration source was tested at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN-LNL), in order to deposit a uniform niobium thin film onto copper superconducting Quarter Wave Resonator cavities. The methodology was divided in three. A first part, in which a test dummy cavity and a test cathode were used in order to deposit stainless steel onto copper quartz. The purpose {{of the use of}} steel has been finding the right parameters of sputtering and also to analyze the uniformity of the film. In this first phase it have been tested several magnetic confinements, which allowed the optimization of the deposition. In parallel it was performed the deposition of stainless steel onto copper strips, to realize the <b>stripping</b> <b>test</b> as a method to analyze the uniformity of the film. The second part was focused on the deposition of niobium thin film onto quartz samples placed along the resonator to improve the superconducting properties, specifically Residual Resistivity Ratio (RRR) and Critical Temperature (Tc); nevertheless other magnetic confinements were tested to maintain the uniformity of the coating. It was studied the influence on superconducting properties of two principal parameters of the sputtering process: the power and the substrate temperature. After setting the deposition parameters, a definitive magnetron confinement was used to deposit the real copper QWR. The RF performance was also measured after the design, construction and installation of a test cryostat. Finally, it was found the magnetic source to deposit a niobium thin film uniformly over QWR cavities. Increasing the substrate temperature and the sputtering power, the transition temperature of the niobium thin film was around 9, 3 K and it was obtained a maximum RRR of 61. Only 30 min were necessary to deposit the film with a uniformity of 2 ± 1 μm along the cavity. SEM results allowed to analyze the microstructure of the niobium film. Bigger grains were founds on the inner conductor closer to the magnetron source. In addition a test cryostat was successfully built in order to measure the RF performance; the system can be useful to perform measurements at 4. 2 and 1. 8 K. Respect to the RF performance the first Nb/Cu cavity is under the specifications of CERN with a maximum Q value of 2 e 8 and an accelerating field of 2 MV/m; however this first result is extremely important to start with the optimization phase. Some parameters will be changed in order to improve the performance and push the SRF community to use the magnetron sputtering technique as an economical method to deposit superconducting cavities in short times...|$|E

The subjects were segregated into four categories: 230 confirmed patients, 52 probable cases, 70 non-cases and 100 healthy endemic controls. The first two groups were used for estimating sensitivity, the latter two for specificity. Sensitivity of DAT-FD was 98. 9 %, rK- 39 : 98. 9 %, KAtex: 67. 0 % and rK- 26 : 21. 3 %. Sensitivity of DAT-FD on blood taken on filter paper (DAT-FDF) was 99. 3 %, which was comparable with that using serum.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case study}} on the SR- 70 section with microsurface for understanding its performance; a development of a methodology for evaluating the asphalt pavement subsurface condition for applying pavement preservation treatments; and a development of a tool for identifying and quantifying the subsurface distresses. From the case study, {{it was found that}} the main distresses on SR- 70 were longitudinal cracks, fatigue cracks, and potholes. The longitudinal cracking was the most widely distributed distress with 22 % of lane length in the 2 -mile test section among the three distress types. Based on the water <b>stripping</b> <b>test</b> results and the core visual observations, it was confirmed that the test section on SR- 70 had the water stripping problem. In order to have a representative condition indicator for the test section, the conditions were converted into the scores scaled from 0 to 100. Layers with closer to a score of 100 have the better subsurface condition. Therefore, the 28 % of the test section length with the surface distress was detected as the fair subsurface condition with a score of 56. The rest 72 % of the length was estimated as the good subsurface condition with a score of 78. Similarly, 20. 5 % of the test section length with the problem locations determined by GPR had the fair subsurface condition with a score of 56 and the rest 79. 5 % of the length had the good subsurface condition with a score of 76. The lab test results showed poor correlations among the water stripping severities, air voids, and tensile strengths. Thus, the air voids or tensile strength cannot properly estimate the water stripping severity or vice versa. When the laboratory test results with the surface distresses or in the GPR-based problem locations were compared to that without the surface distresses or in the GPR-based non-problem locations, in general, average air voids and water stripping severities decrease and average tensile strengths increase. The observation confirms that the evaluation processes are applicable for evaluating the subsurface condition. Furthermore, the probability that a location determined to be problematic by GPR to be on one of poor conditions based on lab tests was 1. 0. The same probability was obtained for a GPS-based problem location. Accordingly, it was concluded that the laboratory tests with the surface distresses survey or the GPR measurement were reliable method to evaluate the subsurface condition. The FWD results had a weak correlation with the laboratory test results possibly due to fairly long testing interval (i. e., 328 ft). The current FWD test protocol should be improved for evaluating the subsurface condition in pavement preservation application. Guidelines of subsurface condition evaluation for pavement preservation treatment application was developed utilizing the findings from the case study. A concept of hierarchy was used in the guideline by taking project importance and available resources into consideration. A tool including guidelines, computer software (e. g., iSub and iMoisture), and its manual was also developed based on the methodology as a research product. Based on the guideline, it was concluded that the subsurface condition of the case study section on SR- 70 was inadequate for the application of the pavement preservation treatments...|$|E

40|$|Rapid and {{quantitative}} sensing of aflatoxin B 1 with high {{sensitivity and specificity}} has drawn increased attention of studies investigating soybean sauce. A sensitive and rapid quantitative immunochromatographic sensing method was developed {{for the detection of}} aflatoxin B 1 based on time-resolved fluorescence. It combines the advantages of time-resolved fluorescent sensing and immunochromatography. The dynamic range of a competitive and portable immunoassay was 0. 3 – 10. 0 µg·kg− 1, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 1 µg·kg− 1 and recoveries of 87. 2 %– 114. 3 %, within 10 min. The results showed good correlation (R 2 > 0. 99) between time-resolved fluorescent immunochromatographic <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Soybean sauce samples analyzed using time-resolved fluorescent immunochromatographic <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> revealed that 64. 2 % of samples contained aflatoxin B 1 at levels ranging from 0. 31 to 12. 5 µg·kg− 1.

40|$|Because {{healthcare}} {{facilities in}} many dengue endemic countries lack laboratory support, early dengue diagnosis {{must rely on}} either clinical recognition or a bedside diagnostic test. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the 1997 and 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) dengue classification schemes and the NS 1 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> in acute sera from 154 virologically confirmed dengue patients and 200 patients with other febrile illnesses. Both WHO classification schemes had high sensitivity but lacked specificity. The NS 1 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> had high specificity, but its sensitivity was significantly lower in secondary compared with primary dengue infections. Differences in viral serotypes {{did not affect the}} performance of any of the three diagnostic approaches. Taken collectively, our findings indicate that the 1997 WHO dengue case definition can be used to exclude dengue, and the NS 1 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> can be used to confirm dengue infection, although the latter should be interpreted with caution in regions where secondary dengue infection is prevalent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The study reports an {{evaluation}} of the direct agglutination test (DAT) with use of promastigote/amastigote antigen, rk 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test,</b> and ELISA for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Out of 94 clinically suspected VL patients, 16 (17 %) were seropositive by all the techniques; in addition, 6 were positive in rk 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and ELISA. On retrospective analysis, out of 16 positive by all the techniques, 11 (69 %) had demonstrable Leishmania donovani (LD) bodies in their bone marrow samples, while in 5 bone marrow was not examined. Out of 6 that were positive by ELISA and rk 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test,</b> 2 had myelofibrosis and 4 had chronic myeloid leukemia. On the basis of bone marrow aspirate positivity, the sensitivity and specificity of DAT were 100 % while those of rk 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and ELISA were 100 % and 87 %, respectively. The study suggests that DAT appears to be the best technique for the serodiagnosis of VL. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne disease caused by an obligate intramacrophage protozoan parasite. Diagnosis of VL is complex because its clinical manifestations mimic other microbial diseases. 1, 2 Confirmatory diagnosis re-lies upon demonstration of the parasite in tissue samples ei-ther directly in or after culture.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work was to {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of using}} a rapid and simple reagent <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> to investigate the viability of hydatid cysts intraoperatively, via testing certain biochemical parameters. Thirty eight HCF samples were processed and examined by different methods for determining the viability status. Using the reagent <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> in the current study, the highest significant level of glucose was detected in HCF samples with the highest viability % at pH 7. 5 and the lowest significant level of glucose was detected in HCF samples with the lowest viability % at pH 8. 5, indicating a likely correlation between glucose concentration and the viability of PSs. On the contrary, protein was not detected in HCF containing viable PSs and was found to be higher in HCF containing non-viable PSs, denoting the possible degenerative processes in such PSs. Haemoglobin was found in trace amounts in all of our samples. In addition, the <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> detected bacterial contamination in 8 samples and biliary leakage in 7 samples. Our results suggest that the simple reagent <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> can assist in providing fast, uncomplicated primary data regarding the viability status of the hydatid cysts. Thus, it may aid the surgeons to make informed decisions for further management and appropriate follow up to minimise the risk of post-operative recurrence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) {{is one of}} the world's {{most highly}} {{contagious}} animal diseases with tremendous economic consequences. A rapid and specific test for FMD diagnosis at the site of a suspected outbreak is crucial for the implementation of control measures. This project developed a multiplex lateral flow immunochromatographic <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> (multiplex-LFI) for the rapid detection and serotyping of FMD viruses. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against serotypes O, A, and Asia 1 were used as capture mAbs. The mAbs were conjugated with fluorescein, rhodamine or biotin for serotype O, A and Asia 1, respectively. The detection mAbs which consisted of a serotype-independent mAb in combination with one serotype A-specific mAb and one Asia 1 -specific mAb, were each colloidal gold-conjugated. The strips used in this study contained one control line and three test lines, which corresponded to one of the three serotypes, O, A or Asia 1. The newly developed multiplex-LFI <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> specifically identified serotype O (n= 46), A (n= 45) and Asia 1 (n= 17) in all tested field isolates. The sensitivity of this <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> was comparable to the double antibody sandwich ELISA for serotypes O and A, but lower than the ELISA for serotype Asia 1. The multiplex-LFI <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> identified all tissue suspensions from animals that were experimentally inoculated with serotypes O, A or Asia 1. FMD viruses were detected in 38 % and 50 % of the swab samples from the lesion areas of experimentally inoculated sheep for serotypes O and A, respectively. The capability of the multiplex-LFI <b>strip</b> <b>tests</b> to produce rapid results with high specificity for FMD viruses of multiple serotypes makes this test a valuable tool to detect FMD viruses at outbreak sites...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of months, seasons, age and sex on visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) in human, data were collected during March 2010 through February 2011 from the register book of Upazila Health Complex (UHC) of Trishal, which is an endemic region for VL in the Mymensingh district. Besides, 70 blood samples were collected from suspected VL human patients to compare microscopy with rK 39 immunochromatographic <b>strip</b> <b>test.</b> Additionally, 50 cattle blood samples were also collected from houses with active or recently-treated VL patients to determine the possible animal reservoir of VL through rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test.</b> Of the suspected VL patients in the UHC registered book, 43. 8 % were seropositive. The percentages of seropositive cases were higher in September (73. 3 %), November (67. 2 %) and August (65. 5 %) than in May (18. 5 %), June (27. 5 %) and March (36. 7 %). The rainy season (58. 4 %) and the winter season (50. 6 %) showed higher seropositive than the summer (30. 7 %) season which was significant (p ≤ 0. 001). Hospital cases of VL were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher in 3 - 14 years (49. 3 %) and 15 - 45 years (43. 5 %) than in children 45 years (33. 6 %) people. The estimated sensitivity of rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> and microscopic examination were 100 % and 58. 8 %, respectively and the specificity were 72 % and 100 %, respectively. Only two cattle blood samples were found positive to rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test.</b> Our present study indicates that rK 39 <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> is superior to the diagnosis of VL compared with parasitological confirmation by direct microscopy of the peripheral blood. Further works are needed to focus on molecular approaches for diagnosis and epidemiological study of VL, sand flies investigation and to confirm the cattle as animal reservoir for VL transmission...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate nitrite and leucocyte esterase <b>strip</b> <b>test</b> procedures in general practice patients, and to relate the results to the decision of the general practitioner to prescribe antibiotic therapy. A total of 292 female patients from eight general practices in the Maastricht area, who were aged 12 years or over with complaints suggesting UTI, were included in the study. All eight practices tested fresh urine samples using the nitrite <b>strip</b> <b>test,</b> and seven also used the leucocyte esterase <b>strip</b> <b>test.</b> The positive predictive value of the nitrite test was greater than the leucocyte test. Antibiotic therapy was nearly always prescribed when either or both of these tests were positive. Bacterial culture was positive in 159 (59 %) cases, although treatment was started in 70 (27 %) cases where there was an absence of significant bacteruria. It was found that the choice of agent used to treat the patient was related to the antibiotic susceptibility of the uropathogens that were isolated...|$|R
