50|$|A {{wireless}} <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> is {{a popular}} solution when it is difficult or impossible to run a mains supply to the <b>sensor</b> <b>node.</b> However, since the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> is often placed in a hard-to-reach location, changing the battery regularly can be costly and inconvenient. An important aspect {{in the development of}} a wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> is ensuring that there is always adequate energy available to power the system.The <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> consumes power for sensing, communicating and data processing. More energy is required for data communication than any other process. The energy cost of transmitting 1 Kb a distance of 100 m is approximately the same as that used for the execution of 3 million instructions by a 100 million instructions per second/W processor. Power is stored either in batteries or capacitors. Batteries, both rechargeable and non-rechargeable, are the main source of power supply for sensor nodes. They are also classified according to electrochemical material used for the electrodes such as NiCd (nickel-cadmium), NiZn (nickel-zinc), NiMH (nickel-metal hydride), and lithium-ion.Current sensors are able to renew their energy from solar sources, temperature differences, or vibration. Two power saving policies used are Dynamic Power Management (DPM) and Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS). DPM conserves power by shutting down parts of the <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> which are not currently used or active. A DVS scheme varies the power levels within the <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> depending on the non-deterministic workload. By varying the voltage along with the frequency, it is possible to obtain quadratic reduction in power consumption.|$|E

30|$|Liu et al. [14] {{proposed}} a group-based keys predistribution scheme that divides the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> into groups and scatters them. After deployment, the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> may suffer from wind force or terrain condition, making {{it likely that}} in-group <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> likely become neighbors. Finally, they modeled the deployment distribution as a Gaussian distribution. Building pairwise keys between in-group <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> and cross-group <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> offers several advantages. Hence, they built the pairwise key between <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> in the same group using the in-group key predistribution method and used the cross-group key predistribution method to build the pairwise key between adjacent <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> in the different groups.|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we shall}} {{investigate}} the security {{aspects of the}} proposed scheme. As discussed in Section 1, <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> are deployed in unattended environment often in area controlled by an adversary. So, an active adversary can compromise one or more <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> of the deployment zone. If the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> are not tamper proof, the adversary can extract sensitive information from the set of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> compromised by the adversary and can use those informations to overhear the conversation between active <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Localizing {{a static}} <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> {{is not a}} {{difficult}} task because attaching a GPS device suffices the need of localization. But a mobile <b>sensor</b> <b>node,</b> which continuously change its geographical location with time is difficult to localize. Mostly mobile sensor nodes within some particular domain for data collection can be used, i.e, <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> attached to an animal within a grazing field or attached to a soldier on a battlefield. Within these scenarios a GPS device for each <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> cannot be afforded. Some {{of the reasons for}} this include cost, size and battery drainage of constrained sensor nodes.To overcome this problem a limited number of reference nodes (with GPS) within a field is employed. These nodes continuously broadcast their locations and other nodes in proximity receive these locations and calculate their position using some mathematical technique like trilateration. For localization, at least three known reference locations are necessary to localize. Several localization algorithms based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method have been proposed in literatures. Sometimes a node at some places receives only two known locations and hence it becomes impossible to localize. To overcome this problem, dead reckoning technique is used. With this technique a <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> uses its previous calculated location for localization at later time intervals. For example, at time instant 1 if node A calculates its position as loca_1 with the help of three known reference locations; then at time instant 2 it uses loca_1 along with two other reference locations received from other two reference nodes. This not only localizes a node in less time but also localizes in positions where it is difficult to get three reference locations.|$|E

After 100 [*]ms, the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> turn on radio transceiver and the power consumption increases. Then after another 100 [*]ms, the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> turn on all LEDs and the power consumption increases more. Finally the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> enter the first idle state after 100 [*]ms. Therefore the supply current will also change periodically.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{wireless}} sensor nodes {{have existed}} {{for decades and}} used for applications as diverse as earthquake measurements to warfare, the modern development of small sensor nodes {{dates back to the}} 1998 Smartdust project and the NASA Sensor Webs Project One of the objectives of the Smartdust project was to create autonomous sensing and communication within a cubic millimeter of space. Though this project ended early on, it led to many more research projects. They include major research centres in Berkeley NEST [...] and CENS.

Physical sensor nodes have been able to increase their capability in conjunction with Moore's Law. The chip footprint contains more complex and lower powered microcontrollers. Thus, for the same node footprint, more silicon capability can be packed into it. Nowadays, motes focus on providing the longest wireless range (dozens of km), the lowest energy consumption (a few uA) and the easiest development process for the user.|$|E

30|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{comprise}} {{of a large}} number of low cost tiny sensors distributed in a specific region for facilitating the activity of data process through sensing capability (Chen et al. 2013 a). The multi-hop, decentralized and self-organizing nature of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> make it suitable for gathering the essential environmental data such that it could be effectively employed in various range of applications such as agriculture, industry and military (Guo et al. 2013). The co-operation between the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> is essential as they are devoid of a fixed infrastructure and a centralized entity of control (Arun Korath and Vineeth 2011). The <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> need to deliver its co-operation for the other interacting <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> by ignoring its benefits for improving the lifetime of the network (Qiu et al. 2010). The limited computational capability, energy and storage potential of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> induces selfish activity of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes.</b> In practical situations, it is even more complex when the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> deployed for different objectives react with selfish intent (Duan et al. 2014 a). This selfish action of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> paralyses the normal activity delivered by the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> for ensuring effective packet forwarding process. The potential challenge of sensor network lies in the formulation of efficient forecasting technique that motivates the selfish <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> to enforce normal operation in the network (Zhang et al. 2010).|$|R

50|$|The {{controller}} performs tasks, processes {{data and}} controls the functionality of other {{components in the}} <b>sensor</b> <b>node.</b> While the most common controller is a microcontroller, other alternatives {{that can be used}} as a controller are: a general purpose desktop microprocessor, digital signal processors, FPGAs and ASICs. A microcontroller is often used in many embedded systems such as sensor nodes because of its low cost, flexibility to connect to other devices, ease of programming, and low power consumption. A general purpose microprocessor generally has a higher power consumption than a microcontroller, therefore it is often not considered a suitable choice for a <b>sensor</b> <b>node.</b> Digital Signal Processors may be chosen for broadband wireless communication applications, but in Wireless Sensor Networks the wireless communication is often modest: i.e., simpler, easier to process modulation and the signal processing tasks of actual sensing of data is less complicated. Therefore, the advantages of DSPs are not usually of much importance to wireless sensor nodes. FPGAs can be reprogrammed and reconfigured according to requirements, but this takes more time and energy than desired.|$|E
50|$|Most {{theoretical}} work on WSNs {{assumes the}} use of passive, omnidirectional sensors. Each <b>sensor</b> <b>node</b> has a certain area of coverage for which it can reliably and accurately report the particular quantity that it is observing.

40|$|Provision {{of energy}} to {{wireless}} sensor networks is crucial for their sustainable operation. <b>Sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> are typically equipped with batteries as their operating energy sources. However, when the <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> are sited in almost inaccessible locations, replacing their batteries incurs high maintenance cost. Under such conditions, wireless charging of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> by a mobile charger with an antenna can be an efficient solution. When charging distributed <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes,</b> a directional antenna, rather than an omnidirectional antenna, is more energy-efficient because of smaller proportion of off-target radiation. In addition, for densely distributed <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes,</b> it can be more effective for some undercharged <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> to harvest energy from neighboring overcharged <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> than from the remote mobile charger, because this reduces the pathloss of charging signal due to smaller distances. In this paper, we propose a hybrid charging scheme that combines charging by a mobile charger with a directional antenna, and energy trading, e. g., transferring and harvesting, between neighboring <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes.</b> The proposed scheme is compared with other charging scheme. Simulations demonstrate that the hybrid charging scheme with a directional antenna achieves {{a significant reduction in}} the total charging time required for all <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> to reach a target energy level...|$|R
30|$|Then, we {{use this}} new key predistribution scheme in a grid-group {{deployment}} of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes.</b> A grid-group deployment refers {{to such a}} deployment where the entire deployment zone is broken into smaller two-dimensional square regions giving rise to an n[*]×[*]n[*]grid-group structure. Equal number of <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> are deployed {{in each of the}} smaller square regions of the deployment zone. <b>Sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> deployed inside one smaller square region forms a group. <b>Sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> within the same group communicate more frequently than a pair of nodes falling in two different groups. This is driven by the fact that <b>sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> in proximity to each other communicate more frequently than distant <b>nodes.</b> <b>Sensor</b> <b>nodes</b> deployed in this fashion grid form a heterogeneous network. This type of deployment scheme is applied in battlefields where sensors belonging to a compromised zone need to be completely disconnected {{from the rest of the}} network.

50|$|Threshold based {{detection}} is {{a simple}} way events may be detected {{through the use of}} various parameters that can hint as to whether an event has occurred or not. Data collected at a <b>sensor</b> <b>node,</b> also called the data-event, is analyzed to see if it has reached a certain threshold point to be considered an event. For example, a light detector may only report back to a gateway if it detects light above a certain intensity. The data-event can be also be the result of a combination of outputs from different types of sensors that either collaborate at the gateway or through small hop peer-to-peer communication. Two important parameters that affect the effectiveness of the detection is sampling rate and event area. The sampling rate will depend on whether events occur {{over long periods of time}} like tides in the ocean or over short periods of time such as cars passing a building. The event area will determine how many sensors need to report values above a threshold value for the likelihood of an event to be high enough to be considered.|$|E
