500|$|Banks {{elaborated}} {{that she}} wanted a judge on the program that had gone through issues in her modeling career that she herself had not: [...] "I sit {{all the time and}} talk to girls and say, 'Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't go out. Don't do this. I never did it.' But there's only <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> can preach to someone if you've never done it. I thought I could have someone like Janice because she's so outrageous." [...] Banks stated that she thought Dickinson provided a warning to models not to follow the path she had taken because it had proved dangerous:" [...] When she's telling a girl, 'Don't do this,' she's saying, 'Don't do this because it didn't work for me.' I {{thought it was a good}} balance." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Writing for The A.V. Club, Rowan Kaiser {{gave the}} episode a positive review, {{stating that the}} characters knowing facts that the audience doesn't worked. [...] "'Donut Run' actually does this well, {{in large part because}} the heist that we're seeing—Duncan and Veronica stealing the coma baby—requires that Duncan and Veronica stage a breakup, meaning that Veronica seems to be a free, bitter agent for the bulk of the episode." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com heavily praised what he called a [...] "great episode" [...] and [...] "a fitting send-off for Duncan". He elaborated that [...] "as much as he and Veronica were a good match, there's only <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> can do dramatically with a happy relationship, you know? I'm kind of glad she's back to being a free agent again." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{background}} Boyd {{read all}} the Bond stories in chronological order; and had researched Fleming and the literary Bond's background. Boyd was a child when his father introduced him to Fleming's works. As a result, Boyd found himself also becoming fascinated with Ian Fleming. He told reporters that {{he was interested in}} Bond as a human being. [...] "Bond is not just a superhero. He has flaws, he has weaknesses, he makes mistakes.... That was Fleming's genius." [...] The novel is set in 1969 when Bond is 45; Boyd intentionally picked the year, further adding that [...] "there are no gimmicks, it's a real spy story." [...] Boyd criticised how the filmmakers have portrayed Bond onscreen as a [...] "cartoon character"; he also believes that Bond should be [...] "troubled and a massive boozer." [...] The novel reflects Boyd's view, where Bond [...] "drinks enough to float a boat. He drinks <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> wonder that he ever has the time or inclination to do anything else".|$|E
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{shooting}} budget of $700,000, Saw began principal photography on [...] at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. The bathroom {{was the only}} set {{that had to be}} built. Danny Glover completed his scenes in two days. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> can do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E

500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks <b>so</b> <b>much!</b> <b>You</b> sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". The recording of Body Language took place during the summer of 2003, in London, England; Dublin, Ireland and Marbella, Spain.|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{stated that}} it was [...] "a song about realizing {{that you are the}} source of all of the {{problems}} in a relationship and you love the other person <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>you</b> want to free them of the problem, which is actually yourself. It was a riff that turned into another riff that turned into another riff and ended up being a nice little power punk song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> kind of learn to believe in yourself, stand up for yourself, because you can bet that nobody else is going to do it." ...|$|E
