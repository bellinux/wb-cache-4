5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead <b>she</b> <b>stayed</b> in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.|$|E

Singh, who styled herself the Queen of the Punjab, did not initially live in Faraday House; <b>she</b> <b>stayed</b> at the Manor House in Old Buckenham, near her brother Prince Frederick. After a period of ill health, her father died in a rundown Paris hotel on 22October 1895 at age 55.|$|E

Because of her background, Reyes considered that these believers may have simply formed a cult, but did not rule out the possibility of alien intervention. <b>She</b> <b>stayed</b> with the case until after Mulder was returned by his abductors, but returned to her field office soon after.|$|E
5|$|In January 1556, Mary's {{father-in-law}} abdicated. Mary and Philip {{were still}} apart; he was declared King of Spain in Brussels, but <b>she</b> <b>stayed</b> in England. Philip negotiated an unsteady truce with the French in February 1556. The following month, the French ambassador in England, Antoine de Noailles, was implicated in a plot against Mary when Sir Henry Dudley, a second {{cousin of the}} executed Duke of Northumberland, attempted to assemble an invasion force in France. The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up. Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain.|$|E
