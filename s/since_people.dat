5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that <b>since</b> <b>people</b> naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This {{is due to}} the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. <b>Since</b> <b>people</b> were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters <b>since</b> <b>people</b> may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{to that in}} Arab countries, {{bread is}} served with most meals and is {{generally}} torn into shreds and used by those eating to envelope foods, {{so that they can}} be picked up and conveyed to the mouth, in a manner similar to a sandwich, and also to soak up liquids on the plate. <b>Since</b> <b>people</b> in Afghanistan normally use their hands to eat, the bread thus acts as both a fork and a spoon.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil {{says the}} law of {{accelerating}} returns suggests that once a civilization develops primitive mechanical technologies, {{it is only a}} few centuries before they achieve everything outlined in the book, at which point it will start expanding outward, saturating the universe with intelligence. <b>Since</b> <b>people</b> have found no evidence of other civilizations, Kurzweil believes humans are likely alone in the universe.

In other cases, if an essential resource becomes scarce, its owners can drive up the price, and thus increase their profit rate, because demand remains strong.|$|E

25|$|Reporting of {{casualty}} numbers {{during the}} invasion varied widely and fluctuated day to day.

On April 11, Ben Wedeman of CNN reported that Palestinians were reporting 500 dead, while international relief agencies were saying possibly as many as 200; he noted that his efforts to independently verify the claims had so far come to naught <b>since</b> <b>people</b> were being prevented from entering the camp by Israeli soldiers.|$|E

25|$|A draft risk {{assessment}} released by Health Canada in July 2016 {{has found that}} overexposure to boric acid {{has the potential to}} cause developmental and reproductive health effects. <b>Since</b> <b>people</b> are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women. The concern is not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that registrations for certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).|$|E
25|$|Labour law in {{its modern}} form is {{primarily}} a creation {{of the last three}} decades of the 20th century. However, as a system of regulating the employment relationship, labour law has existed <b>since</b> <b>people</b> worked. In feudal England, the first significant labour laws followed the Black Death. Given the shortage of workers and consequent price rises the Ordinance of Labourers 1349 and the Statute of Labourers 1351 attempted to suppress sources of wage inflation by banning workers organisation, creating offences for any able-bodied person that did not work, and fixing wages at pre-plague levels. Ultimately this led to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which was in turn suppressed and followed up with the Statute of Cambridge 1388, which banned workers from moving around the country. Yet conditions were improving as serfdom was breaking down. One sign {{was the beginning of the}} more enlightened Truck Acts, dating from 1464, that required that workers be paid in cash and not kind. In 1772 slavery was declared to be illegal in R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett, and the subsequent Slave Trade Act 1807 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 enforced prohibition throughout the British Empire. The turn into the 19th century coincided with the start of the massive boom in production. Gradually people's relationship to their employers moved from one of status - formal subordination and deference - to contract whereby people were formally free to choose their work. However, freedom of contract did not, as the economist Adam Smith observed, change a worker's factual dependency on employers.|$|E
