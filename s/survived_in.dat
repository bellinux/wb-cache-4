5|$|In Apra Harbor, ten ships or tugs were sunk, as were {{numerous}} smaller vessels. One {{of the ships}} that <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> the harbor was the cutter Basswood of the Coast Guard, which recorded a wind gust of 220km/h (140mph). Pamela's damage prevented regular flights {{in and out of}} the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the realm}} of {{structural}} engineering and technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine plants have <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain ringlet, also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century saw the {{construction}} of most of Leeds' railway infrastructure, including architecturally notable viaducts in Holbeck and Leeds city centre. None of the major railway stations from this era have <b>survived,</b> <b>in</b> fact most of Leeds railway station was rebuilt as recently as 2002.|$|E

50|$|Most of Clement's {{works that}} survive remain unpublished. The only {{exception}} {{is part of}} Unum, which was partly published as a doctoral thesis in 1984. Most of Clement's works <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> one or two copies. Two works, De sex and Unum, have multiple copies. De sex <b>survives</b> <b>in</b> 12 manuscripts and Unum <b>survives</b> <b>in</b> at least 42 manuscripts, although in varied forms.|$|R
5|$|The Tramp Dentists {{is presumed}} lost, but {{the date of}} {{disappearance}} is unknown. If the film were to have <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> Universal's vaults {{it would have been}} deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is {{long-lived}} for a mammal of its size. Individuals reportedly <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> captivity {{for up to}} 23 years, and a maximum age of up to 15 years seems possible in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{came from}} Zakynthos, a Greek island, and has <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> a fragmentary condition. It {{was brought to}} England in 1821 and transferred to Cambridge University in 1985. It is often cited in critical editions of the Greek New Testament.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{animation}} film {{produced in}} Spain and titled Gisaku relates {{the adventures of}} a young Japanese samurai named Yohei who visited Spain in the 17th century, in a story loosely taking its inspiration from the travels of Hasekura. Yohei <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> hiding {{to the present day}} due to magical powers ("After centuries of lethargy, he awakes in a World he does not know"), and accomplishes many adventures in modern Europe as a superhero.|$|E
5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, had <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E
5|$|After {{the appeals}} had been exhausted, Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby {{commuted}} Fielden's and Schwab's sentences {{to life in}} prison on November 10, 1887. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled blasting cap which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast blew off half his face and he <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> agony for six hours).|$|E

50|$|Adult foliar {{nematodes}} {{are able}} to overwinter by <b>surviving</b> <b>in</b> dried plant tissue in a dormant state. The nematodes can <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> this dead leaf material for several months. Foliar nematodes do not survive for very long in bare soil alone.|$|R
50|$|The Digha Nikaya {{corresponds}} to the Dīrgha Āgama found in the Sutra Pitikas of various Sanskritic early Buddhists schools, fragments of which <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> Sanskrit. A complete version of the Dīrgha Āgama of the Dharmagupta school <b>survives</b> <b>in</b> Chinese translation by the name Cháng Ahánjīng 長阿含經. It contains 30 sūtras {{in contrast to the}} 34 suttas of the Theravadin Dīgha Nikāya. In addition, portions of the Sarvāstivādin school's Dīrgha Āgama <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> Sanskrit and in Tibetan translation.|$|R
5|$|Alex North's unused {{music had}} its first public {{appearance}} in Telarc's {{issue of the}} main theme on Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, a compilation album by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. All the music North originally wrote was recorded commercially by North's friend and colleague Jerry Goldsmith with the National Philharmonic Orchestra and was released on Varèse Sarabande CDs shortly after Telarc's first theme release but before North's death. Eventually, a mono mix-down of North's original recordings, which had <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> the interim, would be released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.|$|E
5|$|Basque, not an Indo-European language, <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> {{the region}} of the Pyrenees. The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were {{regarded}} by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{earliest}} (excavated) windmill is in Great Linford. The large oak beams {{forming the}} base supports still <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> the mill mound and were shown by radio carbon dating to {{originate in the}} first half of the 13th century. (The present stone tower mill at Bradwell was built in 1815, on a site convenient to the new Grand Junction Canal).|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 2nd century, the Roman army {{underwent}} considerable further expansion, with the addition of 5 new legions (27,500 men) to a Principate peak of 33. A matching number of auxilia (i.e. c. 50 regiments, although only the names of around 25-30 have <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> the epigraphic record) were probably added, possibly reaching a peak of c. 440 regiments and around 250,000 effectives by the end of Septimius Severus's rule (211AD).|$|E
5|$|Houses found {{today in}} Zeeland are closer in {{appearance}} {{to the fine}} Dutch brick houses of New York than are houses {{from other parts of}} the Netherlands. Brick farm houses built separately from barns are found in Zeeland, but none have <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> other locations. Unlike the common practice in New York, the farm houses in Zeeland do not have separate outside doors for each room. The Dutch also used bricks to pave the roads, or chaussees, in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|If Hahn's {{account is}} disregarded, the Mascarene parrot {{probably}} became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion {{is from the}} 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still <b>survived</b> <b>in</b> Europe, since specimens {{are known to have}} lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist François Levaillant stated that the bird was rare and that he had seen three specimens in France.|$|E
