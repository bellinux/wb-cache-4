5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass <b>surgery,</b> <b>in</b> which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt <b>surgery,</b> <b>in</b> which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare prognosis of patients with gastric or colorectal cancer according to places where they received surgeries. Methods The cancer patients underwent <b>surgeries</b> <b>in</b> sampled hospitals located in Daegu were matched 1 : 1 to the patients who visited sampled hospitals in Seoul using propensity score method. After the occurrences of death were examined, Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and the log-rank test was performed to compare the survival curves. Results A total of six out of 291 gastric cancer patients who had <b>surgeries</b> <b>in</b> Daegu died (2. 1 %) and ten deaths (3. 4 %) occurred from patients went Seoul hospitals. Out of 84 gastric cancer patients who had chemotherapy after <b>surgeries</b> <b>in</b> Daegu, 13 (15. 5 %) patients died while 18 (21. 4 %) deaths occurred among patients underwent <b>surgeries</b> <b>in</b> Seoul. Six deaths (6. 9 %) out of 87 colorectal cancer patients who had <b>surgeries</b> <b>in</b> Daegu were reported. Five patients (5. 7 %) died among the patients underwent <b>surgeries</b> <b>in</b> Seoul. Among the colorectal cancer patients with chemotherapy after surgeries, 13 patients (12. 4 %) who visited hospitals in Daegu and 14 (13. 3 %) patients who used medical centers in Seoul died. There were no significant differences according to places where patients used medical services. Conclusions The result of this study is expected to be used as basic data for policy making to resolve centralization problem of cancer patients and to help patients to make rational choices in selection of medical centers...|$|R
