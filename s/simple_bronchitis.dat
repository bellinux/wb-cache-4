40|$|Asthma is a {{frequent}} chronic inflammatory disease which is often mistaken for <b>simple</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> The diagnosis {{is based on the}} association of symptoms and excessive airway calibre variability. When symptoms are present more than once a week, it is recommended to give low dose inhaled corticoids as a maintenance treatment together with, as needed, rapid acting beta 2 agonist. In addition it is crucial to provide the patient with an education on the disease to reinforce adherence to the treatment. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Since {{cigarette}} smoking {{is an important}} cause of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis both conditions should occur together more often in cigarette smokers than would result from chance. If they do commonly occur together then severe airways obstruction, which {{is often associated with}} chronic bronchitis, should also be often associated with lung cancer. To discover whether this were so three groups of patients were studied at the London Chest Hospital. Two hundred men and 43 women who presented with lung cancer provided information on the prevalence of defined chronic bronchitis and airways obstruction in those suffering from lung cancer. The third group consisted of 233 men presenting with defined chronic bronchitis who were kept under observation to discover how many would die from lung cancer. The results suggested that <b>simple</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and lung cancer often occur together but that obstructive bronchitis and lung cancer do not often occur together. The lack of association between lung cancer and severe airways obstruction requires an explanation...|$|E

40|$|We have {{calculated}} the effective time (t eff) of the forced expiratory spirogram in healthy non-smokers, {{in patients with}} <b>simple</b> chronic <b>bronchitis,</b> and in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Effective time was obtained by dividing the area underneath the forced expiratory spirogram by the forced vital capacity (FVC) and {{is equal to the}} time constant of lung emptying if the FVC-time curve is a single exponential. In 75 healthy non-smoking adults, t eff showed a linear increase with age but no difference between the sexes. In 37 patients with low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) /FVC ratios, t eff, as expected, was increased. In 19 subjects with <b>simple</b> chronic <b>bronchitis</b> and normal FEV 1 /FVC ratios, t eff was longer than or at the upper limit of 2 SE above the mean for healthy subjects of the same age. A comparison of t eff with FEV 1 /FVC suggested that in most normal subjects and patients the forced expiratory spirogram was a multiple exponential and that t eff was a more sensitive index for the evaluation of airway obstruction than the FEV 1 /FVC ratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{complete}} examination {{was made}} of 180 workers, all working during the investigation and all without acute respiratory disease. These workers were exposed to diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI). The following tests were performed: (1) Completion of a CECA questionnaire to reveal symptoms of chronic bronchitis. (2) Physical examination of the chest. (3) Spirographic tests (Expirograph Godart), determination of VC, FEV 1, before and after 5 min aerosol with a bronchodilatator (orchiprenaline). The aerosol consisted of a 10 lt. /min of flow at a 1 / 100 concentration of orchiprenaline. For the spirographic predicted values reference was made to the CECA values. The present paper reports {{the results of the}} analysis of the chronic bronchitis questionnaire, according to age, length of exposure, smoking habits and job. The data were grouped into different syndromes, from which 'simple bronchitis' and 'sputum breathlessness' were selected for further analysis.

40|$|The {{first steps}} of a {{community}} involvement health project using the principles of community diagnosis and popular participation were carried out in a small Nicaraguan mining village {{during the second half}} of the 1980 s. Using existing archives and obtaining new information aided by local organizations, priorities could be established for health and safety surveillance within the mining company, as well as for further investigations concerning what seemed to be dominant health problems in the community: serious accidents among the economically active population and diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections among children, as well as infections, and other health indicators of malnutrition. Workers also presented chronic <b>simple</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> ventilatory obstructive disturbance and hearing loss that were strongly associated with working conditions. These results helped to direct health priorities and educational activities at the local level with both the general and working population.

40|$|The {{relation}} of respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and abnormalities of chest radiographs to estimated exposures of borax dust {{has been investigated}} in a cross sectional study of 629 actively employed borax workers. Ninety three per cent of the eligible workers {{participated in the study}} and exposures ranged from 1. 1 mg/m 3 to 14. 6 mg/m 3. Symptoms of acute respiratory irritation such as dryness of the mouth, nose, or throat, dry cough, nose bleeds, sore throat, productive cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were related to exposures of 4. 0 mg/m 3 or more, and were infrequent at exposures of 1. 1 mg/m 3. Symptoms of persistent respiratory irritation meeting the definition of chronic <b>simple</b> <b>bronchitis</b> were related to exposure among non-smokers. Decrements in the FEV 1 as a percentage of predicted were seen among smokers who had heavy cumulative borax exposures (greater than or equal to 80 mg/m 3 years) but were not seen among less exposed smokers or among non-smokers. Radiographic abnormalities were uncommon and were not related to dust exposure. Borax dust appears to act as a simple respiratory irritant and perhaps causes small changes in the FEV 1 among smokers who are heavily exposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{hockey stick}} {{regression}} method is a convenient method to estimate safe doses, {{which is a}} kind of regression method using segmented lines. The method seems intuitively to be useful, but needs the assumption of the existence of the positive threshold value. The validity of the assumption is considered to be difficult to be shown. The alternative methods which are not based on the assumption, are given under suitable dose-response curves by introducing a risk level. Here the method using the probit model is compared with the hockey stick regression method. Computational results suggest that the alternative method is preferable. Furthermore similar problems in the case that response is measured as a continuous value are also extended. Data exemplified are concerned with relations of SO 2 to <b>simple</b> chronic <b>bronchitis,</b> relations of photochemical oxidants to eye discomfort and residual antibiotics in the lever of the chicks. These data was analyzed by the original authors under the assumption of the existence of the positive threshold values...|$|R
40|$|The partial {{effective}} {{times of}} the expiratory spirogram were calculated in 80 normal non-smoking subjects aged from 20 to 69 years and in 30 patients aged from 30 to 58 years with chronic bronchitis. Of these patients, 28 had a normal FEV 1 /FVC ratio, while the other two had a low ratio. Partial effective times were calculated for 10 % segments of the expired FVC from total lung capacity (0 % FVC) to residual volume (100 % FVC) and became progressively longer after 50 % of the FVC had been expired in normal subjects. The elongation to the partial effective times was more pronounced with age. In the patients with <b>simple</b> chronic <b>bronchitis</b> (normal FEV 1 /FVC ratio) the partial effective times were longer than normal after 50 % of the FVC had been expired and after 10 % of the FVC had been expired in the two patients with chronic bronchitis and low FEV 1 /FVC ratio. The partial effective {{times of the}} forced expiratory spirogram, especially that at the 80 [...] 90 % part of the FVC, {{seem to be very}} sensitive indices for the early detection of mild airways obstruction...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Cough {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} in the practice of doctors of various specialties, including pediatricians. Cough treatment should be started with the identification of its cause and correct diagnosis. Most often, cough in children is due to the increased viscosity of bronchial secretions, i. e. violation of sputum transport in the bronchial tree, and insufficient activity of ciliated epithelium. The main objective of the treatment of productive cough is dilution of sputum, bronchial secretion and excretion, thus necessitating the administration of mucolytics. Currently, one of the most famous mucolytics is acetylcysteine, cysteine amino acid product, such as ACC®. However, today the question of ACC® (acetylcysteine) application in infants and young children is still debatable. This article presents a study whose objective was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of ACC® (20  mg/ml solution) in the treatment of bronchopulmonary diseases in children aged 2 to 6 years. Materials and methods. The study involved 60 children with acute tracheitis, <b>simple</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> acute obstructive bronchitis, recurrent bronchitis in the acute phase, community-acquired pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, cystic fibrosis. Patients of the main groups (n = 40) received ACC® (20 mg/ml solution) at the age-specific dosage 3 times a day in combined treatment. Therapy of patients in the control group (n = 20) was conducted without ACC®. Results. During follow-up, patients who received ACC® had significant positive changes in the nature of cough, sputum viscosity and its amount as opposed to a comparison group of patients. Complete disappearance of cough was achieved on day 5 – 8 from the beginning of treatment, while in the control group patients, this time was longer. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the study drug showed that very good efficacy was achieved in 75 % of patients and good — in 20 %, and among patients who received other mucolytic agents — in 50 and 30 %, respectively. Discussion. The findings suggest that the use of ACC® (acetylcysteine) in the combination treatment of children with bronchopulmonary pathology enables to make dry cough wet and productive. Unlike other expectorants, ACC® (acetylcysteine) has a more pronounced and rapid mucolytic effect with good tolerability. Conclusions. Mucolytic agent ACC® can be recommended as a drug of choice in the treatment of acute tracheitis and bronchitis, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis from the first days of the disease in children aged 2 years and more both in the hospital and in an outpatient setting. Acetylcysteine should be administered with caution to the patients with bronchial asthma...|$|E

40|$|The period {{prevalence}} of <b>simple</b> chronic <b>bronchitis</b> (SCB) (mucus hypersecretion), defined as chronic cough and sputum production by the MRC respiratory symptom questionnaire administered by occupational physicians and of obstructive chronic bronchitis (OCB) (airflow obstruction) (defined as SCB plus FEV 1 less than 80 % predicted) have been measured {{over the period}} 30 June 1977 - 30 June 1980 in the entire work force aged between 21 and 60 of the coal industry of New South Wales, Australia (12 357 men). Four dimensional contingency table analysis by a logistic transform method showed highly significant (p less than 0. 001) additive affects of age (exposure duration), site of work, smoking, and alcohol consumption on development of overall chronic bronchitis (SCB + OCB). Odds ratios were face work:surface work = 1. 78 : 1, smoker:non-smoker = 4. 23 : 1, alcohol greater than 300 g/wk:alcohol less than 300 g/wk = 2. 13 : 1. There was no evidence for synergistic effects of these factors {{on the development of}} mucus hypersecretion. When OCB was analysed separately, the effect of site of work, although in the same direction, was not statistically significant and this was assumed to be due to a "healthy worker" effect or a "swamping" effect of smoking. Age, smoking, and alcohol effects were highly significant (p less than 0. 0001) and there was a sharp increase in prevalence of OCB in the age groups 41 - 50 and 51 - 60. Odds ratios were face work:surface work = 1. 11 : 1, smoker:non-smoker = 2. 66 : 1, alcohol greater than 300 g/wk:alcohol less than 300 g/wk = 2. 91 : 1. There was no evidence of synergistic effects. These results are consistent with a hypothesis of additive effects of smoking, alcohol, and coal mine dust and fumes on the development of chronic mucus hypersecretion leading to airflow obstruction or a hypothesis of similar additive effects on the development of two separate conditions [...] mucus hypersecretion with airflow obstruction and mucus hypersecretion without airflow obstruction...|$|R
