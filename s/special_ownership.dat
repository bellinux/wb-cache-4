The high first day returns of China’s IPOs are most likely generated from on-market overpricing. Government intervention, market speculation, <b>special</b> <b>ownership</b> structure, strategy of proceeds maximization and risk concerns are the main drivers of the high first day returns. However, the high first day returns have decreased significantly in recent years.

40|$|The Strategic Plan of Cordoba (SPC) {{is one of}} the few {{strategic}} {{urban development}} plans in Latin America, which has actually been implemented in the majority of its components. The SPC was conceived as a collective and global project of the city as a whole without excessive conflicting interests or <b>special</b> <b>ownership</b> by a few. The SPC integrated a policy of public works – oriented at the “social debt” which existed in the city – with a work on urban norms and directions and economic development. The SPC as a space for articulation achieved to organise a great number of representatives from civil society organisations, achieving legitimacy and representation in the work of the SPC. The SPC has given a new orientation and increased the municipal capacity to manage the city. The SPC has developed innovative and participatory forms of management (e. g. the Follow-Up and Monitoring Groups, with their annual meetings for presenting audit reports known as “presenting the bills”). The population has perceived the incentive to participate in the planning process of the SPC since it was possible to propose concrete projects, as long as these were feasible. The SPC has pursued the detailed feasibility study of a number of these projects others have been delegated to sectoral agencies. The SPC has shown flexibility in the incorporation of new projects, and there existed two directions of work initiatives: “top-down” project planning for the big “strategic” projects of global importance, and it stimulated “bottom-up” planning of projects that reflected the social demand side. It needs to be noted that the SPC has known how to mobilise and diversify sources of finance of its projects and been able to obtain additional funding. Financing agencies like the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have appreciated the SPC as a reference of a consensus-based Programme. The formulation of the SPC has been executed, basically, with own resources of the municipality. Nevertheless, in certain moments it has been difficult for the Municipal Technical Team (MTT) to establish commitment and willingness to cooperate between civil society and the municipal government. For example, the MTT was seen as an “elite team” by other municipal units. The Municipal Council conceived the participation of citizens as a kind of competition. The members of the Municipal Council did not participate regularly in the workshops and meetings of the SPC...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between board of directors (BoD) and corporate performance in China. In particular, it attempts to identify the effects of four attributes of BoD board composition, characteristics of directors, board structure and board process on the financial performance of Chinese listed companies. A large number of empirical studies have examined the correlation between BoD and corporate performance. Few previous studies have examined the effects of BoD on both direct shareholder wealth and company financial performance. Moreover, little attention has been paid to this topic in a Chinese context. Owing to <b>special</b> <b>ownership</b> structure of listed companies, agency problems have recently received more and more attention in China from the academics and policy makers. As noted by Qian (1995) and Firth et al. (2003), agency problems in China are potentially more serious than in the West. Therefore, this study mainly employs agency theory to examine the effects of the BoD on corporate performance. It is utilised, together with other theories, such as resource dependence theory, to develop testable hypotheses and discuss the results. This study finds that there is relatively limited evidence that board independence has significantly positive impacts on corporate performance. In particular, it finds that there is non-linear relationship between board independence and firm performance. There is no negative relation between the proportion of affiliated directors on board and firm current or future performance. In addition, there is no significantly negative correlation between board size and firm current performance. In particular, there is no non-linear relationship between board size and corporate performance. There is no confirmative evidence that stock ownership and cash compensation of independent directors have any positive effects on corporate financial performance. However, there is strong evidence that firm performance depends crucially on the interaction between the magnitude of cash compensation of independent directors and the size of them on board. Also there is no evidence that the incentives of independent directors have any curvilinear effects on current performance. There is no evidence of significantly positive or negative correlation between age and primary occupation of independent directors and firm performance. However, I find that the presence of overseas independent directors has significantly positive impacts on corporate performance. Interestingly, there is a significantly negative correlation between the proportion of female independent directors and corporate performance. There is no clear evidence that CEO duality has any negative impact on current financial performance, which rejects the hypothesis H 5. Furthermore, there is a significantly negative relationship between multi-directorship and firm performance. In addition, there is limited evidence that auditing committee has a significantly positive impact on corporate performance. There is no significantly positive correlation between the frequency of board meeting and firm financial performance. However, there is strong evidence that firm performance depends crucially on the interaction between the frequency of board meetings and the size of independent directors appointed. In particular, there is confirmative evidence that frequency of board meeting has curvilinear effect on firm performance. There is no clear evidence that the proportion of directors appointed by government agents control shareholders has a negative impact on corporate performance. However, there is a significantly negative correlation between the proportion of directors appointed by SOE control shareholders and company performance. Furthermore, the relationship between the proportion of directors appointed by SOE control shareholders and company performance is non-linear. The dissertation makes several important contributions to the corporate governance literature. In addition, this study also has implications for policy makers insofar as it offers empirical evidence concerning effectiveness of Chinese BoD in improving financial performance of listed companies. The findings of this study can help the authorities to reform the corporate governance system...|$|E

Levels of adoption of microcomputers varied widely across districts. with half the sample reporting no <b>special</b> education <b>ownership</b> of microcqmputers while others had acquired a number of machines.

40|$|The {{logic of}} {{consolidation}} became a controversial mantra {{of the real}} estate industry dur-ing the late 1990 s. Five years later, the empirical research on economies of scale cannot resolve the debate. In an industry as fragmented as real estate, market dominance and pric-ing power is exceedingly hard to establish. That more consolidation did not take place dur-ing the REIT bear market of the late 1990 s appears to weaken the essential thread of the consolidation logic, yet there is no definitive benchmark on which to evaluate {{what should have been a}} threshold level of public-to-public merger activity. The longer-term stumbling blocks to consolidation in the public real estate sector are less insurmountable structural barriers to further consolidation than intervening complications in a halting process. For the real estate industry, the analogy with other capital-intensive industries is not exact. A historic dependence on debt capital, a duality of local property markets and national cap-ital markets, <b>special</b> tax-advantaged <b>ownership</b> vehicles, and a large private market with arbitrage opportunities all make the path toward consolidation distinctive in its pattern and timing.

40|$|Farm Ownership Savings Accounts are {{a popular}} method of saving for farm {{purchase}} and entry into sharefarming. As at 31 March 1981 there were nearly 7, 000 account holders and deposits totalled approximately $ 29 million. The investment returns {{that can be}} obtained from Farm Ownership Accounts are dependent on the savings period. For <b>Special</b> Farm <b>Ownership</b> Accounts the return on capital invested can be in excess of 40 per cent per annum where the savings period is three years, declining to less than 15 per cent per annum where the savings period is ten years. For Ordinary Farm Ownership Accounts the return on capital is approximately 20 per cent per annum where the savings period is three years dropping to approximately ten percent where the savings period is ten years. Owing to the effects of inflation, increases in the cash deposits required for farm purchase are likely to outstrip people's ability to save the necessary deposit through the Farm Ownership Account Scheme. Accordingly, these accounts should be considered as either a means of saving for entry into sharefarming or as a secondary means of saving for farm purchase. Aspiring farmers who have limited assets should consider saving initially in a Home Ownership Account rather than a Farm Ownership Account. Current incentives for first home ownership make this an attractive method of saving towards eventual farm ownership. It can be argued that Farm Ownership Accounts as they are set up at present are biased in favour of those people who, on account of their access to inherited or family wealth, only need to save for a short period and at the expense of those people who must save from wages and salary over a longer period. It would seem doubtful that this was ever an intention of those who designed the scheme and hence consideration should be given to changing this feature...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{economies and}} societies, the {{availability}} of information is central to better decision making by citizens and consumers. In most countries, citizens and consumers receive {{the information they need}} through the media, including newspapers, television radio, internet and etc. After 1990 s, technological and economic developments have evolved the media sector by converging it to telecommunications and IT sectors and by leading to new interactive broadcasting services transmitted by different technologies. These developments also increased mergers and joint ventures both at global level and national level. As well as these developments, the private benefits of media have increased concentration of ownership in these sectors. There are many people who argue that concentration in media markets has a negative effect on diversity and plurality. Because of increasing concentration in media markets in recent years all over the world, many concerns as to whether competition law and policy is sufficient to ensure the diversity and pluralism in media have arisen. Competition rules can address issues of concentration, efficiency and choice and will tend to encourage dispersed ownership and new entry. However, they cannot guarantee any of it. Competition law cannot therefore provide the certainty we need that a significant number of different media voices will continue to be heard, or that prospective new entrants to the market will be able to add their voice. Moreover, it cannot directly address concerns over editorial freedom or community voice. Therefore, if competition law and policy is assessed as a whole in the context of media, it can be stated that it guarantees diversity to some extent. However, because of the objectives and criteria of competition law {{is an important part of}} regulation, it is not designed to deliver diversity and plurality in the media. <b>Special</b> media <b>ownership</b> rules exist across the world because the market alone, even regulated by competition law, is not thought to provide the best results for society and for democracy. ...|$|R
40|$|Memory {{management}} system performance is of increasing impor-tance in today’s managed languages. Two lingering sources of over-head are the direct costs of memory allocations and write barriers. This paper introduces allocation folding, an optimization technique where the virtual machine automatically folds multiple memory al-location operations in optimized code {{together into a}} single, larger allocation group. An allocation group comprises multiple objects and requires just a single bounds check in a bump-pointer style allo-cation, rather than a check for each individual object. More impor-tantly, all objects allocated in a single allocation group are guaran-teed to be contiguous after allocation and thus exist in the same gen-eration, which {{makes it possible to}} statically remove write barriers for reference stores involving objects in the same allocation group. Unlike object inlining, object fusing, and object colocation, alloca-tion folding requires no <b>special</b> connectivity or <b>ownership</b> relation between the objects in an allocation group. We present our analysis algorithm to determine when it is safe to fold allocations together and discuss our implementation in V 8, an open-source, production JavaScript virtual machine. We present performance results for the Octane and Kraken benchmark suites and show that allocation fold-ing is a strong performance improvement, even in the presence of some heap fragmentation.

Some of presented examples demonstrate problems with legal interpretation of rules, some of them indicate lack of legal provisions regarding taxes.

In my work I tried to offer an excerpt of problems which apply to all taxes regulating flats and real property. Each type of tax has its special particularities and questions that must be solved in ordinary life. All used examples come from real practice in this field. So anyone can meet such problems in his life. From my point of view, the most disorganized rule in the Czech Republic is the Income Tax Act in these days.

Concentrating on the ownership and transfer of flats is in the environment of the Czech Republic well justified considering the large number of blocks of flats and the general drift of their development. The taxation related to property affects a multitude of people and this was the reason I chose this subject matter. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part defines the basic terms, such as real estate property, land, building and flat. This introductory part also contains a description of the main principles of ownership and the means of acquiring the proprietary right. The main emphasis is placed on the acquirement of proprietary right to the real estate property which has its specialties.

5000|$|The 1992 {{constitution}} of independent Turkmenistan recognized private land ownership. Yet the Land Code, {{which is the}} permanent law that interprets the constitution on land matters, stipulates that privately owned land in Turkmenistan is non-transferable: {{it may not be}} sold, given as a gift, or exchanged. The notion of private landownership in Turkmenistan is thus different from the accepted notion in market economies, where ownership implies full transferability of property rights. In practical terms, all land in Turkmenistan is controlled by the state, and it is basically the state that allocates land use rights to both leaseholders and dayhan farmers. The allocation of land use rights typically involves assignment of annual production targets in cotton and wheat. Leaseholders receive land in use rights from the state through the intermediation of the local peasant association (the lease term is usually 5-10 years). The lease is nontransferable: if a family cannot farm, the leasehold reverts to the association for reassignment. Dayhan farmers receive land directly from the state. Initially, the land is granted in use rights, but once the farmer has established a record of successful farming (within two-three years), the land is transferred into [...] "private ownership" [...] and the farmer receives a <b>special</b> [...] "land <b>ownership</b> certificate" [...] from the authorities. On the other hand, if the farmer fails to achieve satisfactory results, the land may be taken away by the state, even if it has the status of private ownership.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} corporate governance, legal origin and firm performance {{with a focus}} mainly on Asia. The dissertation consists of four individual papers and an introductory chapter. All papers can be read individually but share a common theme in corporate governance and investments. The main region of interest is Asia due to its <b>special</b> characteristics of <b>ownership</b> structures and governance. However, comparative studies of Asia and Europe as well as global outlooks {{are included in the}} dissertation too. The papers contribute to research by studying effects on investment performance, firm performance, capital allocation and capital structure from legal traditions, institutional indicators and ownership type. The first paper focuses on family ownership which is found to affect firm performance negatively when using measures of firm valuation and returns, but investment performance positively when measured by marginal q. This suggest that family owned firms may be better at avoiding bad investments {{but at the same time}} have lower market valuation and returns to capital compared to firms with other owners. The second paper investigates investment performance and firm size in terms of number of employees in 58 countries around the world. It is found that initial increase of staff size tend to positively affect investment performance overall, but excessive employment has a negative impact on investment performance. The third paper studies the capital allocation in India after their economic reforms in the 1990 s. It is found that allocation of capital has been slow to respond to reforms and firms face significant costs in adjusting their capital stock, leading to inefficient capital allocation. The fourth paper deals with firm capital structure in 24 Asian and European countries. Both financial market indicators of maturity and firm specific characteristics influence the leverage of firms. Financial market maturity measures have a negative effect on debt levels as do family ownership of firms...|$|R
40|$|Community {{gardens are}} widely {{promoted}} for their community building and educational capacities {{and they are}} equally criticised for their capability to perpetuate neoliberal logics of self-reliance and responsible citizenship. This thesis takes a relational approach to community gardens, focusing on community gardens in a relatively affluent and gentrifying urban area. It does so through examining community gardeners’ practices in three community gardens in the inner west of Sydney, Australia, {{and the ways in}} which through these practices gardens are connected to the wider urban environments in which these spaces are situated. Rather than prioritise institutional relationships or practices which generate social capital, as community garden scholarship tends to do, this thesis focuses on community gardeners’ practices, examining how community gardens relate not only to Council policies and interventions, but also to domestic garden spaces, infrastructure, non-human organisms and so forth. Community garden practices and relations were studied through participant observation at working bees and community garden meetings, and through twenty-four indepth interviews with community gardeners and neighbours. Fifteen interviews included a walk from the participant’s home garden to the community garden. This broader approach opens up ways of knowing the practices through which gardeners come to understand themselves as individuals in a group. A key finding is that garden communities come into being through their members’ practice which in turn respond and shift according to the nonhuman agency of technology and plants, and the values and objectives of individual gardeners. In these responsive practices, gardeners constantly balance personal experiences and values such as feelings of ownership and accomplishment, and community objectives such as reciprocity and inclusiveness. This finding is supported by three empirical threads. First, the thesis focuses on gardeners’ propertied relationships to land in the form of plots and fences. This thread troubles understandings of community gardens as commons and explores the various overlapping kinds of work private and communal property do in these community spaces. Second, the thesis analyses gardeners’ practices in relation to the food that is produced and harvested in the garden. This thread demonstrates how gardening practices and attachments to plants take shape in relation to personal objectives and that a sense of community is partly generated through gardeners’ relationships to plants. And finally, the thesis pays attention to gardeners’ individual and collective water management choices and practices. The focus on water practices and infrastructures emphasises the importance of external dependencies, such as domestic spaces, and values and expectation around fairness and economic rationale, in shaping community garden practices. Each of these empirical focus points sheds light on how gardeners are engaged in a complex set of relationships which allow them to invest in the community project for the sake of their personal goals while also creating a community space. In developing this relational approach to community gardens with a <b>special</b> focus on <b>ownership,</b> the thesis offers the insight that community gardens understood as spaces that build community, and community gardens as spaces that encourage self-reliance, are not mutually exclusive. Rather, it shows that depending on context, the concepts of ownership and community can be practised in socially inclusive and exclusive ways. The thesis encourages an opening up of questions around how community might function in a central, dense and relatively affluent urban area such as Sydney’s Inner West. It also offers insights into community formation that are useful for policy makers who wish to encourage community belonging either through community gardening or through other social activities such as markets, festivals, political participation or volunteering, that encourage people to generate a sense of community in relation to their material and social contexts...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Strategic {{property}} management aims at balancing {{the question of}} how the needed space is to be secured, maintained, increased or disposed of in a cost effective manner under a mixture of decisions and actions. In recent years, the interest in building maintenance has increased as {{more and more of the}} housing stock built after the Second World War is in need of major renovation.   For example, approximately 1 million dwellings were constructed in Sweden in the period 1960 - 1970. Currently there is growing concern about the expected huge cost of maintaining this aging housing stock especially in the portfolio under municipal ownership. Private housing companies have been shown to report lower maintenance costs than those in the public sector but which are the factors that can explain the apparent differences? During the last decade there has also been a growing trend of governments diversifying themselves of their properties and/or outsourcing the {{property management}}. A question of interest is whether it is advantageous to do so and if the maintenance management differs substantially between the government sector and the industrial sector which is seen as business oriented and with a production centred maintenance strategy. In a number of industries there has been a paradigm shift in maintenance whereby the focus is no longer only on availability but reliability and cost effectiveness. New maintenance strategies and policies such as reliability centred maintenance have seen the light of day though without winning ground within property management. Shouldn’t building maintenance be handled in the same way? This licentiate thesis focuses on the strategic management of housing properties under public and private ownership as well as the management of special purpose properties in the government and industrial sectors in relation to the ongoing discussion about neglected maintenance. The purpose is to contribute to the process of cost efficient and effective maintenance both in the housing sector and in the management of special purpose properties through underscoring the factors that lead to differences in the maintenance levels in the different categories. Method The questions above are analysed through a theoretical part that discusses the concept of maintenance and strategies in building maintenance in relation to other industries. The thesis also contains an empirical part that is based on a survey in the form of a questionnaire on housing maintenance and an econometric analysis of the maintenance costs contained in the financial reports of the municipal and private housing companies as well as a questionnaire on among others how state and county governments as well as industrial companies have secured the availability and management of their special purpose properties. The thesis consists of four papers the first two of which are co-authored with Hans Lind. It starts by demarcating the concept of maintenance in the context of standard investment theory followed in paper 2 by a discussion of the term “maintenance strategy” and some stylized facts concerning building maintenance in Sweden. Maintenance strategies and approaches used in some other industries are presented as a background to an analysis of why building maintenance is different. The various factors that affect the maintenance costs reported within the housing sector are surveyed and analysed in paper 3 before the results from a survey on management of special purpose properties in the state and county governments as well industry sector are presented in paper 4. A questionnaire was used to get a broader material about aspects that were difficult to observe directly, including views about underlying factors. Results From the perspective of investment theory everything that is usually classified as maintenance is also an investment. The concept of maintenance can in a number of situations be taken to be unnecessary. A review of strategies from other industries reveals a focus on systematic data collection and cost analysis before action is taken and a move away from time scheduled maintenance to acting on the condition of the object. However building maintenance contains a substantial degree of corrective maintenance with a high degree of opportunistic maintenance and detailed maintenance planning is not ideal due to constantly changing needs and demands. An important result is from the surveys and econometric analysis which indicate that the ownership category has a significant effect of approx. 35 per cent on the maintenance costs reported by the housing companies. Furthermore a major factor affecting the cost level in the housing companies is the influence of external factors such as pressure from the media and politicians. The degree of <b>special</b> property <b>ownership</b> in the surveyed companies is high and the probability of the leasing market increasing in the coming five years is very low. According to the respondents there is very little neglected maintenance in the industry in contrast to the government sector especially in the counties. Furthermore, the maintenance plans in the public sector were shorter than those in the private sector. Discussion The outstanding result from the surveys is that classification of activities as maintenance or investments in both housing and special purpose properties differs in that the public sector companies lean more towards maintenance than investment in their accounting and have a higher degree of adherence to laid maintenance plans. The distinct difference in the pay-back duration used by the government sector as compared to that in the industry sector in effect lowers the effectiveness of the government sector as the lower required rate of return allows the government sector to have more activities that appear to be profitable.   Maybe the problem to worry about should not be that of neglected maintenance in this sector but that of unprofitable maintenance that should not be carried out. This might also just explain why more activities are classified and dealt with as investments by the industry and not by the county or state companies or the municipal housing companies. Conclusion There are strong arguments for saying that building maintenance rationally differs from the kind of maintenance and maintenance planning that could be observed in some of the other industries and the concept of maintenance is much more suitable in a world where there are smaller changes and where it is believed to be possible to know long in advance what is rational to do. The divergence in classification of activities even within the same category and company revealed by the two surveys is problematic as it complicates comparison of activities and services provided as well as benchmarking and it should be given appropriate attention by the managers. This goes to show the great need to use the same well defined concepts in order to benchmark and develop more efficient maintenance management strategies. Future research Though each building is unique the goal should be to develop a model that is rational given the specific uncertainties that characterise a building and the institutional system in which decisions are made. The limited size of the sample and the lack of transparency and uniformity in the financial reports constrain the research efforts in this study. However research is needed towards a clearer and more transparent classification of maintenance activities with the purpose of not only reducing the gap between the reported maintenance costs of the companies but also increasing the comparability in the branch. This will help to isolate and possibly limit the external influence in the management of the companies especially in the municipal housing sector...|$|R
