My investigation has compiled geotechnical subsurface data, high-resolution LiDAR imagery, and ground-penetrating radar to produce strip log sections transecting identified lineaments and depth-to-bedrock maps exposing fault structure. My work incorporates field investigation, multiple publicly available datasets, and subsurface modeling. My results include a map showing twenty-eight identified surface lineaments, five strip-log sections, and interpolated depth-to-bedrock and minimum-depth-to-bedrock maps. Several lineaments identified in the minimum-depth-to-bedrock raster are parallel to the Seattle Fault zone and suggest the presence of small splay faults beneath east Bellevue. These results strengthen previous interpretations of seismic profile data located in the study area.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to develop an improved correlation between Texas Cone Penetrometer (TCP) blow count and undrained shear strength for soft, clay soils in the upper approximately 30 feet of the ground. <b>Subsurface</b> <b>explorations</b> were carried out by Tolunay-Wong Engineers, Inc.

Laboratory testing was subsequently performed at The University of Texas at Austin on the thin-walled tube samples obtained in the field.

A search of Willamette River cutbanks was {{conducted for the}} presence of late Holocene paleoli-quefaction records in the Willamette forearc valley, located 175 ± 25 km landward from the buried trench in the central Cascadia subduction zone. Eight cutbank sites are reported that show evidence of large-scale fluidization features (≥ 10 cm width) including clastic sand dikes and intruded sand sills in Holocene overbank mud deposits. The targeted alluvial sequences, and hosted paleoliquefaction records, are of late Holocene age, as based on radiocarbon dating, flood silt thickness (≤ 4 m thickness), and minimal consolidation of dike sand (~ 1. 5 ± 0. 5 kg·cm- 2 unconfined compressive strength). Two of the paleoliquefaction sites, which are separated by 150 km distance, overlap in age (175 - 500 yr BP) with the last great megathrust rupture (Mw 8. 5 - 9. 0) in the Cascadia margin, dated at AD 1700. The scarcity of exposed late Holocene paleoliquefaction sites in the Willamette River cutbanks motivated subsurface searches for thick basal sand deposits and overlying fluidization features, using floodplain geomorphological analyses, ground penetrating radar, and remote pole-camera scans of deep trench walls (3 - 4 m depth). The onset of large-scale fluidization features occurred in overbank mud deposits (2 - 3 m thickness) above unconsolidated sand bodies (≥ 2 m thickness) with unconfined compressive strengths of ~ 1. 5 ± 0. 5 kg·cm- 2.

Borehole construction is the most common direct exploration technique which provides exact information on a particular location whereas, Electrical Resistivity Method {{is one of the}} commonly practiced indirect exploration techniques. Since the exploration costs are relatively high, minimizing the cost while obtaining adequate information is of everyone’s interest. For larger constructions with deep foundation requirements, determining the overburden thickness (bedrock level) and water table is a mandatory requirement.
