Some of the natural features on the land are gardens, a large meadow, forests, ponds, and a creek. Some of its projects include numerous natural building material structures, <b>solar</b> <b>ovens,</b> <b>solar</b> showers, beekeeping, a hot tub, and a sauna.

These activities have created bonds between different members of the school community, awakened {{a sense of belonging}} and pride in the school, and built an environment where ideas and information are shared freely. The environment team has also offered trainings for school community members in order to secure buy-in for the projects. For example, training on waste sorting and cooking oil collection was offered to employees. Also, a gardening workshop was organized for student volunteers, so they could assist maintenance staff in caring for the expanding school gardens.|$|R
