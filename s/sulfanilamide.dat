The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.

However, {{in response to the}} Elixir <b>Sulfanilamide</b> disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} publication (1) {{it was shown}} that various <b>sulfanilamides</b> are very effective in suppressing parasitemia in lophurae malaria of ducks; that optimal therapy depends upon the maintenance of more or less constant blood concen-trations of these drugs; and, finally, that p-aminobenzoic acid has an antagonistic effect on sufanilamides in P. lophurae as has been reported by Seeler and his associates (2) and by Maier and Riley (3) for P. gallinaceum. The complete inactivity, reported by other investigators, of <b>sulfanilamides</b> against relictum and cathemerium malaria in the canary was considered by us as possibly due not only to species differences in parasite susceptibility {{but also to the}} use of single daily doses of these drugs instead of the maintenance of continuous blood concentrations. In the present communication data are presented to show 1) that the maximum reduction of parasitemia that can be obtained on the sixth day with the sulfa-nilamides is a reduction from 70 per cent to 1 to 2 per cent cells parasitized and elevation of drug dosage beyond this point yields no further drop in para. sitemia, 2 2) that the <b>sulfanilamides</b> act much more slowly than quinine in lophurae malaria in ducks, 3) that the <b>sulfanilamides</b> in general clinical use are much more active in lophurae than in cathemerium malaria in the duck, and 4) that certain halogen substituted sulfanilanilides appear to differ from other <b>sulfanilamides</b> in their mode of action. METHODS. These were in the main similar to those described in our previous communi-cation (1). For the lophurae infection, the dose of infected blood was 100 X 10 parasitized cells per bird, giving a peak of parasitemia on the sixth day, except that in certain experi-ments the dose was decreased to give a peak on the tenth day.

25|$|Many {{thousands}} of molecules containing the <b>sulfanilamide</b> structure {{have been created}} since its discovery (by one account, over 5,400 permutations by 1945), yielding improved formulations with greater effectiveness and less toxicity.

25|$|The <b>sulfanilamide</b> {{compound}} is {{more active}} in the protonated form. The drug has very low solubility and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10. This is a very painful experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water.

25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as <b>sulfanilamide,</b> sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{investigators}} {{have found that}} <b>sulfanilamides</b> do not produce complete inhibition of bacteria immediately but that {{a more or less}} extensive time lag occurs (1). Although Libby (2) found appreciable growth during the first hours of treatment his sensitive technique of photronreflectometric turbidity readings showed that population increase of several species of ba#{ 234 }teria was retarded fairly early. He suggested that progressive reduction of the growth rate occurs before complete inhibition of development is attained. It seems possible that the length of time required for effective inhibition by <b>sulfanilamides</b> or other slowly acting compounds varies inversely with the growth and multiplication rate of the organism. This has obvious implications for the length of treatment necessary in chemotherapeutic trials with more complex and slowly multiplying organisms such as the protozoa.

2500|$|Prontosil, as Bayer {{named the}} new drug, {{was the first}} {{medicine}} ever discovered that could effectively treat a range of bacterial infections inside the body. It had a strong protective action against infections caused by streptococci, including blood infections, childbed fever, and erysipelas, and a lesser effect on infections caused by other cocci. However, it had no effect {{at all in the}} test tube, exerting its antibacterial action only in live animals. Later, it was discovered by Bovet, Federico Nitti and J. and Th. Jacques Tréfouël, a French research team led by Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute, that the drug was metabolized into two pieces inside the body, releasing from the inactive dye portion a smaller, colorless, active compound called <b>sulfanilamide.</b> The discovery helped establish the concept of [...] "bioactivation" [...] and dashed the German corporation's dreams of enormous profit; the active molecule <b>sulfanilamide</b> (or sulfa) had first been synthesized in 1906 and was widely used in the dye-making industry; its patent had since expired and the drug was available to anyone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Bayer sought medical {{applications}} of its dyes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The most {{prevalent}} drug hypersensitivity reactions are T-cell mediated. The only established in vitro test for detecting T-cell sensitization to drugs is the lymphocyte transformation test, {{which is of}} limited practicability. To find an alternative in vitro method to detect drug-sensitized T cells, we screened the in vitro secretion of 17 cytokines/chemokines by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) of patients with well-documented drug allergies, in order to identify the most promising cytokines/chemokines for detection of T-cell sensitization to drugs. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell of 10 patients, five allergic to beta-lactams and five to <b>sulfanilamides,</b> and of five healthy controls were incubated for 3 days with the drug antigen. Cytokine concentrations were measured in the supernatants using commercially available 17 -plex bead-based immunoassay kits. RESULTS: Among the 17 cytokines/chemokines analysed, interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), IL- 5, IL- 13 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion in response to the drugs were significantly increased in patients when compared with healthy controls. No difference in cytokine secretion patterns between sulfonamide- and beta-lactam-reactive PBMC could be observed. The secretion of other cytokines/chemokines showed a high variability among patients. CONCLUSION: The measurement of IL- 2, IL- 5, IL- 13 or IFN-gamma or a combination thereof might be a useful in vitro tool for detection of T-cell sensitization to drugs. Secretion of these cytokines seems independent of the type of drug antigen and the phenotype of the drug reaction. A study including a higher number of patients and controls will be needed to determine the exact sensitivity and specificity of this test...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of drug hypersensitivity, our group has {{recently}} proposed a new model based on the structural features of drugs (pharmacological interaction with immune receptors; p-i concept) to explain their recognition by T cells. According to this concept, even chemically inert drugs can stimulate T cells because certain drugs interact in a direct way with T-cell receptors (TCR) and possibly major histocompatibility complex molecules {{without the need for}} metabolism and covalent binding to a carrier. In this study, we investigated whether mouse T-cell hybridomas transfected with drug-specific human TCR can be used as an alternative to drug-specific T-cell clones (TCC). Indeed, they behaved like TCC and, in accordance with the p-i concept, the TCR recognize their specific drugs in a direct, processing-independent, and dose-dependent way. The presence of antigen-presenting cells was a prerequisite for interleukin- 2 production by the TCR-transfected cells. The analysis of cross-reactivity confirmed the fine specificity of the TCR and also showed that TCR transfectants might provide a tool to evaluate the potential of new drugs to cause hypersensitivity due to cross-reactivity. Recombining the alpha- and beta-chains of sulfanilamide- and quinolone-specific TCR abrogated drug reactivity, suggesting that both original alpha- and beta-chains were involved in drug binding. The TCR-transfected hybridoma system showed that the recognition of two important classes of drugs (<b>sulfanilamides</b> and quinolones) by TCR occurred according to the p-i concept and provides an interesting tool to study drug-TCR interactions and their biological consequences and to evaluate the cross-reactivity potential of new drugs of the same class...|$|R
