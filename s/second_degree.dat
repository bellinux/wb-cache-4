5|$|MSU's newest {{residential}} {{college is}} the Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though {{all the students}} will graduate with the same degree, MSU encourages students in the college to get a <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> or specialization. The university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College.|$|E

He was replaced by San Jose Sharks defenceman Scott Hannan in the lineup. Canada went on to win the championship over Finland in the final.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the famous}} names {{associated}} with Bristol in this early period is Paul Dirac, who graduated in 1921 {{with a degree}} in engineering, before obtaining a <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> in mathematics in 1923 from Cambridge. For his subsequent pioneering work on quantum mechanics, he was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize for Physics. Later in the 1920s, the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory was opened by Ernest Rutherford. It has since housed several Nobel Prize winners: Cecil Frank Powell (1950); Hans Albrecht Bethe (1967); and Sir Nevill Francis Mott (1977). The Laboratory stands on the same site today, close to the Bristol Grammar School and the city museum.|$|E
5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons {{with three or}} more Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the <b>second</b> <b>degree)</b> would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and <b>second</b> <b>degree.</b> For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E

5|$|While {{the plane}} {{suffered}} relatively little damage, the suspect incurred first and <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> burns to his hands, {{as well as}} second-degree burns to his right inner thigh and genitalia. Two other passengers were also injured. When the plane landed, Abdulmutallab was handed over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, and taken into custody for questioning and treatment of his injuries in a secured room of the burn unit of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. Schuringa was also taken to the hospital. One other passenger incurred minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|There are {{sections}} of the Temple known as Orders, each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular skill, for instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. Orders {{can be understood as}} schools of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. Orders are led by grand masters, who will usually be the founder of the order. In longer-lived orders the founder may have a successive grand master. Orders are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing. In normal circumstances, a Setian is only permitted to join one order, however special dispensation can be obtained for a practitioner to join two.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the sorting effects of university degree class on initial labor market outcomes using a regression discontinuity design that exploits institutional rules governing the award of degrees. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, we find sizeable and significant effects for Upper <b>Second</b> <b>degrees</b> and positive but smaller effects for First Class degrees on wages. In additional results we explore differences across groups and find evidence {{consistent with a}} simple model of statistical {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender and types of degree programmes. When we split the sample by ability, we find that the signaling effects are similar in the high ability group but stronger for Upper <b>Second</b> <b>degrees</b> in the lower ability group. The evidence points to the importance of sorting in the high skills labor market...|$|R
5|$|Edge {{then lost}} a return match {{on a special}} Thursday episode of Raw held in February and blamed special guest referee Mick Foley for his loss, {{claiming}} biased officiating and attacked him. At Saturday Night's Main Event, Foley got revenge on Edge by assaulting him with a con-chair-to. They feuded until WrestleMania 22 in April, where Edge defeated Foley in a Hardcore match by spearing him through a flaming table but suffered <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> burns. Following his feud with Foley, Edge once again challenged John Cena for the WWE Championship. Triple H {{was involved in a}} feud with Cena at the time, resulting in a triple threat match at Backlash, where Cena pinned Triple H to retain the title. After Backlash, Edge continued his feud with Mick Foley as they entered a triple threat hardcore match. Foley, however, betrayed his friend Tommy Dreamer with Edge's assistance. Edge and Foley then proclaimed that, because of their brutal match at WrestleMania, they were the true Hardcore Champions. At June's pay-per-view event One Night Stand, Edge, Foley and Lita defeated Dreamer, Terry Funk and Beulah McGillicutty in an Extreme Rules tag team match. Later in the event, Edge interfered in the WWE Championship match between John Cena and challenger Rob Van Dam, helping Van Dam win the title after he speared Cena through a table.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
