5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock {{to help build a}} state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

Before the decision, Commissioner Don Garber and the {{committee}} contemplated whether to have the cup final at the highest seed's home ground, or to have it at the stadium of the Supporters' Shield winner.

25|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Jaypaw and Leafpool must go to WindClan to take Onestar {{a message}} from Firestar about not {{shedding}} unnecessary blood in a battle over <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> never happen, while Hollypaw convinces Mousefur and Firestar to do something to help RiverClan. When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk about the future and how they want things to go.|$|E

Despite not taking {{a strong interest in}} politics, Wheeler was described by his biographer as [...] "a natural conservative"; for instance, during his youth he was strongly critical of the Suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women. Nevertheless, he was [...] "usually happy to advance young women professionally", <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them. He expressed little interest in his relatives; in later life, he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties.|$|E

500|$|The September 11, 2001 {{attacks are}} used as a motif {{representing}} a {{break with the past}} with Cayce's father, who disappears during the attacks, as the personification of the 20th century. Gibson viewed the attacks as a nodal point after which [...] "nothing is really the same". One reviewer commented that in [...] "Gibson's view, 9-11 was the end of history; after it we are without a history, careening toward an unknown future without the benefit of a past—our lives before 9-11 are now irrelevant." [...] Cayce's search for her father and Damien's excavation of the German bomber symbolize the historicist search for a method to interpret people's actions in the past. Coming to terms with her father's disappearance may be interpreted as a requiem for those lost to the 20th century, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been influenced by Gibson {{coming to terms with the}} loss of his own father.|$|E

2500|$|In Catholic teachings, Jesus Christ is {{the only}} {{mediator}} between God and man. He alone reconciled through his death on the Cross creator and creation. But this does not exclude a secondary [...] mediating role for Mary, preparatory, supportive, {{in the view of}} several prominent, but not all Catholics. The teaching that Mary intercedes for all believers and especially those who request her intercession through prayer has been held in the Church since early times, for example by Ephraim, the Syrian “after the mediater a mediatrix for the whole world Intercession is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be done by all the heavenly saints, but Mary is seen as having the greatest intercessionary power.

2500|$|The mood of Arnold's poetry {{tends to}} be of plaintive reflection, and he is {{restrained}} in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the 'criticism of life' and express a philosophy. Arnold's philosophy is that true happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues {{that we should not}} live in the belief that we shall one day inherit eternal bliss. If we are not happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> never be attained. This philosophy is clearly expressed in such poems as [...] "Dover Beach" [...] and in these lines from [...] "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse": ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{a different}} {{judge of the}} High Court departed from the view taken in Tang Kin Hwa. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang {{as to whether the}} two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief that <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible.|$|E
2500|$|States may not {{exercise}} certain powers {{reserved for the}} federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue bills of credit (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government) from [...] "making a tender" [...] (i.e., authorizing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be offered in payment) of any type or form of money to meet any financial obligation, unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In Federalist no. 44, Madison explains that [...] "it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they {{ought not to be}} at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded". Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ex post facto laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, in Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon {{thought that}} there was a real {{difference}} between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, suspicion suggests a belief that <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> not be provable could still be possible. Reasonable suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, likelihood points towards something being likely, and real suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible. Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E
