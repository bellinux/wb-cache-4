5000|$|Against the clergymen's {{assertion}} that demonstrations could be illegal, King argued {{that not only}} was civil disobedience justified in the face of unjust laws, but it was necessary and even patriotic. [...] "I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law." [...] King stated that an unjust law was a law that degraded a human personality. Citing Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Martin Buber, and Paul Tillich—and examples from the past and present—King described what makes laws just or unjust. For example, [...] "A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law." [...] Alabama has used [...] "all sorts of devious methods" [...] to deny its black citizens their right to vote and thus preserve its unjust laws and broader system of white supremacy. [...] Segregation laws are immoral and unjust [...] "because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the <b>segregator</b> a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority." [...] Even some just laws, such as permit requirements for public marches, are unjust when used to uphold an unjust system.|$|E

With computer control system, temperature and pressure was controlled accurately in dyeing process. As key components of the supercritical dyeing equipment, the coloring matter kettle and the <b>segregator</b> had {{a close relationship with}} the dyeing process. The finite element analysis software ANSYS was used to analyze the static stress of supercritical dyeing equipment. The model of the coloring matter kettle and the <b>segregator</b> were established, and the static stress analysis result of the coloring matter kettle and the <b>segregator</b> were obtained. These models not only confirmed the safety of the dyeing equipment, but also offered related parameters and provided the methods for improving the efficiency of dyeing equipment design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The need {{has arisen}} in rice-drying {{facilities}} in Japan for an automatic method to measure quality aspects of rice when it {{arrives at the}} drying facility. A near-infrared (NIR) transmission instrument was used to obtain NIR spectra of damp rough rice and damp brown rice. Calibration models were developed from the original spectra and reference analysis data to determine moisture and protein content of the samples. A visible light (VIS) <b>segregator</b> {{was used to determine}} sound whole kernel of brown rice. The precision and accuracy of the NIR instrument and the VIS <b>segregator</b> were found to be sufficiently high to determine moisture and protein content, and sound whole kernel ratio. An automatic rice-quality inspection system was consequently developed. The system consisted of a rice huller, a rice cleaner, an NIR instrument and a VIS <b>segregator,</b> and it was controlled by a computer. Based on the rice-quality information, this system enabled rough rice transported to a rice-drying facility to be classified into six qualitative grades...|$|E
40|$|The work of {{recycling}} solid waste <b>segregators</b> allows a precarious livelihood, but triggers a disease process that exacerbates {{their health and}} well-being. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of occupational accidents at the open dump in the Federal District and its associated factors. Most <b>segregators</b> have had an accident at work (55. 5 %), perceived the danger of their working environment (95. 0 %) and claimed they did not receive personal protective equipment (51. 7 %). Among other findings, 55. 8 % ate foods found in the trash, 50. 0 % experienced food insecurity at home and 44. 8 % received Bolsa Fam&# 237;lia. There was a statistically significant relationship between work accidents and perception of dangerous work environment, household food insecurity {{and the presence of}} fatigue, stress or sadness (p < 0. 05). On the other hand, the fellowship between the <b>segregators</b> was associated with a lower prevalence of accidents (p < 0. 006). Women are the majority of the <b>segregators</b> (56. 5 %) and reported more accidents than men (p < 0. 025). We conclude that the solid waste <b>segregators</b> constitute a vulnerable community, not only from the perspective of labor, but also from the social and environmental circumstances. To reverse this situation, effective implementation of the National Policy of Solid Wastes is imperative, in association with affirmative policies to grant economic emancipation for this population...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: {{describe}} {{elements that}} promote satisfaction and dissatisfaction {{in the work}} of recyclable solid waste <b>segregators</b> and conduct a nursing action focused on these elements. Method: qualitative research, convergent-care, conducted with members of the cooperative. Data production occurred during 2015 through participation observation, semi-structured interviews, and a convergence group. Analysis comprised the phases Apprehension, Synthesis, Theorization, and Transference. Results: four categories emerged. They showed satisfaction and dissatisfaction related to identification with tasks and work content, material and personal gains obtained from solid waste segregation, prejudice, lack of appreciation, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. This last item, due to its importance, received a nursing action. Conclusion: the study contributed to the advancement of knowledge and the association of possibilities between the research performance and nursing care for workers...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} seven DNA fragments from Caenorhabditis elegans {{that enhance}} the mitotic segregation of autonomously replicating plasmids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These segregators, designated SEG 1 -SEG 7, behave like isolated yeast chromosomes: they increase {{the stability and}} simultaneously lower the copy number of circular plasmids during mitotic growth in yeast. During meiosis, plasmids containing the C. elegans segregators show higher levels of precocious or aberrant disjunction than do plasmids bearing isolated yeast centromeres. Yet one of the segregators improved the meiotic segregation of the parental plasmid. We estimate {{that there may be}} as many as 30 <b>segregator</b> sequences in the C. elegans genome, a value that is consistent with the polycentric nature of C. elegans chromosomes. Five of the seven segregators are linked to sequences that are repeated in the worm genome, and four of these five segregators cross-hybridize. Other members of this family of repetitive DNA do not contain <b>segregator</b> function. <b>Segregator</b> sequences may prove useful for probing the structure of centromeres of both C. elegans and S. cerevisiae chromosomes...|$|E

Fresh sections of the leaf, stem, and root were analysed for the presence of CPT by examining the autofluorescence that the CPT molecule emits when exposed to UV radiation. In the plants grown in the field, CPT was observed only rarely. In the greenhouse plants, CPT had accumulated in crystalline form in the vacuole of specialised cells (i. e., <b>segregator</b> idioblasts), which were not morphologically distinguishable from the cells of the surrounding tissues. In the organs examined, the <b>segregator</b> idioblasts were localised in parenchymatic and epidermal tissues.

The hospital {{did not provide}} the technology, instead they asked their workers {{to use their own}} personal mobiles at work, through a permissive bring your own device to work (BYOD) policy. Using boundary theory, we conducted a constant-comparative analysis to examine the layers of boundary management issues. At the organizational level, the key issues were policy legacy, communicating the policy, control, dead zones, and mobile costs. At the group level, different hospital units created their own formal and informal policies. At the individual level, themes included personal mobile device use, job role expectations, and decision-making autonomy. The discussion presents examples of how healthcare workers enacted <b>segregator</b> and integrator boundaries.

40|$|Global {{analysis}} of lymphoma genome integrity and transcriptomes tremendously advanced {{our understanding of}} their biology. Technological advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics promise to complete the picture by allowing the global quantification of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Here we use N-glyco FASP, a recently developed mass spectrometric approach using lectin-enrichment, {{in conjunction with a}} super-SILAC approach to quantify N-linked glycoproteins in lymphoma cells. From patient-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines, we mapped 2383 glycosites on 1321 protein groups, which were highly enriched for cell membrane proteins. This N-glyco subproteome alone allowed the segregation of the ABC from the GCB subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which before gene expression studies had been considered one disease entity. Encouragingly, many of the glycopeptides driving the segregation belong to proteins previously characterized as <b>segregators</b> in a deep proteome study of these subtypes (S. J. Deeb et al. MCP 2012 PMID 22442255). This conforms to the high correlation that we observed between the expression level of the glycosites and their corresponding proteins. Detailed examination of glycosites and glycoprotein expression levels uncovered, among other interesting findings, enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs, including known NF-kappa-B related ones. Thus, enrichment of a class of post-translationally modified peptides can classify cancer types as well as reveal cancer specific mechanistic changes...|$|R

We show that NT IME(n √ log ∗ (n)) = DT IME(n √ log ∗ (n)). We show that if the class of multi-pushdown graphs has (o(n), o(n/log(n))) <b>segregators,</b> then NT IME(nlog(n)) = DT IME(nlog(n)). We also show that atleast {{one of the following}} facts holds-(1) P = L, (2) For all polynomially bounded constructible time bounds t, NT IME(t) = DT IME(t). We consider the problem of whether NT IME(t) is distinct from NSP ACE(t) for constructible time bounds t. A pebble game on graphs is defined such that the existence of a “good ” strategy for the pebble game on multi-pushdown graphs implies a “good” simulation of nondeterministic time bounded machines by nondeterministic space-bounded machines. It is shown that there exists a “good ” strategy for the pebble game on multi-pushdown graphs iff the graphs have sublinear separators. Finally, we show that nondeterministic time bounded Turing machines can be simulated by Σ 4 machines with an asymptotically smaller time bound, under the assumption that the class of multipushdown graphs has sublinear separators. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{metasearch}} engine {{is a system}} that provides integrated access to multiple existing search engine mechanisms. Once a query is executed on a {{metasearch engine}}, the system passes the query to its participating component search engines, collects the individual results and merges them into a single ranked list. Metasearch engines increase the search coverage of the Web, help solve the extendibility issues in searching the internet, and improve the retrieval effectiveness, and consequently the relevance, of results. Result merging is a key constituent of metasearch engines. When results from several search engines are collected, the metasearch system has to merge them into a unified list. The effectiveness of the metasearch mechanism and the relevance of the result set are closely related to the result merging algorithm used. The purpose of this research is to build a flexible, general purpose metasearch framework and explore a content-directed result merging approach to rank results. Here the content-direction is provided to the framework by the user in the form of documents or text artifacts. A modular metasearch application programming interface (API) based on java has been implemented. The API framework provides interfaces and utilities to develop components of a metasearch system like <b>segregators,</b> scheduler, aggregators, and search service providers. A prototype metasearch engine has been built based on this framework to study the content-directed result merging algorithm...|$|R

It will be explored the idea that the rationality of the capitalist mode of production and the contradictions of society are combined to produce a space that is segregated and <b>segregator,</b> which positivities and negativities are lived in the quotidian by their inhabitants in ways that vary according to their socio-economical level, but whose final outcome is a whole that seems to be minor than the sum of their parts...|$|E

By providing a STATUS report, service requester can be automatically aware of the current status of the service.

The Mixed Marriage policy was an attempt to reconcile the question: Who did the U. S. government and the Japanese American community consider Japanese? Japanese Americans emigrated with the transpacific identity of both Japanese and American. In contrast, the U. S. government rejected the possibility of dual identities by arguing that racial identity was based on biology alone. The existence of mixed race individuals in Japanese mass incarceration camps upset the U. S. ’s racial logic that emphasized <b>segregator</b> biology over the possibility of cultural assimilation. The Mixed Marriage policy built upon segregation policies to determine who could integrate into the American identity. Those who passed the appeal process of the Mixed Marriage policy were welcomed back into the categories of Japanese and American. These individuals became symbols for the U.

40|$|In-line flow <b>segregators</b> {{based on}} axial {{induction}} of swirling flow have important applications in chemical, process and petroleum production industries. In the later, the segregation of gas bubbles and/or water droplets dispersed into viscous oil by swirling pipe flow {{may be beneficial}} by either providing a pre-separation mechanism (bubble and/or drop coalescer) or, {{in the case of}} water-in-oil dispersions, by causing a water-lubricated flow pattern to establish in the pipe (friction reduction). Works addressing these applications are rare in the literature. In this paper, the features and capabilities of swirling pipe flow axially induced by a vane-type swirl generator were investigated both numerically and experimentally. The numerical analysis has been carried out using a commercial CFD package for axial Reynolds numbers less than 2000. Pressure drop, tangential and axial velocity components as well as swirl intensity along a 5 cm i. d. size and 3 m long pipe were computed. Single phase flow experiments have been performed using a water-glycerin solution of 54 mPa s viscosity and 1210 kg/m(3) density as working fluid. The numerical predictions of the pressure drop were compared with the experimental data and agreement could be observed within the range of experimental conditions. The experiments confirmed that swirl flow leads to much higher friction factors compared with theoretical values for non-swirl (i. e. purely axial) flow. Furthermore, the addition of a conical trailing edge reduces vortex breakdown., Visualization of the two-phase swirling flow pattern was achieved by adding different amounts of air to the water-glycerin solution upstream the swirl generator.

40|$|Established soil {{sampling}} methods for asbestos are inadequate to support risk assessment and risk-based decision making at Superfund sites due to difficulties in detecting asbestos at low concentrations and difficulty in extrapolating soil concentrations to air concentrations. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 's Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM) currently recommends the rigorous process of Activity Based Sampling (ABS) to characterize site exposures. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare three soil analytical methods and two {{soil sampling}} methods to determine whether one method, or combination of methods, would yield more reliable soil asbestos data than other methods. Samples were collected using both traditional discrete ("grab") samples and incremental sampling methodology (ISM). Analyses were conducted using polarized light microscopy (PLM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods or a combination of these two methods. Data show that the fluidized bed asbestos <b>segregator</b> (FBAS) followed by TEM analysis could detect asbestos at locations that were not detected using other analytical methods; however, this method exhibited high relative standard deviations, indicating the results may be more variable than other soil asbestos methods. The comparison of samples collected using ISM versus discrete techniques for asbestos resulted in no clear conclusions regarding preferred sampling method. However, analytical results for metals clearly showed that measured concentrations in ISM samples were less variable than discrete samples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Spira [28] {{showed that}} any Boolean formula of size s can be {{simulated}} in depth O(log s). We generalize Spira’s theorem {{and show that}} any Boolean circuit of size s with segregators of size f(s) can be simulated in depth O(f(s) log s). If the <b>segregator</b> size is at least s ε for some constant ε> 0, then we can obtain a simulation of depth O(f(s)). This improves and generalizes a simulation of polynomial-size Boolean circuits of constant treewidth k in depth O(k 2 log n) by Jansen and Sarma [17]. Since the existence of small balanced separators in a directed acyclic graph implies that the graph also has small segregators, our results also apply to circuits with small separators. Our results imply that the class of languages computed by non-uniform families of polynomial-size circuits that have constant size segregators equals non-uniform NC 1. Considering space bounded Turing machines to generate the circuits, for f(s) log 2 s-space uniform families of Boolean circuits our small-depth simulations are also f(s) log 2 s-space uniform. As a corollary, we show that the Boolean Circuit Value problem for circuits with constant size segregators (or separators) is in deterministic SP ACE(log 2 n). Our results also imply that the Planar Circuit Value problem, which {{is known to be}} P-Complete [16], can be solved in deterministic SP ACE (√ n log n). Key words: Boolean circuits, circuit size, circuit depth, Spira’s theorem, Turing machines, space complexity...|$|E

40|$|There is no {{geographical}} {{definition of}} the neighbourhood despite it being the chosen spatial scale for U. K. government policy tackling social injustice and rebuilding democracy, and the setting {{for the majority of}} life’s experiences where an individual’s lifelong welfare is largely determined. Consequently, resources are targeted sub-optimally with environmental and social dynamics largely undiagnosed. This has fuelled an urgent demand for revealing the nature of neighbourhoods, and how they can be identified on the ground and delineated on maps. Implementing a positive methodology I build upon the foremost theoretically-supported pedestrian-street network neighbourhood model, harnessing established theory, and present an integrative geographical theory of the neighbourhood and its practical manifestation to address the research problem. Using Grannis's empirical work as a benchmark I test the transferability of his methodology to the UK and the explanatory power of my housing area neighbourhood model, using correlation analysis, in two London case study areas, with positive results. Housing areas arise from the physical and built environments and are shown to explain social distributions better than other spatial units tested, and compare favourably with applied surrogate neighbourhoods. I then identify the datasets required to roll out the methodology for developing a practical, meaningful and bounded neighbourhood geography. Further analysis confirms the role of wealth as the great social and spatial <b>segregator.</b> The neighbourhood is re-conceptualised as an holistic and commonly understood entity, whilst the spatial precision introduced facilitates measurement and assessment for optimal service and resource provision, as well as monitoring and intervention. Presenting structural and social homophily as the geneses of social interaction patterns and the explanation for how space is transformed into place is a paradigm shift in our understanding of this fundamental geographical concept which promises to stimulate additional theoretical substantiation and development whilst providing a framework for phenomenological and ethnographical approaches...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVisual and {{auditory}} duration information {{plays an important}} role in our perception of external events. However, mismatches frequently occur in the temporal extent of the event's auditory and visual components (e. g., seen and heard elements of striking a cymbal). Moreover, these physical discrepancies will be accompanied by perceptual differences arising from internal neural noise. An efficient system for integrating these signals might resolve these discrepancies by fusing the signals into a multisensory estimate of audiovisual duration. However, this approach would lead to potentially hazardous misperceptions if large audiovisual discrepancies originate from separate external sources. In the current study, we investigated the role of duration discrepancy in regulating the multisensory perception of duration. Observers made visual duration discrimination judgments (centred on 320 ms) whilst attempting to ignore a range of concurrently presented auditory ‘distracter’ stimuli (100 - 640 ms in logarithmically spaced steps). In line with earlier reports (Klink, Montijn & van Wezel, 2011), small duration discrepancies caused perceived visual duration to be biased in the direction of the auditory distracter. Small increases in auditory distracter duration (> 320 ms) induced approximately linear increases in perceived visual duration until ∼ 0. 2 log units of duration discrepancy, beyond which the influence of the auditory distracter declined rapidly. There was no evidence of a similar tuning pattern with an equivalent decreases in auditory distracter duration (< 320 ms) : perceived visual duration showed robust contraction with our shortest distracter. Given that duration discrepancies were matched (in logarithmic terms) either side of our 320 ms visual stimulus, our asymmetric tuning pattern cannot be driven by relative duration per se. Alternatively, multisensory integration may be driven by onset/offset asynchronies which were disproportionately greater for longer auditory distracter/visual stimulus combinations. A follow up experiment confirmed this possibility: visual judgments were made around a 640 ms baseline accompanied by a range of distracter stimuli which generated equal duration discrepancies either side of 640 ms (in log terms) but substantially greater onset/offset asynchronies across the range. In this situation, there was little evidence of robust audiovisual interaction, suggesting that discrepant onsets and/or offsets are a more powerful perceptual <b>segregator</b> than the durations bound within them...|$|E
