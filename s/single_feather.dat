5|$|Tail {{feathers}} of the extinct huia are very rare {{and they have}} become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$8,000, {{much higher than the}} $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive feather ever. The previous record price for a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a bald eagle feather at auction in the United States.|$|E
5|$|These {{features}} make Archaeopteryx a clear {{candidate for}} a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, Archaeopteryx plays an important role, {{not only in the}} study of the origin of birds, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to my studio to visit me. He would sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E

500|$|The compound-expansion {{steam engine}} was {{supplied}} with steam by 6 boilers and developed [...] This was 50% {{more powerful than}} the predecessor class, which gave the corvette one more knot of speed, a difference that would be crucial in the disaster that made Calliope famous. Driving a <b>single</b> <b>feathering</b> screw, the engine could achieve a speed of 13¾knots, or 14¾knots with forced draught. The vessel nevertheless was a fully rigged sailing ship, allowing sustained service in areas where coaling stations were far apart. Calliope was well-suited to distant cruising service for the British Empire at its Victorian peak.|$|R

The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian with a Mohawk hairstyle and <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa was replaced in 1986. The current mascot is [...] "Homer the Brave".|$|E
500|$|The initial discovery, a <b>single</b> <b>feather,</b> was {{unearthed}} in 1860 or 1861 {{and described}} in 1861 by Hermann von Meyer. It is currently {{located at the}} Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. This is generally assigned to Archaeopteryx and was the initial holotype, but {{whether it is a}} feather of this species, or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the [...] "typical" [...] A. lithographica).|$|E
500|$|When Heilmann {{began his}} {{research}} in the early 1900s, the early bird Archaeopteryx was only known from three fossils found in the limestone quarries of Solnhofen near Eichstätt, Germany. The three fossils consisted of two nearly complete skeletons found in 1861 and 1877 and a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> from 1860. They had been discovered just a few decades after {{the discovery of the}} dinosaurs, and as some dinosaurs appeared somewhat birdlike, Archaeopteryx was regarded as a possible [...] "missing link" [...] between reptiles and birds by many paleontologists at the time.|$|E

50|$|Praeornis is {{a dubious}} genus of {{possible}} early bird, named {{on the basis}} of a <b>single</b> possible <b>feather</b> discovered in the Balabansai Formation of Kazakhstan by Sharov in 1971. A second specimen has been discovered in 2010 by Dzik et al.|$|R
50|$|Recovered {{from the}} German Solnhofen {{limestone}} beds in 1871, {{it is only}} the third Archaeopteryx to be discovered and the most complete. The first specimen, a <b>single</b> 150-million-year-old <b>feather</b> found in 1860, is also in the possession of the museum.|$|R
500|$|Birds and bats have {{homologous}} limbs {{because they}} are both ultimately derived from terrestrial tetrapods, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence. The two groups have powered flight, evolved independently. [...] Their wings differ substantially in construction. The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs. The airfoil of the bird wing is made of feathers, strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the carpometacarpus), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a <b>single</b> <b>feather.</b> So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent.|$|E
500|$|The Greek term [...] "pteryx" [...] (...) {{primarily}} means [...] "wing", but {{can also}} designate merely [...] "feather". Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> which appeared to resemble a modern bird's remex (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the London specimen, to which he referred as a [...] "Skelett eines mit ähnlichen Federn bedeckten [...] " [...] ("skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term Schwinge which {{does not necessarily mean}} a wing used for flying. Urschwinge was the favoured translation of Archaeopteryx among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, [...] "ancient pinion" [...] offers a rough approximation.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{fossils of}} the genus Archaeopteryx are usually {{assigned}} {{to one or two}} species, A. lithographica and A. siemensii, but their taxonomic history is complicated. Dozens of names have been published for the handful of specimens, most of which are simply spelling errors (lapsus). As interpreted today, the name A. lithographica only referred to the <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> described by Meyer. In 1954 Gavin de Beer concluded that the London specimen was the holotype. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name Archaeopteryx lithographica be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names Griphosaurus and Griphornis invalid. The ICZN, implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens, which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent Johann Andreas Wagner (whose Griphosaurus problematicus – [...] "problematic riddle-lizard" [...] – was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer's Archaeopteryx). In addition, in 1977 the first specific name of the Haarlem specimen, crassipes, described by Meyer as a pterosaur before its true nature was realized, also was suppressed.|$|E

50|$|Males weigh up to 6.6 lb {{and females}} up to 5.5 lb. There are two color varieties; {{a black and}} a blue. Both have a <b>single</b> white <b>feather</b> on each wing and a white bib. Eggs have a blue-green shell. Duclair ducks are {{considered}} table ready at 8 weeks old.|$|R
60|$|While {{they were}} waiting in the {{anteroom}} there entered from another apartment a young man uniformed similarly to the others with the exception that upon his head was a fillet of gold, {{in the front of}} which a <b>single</b> parrot <b>feather</b> rose erectly above his forehead. As he entered, the other soldiers in the room rose to their feet.|$|R
2500|$|The Afflicted Warriors is {{a series}} of portraits {{depicting}} male Indian warriors with long hair, a headband a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> from their head, while some are not adorned. The Wounded Knee series is reminiscent of Picasso's Blue Period, a series of male and female portraits painted in blues, greens and blacks with a touch of white. The portraits are skeletal, representative of the horrors that took place at Wounded Knee. Occasionally they are just general [...] "Rugged Indians" [...] and Denomie will sign, date and perhaps name the portrait after someone it reminds him of.|$|E
60|$|Fifthly, out of {{the upper}} part and {{outsides}} of these horns (as I may call them, from the Figure they are of, in the 24.

50|$|However, {{a second}} {{possible}} Gastornis feather {{has since been}} identified, also from the Green River Formation. Unlike the filamentous plant material, this <b>single</b> isolated <b>feather</b> resembles the body feathers of flighted birds, being broad and vaned. It was tentatively identified as a possible Gastornis feather based on its size; the feather measured 240 mm long and must have belonged to a gigantic bird.|$|R

50|$|One popular {{use of the}} Shuti, two-feather crown is by {{the deity}} Amun, {{one of his many}} crowns he is portrayed wearing.

60|$|As the menacing figures {{stood in}} the glare of the fire gazing at the party with shifty eyes, they {{presented}} a frightful appearance. Fierce lineaments, all the more so because of bars of paint, the hideous, shaven heads adorned with tufts of hair holding a <b>single</b> <b>feather,</b> sinewy, copper-colored limbs suggestive of action and endurance, the general aspect of untamed ferocity, appalled the travelers and chilled their blood.|$|E
60|$|The {{new arrival}} was a lady of {{singularly}} striking appearance, beautiful {{and in the}} full flush of womanhood, being perhaps thirty years of age. She wore a smart walking-suit that fitted her rounded form perfectly, and a small hat with a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> was jauntily perched upon her well-set head. Hair and eyes, almost black, contrasted finely with the bloom on her cheeks. In her ungloved hand she held a small walking- stick.|$|E

50|$|A <b>single</b> Miwok <b>feather</b> skirt or cape {{was made}} with {{approximately}} 100 feet of cordage, requiring about 500 plant stalks. A 40-foot-long deer net contained about 7,000 feet of cordage, requiring the harvesting of approximately 35,000 plant stalks. The milkweed stalks were burned in the fall to eliminate dead stalks and stimulate the next year's growth, and to stimulate flower and seed production. Cordage was typically two-ply, though there are some examples at the Field Museum of three- and four-ply Miwok cordage.|$|R

Across his shoulder he carried the sash of a finely beaded tobacco pouch, and in his hand a long fringed bag, very ancient, containing a peace-pipe, which had been transmitted to Crawling Elk by his father's father, a very precious thing, worn only by chieftains.|$|E
60|$|While the {{old lady}} had been {{speaking}} Tess and the other maid, in obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a <b>single</b> <b>feather</b> were crippled or draggled. She handled their crops, and knew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much; her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind.|$|E

50|$|The {{hospital}} has individual air-conditioned rooms for over 200 birds. Each year about 6,000 falcons enter its care. It offers annual check-ups {{because it is}} often difficult to recognise whether a falcon has a health issue. The staff is experienced in treating everything they might diagnose. Even the birds' feathers are carefully scrutinised. As visitors learn during the popular tours a falcon's flight gets significantly unbalanced when they lose even a <b>single</b> flight <b>feather.</b> Consequently it is standard treatment to repair or substitute lost feathers by those kept in stock.|$|R
