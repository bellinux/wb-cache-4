5|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} the Solar System began 4.6billion {{years ago with the}} gravitational collapse of a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.|$|E

5|$|This sparrow feeds {{primarily}} on small grass and forb seeds, fresh grass stems, and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter. During these seasons, insects such as ants, grasshoppers, ground beetles, and scale insects {{as well as}} spiders make up a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its diet. In the spring and summer, the bird's diet includes a greater quantity and variety of insects.|$|E
5|$|Welles {{later said}} that casting {{character}} actor Gino Corrado in the <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the waiter at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado {{had appeared in}} many Hollywood films, often as a waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E

5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the ice floe broke away {{and he was}} only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of {{the men of the}} next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately {{from the rest of}} the troop.|$|E

5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy.

5|$|In 1854 the Barton, Eccles, Winton and Monton Local Board of Health was {{established}} for {{the northern part of}} the township of Barton.

A <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the borough was transferred in 1961 to the County Borough of Salford. In 1974 the borough was abolished and its area transferred to Greater Manchester to form part of the City of Salford.|$|E

5|$|In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow {{is found}} in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{mainland}} Russia, Japan, southern Korea, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. It is distributed through southern China and Taiwan, and the mountainous parts of Burma, southern Northeast India, Laos, and Vietnam, where it is mostly resident. The russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China, and northern Thailand. In eastern Asia, the autumn migration occurs between August and November.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the Second World War {{there was a}} significant economic and population decline in Salford. In 1961 a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Eccles was added to the city. On 1 April 1974, the City and County Borough of Salford was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and was replaced by the metropolitan borough of City of Salford, one of ten local government districts in the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The city status of the new district was confirmed by additional letters patent issued on the same day. Since the early 1990s, the decline has slowed.|$|E
