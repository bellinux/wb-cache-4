It still retains, as we may see in Africa, its power of bringing to simple people a message of hope and consolation that no other religion offers. But this enchantment is produced by its <b>spurious</b> <b>association</b> with the personal charm of Jesus, and exists only for untrained minds. In the hands of a logical Frenchman like Calvin, pushing it to its utmost conclusions, and devising [...] "institutes" [...] for hardheaded adult Scots and literal Swiss, it becomes the most infernal of fatalisms; and the lives of civilized children are blighted by its logic whilst negro piccaninnies are rejoicing in its legends.|$|E

40|$|In genomewide {{mapping of}} {{expression}} quantitative trait loci (eQTL), {{it is widely}} believed that thousands of genes are trans-regulated by a small number of genomic regions called “regulatory hotspots,” resulting in “trans-regulatory bands” in an eQTL map. As several recent studies have demonstrated, technical confounding factors such as batch effects can complicate eQTL analysis by causing many <b>spurious</b> <b>associations</b> including <b>spurious</b> regulatory hotspots. Yet little is understood about how these technical confounding factors affect eQTL analyses and how to correct for these factors. Our analysis of data sets with biological replicates suggests that it is this intersample correlation structure inherent in expression data that leads to <b>spurious</b> <b>associations</b> between genetic loci and a large number of transcripts inducing spurious regulatory hotspots. We propose a statistical method that corrects for the <b>spurious</b> <b>associations</b> caused by complex intersample correlation of expression measurements in eQTL mapping. Applying our intersample correlation emended (ICE) eQTL mapping method to mouse, yeast, and human identifies many more cis associations while eliminating most of the <b>spurious</b> trans <b>associations.</b> The concordances of cis and trans associations have consistently increased between different replicates, tissues, and populations, demonstrating the higher accuracy of our method to identify real genetic effects...|$|R

40|$|Association between {{disease and}} genetic polymorphisms often {{contributes}} critical informa-tion in {{our search for}} the genetic components of common diseases. Devlin and Roeder (1999) introduced genomic control, a statistical method that overcomes a drawback {{to the use of}} population-based samples for tests of <b>association,</b> namely <b>spurious</b> <b>associations</b> induced by population structure. In essence, genomic control (GC) uses markers throughout the genome to adjust for any in ation in test statistics due to substructure. To date genomic control (GC) has been developed for binary traits and bi- or multiallelic markers. Tests of association using GC have been limited to single genes. In this report, we generalize GC to quantita-tive traits (QT) and multilocus models.

50|$|One {{limitation}} of the standard approach to discovering associations is that by searching massive numbers of possible associations to look for collections of items {{that appear to be}} associated, there is a large risk of finding many <b>spurious</b> <b>associations.</b> These are collections of items that co-occur with unexpected frequency in the data, but only do so by chance. For example, suppose we are considering a collection of 10,000 items and looking for rules containing two items in the left-hand-side and 1 item in the right-hand-side. There are approximately 1,000,000,000,000 such rules. If we apply a statistical test for independence with a significance level of 0.05 it means there is only a 5% chance of accepting a rule if there is no association. If we assume there are no associations, we should nonetheless expect to find 50,000,000,000 rules. Statistically sound association discovery controls this risk, in most cases reducing the risk of finding any <b>spurious</b> <b>associations</b> to a user-specified significance level.|$|R

When examining the effect of an individual genetic locus on a disease, logistic regressions developed by conditioning on parental genotypes provide complete protection from <b>spurious</b> <b>association</b> caused by population stratification. However, when testing gene-gene interactions, it is unknown whether conditional logistic regressions are still robust. Here we evaluate the robustness and efficiency of several gene-gene interaction tests that are derived from conditional logistic regressions. We found that {{in the presence of}} SNP genotype correlation due to population stratification or linkage disequilibrium, tests with incorrectly specified main-genetic-effect models can lead to inflated type I error rates.

40|$|Population-wide {{associations}} between loci due to linkage disequilibrium {{can be used}} to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) with high resolution. However, spurious {{associations between}} markers and QTL can also arise as a consequence of population stratification. Statistical methods that cannot differentiate between loci associations due to linkage disequilibria from those caused in other ways can render false-positive results. The transmission-disequilibrium test (TDT) is a robust test for detecting QTL. The TDT exploits within-family associations that are not affected by population stratification. However, some TDTs are formulated in a rigid form, with reduced potential applications. In this study we generalize TDT using mixed linear models to allow greater statistical flexibility. Allelic effects are estimated with two independent parameters: one exploiting the robust within-family information and the other the potentially biased between-family information. A significant difference between these two parameters can be used as evidence for <b>spurious</b> <b>association.</b> This methodology was then used to test the effects of the fourth melanocortin receptor (MC 4 R) on production traits in the pig. The new analyses supported the previously reported results; i. e., the studied polymorphism is either causal or in very strong linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutation, and provided no evidence for <b>spurious</b> <b>association...</b>|$|E

Since samples from the same population generally co-evolve, different populations may or may not share the same genetic underpinnings for the seemingly common phenotype. Our goal is to develop a unified framework for detecting causal genetic markers through a joint association analysis of multiple populations. RESULTS: Based on a multi-task regression principle, we present a multi-population group lasso algorithm using L(1) /L(2) -regularized regression for joint association analysis of multiple populations that are stratified either via population survey or computational estimation. Our algorithm combines information from genetic markers across populations, to identify causal markers. It also implicitly accounts for correlations between the genetic markers, thus enabling better control over false positive rates. Joint analysis across populations enables the detection of weak associations common to all populations with greater power than in a separate analysis of each population. At the same time, the regression-based framework allows causal alleles that are unique to a subset of the populations to be correctly identified. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on HapMap-simulated and lactase persistence datasets, where we significantly outperform state of the art methods, with greater power for detecting weak <b>associations</b> and reduced <b>spurious</b> <b>associations.</b> AVAILABILITY: Software will be available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Population {{stratification}} is {{a potential}} problem for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), confounding results and causing <b>spurious</b> <b>associations.</b> Hence, understanding how allele frequencies vary across geographic regions or among subpopulations is an important prelude to analyzing GWAS data. Using over 350, 000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs in over 6000 Han Chinese samples from ten provinces of China, our study revealed a one-dimensional “north-south” population structure and a close correlation between geography and the genetic structure of the Han Chinese. The north-south population structure is consistent with the historical migration pattern of the Han Chinese population. Metropolitan cities in China were, however, more diffused “outliers,” probably because of the impact of modern migration of peoples. At a very local scale within the Guangdong province, we observed evidence of population structure among dialect groups, probably on account of endogamy within these dialects. Via simulation, we show that empirical levels of population structure observed across modern China can cause <b>spurious</b> <b>associations</b> in GWAS if not properly handled. In the Han Chinese, geographic matching is a good proxy for genetic matching, particularly in validation and candidate-gene studies in which population stratification cannot be directly accessed and accounted for {{because of the lack of}} genome-wide data, with the exception of the metropolitan cities, where geographical location is no longer a good indicator of ancestral origin.
