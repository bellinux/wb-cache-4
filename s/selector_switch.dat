25|$|The {{vertical}} section controls the amplitude of the displayed signal. This section carries a Volts-per-Division (Volts/Div) selector knob, an AC/DC/Ground <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> and the vertical (primary) input for the instrument. Additionally, this section is typically {{equipped with the}} vertical beam position knob.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} {{fossil fuel}} vehicles, such as some {{versions of the}} Crown Victoria especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on compressed natural gas—or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks – one for gasoline, the other for CNG – the same engine can operate on either fuel via a <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tap changers {{typically}} use numerous tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> {{which may}} not be switched under load, broken into even and odd banks, and switch between the banks with a heavy-duty diverter switch which can switch between them under load. The result operates like a dual-clutch transmission, with the tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> taking the place of the gearbox and the diverter switch taking the place of the clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The second tube is a {{semi-automatic}} 35 mm {{grenade launcher}} with programmable shells. A large <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> from rifle to grenade.|$|R
50|$|The Multimonica II {{featured}} no microphone input, {{and only}} one loudspeaker, but provided more types of harmonics filtering, and the electromechanic vibrato was changed to a tube based and more sophisticated design. The front panel controls of the Multimonica II {{from left to right}} are: power switch and overall volume knob; six <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> for different preset sounds of the synthesizer; tuning knob; two <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> for different harmonics filtering; three switches for the vibrato speed and amplitude; power switch for the blower fan.|$|R
25|$|If the {{mechanical}} regulator design {{is sensitive to}} small voltage fluctuations, {{the motion of the}} solenoid core can be used to move a <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> across a range of resistances or transformer windings to gradually step the output voltage up or down, or to rotate the position of a moving-coil AC regulator.|$|E
25|$|A double-crescent trigger {{provides}} select fire capability {{without the}} need for a fire mode <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b> Pressing the upper segment of the trigger produced semi-automatic fire, while holding the lower segment of the trigger produced fully automatic fire. Though considered innovative at the time, the feature was eliminated on most firearms due to its complexity. Examples include MG 34, Kg m/40 light machine gun, M1946 Sieg automatic rifle, and Star Model Z-70.|$|E
25|$|Firing {{tests showed}} that the M14, when {{equipped}} with the <b>selector</b> <b>switch,</b> hinged buttplate and bipod, performed {{as well as the}} M15. As a result, the M15 was dropped and the modified M14 became the squad automatic weapon. Accuracy and control problems with this variant led to the addition of a pistol grip, a folding rubber covered metal foregrip and a muzzle stabilizer. However, it was a poor suppressive fire weapon owing to 20-round magazines and it overheated rapidly.|$|E
50|$|The SLAM has an {{anti-tamper}} {{feature that}} is only active in the bottom- and side-attack modes. The SLAM will detonate when an attempt is made to change the <b>selector</b> <b>switch's</b> position after arming.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{switches}} for audio and video, from simple <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> to sophisticated production switchers. However, emulating or exceeding the capabilities of audio and/or video patch bays requires specialized devices like routing switches and crossbar switches.|$|R
50|$|The ARP Pro Soloist would {{eventually}} be reintroduced as the updated Pro-DGX featuring momentary digitally-latched push button voice <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> with LED status indicators, rather than toggle switches. It would remain in production until the company's demise in 1981.|$|R
25|$|Corgan played (during the Gish-Siamese Dream era) a {{customized}} '57 Reissue Fender Stratocaster equipped with three Fender Lace Sensor pickups (the Lace Sensor Blue {{in the neck}} position, the Lace Sensor Silver in the middle position, and the Lace Sensor Red at the bridge position). It also has a five-position pickup <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> which he installed himself. This battered Strat became his number one guitar by default. He owned a '74 Strat that was stolen shortly after Gish was completed.|$|E
25|$|The guitar was {{extensively}} {{modified by}} Gallagher. The tuning pegs are odd (5 Sperzel pegs and one Gotoh), {{and all of}} these {{have been found to be}} replacements. Second, it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times. Third, the pickguard was changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> in place of the vintage 3-way one.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E
5000|$|Unknown: There is {{an unknown}} model number {{featuring}} 2 single coil and 1 humbucking pickups, 3 independent <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> (one per pickup), 1 volume, 1 TBX, System I tremolo, rosewood fingerboard, 25.5" [...] scale length, and side mounted output jack.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1998, {{this made}} the {{distinction}} between uplink and normal ports and manual <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> on older hubs and switches obsolete. If {{one or both of}} two connected devices has the automatic MDI/MDI-X configuration feature, {{there is no need for}} crossover cables.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigation}} in design of high speed modulators based on planar microring resonators were made. The design and features of microresonator structures in optical modulators and Mach–Zehnder interferometers were considered. The {{possibilities of the}} use of microresonators as wavelength <b>selectors,</b> <b>switch</b> channels, multiplexers/demultiplexers, switches and routers are shown...|$|R
25|$|Ford has {{expanded}} its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate {{on a range of}} fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 18 is a selective-fire {{variant of}} the Glock 17, {{developed}} {{at the request of}} the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra, and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions. Originally produced in 1986, this machine pistol–class firearm has a lever-type fire-control <b>selector</b> <b>switch,</b> installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires fully automatically, and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semiautomatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 will function, with available capacities of 10, 17, or 19 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not featuring them on its official websites or its public catalogues, and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement and government organizations, and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce muzzle rise during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81 was {{designed}} to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a VHF TV channel <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> present on early [...] "ZX81 USA" [...] models and the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.|$|E
50|$|Automatic MDI/MDI-X Configuration is {{specified}} as {{an optional}} {{feature in the}} 1000BASE-T standard, meaning that straight-through cables will often work between gigabit-capable interfaces. This feature {{eliminates the need for}} crossover cables, making obsolete the uplink/normal ports and manual <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> found on many older hubs and switches and greatly reduces installation errors.|$|R
25|$|The trigger section {{controls}} the start {{event of the}} sweep. The trigger can be set to automatically restart after each sweep {{or it can be}} configured to respond to an internal or external event. The principal controls of this section will be the source and coupling <b>selector</b> <b>switches.</b> An external trigger input (EXT Input) and level adjustment will also be included.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{automated}} magnet {{switching system}} has been devised whereby power for beam-trans-port magnets of multiple-beam arrays can be sup-plied by common power supplies, thereby reduc-ing the power-supply cost {{to that of a}} single beam line. The heart of the system is compact and in-expensive computer- or punched-card-operated reversing and <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> that can switch kiloamperes. The complete system and the switches are described in detail...|$|R
500|$|When the INS {{navigation}} {{systems were}} properly programmed with the filed flight plan waypoints, the pilot {{could turn the}} autopilot mode <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> to the INS position and the plane would then automatically track the programmed INS course line, provided the plane was headed in the proper direction and within [...] of that course line. If, however, the plane was more than [...] from the flight-planned course line when the pilot turned the autopilot mode selector from HEADING to INS, the plane would continue to track the heading selected in HEADING mode {{as long as the}} actual position of the plane was more than [...] from the programmed INS course line. The autopilot computer software commanded the INS mode to remain in the [...] "armed" [...] condition until the plane had moved to a position less than [...] from the desired course line. Once that happened, the INS mode would change from [...] "armed" [...] to [...] "capture" [...] and the plane would track the flight-planned course from then on.|$|E
2500|$|Settings on {{the guitar}} itself (passive tone controls, active {{equalizer}} circuits in built-in preamps, pickup <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> position, etc.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{horizontal}} section controls the time base or [...] "sweep" [...] of the instrument. The primary control is the Seconds-per-Division (Sec/Div) <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b> Also included is a horizontal input for plotting dual X-Y axis signals. The horizontal beam position knob is generally located in this section.|$|E

50|$|The alternators were {{connected}} to 66 kV 3-phase delta-star transformers. The main 66 kV switchgear, rated at 2,500 MVA, was on the three upper floors of the switch-house: the circuit breakers on the upper floor, the <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> below and the bus-bars on the lower floor. Two 66 kV cables ran to Battersea power station, and two to Deptford power station. Ten 22 kV cables and twelve 11 kV cables distributed to various sub-stations of the London Electricity Board.|$|R
50|$|Some arcing is unavoidable, {{and both}} the tap changer oil and the switch {{contacts}} will slowly deteriorate with use. To prevent contamination of the tank oil and facilitate maintenance operations, the diverter switch usually operates in a separate compartment from the main transformer tank, and often the tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> will {{be located in the}} compartment as well. All of the winding taps will then be routed into the tap changer compartment through a terminal array.|$|R
2500|$|NTSB {{investigators}} {{examined and}} tested the antiskid, autobrake, and thrust reverser systems on the aircraft. The autobrake <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> {{in the cockpit}} {{was found in the}} [...] "max" [...] position. The tailcone handle in the main cabin had been actuated, presumably for evacuation purposes, and the rear tailcone had detached.|$|E
2500|$|The M15 Squad Automatic Weapon was a {{modified}} M14 {{developed as a}} replacement for the [...]30-06 M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle for use as a squad automatic weapon. It added a heavier barrel and stock, a hinged buttplate, a <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> for fully automatic fire, and a bipod. The sling was from the BAR. Like the M14, it was chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO.|$|E
2500|$|The Dark Fire had one Burstbucker 3 humbucker in {{the bridge}} position, a P-90H at the neck, {{and a special}} Tronical-designed {{piezoelectric}} tune-o-matic sat {{in the place of}} the bridge. The Burstbucker 3 and P-90H were selected via the three-way <b>selector</b> <b>switch.</b> The piezoelectric could be activated via the MCK, blending the magnetic and piezoelectric together under a standard 1/4" [...] guitar cable. Gibson supplied a TRS stereo cable that allowed the piezo signal and the magnetic signal to be split between two different amps.|$|E
50|$|Rosen built {{a replica}} of PURPLE which turned out (when a machine was found years later) to use exactly the same {{telephone}} <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> in common use {{at that time in}} the U.S. This machine was used to decode the Japanese diplomatic messages, sometimes before the Japanese ambassadors had themselves. Rosen also contributed his engineering talents during and after the war at Arlington Hall, after the S.I.S. became the Army Security Agency, later to become AFSA and finally the present National Security Agency.|$|R
30|$|The main panel {{includes}} real-time controllable parameters such as pickup <b>selector,</b> tone <b>switches,</b> yarn damping, ripple filter coefficients, soundboard knock volume, beating equalizers settings, and {{the master}} volume.|$|R
50|$|Assume {{a failure}} free state for a path from a node B to a node A. Node B bridges the signal destined to A from other nodes on the ring, both on working and {{protecting}} routes. At node A, signals {{from these two}} routes are continuously monitored for path layer defects and the better quality signal is selected.Now consider a failure state where fiber between node A and node B is cut. The <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> traffic on the standby route when the active route between node A and node B is failed.|$|R
