5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew <b>superlatives</b> from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
25|$|ASL {{occasionally}} uses suffixation in derivation, {{but less}} often than in English. Agent nouns may be derived from verbs by adding the suffix AGENT and deleting the final hold of the verb, e.g. TEACH+AGENT 'teacher'. <b>Superlatives</b> are also formed by suffixation, e.g. SMART+MOST 'smartest'.|$|E
25|$|Patti's {{career was}} one of success after success. She sang not only in England and the United States, but also as far afield in {{mainland}} Europe as Russia, and in South America as well, inspiring audience frenzy and critical <b>superlatives</b> wherever she went. Her girlish good looks gave her an appealing stage presence, which added to her celebrity status.|$|E
40|$|Since Greek authors is {{has been}} {{traditionally}} agreed that comparison is a three degree-system: positive, comparative and <b>superlative.</b> Doctrine {{also argues that}} <b>superlative</b> can compare, specially in case of relative <b>superlative,</b> which compares a term with another of the same category. According to this doctrine, relative <b>superlative</b> is, therefore, a comparative rather than an elative. Against this traditional idea, the most rational grammatic since Prisciano to Brocense argues that <b>superlative,</b> even the relative one, is <b>superlative</b> and not comparative and that the genitive that sometimes depends on {{it is not a}} second term of comparison, but a partitive. This idea is based on two arguments: first, the functions which doctrine ascribes to relative <b>superlative</b> -for example, to connect a term with another of the same category- can also be worded by a comparatife and, hence, <b>superlative</b> is not needed for this function and the compolement which depends on a comparative is not a second term of comparison but a partitive, so that the complement which depends on a relative <b>superlative</b> must be aso partitive and not comparative. Second, it is necessary to prove with some texts that tripartite system of comparison, in fact does not exist: that is to say that texts and facts demonstrate that comparative is comparative and <b>superlative,</b> even relative <b>superlative,</b> is <b>superlative.</b> We believe that true is, as always, in aurea mediocritas...|$|R

25|$|As desired and expected, news of {{a contest}} of such {{distance}} evoked strong enthusiasm both within and without the motorsport community. Newspaper and trade magazine articles used ever-new <b>superlatives</b> for the challenges expected to soon face both drivers and engineers, and continuing discussion throughout the spring and winter kept the race as the primary conversation piece of the average citizen. Everyone, it seemed, {{had something to say}} about it.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the {{influence}} of Francis Bacon was profound. Bacon, and indeed Hobbes, held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must {{be the basis of}} all rational sciences. This passion for accuracy led Petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision, rather than rely on comparatives or <b>superlatives,</b> yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic. Petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist, amidst the merchant-pamphleteers, such as Thomas Mun or Josiah Child, and philosopher-scientists occasionally discussing economics, such as John Locke.|$|E
25|$|When {{used with}} {{adjectival}} roots, non-telicity may suggest a gradualness of the quality, {{such as the}} comparison in (6). In comparative constructions the final syllables of each occurrence of the reduplicated root are accented. If {{the stress of the}} second occurrence is shifted to the first syllable, then the reduplicated root suggests a superlative degree, as in (7). Note that <b>superlatives</b> can also be created through prefixation of pinaka- to the root, as in pinaka-dakô. While non-telicity can suggest augmentation, as shown in (7), it can also indicate diminishment as in shown in (9), in contrast with (8) (note the stress contrast). In (8b), maàyoáyo, accented in the superlative pattern, suggests a trajectory of improvement that has not been fully achieved. In (9b), maàyoayó suggests a trajectory of decline when accented in the comparative pattern. The reduplicated áyo implies sub-optimal situations in both cases; full goodness/wellness is not achieved.|$|E
5000|$|Adjectives {{have three}} degrees of comparison: positive, {{comparative}} and <b>superlative.</b> The comparative and <b>superlative</b> are formed synthetically, by adding endings to the adjective. The comparative and <b>superlative</b> {{can also be}} formed analytically by using meer [...] "more" [...] and meest [...] "most", but this is much rarer than in English. The analytic forms are used only when the word would become particularly long, or when it would become hard to pronounce (particularly in the <b>superlative).</b>|$|R

25|$|That New England states, in general, regard {{cities and}} towns on equal footing, yet they are handled in two {{different}} ways by the Census Bureau, can be another source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that cities are incorporated but towns are not, or that {{cities and towns}} represent two fundamentally different types of entities. Note that the Census classifies New England municipalities strictly based on whether they are towns or cities, with no regard to the actual population-distribution pattern in a particular municipality. All municipalities titled as cities are classified as incorporated places, even if their population-distribution pattern {{is no different from}} that of a typical town; towns are never classified as incorporated places, even if they are thoroughly built-up. The ambiguity over whether certain municipalities in Massachusetts should be classified as cities or towns, and the Census Bureau's inconsistent handling of these municipalities (see the Statistics and <b>Superlatives</b> section below), further blurs matters.|$|E
25|$|Their {{opponent}} {{in the final round}} was the Calgary Flames, captained by Jarome Iginla. The final round also went the full seven games, with the deciding game played in the St. Pete Times Forum on June 7, 2004. This time, Ruslan Fedotenko was the Game 7 hero, scoring both Lightning goals in a 2–1 victory. Brad Richards, who had 26 points in the post-season, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs; the Lightning had won all 31 contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season. Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year. Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of 50 or more losses, and in only their 12th year of existence, the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup. Martin St. Louis led the team and the NHL with 94 points (his 38 goals were fourth-most after the 41 of tied trio Jarome Iginla, Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk), and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player. St. Louis also won the Lester B. Pearson Award for the league's most outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players' Association, and tied the Vancouver Canucks' Marek Malik for the NHL Plus/Minus Award. A season of <b>superlatives</b> was capped with one final accolade, as The Sporting News named GM Jay Feaster as the league's executive of the year for 2003–04.|$|E
500|$|From 2006 to 2011 {{the chief}} {{executive}} (titled [...] "artistic director") was John Fisher. His term overlapped with that of Lothar Koenigs who was musical director from 2009 to 2016. A highlight of this period was the 2010 production of Die Meistersinger, produced by Richard Jones, starring Bryn Terfel as Hans Sachs. The production won <b>superlatives</b> from reviewers.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{definite}} article is, {{along with}} más or menos, the <b>superlative</b> marker, the comparative is grammatically {{indistinguishable from the}} <b>superlative</b> when used with it; an additional qualifier phrase such as de los dos ("of the two") must therefore be used {{to indicate that the}} adjective is the comparative and not the <b>superlative.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>superlative</b> constructions {{in contemporary}} Syrian (Levantine) Arabic. These have the revealing property that the <b>superlative</b> morpheme may be linearly {{separated from the}} term that provides the degree scale it makes reference to. This displacement is syntactically constrained, lending support to theories that postulated movement in the derivation of <b>superlative</b> constructions. The data reported here also document a tight correlation of scopal options for the <b>superlative</b> in Arabic and English, indicating that the languages are uniform at LF, while the surface distribution of the <b>superlative</b> morpheme is wider in Arabic than in English. The remarkable convergence {{of a variety of}} interpretational nuances between these two unrelated languages suggests that these uniformities can be traced to Universal Grammar...|$|R
5000|$|In Estonian <b>superlative</b> form {{can usually}} {{made up in}} two ways. One is {{constructed}} with words [...] "kõige" [...] + comparative form. It {{can be made with}} all adjectives. For example: [...] "sinine" [...] (blue) comparative form is [...] "sinisem" [...] and therefore <b>superlative</b> form is [...] "kõige sinisem." [...] The short <b>superlative</b> form is made up by adding [...] "-m" [...] to the end of plural partitive case. Plural partitive from the word [...] "sinine" [...] (blue) is [...] "siniseid" [...] and therefore [...] "siniseim" [...] is short <b>superlative.</b> Short <b>superlative</b> cannot be made up with all adjectives and in difference of the [...] "kõige"-form, {{it has a lot of}} exceptions.|$|R

500|$|Degrees of {{comparison}} are constructed syntactically. Comparatives are expressed {{using the word}} [...] : [...] "A X [...] " [...] (A is more X [...] ). [...] The most common way to express <b>superlatives</b> is with [...] : [...] "A X [...] " [...] (A is the most X). Intensity is also expressed syntactically, similar to other languages of the region, by reduplication or {{with the use of}} intensifiers.|$|E
500|$|The next {{production}} was Macbeth.

40|$|Abstract We {{argue that}} the <b>superlative</b> {{modifiers}} at least and at most quan-tify over a scale of answers to the current question under discussion (and in this sense, resolve issues), and that they {{draw attention to the}} individual pos-sibilities along the scale (and in this sense, raise issues for discussion). The point of departure is a simple analysis on which at least denotes what only presupposes, and at most denotes what only contributes as its ordinary at-issue content. This analysis captures the truth conditions, focus-sensitivity, and distribution of <b>superlative</b> modifiers but leaves some pragmatic facts unexplained. We enrich the simple account with unrestricted inquisitive semantics in order to explain the fact that <b>superlative</b> modifiers give rise to ignorance implicatures while comparative modifiers like more and less do not, the fact that <b>superlative</b> modifiers do not give rise to scalar impli-catures, and two puzzles concerning the interaction between <b>superlative</b> modifiers and deontic modals. We argue that this proposal provides the most empirically successful published account of <b>superlative</b> modifiers to date...|$|R

500|$|Newton and Robert Boyle's {{approach}} to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as {{a viable alternative to}} the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians. The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical <b>superlatives</b> of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, and at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a [...] "Natural Religion".|$|E
500|$|The nondescript brown honeyeater has a {{noteworthy}} song, usually {{described in}} <b>superlatives.</b> [...] "A glorious voice, easily the best songster among Australian honeyeaters," [...] is how {{one study of}} West Australian birds noted. [...] "As a singer it has no superior among the honeyeater family, or for that matter, among Australian birds," [...] said another report. It has a clear, rolling, musical call, rendered as sweet-sweet-quarty-quarty, which is very loud for {{the size of the}} bird. Both sexes call, usually early in the morning, though the male calls throughout the day during the breeding season. The alarm call is a harsh ke-ke given several times at short intervals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to English, the relative and the <b>superlative</b> are joined {{into the same}} degree (the <b>superlative),</b> which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. [...] "the most beautiful") and absolute (e.g. [...] "very beautiful").|$|R

500|$|Journalists {{employed}} many <b>superlatives</b> {{to describe}} the Kippax style. Ray Robinson thought that Kippax's batting [...] "had a silky quality not seen in any other player of his time or since"; he captivated the crowds with his late cut when he, [...] "made a lissom bow over the ball and stroked it away with the bat's face downward, as if to squeeze {{the ball into the}} ground". His favourite hook shot propelled the ball [...] "with such unhurried ease that the punishing power of the stroke was revealed only in the way the ball smacked against the fence." [...] Donald Bradman believed him to be the best exponent of the hook shot in the game.|$|E

[...] Bolitho took a similar line in his 1943 book Combat Report, attesting to Hull's [...] "bubbling, unquenchable gaiety". According to Bolitho, Hull was [...] "possessed of a magic power of creating happiness in others; making them belittle their cares, of inspiring them with confidence, not simply in him but in themselves. Of imbuing them with his own abounding love of life. Where Caesar was, laughter was." ...|$|E
500|$|Gielgud {{invested}} £5,000, {{most of his}} {{earnings from}} the American Hamlet; Perry, who had family money, put in the same sum. From September 1937 to April 1938 Gielgud was the tenant of the Queen's Theatre, where he presented a season consisting of Richard II, The School for Scandal, Three Sisters, and The Merchant of Venice. His company included Harry Andrews, Peggy Ashcroft, Glen Byam Shaw, George Devine, Michael Redgrave and Harcourt Williams, with Angela Baddeley and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as guests. His own roles were King Richard, Joseph Surface, Vershinin and Shylock. Gielgud's performances drew <b>superlatives</b> from reviewers and colleagues.

5000|$|The {{containment}} {{hypothesis is}} a theory under the framework of Distributed Morphology advanced by Bobaljik (2012) {{to account for the}} restrictions on the patterns of suppletion seen in language. It states:"The representation of the <b>superlative</b> properly contains that of the comparative (in all languages that have a morphological superlative)."Bobaljik argues that if a language has a <b>superlative</b> form, it must build off the comparative form. In other words, the <b>superlative</b> form and the bare adjective cannot be built off the same root to the exclusion of the comparative (a so-called *ABA pattern), because the comparative is necessarily contained within the <b>superlative</b> form. Thus, languages allow: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>superlative</b> adverb is {{also very}} simple: {{it has the same}} base as the <b>superlative</b> {{adjective}} and always ends in a long -e. Instead of the adjective clārissimus, which mean brightest, the adverb is clārissimē, which means most brightly.|$|R
