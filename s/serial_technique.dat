500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of <b>serial</b> <b>technique</b> was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of my interest in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E

2500|$|Schoenberg's <b>serial</b> <b>technique</b> of {{composition}} with twelve notes {{became one of}} the most central and polemical issues among American and European musicians during the mid- to late-twentieth century. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing to the present day, composers such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono and Milton Babbitt have extended Schoenberg's legacy in increasingly radical directions. The major cities of the United States (e.g., Los Angeles, New York, and Boston) have had historically significant performances of Schoenberg's music, with advocates such as Babbitt in New York and the Franco-American conductor-pianist Jacques-Louis Monod. Schoenberg's students have been influential teachers at major American universities: Leonard Stein at USC, UCLA and CalArts; Richard Hoffmann at Oberlin; Patricia Carpenter at Columbia; and Leon Kirchner and Earl Kim at Harvard. Musicians associated with Schoenberg have had a profound influence upon contemporary music performance practice in the US (e.g., Louis Krasner, Eugene Lehner and Rudolf Kolisch at the New England Conservatory of Music; Eduard Steuermann and Felix Galimir at the Juilliard School). In Europe, the work of Hans Keller, , and René Leibowitz has had a measurable influence in spreading Schoenberg's musical legacy outside of Germany and Austria. His pupil and assistant Max Deutsch, who later became a professor of music, was also a conductor [...] who made a recording of three [...] "master works" [...] Schoenberg with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, released posthumously in late 2013.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Copland {{became aware that}} Stravinsky and other fellow {{composer}}s had begun to study Arnold Schoenberg's use of twelve-tone (<b>serial)</b> <b>techniques.</b> After he {{had been exposed to}} the works of French composer Pierre Boulez, he incorporated <b>serial</b> <b>techniques</b> into his Piano Quartet (1950), Piano Fantasy (1957), Connotations for orchestra (1961) and Inscape for orchestra (1967). Unlike Schoenberg, Copland used his tone rows in much the same fashion as his tonal material—as sources for melodies and harmonies, rather than as complete statements in their own right, except for crucial events from a structural point of view. From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting. He became a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U.S. and the UK and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for Columbia Records.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} style, Antoniou's earlier works hesitated at first between a simple {{atonality}} and Bartókian folklorism. He later developed <b>serial</b> <b>techniques</b> and applied them in various refined forms, which continue to characterize his works.

50|$|Papaioannou was {{the first}} {{musician}} to systematically teach atonal, 12-note and <b>serial</b> <b>techniques</b> before 1970. His compositional career falls into five main phases: Early Impressionist (1932-8), National School (1939-43), Hindemithian neo-classicism combined with elements of Byzantine music (1944-52), 12-note period (1953-1966) and the last period (1966-89) in which he developed an entirely personal technique.|$|R
5000|$|From 1963-1966 Appleton was a {{graduate}} student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon where he studied with Homer Keller, Henri Lazarof, Felix Salzer and Robert Trotter. It was there that he assembled a primitive electronic music studio and composed his first works in this genre. His thesis was an orchestral work, After [...] "Nude Descending a Staircase". Most of the instrumental and vocal music he composed at this time used <b>serial</b> <b>technique</b> that he loved to compose. During his years in Eugene he became a lifelong friend of the pianist Gabriel Chodos.|$|E
50|$|Lutyens is {{credited}} with bringing Schoenbergian <b>serial</b> <b>technique</b> (albeit her own very personal interpretation of it) to Britain. She disapproved of the 'overblown sound' of Gustav Mahler and similar composers, and instead chose to work with sparse textures and develop her own type of serialism; she first used a 12-note series in Chamber Concerto I for 9 instruments (1939), but earlier than this she had been using the techniques of inversion and retrograde fundamental to a serial idiom, and she stated she had been inspired to this by precedents she found in older British music, especially Henry Purcell.|$|E
50|$|With {{encouragement}} from Cage, Feldman {{began to write}} pieces that had no relation to compositional systems of the past, such as the constraints of traditional harmony or the <b>serial</b> <b>technique.</b> He experimented with non-standard systems of musical notation, often using grids in his scores, and specifying how many notes should be played at a certain time, but not which ones. Feldman's experiments {{with the use of}} chance in his composition in turn inspired John Cage to write pieces like the Music of Changes, where the notes to be played are determined by consulting the I Ching.|$|E
5000|$|Berl's {{music has}} innovated {{what she calls}} a Chakra form, arrived at using <b>serial</b> <b>techniques</b> and {{interval}} cycle theory connected to the Passacaglia form.

50|$|Many composers in the {{mid-twentieth century}} {{converted}} from serialism to tonality and vice versa. Bernstein’s compositions are rooted firmly in tonality, but he felt that, {{in order to be}} taken seriously, he had to draw on <b>serial</b> <b>techniques.</b> He credits this to eclecticism, which he argues is a superb twentieth century innovation and an ideal direction for music to take into the future.|$|R
2500|$|Igor Stravinsky's {{adoption}} of twelve-tone <b>serial</b> <b>techniques</b> offers {{an example of}} the level of influence that serialism had after the Second World War. Previously Stravinsky had used series of notes without rhythmic or harmonic implications [...] Because many of the basic <b>techniques</b> of <b>serial</b> composition have analogs in traditional counterpoint, uses of inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion from before the war are not necessarily indicative of Stravinsky adopting Schoenbergian techniques. However with his meeting Robert Craft and acquaintance with younger composers, Stravinsky began to consciously study Schoenberg's music, as well as the music of Webern and later composers, and began to use the techniques in his own work, using, for example, <b>serial</b> <b>techniques</b> applied to fewer than twelve notes. Over the course of the 1950s he used procedures related to Messiaen, Webern and Berg. While it is difficult to label each and every work as [...] "serial" [...] in the strict definition, every major work of the period has clear uses and references to its ideas.|$|R
