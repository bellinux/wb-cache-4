50|$|A <b>scriber</b> is a {{hand tool}} used in {{metalworking}} to mark lines on workpieces, prior to machining.

It is used instead of pencils or ink lines, because the marks are hard to see, easily erased, and inaccurate due to their wide mark; scribe lines are thin and semi-permanent. On non-coated workpieces marking blue is commonly used to increase the contrast of the mark lines.|$|E
