40|$|A brief {{overview}} is presented of Remotely Manned Systems {{with emphasis on}} their use as tools for exploration and operation in space. Remotely Manned Systems missions and functions in space are described and classified {{in relation to other}} existing or planned space systems. Problem areas of large-scale man-machine systems are identified based on experience in the Surveyor program, the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter project and the Apollo program. The effects of communication time delay on system performance are investigated using the average velocity of a Martian rover as <b>performance</b> indicator. A <b>substantial</b> <b>performance</b> increase can be achieved by providing certain autonomous capabilities to the remote system...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} is {{a technology}} for enabling green, sustainable, and autonomous wireless networks. In this paper, a large-scale wireless network with energy harvesting transmitters is considered, {{where a group}} of transmitters forms a cluster to cooperatively serve a desired receiver amid interference and noise. To characterize the link-level performance, closed-form expressions are derived for the transmission success probability at a receiver in terms of key parameters such as node densities, energy harvesting parameters, channel parameters, and cluster size, for a given cluster geometry. The analysis is further extended to characterize a network-level performance metric, capturing the tradeoff between link quality and the fraction of receivers served. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the analytical model. Several useful insights are provided. For example, while more cooperation helps improve the link-level performance, the network-level performance might degrade with the cluster size. Numerical results show that a small cluster size (typically 3 or smaller) optimizes the network-level <b>performance.</b> Furthermore, <b>substantial</b> <b>performance</b> can be extracted with a relatively small energy buffer. Moreover, the utility of having a large energy buffer increases with the energy harvesting rate {{as well as with the}} cluster size in sufficiently dense networks.

30|$|The {{study showed}} that while <b>substantial</b> <b>performance</b> {{improvements}} {{with respect to a}} conventional receiver can be achieved—ranging from 2 to 4 dB depending on packet size and LOS conditions—these benefits come at an increase in per-bit decoding running time that increases linearly with the number of performed iterations. If full convergence (i.e., best performance) is sought, decoding running time can be as much as 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of a conventional receiver. However, <b>substantial</b> <b>performance</b> improvements can be achieved also with a smaller number of iterations, especially in a rich scattering environment (NLOS scenario). Summarizing, our study clearly shows that in practical settings the trade-off between receiver complexity, running time, and performance should be carefully evaluated to strike the best compromise between these metrics.|$|R
