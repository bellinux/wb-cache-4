A case study approach based on grounded theory utilised in-depth interviews to collect data from five <b>small</b> <b>professional</b> service firms. The study found that it is worthwhile to conceive of strategy content and process in relation to <b>small</b> <b>professional</b> services firms. An emerging theory is presented.

40|$|This article {{critically}} analyses intersubjective negotiation in {{the context}} of small firm employment relationships. These employment relationships are generally acknowledged as ad hoc, contested and negotiated, producing mutual adjustment between owner-managers and employees. We present detailed qualitative empirical material from three <b>small</b> <b>professional</b> service firms and argue that explicit instances of formal or informal negotiation cannot be understood as discrete events disassociated from ongoing, everyday intersubjective negotiations. The negotiation of employment relationships, especially in ambiguity-intensive <b>small</b> <b>professional</b> service firms, frequently draws on the perception of other actors’ value or interests rather than on any direct engagement with them. This intersubjective guesswork underlying mutual adjustment is potentially dysfunctional as outcomes can arise that satisfy neither owner-manager nor employee interests. We suggest that understanding employment relationships in <b>small</b> <b>professional</b> service firms requires greater focus on individuals’ perceptions {{and the ways in which}} their relative positions are structured in intersubjective mutual (mis) recognition...|$|R
