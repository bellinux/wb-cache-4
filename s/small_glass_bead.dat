40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{interdisciplinary}} research project is to investigate the neuronal control of flying prey interception in dragonflies by designing, constructing, and programming an apparatus to simulate the complex motions of a flying insect. Our three-dimensional motion device is capable of mimicking a flying insect by moving a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> accurately up to speeds of 1 m/s. Dragonflies are highly efficient aerial predators that have the remarkable capability of intercepting and capturing small insects in flight. This complex process generally occurs in less than 300 ms, with success rates as high as 97 % 1. Prey capture behavior requires both rapid visual processing and information transmission, resulting {{in the evolution of}} large neurons in the control pathway. Eight pairs of large neurons, called Target-Selective Descending Neurons (TSDNs), are implicated in steering the interception flight. These neurons descend from the brain of the dragonfly to the wing motor regions of the thorax, transmitting visual information about prey movement. Our stimulus device will be used to determine {{the way in which the}} TSDN's encode information about object movement in three dimensions.

40|$|Mating of {{the cattle}} tick Boophilus microplus is {{mediated}} by chemical stimuli on the cuticle of females. Males are arrested on the dorsum of females attached to the host, frequently sample the substrate, and then tip-over to the ventrally located gonopore. These behaviours are also observed in vitro when males are placed on a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> treated with a female extract. Time spent and tip-over by male ticks on dummies is used in an assay to test the behavioural significance of fractions of the extract. TLC separation yields one apolar fraction that arrests males, though much less so than the whole extract, but lost tip-over behaviour. This apolar fraction contains a series of cholesteryl esters that, when tested individually, show no arrestment activity at levels present in the extract but, when combined, are as active as the fraction. When a small silica column is used for fractionation, all biological activity is reproduced after recombining the fractions. In addition to the early eluting apolar fraction containing cholesteryl esters, a set of highly active more polar fractions is isolated. Electrophysiological recordings from gustatory sensilla on the pedipalps of male B. microplus, which are regularly brought {{into contact with the}} cuticle of the female during mating, provide evidence for receptors in two of them responding to the whole extract and to the behaviourally active polar fractions. Mating behaviour involving arrestment and tip-over is clearly initiated by a mixture of chemical stimuli, and tip-over behaviour is associated with the more polar material...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{demand for the}} development of rapid and effective analytical tools to support nuclear forensic investigations of seized suspect materials to determine sample origins and ownership. New methods are sometimes simply adapted from other scientific disciplines and can be effectively used to rapidly prepare complex materials for analysis. The adaptation and re-implementation of such techniques for rapid nuclear forensic characterisation is the focus of this thesis with emphasis on geolocating uranium ore concentrates (UOC) whilst preserving as much of the original sample as possible. A rapid sample solubilisation technique was developed to overcome significant and unpredictable photon self-attenuation observed in U-bearing matrices caused by variable matrix compositions containing dense uranium-bearing particles. The technique enables collection of accurate gamma spectrometric measurements of U-bearing compounds where no photon self-absorption corrections, photon detection efficiency adjustments or sample specific matrix matching are required due to the reproducible and predictable aqueous matrix. The technique was used to prepare and measure 19 UOCs via gamma and alpha spectrometry and the data were statistically analysed by Principal Components Analysis. Half of the UOCs were statistically unique whilst the remaining samples grouped together. The UOCs were re-prepared, re-measured and incorporated into the PCA and plotted in close proximity to the original 3 D modelled data. This validates the effectiveness of the procedures to obtain accurate and reliable data and that statistical analysis of the data is able to infer possible sample origins. A second sample preparation technique was developed and tested using U-bearing samples which allows for 1. 5 mg of sample to be formed in to a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> after dilution with pure MgSiO 3 instead of using a specific flux (usually determined with prior knowledge of sample composition) and could over-dilute the sample and introduce contaminants. The glass was prepared using an iridium-strip resistive fusion device and is produced in less than 10 minutes. The resulting homogeneous flux-free bead of glass was then analysed via laser-ablation ICPMS and the rare earth element (REE) patterns were obtained for reference materials and 9 UOCs. The REEs can be used to infer UOC provenance. The patterns were convincingly similar to chondrite normalised reference values and data from chemically purified UOCs and offer a rapid and effective approach to obtaining REE data and other trace element data...|$|E
40|$|Tissue culture {{techniques}} were combined with cell separation procedures {{to investigate the}} cellular requirements for a response to antigen, leading {{to the production of}} antibody-forming cells. Mouse spleen was dissociated, and the cells were separated into various groups on the basis of density, size, and active adherence. The ability of fractions to initiate a response in vivo, on transfer to an irradiated recipient, was compared to the response in vitro; and this ability was correlated with {{the presence or absence of}} phagocytic cells. Two different antigens were studied, sheep erythrocytes (SRC) and polymerized bacterial flagellin (POL). Density distribution analysis of spleen showed a wide density range of cells responding to both antigens in vivo. The same fractions responded to POL in vitro as in vivo. By contrast, only the light density regions responded in vitro to SRC. Response occurred in regions of overlap between lymphocytes and phagocytic macrophages. Separation by active adherence on columns of large glass beads gave a preparation containing large, medium, and small lymphocytes but no detectable phagocytic macrophages and very low levels of phagocytic polymorphs. This lymphocyte preparation responded to both antigens in vivo. In vitro it gave a full response to POL, but no response to SRC. Addition of a small quantity of the adherent fraction, enriched for phagocytic cells, restored response to SRC. The use of strain-specific antisera in a mixed culture containing a C 57 phagocytic fraction and CBA lymphocytes showed that the lymphocyte fraction contributed the precursors of the final antibody-forming cells. The accessory cells from C 57 spleen banded in the light regions of the density gradient where phagocytic macrophages were found. Irradiated spleen cells also activated the lymphocyte preparation, suggesting that the irradiated host provided the accessory cells for the in vivo response to SRC. Small lymphocytes were purified from spleen by the <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> size filtration technique. This sample of small lymphocytes responded less well to POL than the total lymphocyte population, but it responded as well in vitro as in vivo. The small lymphocyte preparation responded in vivo to SRC but not in vitro. Addition of a small quantity of the phagocyte-rich fraction from adherence columns restored the in vitro response to SRC. The results indicated that phagocytic cells are not required in the initiation of an immune response to POL. By contrast some accessory cell, possibly a phagocytic macrophage, is required for a response to SRC. The basis for this marked difference is discussed...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: In {{order to}} prepare staphylococcal cell walls as free as {{possible}} from intact organisms yet with minimum chemical and mechanical degradation, a rapid turbidimetric method was developed to measure the proportion of staphylococci ruptured by shaking with <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> The assay took less than a minute, and was used to find the bacterial concentration and speed and time of shaking which gave the biggest yields of cell walk in the shortest time. When bacterial suspensions are shaken with <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> the turbidity decreases (Curran & Evans, 1942) and the viable count steadily drops according to a logarithmic law (King & Alexander, 1948).

40|$|The flow {{behaviour}} of a granular media {{is due to}} their weight, frictional contact forces between them, and external forces exerted by the walls.

When adding some wetting liquid, we introduce attractive forces between the particles, whose order of magnitude may overcome the particle weight and V-d-W interactions.

Conventional ways to isolate yeast genomic DNA utilize either <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> or enzymatic digestion to disrupt yeast cell wall. Using <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> is messy, whereas enzymatic digestion of the cells is expensive when many samples need to be analyzed. We sought to develop an easier and faster protocol than the existing methods for obtaining yeast genomic DNA from liquid cultures or colonies on plates. Results Repeated freeze-thawing of cells in a lysis buffer was used to disrupt the cells and release genomic DNA. Cell lysis was followed by extraction with chloroform and ethanol precipitation of DNA. Two hundred ng – 3 μg of genomic DNA could be isolated from a 1. 5 ml overnight liquid culture or from a large colony. Samples were either resuspended directly in a restriction enzyme/RNase coctail mixture for Southern blot hybridization or used for several PCR reactions. We demonstrated the utility of this method by showing an analysis of yeast clones containing a mutagenized human β-globin locus YAC. Conclusion An efficient, inexpensive method for obtaining yeast genomic DNA from liquid cultures or directly from colonies was developed. This protocol circumvents the use of enzymes or <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> and therefore is cheaper and easier to perform when processing large numbers of samples. </p...|$|R

Beads functioned as an important trade commodity during the Late Bronze Age, as demonstrated by their abundance aboard the Uluburun shipwreck. This Late Bronze Age shipwreck, discovered off the Turkish coast at Uluburun in 1982, dates to approximately 1300 B. C.
