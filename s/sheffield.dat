5|$|During the 1860s <b>Sheffield</b> and London {{were the}} {{dominant}} football cultures in England. However, while London was fragmented by the different codes used, by 1862 {{the rules of}} <b>Sheffield</b> F.C. had become the dominant code in <b>Sheffield.</b> Nottingham Forest adopted the <b>Sheffield</b> code in 1867 and the Birmingham and Derbyshire FAs became affiliated with <b>Sheffield,</b> adopting its code, in 1876.

5|$|<b>Sheffield</b> {{has a long}} {{sporting}} heritage.

By 1860 there were 15football clubs in <b>Sheffield,</b> with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sheffield</b> has two universities, the University of <b>Sheffield</b> and <b>Sheffield</b> Hallam University.

5|$|A poor {{supply of}} fresh water and {{dwellings}} without adequate drainage led to a cholera outbreak in the town in 1832. The Ashton Poor Law Union was established in 1837 and covered most {{of what is now}} Tameside. A new workhouse was built in 1850 which provided housing for 500 people. It later became part of Tameside General Hospital. Construction on the <b>Sheffield,</b> Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA) began in 1837 to provide passenger transport between Manchester and <b>Sheffield.</b> Although a nine-arch viaduct in Ashton collapsed in April 1845, the line was fully opened on 22 December 1845. The SA was amalgamated with the <b>Sheffield</b> and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, the Great Grimsby & <b>Sheffield</b> Railway, and the Grimsby Docks Company in 1847 to form the Manchester, <b>Sheffield</b> and Lincolnshire Railway (MS). In 1890, the MS bought the Old Hall and demolished it {{to make way for the}} construction of new sidings.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the <b>Sheffield</b> economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the <b>Sheffield</b> district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that <b>Sheffield</b> was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the <b>Sheffield</b> One redevelopment agency. The <b>Sheffield</b> economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E

5|$|Although not {{directly}} involved with <b>Sheffield</b> football, Charles Alcock {{had a major}} role in relations between the local and London associations. He acted as a go between encouraging the FA to accept rules from the <b>Sheffield</b> Rules. When the FA declined an inter-association match in <b>Sheffield</b> {{on the grounds that they}} could not play under <b>Sheffield</b> Rules it fell to Alcock to organise a team of London players to fulfil the fixture. The success of the match led to it becoming a regular event in the following years.|$|E
5|$|Coach {{services}} {{running through}} <b>Sheffield</b> are operated by National Express {{and to a}} lesser extent Megabus, part of the Stagecoach Group.

National Express services 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 call at <b>Sheffield,</b> as do others on a less frequent basis.

Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, call at <b>Sheffield</b> en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, <b>Sheffield</b> Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and <b>Sheffield</b> developed into a small town, no larger than <b>Sheffield</b> City Centre. By the 14th century <b>Sheffield</b> was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by <b>Sheffield</b> resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, <b>Sheffield</b> plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the <b>Sheffield</b> area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Brittonic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Britonnic presence within the <b>Sheffield</b> area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to <b>Sheffield.</b> The settlements that grew and merged to form <b>Sheffield,</b> however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin. In Anglo-Saxon times, the <b>Sheffield</b> area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Eanred of Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of <b>Sheffield)</b> in 829, a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.|$|E
