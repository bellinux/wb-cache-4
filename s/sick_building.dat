5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{actions against}} mould and odour in buildingsMany {{reports on the}} {{increasing}} incidence of allergies and hyper sensitivities among both adults and children - together with reports on poor indoor climate conditions, damage to buildings and poorly cared for and maintained ventilation systems - indicate a need to improve the indoor environment in many buildings. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to premises where children and young persons are present, with investigations of schools and day-care centres finding substantial shortcomings not only in design and in the choice of materials, but also in general operational care and maintenance. Residential buildings, offices and other premises also need to be renovated and improved in this respect. However, before starting to tackle the problems in a building, it is necessary to know what has caused the problems and how they should be put right. All too often, 'improvements' are carried out without knowing if they are really appropriate, or in the same way as was done originally. There is a considerable risk of failure if the underlying causes of the problem have not been carefully investigated. The report discusses various types of damage to buildings, how they should be investigated and how they can be rectified. It describes surveys of moisture-damaged buildings, how they are carried out, what measurements need to be made and how the underlying problems can be identified. It also describes the methodology of investigating <b>sick</b> <b>buildings,</b> i. e. those in which the occupants experience health and similar problems that can be linked to the building. It is often very difficult to investigate the conditions in <b>sick</b> <b>buildings,</b> as there can be many causes of the problems. Several faults or defects can often interact with conditions that are unrelated to the building, to produce problems for the occupants...|$|R

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{very common}} in modern buildings. It was originally purposed to maintain thermally comfortable environments for people inside the building. So far, human thermal comfort {{is not only the}} criteria adapted to given the control and operation of a system. Most of the commercial buildings in Sri Lanka are <b>sick</b> <b>buildings</b> and having extremely high energy consumption of 50 % to 65 % of the total power consumption for air conditioning. The main reasons to have less energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems are over selection of the equipments, poor maintenance and improper controlling. Although having over selected equipment such as chillers, pumps and air handling units of particular installation, the energy usage can be optimized by accommodating a proper control system. The objective of this research is a conceptual development for air distribution cycle in order to improve the energy saving of existing variable air volume (VAV) system while maintaining the human comfort at a highest level. This will be only a functional modification of the system (programming concept), any additional sensing elements and or controlling elements will not be required to achieve the results. Any Specialized Building Management System Contractor can use this programming concept in their system with own programming languages or functional blocks. Only the requirement is that the VAV controller shall be connected to air handling unit controller via a communication bus and the few parameters from VAV controllers shall be transmitted to the particular air handling unit (AHU) controller. Generally in VAV air distribution system, thought-out the running period of the AHU, the duct static pressure set point is constant and Variable Speed Drive will be modulated by Direct Digital Controller (DDC) {{in order to maintain the}} duct static pressure at the set point. The research describes about the concept of the duct static pressure set point to varying (resetting) according to the actual demand of the total VAV Units which are connected to the particular VAV AHU. This will be an adaptive control loop for pressure set point. At the end of the research (under the result), the actual site experimental data is given for the power consumption of "Fixed Duct Static Pressure Set Point VAV Control System" Vs "Proposed adaptive control of pressure set point VAV Control System". The conclusion and analysis of the dissertation shows 6 % of the energy saving from the adaptive control system compare to the fixed duct static pressure set point...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability in the {{workplace}} {{has the potential to}} affect many aspects of an organization, including employee productivity. Sustainable designers, such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) professionals, claim that sustainability has numerous positive impacts in {{the workplace}}. These impacts include fewer employee <b>sick</b> days, increased <b>building</b> occupant satisfaction, and increased employee productivity. Researchers that have studied this claim have found that in many cases, sustainable initiatives and buildings have had a slight to profound positive effects on occupant satisfaction, attendance, and productivity. Lower levels of satisfaction for lighting and acoustics are common, though, because many sustainable workplaces use an open floor plan design. Most of the research has focused on the structural aspect of sustainability and indoor environmental quality and its impact on employees. There is little research on how sustainable behavior initiatives {{in the workplace}} have affected employee productivity; {{there is a need for}} this gap in research to be filled. The existing research, synthesized for this paper, gives evidence that sustainable initiatives often have high return on investment not only in saving operational costs but also in improving employee productivity. Sustainability should not just be used as a tool to increase productivity, however; it is a mindset that must be adapted and incorporated into values and strategic planning. There are several guides and case studies available to give organizations ideas on how to incorporate sustainability, however, each organization is different. Employees should be involved in sustainability planning and it should relate to the organization’s strategic plan and long-term goals...|$|R
40|$|Purpose– This paper aims to {{investigate}} the benefits derived from sustainable office buildings in People’s Republic of China (PRC) through their green features, with particular reference to energy efficiency. Design/methodology/approach– A survey on operating costs, energy impacts, productivities from property managers and tenants of sustainable office buildings was conducted in Shenzhen, PRC. All survey {{data were collected from}} a portfolio of 12 sustainable office buildings and from 76 responses out of more than 400 tenants who had moved into these buildings from conventional office buildings. Findings– Most tenants were concerned with sustainable operations, practices and policies. Some of them held that sustainable office buildings contribute to higher productivity and less <b>sick</b> time. These <b>buildings</b> typically consume less electricity and water, and have higher occupancy rates and rents. Research limitations/implications– There are only 40 sustainable office buildings in Shenzhen, and our study, albeit with proper methodology, with 12 sample buildings may not reflect entirely the attitudes of tenants and property managers of sustainable office buildings in Shenzhen. Advisably, future works can be carried out on a larger scale in other main cities of PRC to obtain a more comprehensive and precise evaluation on which strategic sustainable central/local government policies might be formulated. Originality/value– The concept of facilities management on sustainable buildings, especially on their derived benefits, is relatively new in developing countries such as China. This study {{is one of the first}} attempts in this area. In addition, this paper also contributes to existing literature by looking into the green lease provisions and operating policies of these sustainable buildings.

50|$|Some {{other human}} {{diseases}} and symptoms {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} indoor bioaerosol, but no deterministic conclusions could be drawn due to the insufficiency of evidence. One example is the well-known <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> syndrome (SBS). SBS refers to non-specific complaints, such as upper-respiratory irritative symptoms, headaches, fatigue, and rash, which cannot be related to an identifiable cause but are building related. Over the last two decades, there have been many studies indicating association of indoor bioaerosol with <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> syndrome. However, most of the related studies based their conclusions on statistical correlation between concentrations of certain types of bioaerosols and incidence of complaints, which has various drawbacks methodologically. For example, some studies have a small sample size, which critically undermines the validity of speculations based on the statistical results. Also, many studies were not able to exclude the influences of other factors beside bioaerosol in their analysis, which makes the statistical correlation theoretically inappropriate to support association of SBS with bioaerosols. Additional studies revealed that bioaerosol is unlikely to be the cause of SBS. Recent epidemiological and toxicological studies continued to suggest a possible link between bioaerosol exposure and <b>sick</b> <b>building</b> syndrome, but methodological limitations remained in these studies.|$|E

Commissioner J. D. Blake announced that schools, churches, moving-pictures, and other theatres would not be closed except for individual instances. The Hospital Conference Association of Maryland disagreed and urged the Mayor to close those venues immediately. Dr. Blake said that the matter of controlling the disease was largely up to the public "because just in proportion as people realize the importance of avoiding such things as permitting members of the family to mingle promiscuously with crowds would they avoid risk of having the disease themselves and of spreading it among others" Dr. Blake deemed the disease not sufficiently fatal to stir alarm among the public or warrant closing these venues. Some schools and moving-picture theatres, however, may be closed due to unsanitary conditions and nature of the disease. Churches do not draw large crowds and do not pose such a great risk. Visiting is discouraged, in particular, to soldiers. Regulations may be put into place to prevent overcrowding of trains carrying government workers to and from camps outside the city. The Hospital Conference Association of Maryland criticized Dr. Blakes' approach and lack of initiative to contain the spread of the disease or care for patients sick at home when hospital were filled to capacity.
