5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E

He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the sky, {{coming to grips with}} what has happened.|$|E
500|$|She {{then walks}} past several people, dances with several {{men and women}} in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé as she walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him a second, then laughed, {{a thought}} unpleasantly.|$|R

2500|$|Utamaro {{depicts the}} courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya (...) as she composes a letter, writing brush held {{to her cheek}} as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the paper deep in thought.

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E

6000|$|... "She is as {{like her}} mother as possible," [...] he mused, {{as soon as he}} was clear of the house. [...] "It might have been Hilda herself, only she is twice as {{beautiful}} as Hilda was. I shall have another bad night after this, I know I shall. I must get rid of that girl somehow, I cannot bear her about me; she is a daily reminder of things I dare not remember, and whenever <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> me with those great eyes of hers, I feel as though she were looking through me. I wonder if she knows the story of Maria Lee!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah, ah, Cytherea!

[...] Wait a little, Adonis, and kiss me again, [...] For the last time, beloved,--and {{but so much}} of this [...] That the kiss may learn life from the warmth of the strain! [...] --Till thy breath shall exude from thy soul to my mouth, [...] To my heart, and, the love-charm I once more {{receiving}} [...] May drink thy love in it and keep of a truth [...] That one kiss in the place of Adonis the living. [...] Thou fliest me, mournful one, fliest me far, [...] My Adonis, and seekest the Acheron portal,-- [...] To Hell's cruel King goest down with a scar, [...] While I weep and live on like a wretched immortal, [...] And follow no step! O Persephoné, take him, [...] My husband!--thou'rt better and brighter than I, [...] So all beauty flows down to thee: I cannot make him [...] Look up at my grief; there's despair in my cry, [...] Since I wail for Adonis who died to me--died to me-- [...] Then, I fear thee!--Art thou dead, my Adored? [...] Passion ends like a dream in the sleep that's denied to me, [...] Cypris is widowed, the Loves seek their lord [...] All the house through in vain. Charm of cestus has ceased [...] With thy clasp! O too bold in the hunt past preventing, [...] Ay, mad, thou so fair, to have strife with a beast!" [...] Thus the goddess wailed on--and the Loves are lamenting.|$|E
