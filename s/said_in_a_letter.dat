25|$|The battle {{led to a}} {{temporary}} collapse of Mercian power. Penda's son Peada, who had converted to Christianity at Repton in 653, succeeded his father as king of Mercia; Oswiu set up Peada as an under-king; but {{in the spring of}} 656 he was murdered and Oswiu assumed direct control of the whole of Mercia. A Mercian revolt in 658 threw off Northumbrian domination and resulted in the appearance of another son of Penda, Wulfhere, who ruled Mercia as an independent kingdom (though he apparently continued to render tribute to Northumbria for a while) until his death in 675. Wulfhere initially succeeded in restoring the power of Mercia, but the end of his reign saw a serious defeat by Northumbria. The next king, Æthelred, defeated Northumbria in the Battle of the Trent in 679, settling once and for all the long-disputed control of the former kingdom of Lindsey. Æthelred was succeeded by Cœnred, son of Wulfhere; both these kings became better known for their religious activities than anything else, but the king who succeeded them in 709, Ceolred, is <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> of Saint Boniface to have been a dissolute youth who died insane. So ended the rule of the direct descendants of Penda.|$|E

500|$|When Blackman {{was sentenced}} to life {{imprisonment}} with a tariff of 10 years, General Sir Nick Houghton called his actions a [...] "heinous crime" [...] and commented that [...] "murder is murder". By contrast, Blackman's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Simon Chapman, 42 Commando, <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> read to the court that Blackman had had a [...] "momentary ... lapse of judgment" [...] and was [...] "not a bad man", and added that Blackman had his [...] "full support".

500|$|Thanks to Garrow's {{political}} connections, he {{was made}} first Solicitor General and then Attorney General for the Prince of Wales in 1806 and 1807; he was recommended by Erskine, who <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to the Prince that [...] "he knows more of the real justice and policy of everything connected with the criminal law than any man I am acquainted with". In 1812 he prosecuted Leigh Hunt for seditious libel against the Prince Regent; thanks to his work, Hunt was found guilty, reversing the judgment of an 1811 trial {{in which he had}} been acquitted.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{remained}} {{committed to}} the Iraq War, but said in June 2007 that he would learn from the mistakes made in Iraq. Brown <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> published on 17 March 2008 that the UK would eventually hold an inquiry into the war. The Iraq Inquiry was announced on 15 June 2009; Brown {{said that it would}} investigate the UK's role in the Iraq War and would be held in camera, a decision which was subsequently changed. Brown stated, [...] "no British documents and no British witness will be beyond the scope of the inquiry". The announcement and nature of the inquiry were widely criticised. David Cameron dismissed the inquiry as [...] "an establishment stitch-up", and the Liberal Democrats threatened a boycott. The open sessions of the inquiry began on 24 November 2009 and were televised from the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre.|$|E
