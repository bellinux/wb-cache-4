40|$|Efficient {{methods of}} content {{characterization}} for the browsing, retrieval or filtering of {{vast amount of}} digital video content has become a necessity. Still, there is {{a gap between the}} computationally available measures of content characteristics and the semantic interpretations of these characteristics. We want to establish connections between motion activity characteristics of video segments and the semantic characterization of them. For this purpose, two <b>simple</b> <b>descriptors</b> for motion activity of a video content is used to infer high-level semantic features of video in certain contexts. One of these descriptors, monotonous activity, is defined as the average block-based motion vector magnitude. The second descriptor, nonmonotonous activity, is an approximation to the average temporal derivative of motion vectors. Simulation results for browsing and retrieval applications show that by using the two measures together, object motions that occur close to the camera can be distinguished from distant ones. Also by using the two descriptors together, we are able to differentiate between a high activity due to camera motion and a high activity due to dancing people. Hence, these <b>simple</b> <b>descriptors,</b> especially when used to complete each other, promise to provide important clues about semantics of a video. 1...|$|R

40|$|Local {{descriptor}} {{methods are}} widely used in computer vision to compare local re-gions of images. These descriptors are often extracted relative to an estimated scale and rotation to provide invariance up to similarity transformations. The estimation of rotation and scale in local neighborhoods (also known as steering) is an imperfect pro-cess, however, and can produce errors downstream. In this paper, we propose an alter-native to steering that we refer to as match-time covariance (MTC). MTC is a general strategy for descriptor design that simultaneously provides invariance in local neighbor-hood matches together with the associated aligning transformations. We also provide a general framework for endowing existing descriptors with similarity invariance through MTC. The framework, Similarity-MTC, is simple and dramatically improves accuracy. Finally, we propose NCC-S, a highly effective descriptor based on classic normalized cross-correlation, designed for fast execution in the Similarity-MTC framework. The surprising effectiveness of this very <b>simple</b> <b>descriptor</b> suggests that MTC offers fruitful research directions for image matching previously not accessible in the steering based paradigm. ...|$|E

The proposed scheme generates a stack of images without using any segmentation threshold. The stack of images is hierarchically ordered in a uniformity tree.

30|$|Seek {{different}} evidence when characterizing visual data. There is no {{silver bullet}} {{to solve all}} problems—especially when describing images. Different problems often demand different forms of image description. However, even within a single problem, {{it is hard to}} think of a <b>simple</b> <b>descriptor</b> that captures all the nuances and cues present in an image. Consider the example of content-based image retrieval. Using a color descriptor is not enough to capture all possible class variability. Including other complementary features, such as shape and texture, is key for a successful retrieval system. In a remote-sensing image-classification system, the RGB color channels are just one way to capture image information. Infrared channels can also play an important role, and each channel can have its own custom-tailored descriptors. Therefore, we recommend thinking of possible complementary features when dealing with visual problems, along with innovative ways for combining them. Sometimes what seems unsolvable using just one piece of visual evidence becomes much easier when considering evidence from different and complementary features and sensors.|$|E

In almost all cases, we find a universal linear relation between the Li-C binding energy and the work required to fill previously unoccupied electronic states within the substrate.

Objective To develop a computer-aided procedure that allows recognition of emphysema on digital chest radiography by using <b>simple</b> <b>descriptors</b> of the lung shape. The procedure was tested against CT. Methods Patients (N= 225), {{who had undergone}} postero-anterior and lateral digital chest radiographs and CT for diagnostic purposes, were studied and divided in a derivation (N= 118) and in a validation sample (N= 107). CT images were scored for emphysema using the picture-grading method. <b>Simple</b> <b>descriptors</b> that measure the bending characteristics of the lung profile on chest radiography were automatically extracted from the derivation sample, and applied to train a neural network to assign a probability of emphysema between 0 and 1. The diagnostic performance of the procedure was described by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results AUC was 0. 985 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 965 to 0. 998) in the derivation sample, and 0. 975 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 936 to 0. 998) in the validation sample.

40|$|Visual {{discrimination}} {{tasks are}} increasingly used {{to explore the}} neurobiology of vision in rodents, but it remains unclear how the animals solve these tasks: Do they process shapes holistically, or by using low-level features such as luminance and angle acuity? In the present study we found that when discriminating triangles from squares, rats did not use shape but instead relied on local luminance differences in the lower hemifield. A second experiment prevented this strategy by using stimuli-squares and rectangles-that varied in size and location, and for which the only constant predictor of reward was aspect ratio (ratio of height to width: a <b>simple</b> <b>descriptor</b> of "shape"). Rats eventually learned to use aspect ratio but only when no other discriminand was available, and performance remained very poor even at asymptote. These results suggest that although rats can process both dimensions simultaneously, they do not naturally solve shape discrimination tasks this way. This may reflect either a failure to visually process global shape information or a failure to discover shape as the discriminative stimulus in a simultaneous discrimination. Either way, our results suggest that simultaneous shape discrimination {{is not a good}} task for studies of visual perception in rodents...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} {{performance of a}} three-step strategy proposed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Group for discriminating between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Methods: This was a prospective observational study, performed at two tertiary-care university hospitals, of women diagnosed with an adnexal mass on transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound between December 2012 and December 2014. Women were scheduled for an ultrasound evaluation, which was initially performed by non-expert examiners. The examiner had to classify the mass using ‘simple descriptors’ (first step) and, if not possible, using ‘simple rules’ (second step). For inconclusive masses, an expert examiner classified the mass according to their subjective impression (third step). Masses were managed expectantly, with serial follow-up examinations, or surgically, according to ultrasound findings and clinical symptoms. Histology {{was used as the}} reference standard. Masses that were managed expectantly with at least 1 year of follow-up were considered as benign for analytical purposes. Women with less than 1 year of follow-up {{were not included in the}} study. Results: Six hundred and sixty-six women were included (median age, 41 (range, 18 – 81) years) of whom 514 were premenopausal and 152 were postmenopausal. Based on the three-step strategy, 362 women had surgical removal of the mass (53 malignant and 309 benign), 71 masses resolved spontaneously and 233 persisted. Four hundred and forty-eight (67. 3 %) of 666 masses could be classified using <b>simple</b> <b>descriptors</b> and, of the 218 that could not, 147 (67. 4 %) were classified using simple rules. Of the remaining 71 masses, the expert examiner classified 45 as benign, 12 as malignant and 14 as uncertain. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of the three-step strategy were 94. 3 %, 94. 9 %, 18. 6 and 0. 06, respectively. Conclusion: The IOTA three-step strategy, based on the sequential use of <b>simple</b> <b>descriptors,</b> <b>simple</b> rules and expert evaluation, performs well for classifying adnexal masses as benign or malignant.
