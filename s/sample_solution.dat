25|$|The {{absorbance}} {{measured by}} the Spectronic 20 {{is the sum of}} the absorbance of each of the constituents of the solution. Therefore, the Spectronic 20 can be used to analyze more complex solutions. For example, if a <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> has two light-absorbing compounds in it, then the user performs measurements at two different wavelengths and constructs standard curves for each compound. Then the concentration of each compound can be calculated algebraically.|$|E
25|$|How {{the sample}} and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the sample probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the sample probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the sample probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be deposited on the surface of the sample probe in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the sample on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the sample probe to allow the matrix to condense around the sample.|$|E
25|$|Paper {{chromatography}} is {{a technique}} that involves placing a small dot or line of <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a great}} {{demand for}} standardising {{biodiversity}} assessments {{in order to allow}} optimal comparison across research groups. For invertebrates, pitfall or flight-interception traps are commonly used, but <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> differs widely between studies, which could influence the communities collected and affect sample processing (morphological or genetic). We assessed arthropod communities with flight-interception traps using three commonly used <b>sampling</b> <b>solutions</b> across two forest types and two vertical strata. We first considered the effect of <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> and its interaction with forest type, vertical stratum, and position of sampling jar at the trap on sample condition and community composition. We found that samples collected in copper sulphate were more mouldy and fragmented relative to other solutions which might impair morphological identification, but condition depended on forest type, trap type and the position of the jar. Community composition, based on order-level identification, did not differ across <b>sampling</b> <b>solutions</b> and only varied with forest type and vertical stratum. Species richness and species-level community composition, however, differed greatly among <b>sampling</b> <b>solutions.</b> Renner solution was highly attractant for beetles and repellent for true bugs. Secondly, we tested whether <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> affects subsequent molecular analyses and found that DNA barcoding success was species-specific. Samples from copper sulphate produced the fewest successful DNA sequences for genetic identification, and since DNA yield or quality was not particularly reduced in these samples additional interactions between the solution and DNA must also be occurring. Our results show that the choice of <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> should be an important consideration in biodiversity studies. Due to the potential bias towards or against certain species by Ethanol-containing <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> we suggest ethylene glycol as a suitable <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> when genetic analysis tools are to be used and copper sulphate when focusing on morphological species identification and facing financial restrictions in biodiversity studies...|$|R

25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} sample preparation. One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} electrospray ionization (EESI). This method involves having an electrospray of solvent directed at an angle against a different spray of the <b>sample</b> <b>solution,</b> produced by a separate nebulizer. This method requires no sample preparation in that the electrospray of solvent extracts the sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which involves directing an electrospray at a surface with the sample deposited on top of it. The sample is ionized in the electrospray as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important {{because of the fact}} that no sample preparation is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few of the negative matrix effects experienced by ESI due to the fact that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing the effect of the matrix on the ionization process.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of {{salt in the}} sample is a factor {{that needs to be}} considered when preparing a MALDI sample as well. Salts can aid a MALDI spectra by preventing aggregation or precipitation while stabilizing the sample. However, interfering signals can be observed due to side reactions of the matrix with the sample, such {{as in the case of}} the matrix interacting with alkali metal ions which can impair the analysis of the spectra. Typically the amount of salt in the matrix only becomes a problem in very high concentrations, such as 1 molar. The problem of having too high a {{concentration of}} salt in the sample can be solved by first running the solution through liquid chromatography to help purify the sample, but this method is time consuming and results in the loss of some of the sample to be analyzed. Another method is focused on purification once the <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> is deposited onto the sample probe. Many sample probes can be designed to have a membrane on the surface that can selectively bind the sample in question to the probe surface. The surface can then be rinsed off to remove all unnecessary salts or background molecules. The matrix of appropriate salt concentration can then be deposited directly onto the sample on the probe surface and crystallized there. Despite these negative effects of salt concentration, a separate desalting step is usually not necessary in the case of proteins, because the selection of appropriate buffer salts prevents the occurrence of this problem.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive photocell is installed.|$|E
2500|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) is {{a technique}} that involves using high voltages to create an electrospray, or a fine aerosol created by the high voltages. ESI sample preparation can be very important {{and the quality of}} results can be heavily determined by the characteristics of the sample. ESI experiments can be run on-line or off-line. In on-line measurements the mass spectrometer is connected to a liquid chromatograph and as the samples are separated they are ionized into the mass spectrometer by the ESI system; sample preparation is actually performed before the LC separation. In off-line measurements, the analyte solution is applied directly to the mass spectrometer by a spray capillary [...] Off-line sample preparation has many considerations, such as the fact that the capillary used allows for the application of volumes in the nanoliter range, which can contain a concentration too small for analysis of many compounds, such as proteins. An additional problem can be loss of ESI signal due to interference between the analyte sample and background components. Unfortunately, {{it has been shown that}} sample preparation itself can only slightly alleviate this problem which is due more to the nature of the analyte itself than the preparation. In ESI the principle problem comes not from reactions in the gas phase but rather from problems involving the solution phase of the droplets themselves. Issues can be due to non-volatile substances remaining in the drops, which can change the efficiency of droplet formation or droplet evaporation, which in turn affects the amount of charged ions in the gas phase that ultimately reach the mass spectrometer. These problems can be fixed in multiple ways, including increasing the amount of concentration of analyte compared to matrix in the <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> or by running the sample through a more extensive chromatographic technique before analysis. An example of a chromatographic technique that can aid in signal in ESI involves using 2-D liquid chromatography, or running the sample through two separate chromatography columns, giving better separation of the analyte from the matrix.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{hard clam}} (meretrix lusoria) {{cultivated}} {{industry has been}} developed vigorously for recent years in Taiwan, and seawater quality determines the cultivated environment. The pH concentration variation affects survival rate of meretrix lusoria immediately. In order to monitor seawater quality, solid-state sensing electrode of ruthenium-doped titanium dioxide (TiO 2 :Ru) is developed to measure hydrogen ion concentration in different cultivated solutions. Because the TiO 2 :Ru sensing electrode has high chemical stability and superior sensing characteristics, thus it is applied as a pH sensor. Response voltages of TiO 2 :Ru sensing electrode are readout by instrument amplifier in different <b>sample</b> <b>solutions.</b> Mean sensitivity and linearity of TiO 2 :Ru sensing electrode are 55. 20 mV/pH and 0. 999 from pH 1 to pH 13, respectively. We expect that the TiO 2 :Ru sensing electrode {{can be applied to}} real environment measurement, therefore we collect two <b>sample</b> <b>solutions</b> by different meretrix lusoria cultivated ponds in the Yunlin, Taiwan. The two <b>sample</b> <b>solutions</b> are both measured for 200 seconds after calibration of standard pH buffer solutions (pH 7, pH 8 and pH 9).
