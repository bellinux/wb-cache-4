5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E

Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park and move on to newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park's location.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, {{a reference to the}} energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Shaw and Crompton is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Shaw and Crompton had {{a railway}} line and station between 1863 and 2009, opened initially for haulage, but later used for passenger and commuter journeys. Shaw and Crompton railway station {{was used by}} passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the Oldham Loop Line. After initially being rejected in the early 2000s, plans to turn the line into part of the light-rail Metrolink system were accepted by the government on 6 July 2006. Shaw and Crompton railway station closed on 3 October 2009, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> converted from use with heavy rail to Metrolink.

5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base instead with a timed radiation pulse <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used against the Reapers. After deciding {{the fate of the}} base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, May 25, 1941, {{ground was}} broken for Mount St. Peter Church. The event was celebrated by the priests of St. Peter's {{congregation}} and about two thousand {{people showed up}} to watch. The cornerstone was blessed on Sunday, September 7, 1941, by Reverend Alfred Koch, who was the Arch Abbot of St. Vincent in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Many other priests from the area were also present. Father Paul Tomlinson of St. Peter's Church in Pittsburgh delivered the sermon in English and Archabbot Koch closed the ceremony with the Pontifical Benediction in Italian. The large red cornerstone was made of granite and was fitted with an iron box. The box contained the memorial reports of the congregation, newspapers, American and Papal coins, and medals of the church. The cornerstone was placed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen from inside the church. It is located by the altar of the Sacred Heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E

5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
