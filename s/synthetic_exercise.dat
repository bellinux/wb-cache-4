This {{was established by}} way of bi-nation project arrangements, between the United States and each of Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and the Netherlands. Australian participation in the project resulted {{in the conduct of}} three demonstration coalition synthetic training events throughout 2001 and 2003. Development of a persistent and effective in-port and ashore training capability between the Royal Australian Navy and USN was the desired end-state of the CReaMS project arrangement.

Our objective is to evaluate the accuracy of analytical models {{of this type of}} system, and in particular to identify the principal sources of error in the modelling of the coherency protocol. The analytical model first derives equilibrium cache line state probabilities which are then used to determine the expected long term message traffic generated by each coherency operation.

40|$|The {{ensemble}} Kalman filter (EnKF) is {{coupled with}} upscaling {{to build an}} aquifer model at a coarser scale than the scale at which the conditioning data (conductivity and piezometric head) had been taken {{for the purpose of}} inverse modeling. Building an aquifer model at the support scale of observations is most often impractical since this would imply numerical models with many millions of cells. If, in addition, an uncertainty analysis is required involving some kind of Monte Carlo approach, the task becomes impossible. For this reason, a methodology has been developed that will use the conductivity data at the scale at which they were collected to build a model at a (much) coarser scale suitable for the inverse modeling of groundwater flow and mass transport. It proceeds as follows: (1) Generate an ensemble of realizations of conductivities conditioned to the conductivity data at the same scale at which conductivities were collected. (2) Upscale each realization onto a coarse discretization; on these coarse realizations, conductivities will become tensorial in nature with arbitrary orientations of their principal components. (3) Apply the EnKF to the ensemble of coarse conductivity upscaled realizations in order to condition the realizations to the measured piezometric head data. The proposed approach addresses {{the problem of how to}} deal with tensorial parameters, at a coarse scale, in ensemble Kalman filtering while maintaining the conditioning to the fine-scale hydraulic conductivity measurements. We demonstrate our approach in the framework of a <b>synthetic</b> worth-of-data <b>exercise,</b> in which the relevance of conditioning to conductivities, piezometric heads, or both is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{interests have}} renewed {{the need for}} developing new sub basalt imaging techniques. One {{of the most important}} problems encountered today is seismic imaging below basalt. In recent years, this problem appears to have been overcome partly by using long offset seismic data. However near offset data are yet to be fully utilised due to the complex waveform caused by the surface as well as internal heterogeneity of the basalts. The near normal incidence data, which influence the sub-basalt imaging, are highly useful to understand the internal structure within a basalt layer. The use of converted waves for such targets has been proposed as an alternative in a rather homogeneous basalt layer. With a few <b>synthetic</b> modelling <b>exercises</b> here we highlight the practical difficulties in dealing with more realistic and heterogeneous basalt flow. Full waveform seismograms are computed to understand the effects of intra-trappean sediments on the seismic data. A case study from the Deccan Traps of India is presented in this paper. First, we discuss the effects of intercalated sediments on the overall seismic image. Later, the sonic log data from the field are used to compute the full wave-field response using the reflectivity method and compared with the field data. The feasibility of using mode converted waves (P to S and vice-versa at the top and bottom basalt interfaces) for sub-basalt imaging in Kutch region is discussed through a series of velocity-depth profiles. By comparing with the field data we demonstrate that the effects of multiple thin layering within the basalt can strongly deteriorate the image we seek to interpret and exploit. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{underground}} repositories to storage high level radioactive waste {{is based on}} the multi barrier concept that consists of placing natural and artificial barriers around the radioactive material for isolation. The artificial barrier is commonly made of expansive clay (e. g. bentonite) that is subjected to heating and hydration resulting in Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) coupled phenomena. Experimental evidence has shown an important reduction in the hydration rate of the clay at advanced stages of infiltration tests under non-isothermal conditions. Traditional models have had problems to properly reproduce the hydraulic behavior observed in some experiments, overestimating the hydration rate and underestimating the time required to reach fully saturation conditions. This thesis presents THM modeling of the FEBEX bentonite based on a mathematical framework suitable for problems in low permeability media. In addition, phenomena not included in traditional models like the threshold hydraulic gradient, thermo-osmosis and double structure are incorporated in the proposed framework to explain the reduction in the hydration rate. In order to assess the performance of the models, infiltration laboratory tests performed under isothermal and non isothermal conditions and the mock-up large scale test carried out by CIEMAT, are presented. Additionally, a <b>synthetic</b> in-situ <b>exercise</b> sponsored by the eFEBEX project to study the THM evolution of a full scale bentonite buffer under typical repository conditions is also discussed. All numerical simulations were carried out with the finite element program CODE_BRIGHT and divided into four cases: a reference case, (based on the standard THM formulation) and the other three correspond to advance model incorporating the following phenomena: the threshold hydraulic gradient, thermo-osmosis and double structure effects. The models incorporated in the existing THM formulation enable the improvement of numerical predictions of the experimental data obtained from the infiltration tests and mock-up experiment by reproducing the reduction in the hydration rate inside the bentonite. It has been observed that the double structure model that considers the two dominant pore levels and material fabric changes in the FEBEX bentonite provided a more satisfactory reproduction of the long-term experimental results...|$|R

JSAF is the core simulation engine of the Navy Continuous Training Environment, which is used to connect simulations and live units to conduct Fleet <b>Synthetic</b> Training (FST) <b>exercises.</b> There were three major steps to the methodology of this research. First, a task analysis of P- 3 pucksters was conducted by interviewing subject matter experts and observing training exercises. Next, the proper mode of interfacing with JSAF was determined by weighing {{the pros and cons of}} several methods. Finally, an adaptive sonobuoy placement behavior was developed and implemented in JSAF. The behavior was successfully implemented in a local JSAF terminal and preliminary tests showed a significant potential for reducing the workload of JSAF operators. It is recommended that the adaptive sonobuoy behavior be fully developed and implemented in JSAF and this methodology be used to automate further behaviors in JSAF, which will lead to reduced manning requirements for FST exercises.

40|$|Purpose: We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} aminoacidemia caused by the consumption of a rapidly digested protein after resistance exercise enhances muscle protein synthesis (MPS) more than the amino acid (AA) profile associated with a slowly digested protein. Here, we investigated whether differential feeding patterns of a whey protein mixture commencing before exercise affect postexercise intracellular signaling and MPS. Methods: Twelve resistance-trained males performed leg resistance exercise 45 min after commencing each of three volume-matched nutrition protocols: placebo (PLAC, artificially sweetened water), BOLUS (25 g of whey protein + 5 g of leucine dissolved in artificially sweetened water; 1 × 500 mL), or PULSE (15 × 33 -mL aliquots of BOLUS drink every 15 min). Results: The preexercise rise in plasma AA concentration with PULSE was attenuated compared with BOLUS (P less than  0. 05); this effect was reversed after exercise, with two-fold greater leucine concentrations in PULSE compared with BOLUS (P less than  0. 05). One-hour postexercise, phosphorylation of p 70 S 6 Kthr 389 and rpS 6 ser 235 / 6 was increased above baseline with BOLUS and PULSE, but not PLAC (P less than  0. 05); furthermore, PULSE greater than BOLUS (P less than  0. 05). MPS throughout 5 h of recovery was higher with protein ingestion compared with PLAC (0. 037 ± 0. 007), with no differences between BOLUS or PULSE (0. 085 ± 0. 013 vs. 0. 095 ± 0. 010 %·h- 1, respectively, P = 0. 56). Conclusions: Manipulation of aminoacidemia before resistance exercise via different patterns of intake of protein altered plasma AA profiles and postexercise intracellular signaling. However, {{there was no difference}} in the enhancement of the muscle protein <b>synthetic</b> response after <b>exercise.</b> Protein sources producing a slow AA release, when consumed before resistance exercise in sufficient amounts, are as effective as rapidly digested proteins in promoting postexercise MPS...|$|R
40|$|File system {{benchmarking}} {{plays an}} essential part in assessing the file system’s performance. It is especially difficult to measure and study the file system’s performance as it deals with several layers of hardware and software. Furthermore, different systems have different workload characteristics so while a file system may be optimized based on one given workload it might not perform optimally based on other types of workloads. Thus, {{it is imperative that}} the file system under study be examined with a workload equivalent to its production workload to ensure that it is optimized according to its usage. The most widely used benchmarking method is synthetic benchmarking due to its ease of use and flexibility. The flexibility of synthetic benchmarks allows system designers to produce a variety of different workloads that will provide insight on how the file system will perform under slightly different conditions. The downside of synthetic workloads is that they produce generic workloads that {{do not have the same}} characteristics as production workloads. For instance, synthetic benchmarks do not take into consideration the effects of the cache that can greatly impact the performance of the underlying file system. In addition, they do not model the variation in a given workload. This can lead to file systems not optimally designed for their usage. This work enhanced synthetic workload generation methods by taking into consideration how the file system operations are satisfied by the lower level function calls. In addition, this work modeled the variations of the workload’s footprint when present. The first step in the methodology was to run a given workload and trace it by a tool called tracefs. The collected traces contained data on the file system operations and the lower level function calls that satisfied these operations. Then the trace was divided into chunks sufficiently small enough to consider the workload characteristics of that chunk to be uniform. Then the configuration file that modeled each chunk was generated and supplied to a synthetic workload generator tool that was created by this work called FileRunner. The workload definition for each chunk allowed FileRunner to generate a synthetic workload that produced the same workload footprint as the corresponding segment in the original workload. In other words, the <b>synthetic</b> workload would <b>exercise</b> the lower level function calls in the same way as the original workload. Furthermore, FileRunner generated a synthetic workload for each specified segment in the order that they appeared in the trace that would result in a in a final workload mimicking the variation present in the original workload. The results indicated that the methodology can create a workload with a throughput within 10 % difference and with operation latencies, with the exception of the create latencies, to be within the allowable 10 % difference and in some cases within the 15 % maximum allowable difference. The work was able to accurately model the I/O footprint. In some cases the difference was negligible and in the worst case it was at 2. 49 % difference...|$|R
40|$|Sarcopenia or the {{involuntary}} age associated {{muscle wasting}} {{starts in the}} fourth decade of life and accelerates markedly from the fifth decade. This gradual loss of muscle mass eventually results in an inability of older people to carry out simple daily tasks, instability, is {{associated with an increased}} risk of falls and fractures, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. As the number of older people is growing steadily in our society, this in turn places an increasing burden on health care resources, making the topic of sarcopenia and its consequences an important area for research. Resistance exercise and protein enriched feeding are potent stimulators of MPS and act synergistically to increase the MPS; however, the muscle protein synthetic responses to amino acids are blunted in the elderly in the resting state. Leucine {{has been shown to be}} the most potent branched-chain amino acid acting as a signal for accelerating MPS in the resting state. How intensity and duration of resistance exercise can affect MPS and anabolic signalling in the elderly is less well understood. Can leucine enriched protein supplementation coupled with resistance exercise rejuvenate the MPS responses in the elderly? We aimed to answer these questions. The results revealed a sigmoidal dose-response relationship between exercise intensity and the stimulation of MPS in the post absorptive state, with little increase from 20 - 40 % 1 RM, then a bigger rise at 60 % of 1 RM with no significant further increase up to 90 % 1 RM in both the young and the elderly. Both groups showed quantitatively similar increases in phosphorylation of both p 70 s 6 K and 4 E-BP 1, which were maximal for exercise at 60 - 90 % 1 RM at 1 h post exercise, i. e. just before the maximal increase in MPS. However, older men demonstrated a blunted rise in MPS and anabolic signalling activity after exercise, suggesting a general pattern of a reduced protein <b>synthetic</b> response to <b>exercise</b> in the elderly. This may explain, in part the mechanisms through which muscle is lost gradually with ageing. Increasing exercise volume from 3 to 6 sets at 40 % and 75 % 1 RM produced no additional MPS responses in post absorptive young men; however, in older men, it resulted in enhanced MPS and p 70 S 6 K responses at both intensities, suggesting that the muscle of older men requires a greater volume of exercise to activate the protein synthetic machinery sufficiently to achieve synthetic responses comparable to those seen in younger men. Exercise, irrespective of intensity and volume caused only short term stimulation in MPS (returned to basal level at 4 h post exercise) in the post absorptive state. Leucine supplementation to protein feeding after resistance exercise appeared to overcome age-related anabolic blunting of responses of myofibrillar protein synthesis and p 70 S 6 K phosphorylation in skeletal muscle of older men by rejuvenating their synthetic responses. In summary, the results gave a clear indication as to the likely optimal exercise intensity and volume of acute resistance exercise (6 sets of 8 - 10 reps at 75 % 1 RM) coupled with optimal amino acid supplementation (leucine supplemented drink containing about 20 g of protein) required to effectively stimulate MPS and anabolic signalling in the elderly for maintenance of muscle mass. This work helps shed light on the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and suggests strategies that could be used to develop effective countermeasures to counteract sarcopenia.
