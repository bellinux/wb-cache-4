5|$|After much speculation, {{head coach}} Phil Jackson {{returned}} for the 2010–11 season. In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets {{in the first}} round. But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second round. After the season, {{it was announced that}} Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.|$|E

50|$|Although the Spurs had home-court {{advantage}} {{throughout the}} playoffs, they played more road games (9) than home games (8), as all their series were won on the road, which included back-to-back <b>sweeps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lakers and Blazers (who would meet in next year's West Finals). They won 12 straight games, and finished 15-2.|$|R
5|$|Ponsford {{had less}} success against the South Africans during their tour of Australia in 1931–32. While the Australians took a clean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test 5–0, Ponsford's highest {{score in the}} four Tests he played was 34; he totalled 97 runs {{at an average of}} 19.40. It was Bradman who {{dominated}} with the bat for Australia, scoring four centuries and 806 runs overall.|$|E
5|$|Australia's strongest ever {{performance}} in swimming {{was at the}} 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event {{for both men and}} women. This is the only time that Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.|$|E
5|$|Bolt won a third {{consecutive}} world relay {{gold medal in}} the 4 × 100 metres relay final, which made him the most successful athlete in the 30-year history of the world championships. The Jamaican team, featuring four of the top five from the 100m final were comfortable winners with Bolt reaching the finish line on his anchor leg three tenths of a second ahead of the American team anchored by Gatlin. Bolt's performances were matched on the women's side by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, meaning Jamaica took a complete <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sprint medals at the 2013 World Championships.|$|E
25|$|AprilNational Army troops under General Prout conduct large <b>sweeps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knockmealdown Mountains {{in south}} Tipperary and Waterford.

5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of his clients.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer {{replaced}} von Pohl, who {{was suffering}} from liver cancer. A week later on the 18th, Scheer hoisted his flag aboard Friedrich der Grosse. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5–7 March, with an uneventful <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hoofden. On 25–26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided Tondern, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21–22 April.|$|E
5|$|The Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams (NFC West), and New Orleans Saints (NFC West) {{finished}} the 1988 season with identical 10–6 records. Philadelphia {{was awarded the}} NFC East title due to a head-to-head <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Giants in regular season play, while Los Angeles was awarded a wild card berth based on winning percentage in NFC play. The Giants and Saints did not qualify for the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|Chicago {{began its}} {{push for a}} 'three-peat' with {{back-to-back}} <b>sweeps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers. But against the top-seeded New York Knicks, the Bulls fell behind 2–0, before winning the next two games in Chicago, tying the series. In a crucial Game 5 at Madison Square Garden, the Bulls stole a rare road victory, aided by an array of blocks on Charles Smith in the final seconds, before wrapping up the series in Game 6 at Chicago Stadium.|$|R
5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} another fruitless <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Sea in late December and, {{while trying}} to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, Monarch was accidentally rammed by Conqueror on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at the entrance and Conqueror could not avoid her. Monarch suffered moderate damage to her stern and received temporary repairs at Scapa before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.|$|E
5|$|The Queensland Rams {{were the}} first team to be {{eliminated}} from contention for the finals, after being swept four games to nil by the Victoria Aces in round 8. The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals, despite finishing the round in second position. It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided: the Aces clinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat, which combined with the New South Wales Patriots <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rams eliminated Perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Bush War (or Second Chimurenga), {{which had}} been {{underway}} at a low level since before UDI, began in earnest in December 1972 when ZANLA attacked farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The Rhodesian Security Forces mounted a strong counter-campaign {{over the next two}} years. Muzorewa re-engaged with Smith in August 1973, accepting the 1971–72 Douglas-Home terms, and the two signed a statement to that effect on 17 August. The UANC executive repudiated this in May 1974, but talks between Smith and Muzorewa continued sporadically. The RF again won a clean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 50 white seats in the July 1974 general election.|$|E

50|$|Governor Macquarie's May 1816 Proclamation ordered magistrates {{and troops}} at Sydney, Parramatta and Windsor to support {{settlers}} in driving off hostile Aboriginal people. The proclamation had <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> indemnifying soldiers and settlers against charges of murder. Serjeant Broadfoot carried out two <b>sweeps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nepean without reporting casualties in May. On his second expedition he reported meeting Magistrate Lowe {{in the field}} with a party <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 46th at Bents Basin on the Nepean.

5|$|Between March and June 1944 Raithel {{commanded}} his regiment during {{several major}} operations, including {{what may have}} been the largest anti-Partisan <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Operation Maibaum (Maypole). He was promoted to SS-Standartenführer (colonel) on 1 April 1944. Raithel led his regiment well, resulting in a serious wound in June 1944. On 11 June 1944, he was recommended for an award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross citing his leadership and courage while commanding the regiment, but it was not approved. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia between March and August 1944, the 13th SS Division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009–10 NHL season, Brodeur led the NHL in wins (45), shutouts (9), {{games played}} (77) and minutes played (4,499). He also won his fifth Jennings Trophy {{and had the}} third-best GAA in the league, leading his team to {{back-to-back}} division wins that included a 6–0 regular-season <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins. However, the Devils lost {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, losing to the seventh-seeded Flyers in five games. Brodeur had a 5–18–1 stretch to begin the 2010–11 season, as New Jersey slumped to the bottom of the NHL. Although the Devils improved in the second half of the season, they did not reach the playoffs; Brodeur recorded 23 wins and a 2.45 GAA, but had his lowest save percentage (.903) in 16 seasons.|$|E
5|$|In the Baltic, Magdeburg {{fired the}} first {{shots of the}} war against the Russians on 2 August, when she shelled the port of Libau. She participated in a series of bombardments of Russian {{positions}} until late August. On the 26th, she participated in a <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the Gulf of Finland; while steaming off the Estonian coast, she ran aground off the island of Odensholm and could not be freed. A pair of Russian cruisers appeared and seized the ship. Fifteen crew members were killed in the brief engagement. They recovered three intact German code books, one of which they passed to the British. The ability to decrypt German wireless signals provided the British with the ability to ambush German units on several occasions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland. The Russians partially scrapped Magdeburg while she remained grounded before completely destroying the wreck.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{was carried}} by the Democrats by a narrow margin, 2.556 million to 2.439 million. With Nixon's weak showing in the suburbs and Kennedy's huge two to one <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia, <b>the</b> latter's margin in the five county area was 237,000 votes.|$|R

5|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} {{three games in}} four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, Orlando Magic 4–0). They {{defeated}} the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 season. Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{first entered}} the {{motorsport}} arena in 1999 when its racing unit, Team Lexus, fielded two GS 400 race {{vehicles in the}} Motorola Cup North American Street Stock Championship touring car series. In its 1999 inaugural season, Team Lexus achieved its first victory with its sixth race at Road Atlanta. Led by Sports Car Club of America and International Motor Sports Association driver Chuck Goldsborough, based in Baltimore, Maryland, Team Lexus capitalized on the debut {{of the first generation}} Lexus IS by entering three IS 300s in the third race of the 2001 Grand-Am Cup season at Phoenix, Arizona. Team Lexus won its first IS 300 victory that year at the Virginia International Raceway. In 2002, Team Lexus' competitive efforts in the Grand-Am Cup ST1 (Street Tuner) class achieved victories in the Drivers' and Team Championships, as well as a <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top three finishes at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E
