They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If you <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry." [...] His concern has centred {{on the power of}} [...] "Islamism" [...] or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which he has tried to fight, especially {{in the wake of the}} controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.|$|E

And if I catch you and my son again in any public {{restaurant}} I will thrash you" [...] to which Wilde responded: [...] "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight". His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small {{hands in the air}} in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E

The song was recorded by Vincent Dilorenzo, with assistance from Geoff Rice, at Sony Music Studios, New York City and Zac Recording, Atlanta. Dilorenzo also mixed the record, with assistance from Matt DeSando, at Studio 609, Philadelphia. According to Josh Eells of Blender, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] was written for Tameka Foster, whom Usher married in August 2007. Composed before their engagement, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] was played at Usher and Foster's wedding, on Foster's request. The tune is an assurance of sexual fidelity and commitment. In an interview with MTV News, Usher stated, [...] "If {{you listen to the}} words , it is very heartfelt, simplistic, yet very soulful. ... It's a man's words to his woman: a vow to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the one, and I'll be there for you." [...] A slow jam soul ballad, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] has been compared to the work of Stevie Wonder by critics. It was included on Usher's fifth studio album of the same name, released on May 13, 2008 by LaFace Records.|$|E

2500|$|Xu Wen {{continued}} {{to maintain control}} of the Wu governance. [...] This led to resentment {{by a number of}} Wu's senior generals — Liu Wei (劉威) the military governor of Zhennan Circuit, Tao Ya (陶雅) the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of She Prefecture (歙州, in modern Huangshan, Anhui), Li Yu (李遇) the governor of Xuan Prefecture (宣州, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Li Jian (李簡) the prefect of Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) — each of whom had greater accomplishments and had higher standing in the army than Xu did when Yang Xingmi was alive. [...] Li Yu was particularly unhappy, often stating, [...] "Who is this Xu Wen? [...] I do not even remember his face, and now he is ruling the state!" [...] On an occasion when the officer Xu Jie was on a diplomatic mission to Wu's southeastern neighbor Wuyue, Xu Wen had Xu Jie stop by in Xuan Prefecture to try to persuade Li Yu to show submission by going to Guangling to pay homage to Yang Longyan. [...] Li Yu initially agreed, but Xu Jie inadvertently stated, [...] "If you, Lord, do not do so, people will <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> committing treason." [...] Li Yu angrily responded, [...] "You, sir, are saying that I, Li Yu, am treasonous. [...] Is it not more treasonous to murder the Shizhong ?" [...] When Xu Wen heard this, he became angry and sent the general Chai Zaiyong (柴再用), with Xu Wen's adoptive son Xu Zhigao serving as Chai's deputy, to attack Li Yu at Xuan. [...] Li Yu's initially was able to hold against Chai's attacks, but Xu Wen put Li Yu's youngest son, who was serving as an officer at Huainan headquarters, under arrest, and had him displayed at the army. [...] Xu Wen then sent the official He Rao (何蕘) to, in Yang Longyan's name, state to Li Yu: [...] "If you, Lord, are planning on rebelling, please execute He Rao to show yourself. [...] Otherwise, follow him out of the city." [...] Li Yu thus surrendered. [...] Xu Wen had Chai kill Li Yu and slaughter his household, and it was said that after this event, all the generals were fearful of Xu and did not dare to resist him further.|$|E
