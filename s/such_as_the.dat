5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by mammals <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> feral cat (Felis catus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), {{as well as}} rodent species, and native predatory birds, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), and {{reptiles}} such as goannas (Varanus spp.).|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

50|$|Some major car {{manufacturers}} <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Subaru, Mazda and Porsche offer short shifters <b>as</b> stock modifications <b>such</b> <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> Subaru WRX, Subaru WRX STI, Subaru BRZ, Mazda Miata, and <b>as</b> {{an option}} <b>such</b> <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> Porsche 911.|$|R
50|$|In larger camps (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> Auschwitz), <b>the</b> Rapportführer {{would answer}} to a Camp Adjutant SS-Officer, but in smaller camps (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> Sobibor) <b>the</b> Rapportführer worked {{directly}} for the Camp Commander and served in a type of Sergeant Major position.|$|R
5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> skyglow over German cities, or the sands of the Mediterranean front.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{depending}} {{on the model of}} the roller coaster, the track size can vary. Models <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Flying, Wing, and Dive Coaster have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Stand-Up and Hyper Coaster, do not and use a smaller sized track.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the city}} boasts big news {{agencies}} in the country, both public, as the Macedonian Information Agency, and private, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Makfax.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} is particularly active in conserving the most endangered parrot {{species in the}} world, both with captive breeding (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> with <b>the</b> critically endangered Spix's macaw) and field projects <b>as</b> well (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> with <b>the</b> equally critically endangered indigo-winged parrot).|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{regional}} and international expressions and efforts, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> by <b>the</b> UN and EU, have attempted {{to stem the tide}} of war.

5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Arctic hare, mustelids <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Arctic tern, insects <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> monarch butterfly and fish <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, new {{versions}} of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Avro Tudor, military transport aircraft <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Avro York, and the Canadair North Star which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{ordinary}} matrix multiplication just described, there exist other less frequently used operations on matrices {{that can be}} considered forms of multiplication, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Hadamard product and the Kronecker product. They arise in solving matrix equations <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Sylvester equation.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the state}} and the magnates {{supported}} the construction and renovations of several fortifications (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle).|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
