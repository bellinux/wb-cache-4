5|$|The high US {{demand for}} {{tickets for the}} tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced <b>secondary</b> <b>market.</b> Some tickets were being resold on the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them straight into the <b>secondary</b> <b>market,</b> Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E

5|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> {{started with}} comic book stores, and hobby shops {{displaying}} and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the role of {{advisory}} committees in <b>secondary</b> <b>marketing</b> education programs in Wisconsin. It was designed to answer the following questions: 1) to what extent do <b>secondary</b> <b>marketing</b> education programs in Wisconsin have advisory committees; 2) what is the marketing education advisory committee's membership makeup at the secondary level in Wisconsin; 3) what is the marketing education advisory committee's role in <b>secondary</b> <b>marketing</b> education programs in Wisconsin; 4) how are <b>secondary</b> <b>marketing</b> education advisory committees structured in Wisconsin; 5) what is the structure for <b>secondary</b> <b>marketing</b> education advisory committee meetings in Wisconsin; and 6) do the <b>secondary</b> <b>marketing</b> education advisory committees add value to the programs in Wisconsin?

5000|$|Several factors {{determine}} which games are carried in each market. Each of the 32 NFL teams is assigned a [...] "primary market." [...] Most teams {{also have a}} selected number of <b>secondary</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>markets</b> can be of any size, and are typically defined by an area where {{any part of the}} market falls within 75 miles of an NFL stadium. Small markets that have no clubs tend to strongly associate with geographically nearby or particularly relevant teams, but may fall outside of the 100-mile area are not necessarily considered <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> by the NFL.

5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the <b>secondary</b> <b>market.</b> Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the <b>secondary</b> <b>market,</b> tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|As of late 2013, Wizards of the Coast has {{expressed}} {{concern over the}} increasing number of counterfeit cards in the <b>secondary</b> <b>market.</b> Wizards of the Coast has since made an effort to counteract the rise of counterfeits by introducing a new holofoil stamp on all rare and mythic rare cards as of Magic 2015.|$|E
5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire {{allotment}} of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the <b>secondary</b> <b>market,</b> often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E
40|$|Does the {{existence}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> for durable goods affect price and allocation on primary markets? We study competitive equilibria for durable goods where the possibility of future trade on <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> does not affect consumer behaviour in the primary market, provided consumers are exponential discounters. If consumers are hyperbolic discounters, however, <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> are no longer neutral as they allow consumers to postpone their purchasing decisions. In this case, the equilibrium price in the primary market is decreasing {{in the number of}} periods in which the good can be traded. Hence, primary producers have an incentive to close down <b>secondary</b> <b>markets.</b> If <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> never close, hyperbolic discounters may use collusive intrapersonal strategies, which lead to a Pareto improvement for all incarnations of the same consumer. We characterise the set of all stationary equilibrium prices and show that the competitive equilibrium allocation may be inefficient...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{hyperbolic}} discounting on competitive equilibria in <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> for a durable good. Under exponential discounting, <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> are irrelevant in our model. They do not affect the price in the initial period and are neutral to the allocation. Under hyperbolic discounting, <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> are not neutral: they do affect price and allocation. The price in the unique competitive Markov equilibrium {{is lower than the}} price in the absence of <b>secondary</b> <b>markets.</b> This affects the equilibrium supply of the durable good in the initial period. We characterise all stationary competitive equilibria in terms of prices. In particular, we obtain that there are stationary competitive equilibria in which trade occurs in each period and the allocation of the durable good is inefficient. Furthermore, we show that there exist competitive equilibria with increasing, decreasing, and cycling price paths, despite the stationarity of the market environment. hyperbolic discounting, <b>secondary</b> <b>markets,</b> durable good, time inconsistency...|$|R
40|$|This {{descriptive}} paper {{analyzes the}} performance of the private equity <b>secondaries</b> <b>market</b> during the financial crisis 2008 - 2009, {{in order to understand the}} effective liquidity of private equity investments during this episode of market stress. We document that the <b>secondaries</b> <b>market</b> followed the development of the crisis very closely, with effective market liquidity contracting in early 2009 to only a fraction of the volume earlier, and a quick recovery afterwards that showed no signs of more protracted turbulences than the stock market. We argue that the particular form of illiquidity in the <b>secondaries</b> <b>market</b> can be best understood as the cumulative effect of behavioral and accounting-based elements. The available evidence indicates that the liquidity and the relative resilience of the <b>secondaries</b> <b>market</b> are efficient. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following {{the announcement of the}} matchup, ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices in the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> plunged.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Fannie and Freddie, the FHFA had sued UBS and 17 other banks in July 2011 over mortgage-backed {{securities}} {{sold to the}} two government-sponsored enterprises that buy mortgages in the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> and repackage them as securities to boost liquidity in the mortgage business. The lawsuit claimed that UBS misrepresented the quality of mortgages sold to the two housing agencies for US$4.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the <b>secondary</b> <b>market.</b> In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{potentially}} critical nature of <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> in maintaining efficient spectrum and wireless markets, research has {{to date has}} focused primarily on the Federal Communication Commission's rules for initial distribution of spectrum. To redress this lacuna, we first examine the evolution of conceptual and policy developments directed toward <b>secondary</b> spectrum <b>markets.</b> Then, we seek to move beyond those efforts to empirically document the development of secondary spectrum activity in the United States {{and the relationship of}} that development to the evolving policy toward such markets. We categorize and explore different types of <b>secondary</b> spectrum <b>markets.</b> Then, by drawing on a database of every spectrum license transaction since 1994, we explore the depth and breadth of spectrum trading in <b>secondary</b> <b>markets.</b> We find that the FCC has radically reduced {{the time it takes to}} approve trades, making the system more akin to notification than to approval. We also find that a large amount of spectrum changes hands each year. While these conclusions do not necessarily imply that <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> work efficiently, they do show that policy efforts to facilitate and energize the growth of <b>secondary</b> spectrum <b>markets</b> are bearing considerable fruit.

40|$|Conventional wisdom says that, in {{the absence}} of default penalties, {{sovereign}} risk destroys all foreign asset trade. We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit and extreme assumption: that assets cannot be retraded in <b>secondary</b> <b>markets.</b> Once this assumption is relaxed, foreign asset trade is possible even {{in the absence}} of default penalties. In fact, in the —also extreme — case of frictionless <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> sovereign risk does not affect foreign asset trade. Overall, the results presented in this paper suggest a broader perspective regarding the origins of sovereign risk and its remedies. Sovereign risk affects foreign asset trade only if both, default penalties are insufficient and <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> work imperfectly. To reduce the effects of sovereign risk, one can either increase default penalties or improve the workings of <b>secondary</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

Ticket sales were botched by Ticketmaster, a situation further exacerbated by revelations of their holding seats back for their <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> TicketsNow.

5|$|Tickets officially {{went on sale}} December 4, {{and three}} days later, Virginia Tech had sold out its entire initial {{allotment}} of 15,000 tickets. A second allotment of 2,400 tickets was sold out in a few hours, leaving ticketless fans disgruntled. Many fans who were turned away at the Virginia Tech ticket office bought tickets from the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> or traveled to New Orleans in hopes of buying tickets at the game. So many Virginia Tech fans traveled to the game that the Montgomery County school district extended its winter break one day to avoid a shortage of teachers and students. The crowds also caused problems at Roanoke Regional Airport, the nearest airport to Virginia Tech. Forty-three aircraft chartered by Virginia Tech fans arrived in New Orleans on a single day.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} {{endogenous}} labor movements － internal and international labor movements caused by exogenous entrants of new workers － in a two-country macroeconomic model where each country has primary and <b>secondary</b> labor <b>markets.</b> To investigate the effects of new entrants into the home country's <b>secondary</b> labor <b>market,</b> we assume that internal movement occurs between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> in each country and international movement occurs between <b>secondary</b> <b>markets</b> of both countries due to differentials of expected real consumption wages. We show that an increase of new entrants into the home country's <b>secondary</b> labor <b>market</b> increases its full employment level, even though workers of the home country's <b>secondary</b> labor <b>market</b> are moving to a foreign country's <b>secondary</b> labor <b>market</b> and to its own primary labor market.

5|$|Sparked by low-mintage {{issues which}} {{appreciated}} in value, {{the market for}} United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the <b>secondary</b> <b>market,</b> and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits {{to be made by}} purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had {{served as president of the}} American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926.|$|E
25|$|However, the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> is {{unlikely}} to have followed {{the growth of the}} primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as World of Warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading. Also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland China targeting the global <b>secondary</b> <b>market.</b> Furthermore, the global decline in consumption that followed the financial crisis of 2007–2008 would have affected the <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> negatively as well. Post 2007 <b>secondary</b> <b>market</b> growth is likely localized to emerging markets such as Russia, eastern Europe, South America, and South East Asia - all of which are relatively inaccessible to international merchants due to payment systems, advertisement channels and language barrier.
