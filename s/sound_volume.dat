25|$|The {{usual way}} of {{limiting}} <b>sound</b> <b>volume</b> on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of {{the efficiency of}} the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, high-impedance equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Canadian {{inventor}} and composer, Hugh Le Caine invented the Electronic Sackbut, a voltage-controlled electronic musical instrument {{that provided the}} earliest real-time control of three aspects of <b>sound</b> (<b>volume,</b> pitch, and timbre)—corresponding to today's touch-sensitive keyboard, pitch and modulation controllers. The controllers were initially implemented as a multidimensional pressure keyboard in 1945, then changed {{to a group of}} dedicated controllers operated by left hand in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Straight {{delay is}} used in sound {{reinforcement}} systems, a straight delay is used {{to compensate for the}} passage of sound through the air. Unlike audio delay effects devices, straight delay is not mixed back in with the original signal. The delayed signal alone is sent to loudspeakers so that the speakers distant from the stage, as in a large outdoor rock festival, will reinforce the stage sound at the same time or slightly later than the acoustic sound from the stage. The delayed signal uses approximately 1 millisecond of straight delay per foot of air or 3 milliseconds per meter, depending on the air temperature's effect on the speed of sound. Because of the Haas effect, this technique allows audio engineers to use additional speaker systems placed away from the stage and still give the illusion that all sound originates from the stage. The purpose is to deliver sufficient <b>sound</b> <b>volume</b> {{to the back of the}} venue without resorting to excessive sound volumes near the front. Straight delay is also used in audio to video synchronization to align sound with visual media (e.g., on TV or web broadcasting), if the visual source is delayed. Visual media can become delayed by a number of mechanisms or reasons, in which case the associated audio should be delayed to match the visual content.|$|E
2500|$|Poor {{sales of}} the Chime-Tones (due to the horns {{requiring}} an ample volume of air) led the Leslie Company to introduce {{a new line of}} air horns utilizing interchangeable components while using less air to produce greater <b>sound</b> <b>volume</b> than the earlier [...] "Tyfon" [...] series. Developed by Kockums, this horn utilized a back-pressure power chamber design in order to enhance diaphragm oscillation. Known as the [...] "SuperTyfon" [...] series, these horns would eventually supplant the [...] "Tyfon" [...] in railroad service.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "interactivity" [...] {{offered by}} the album/program was limited to {{controlling}} the speed and quantity of the visual effects, tuning the <b>sound's</b> <b>volume</b> and filtering, and skipping to {{any part of the}} album.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pneumatic}} siren, {{which is}} a free aerophone, consists of a rotating disk with holes in it (called a chopper, siren disk or [...] ), such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes {{on the outside of}} the unit (called a stator). As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results in alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure, i.e. sound. [...] Such sirens can consume large amounts of energy. To reduce the energy consumption without losing <b>sound</b> <b>volume,</b> some designs of pneumatic sirens are boosted by forcing compressed air from a tank that can be refilled by a low powered compressor through the siren disk.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the strings}} were {{wrapped around the}} goose feet, {{but there has been}} a device that has been invented, which is a block of wood {{attached}} to the goose feet, with pins similar to those used to tune the guzheng protruding out at the sides, so one can string and tune the qin using a tuning wrench. This is good for those who lack the physical strength to pull and add tension to the strings when wrapping the ends to the goose feet. However, the tuning device looks rather unsightly and thus many qin players prefer the traditional manner of tuning; many also feel that the strings should be firmly wrapped to the goose feet in order that the sound may be [...] "grounded" [...] into the qin and some feel that the device which covers the phoenix pond sound hole has a negative effect on the <b>sound</b> <b>volume</b> and quality.|$|E
2500|$|A male cricket [...] "sings" [...] {{by raising}} his wing covers (tegmina) above {{the body and}} rubbing their bases against each other. The wing covers of a mature male cricket have protruding, irregularly shaped veins. The scraper of the left wing cover rubs against the file of the right wing, {{producing}} a high-pitched chirp. Crickets are {{much smaller than the}} sound wavelengths that they emit, which makes them inefficient transducers, but they overcome this disadvantage by using external natural resonators. Ground-dwelling field crickets use their funnel-shaped burrow entrances as acoustic horns; [...] attach themselves to leaves which serve as soundboards and increase <b>sound</b> <b>volume</b> by 15 to 47 times. Chinese handlers increase the apparent loudness of their captive crickets by waxing the insects' tympanum with a mixture of cypress or lacebark pine tree sap and cinnabar. A legend says that this treatment was discovered in the day of the Qing Dynasty, when the Emperor's cricket, held in a cage suspended from a pine tree, was observed to develop an [...] "unusually beautiful voice" [...] after accidentally dipping its wings in tree sap.|$|E
