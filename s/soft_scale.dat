50|$|The Coccidae are {{a family}} of scale insects {{belonging}} to the superfamily Coccoidea. They {{are commonly known as}} <b>soft</b> <b>scales,</b> wax scales or tortoise scales. The females are flat with elongated oval bodies and a smooth integument which may be covered with wax. In some genera they possess legs but in others, they do not, and the antennae may be shortened or missing. The males may be alate or apterous.|$|R

50|$|Genome {{type and}} {{transmission}} vector {{are two of}} the most important traits used for classification. Ampeloviruses and Closteroviruses have monopartite genomes and are transmitted by pseudococcid mealybugs (and <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects) and aphids respectively. While Criniviruses are bipartite and transmitted by whiteflies.|$|E
50|$|The adult female {{scale insect}} is oval and dome-shaped, about 3 to 5 mm long. It retains its legs and {{antennae}} throughout its life. Its cuticle {{is made of}} chitin {{but it does not}} produce the copious quantities of wax that armoured scales do. It is a pale yellowish-brown or greenish-brown colour with brown irregular speckles, and darkens with age. Male brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects are rarely found.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{effective}} field theory techniques can be applied in the high temperature T regime of plasmas to improve {{the accuracy of the}} physics of the hard scales (or scales of order T), and as a by-product, also that of the <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> (or scales of order gT). At leading order in the coupling constant the hard scales of the plasma can be viewed as on-shell classical particles. Based on this observation, and without any reference to the state of the system, we derive an {{effective field theory}} describing the quantum fluctuations around an on-shell fermion with energy p, described as a set of high dimension operators over the on-shell energy p. When applied to systems close to thermal equilibrium, where for most on-shell particles p ~ T, we show that the on-shell effective field theory (OSEFT) properly describes the HTL photon polarization tensor of QED, and its 1 /T corrections. For the <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> the first non-vanishing power correction {{turns out to be a}} perturbative correction to the HTL result...|$|R

5000|$|Adult female stictococcids {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> in the family Coccidae. They are nearly circular, flattened dorsally and have turned up margins. The segments are conspicuous, particularly near the rim. There are small, pale coloured legs and antennae on the underside. The body is covered in setae which are longer at the periphery.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain all the {{nutrients}} they need, the scale insects ingest large quantities of sap. They then secrete the excess sugary fluid as honeydew. This is attractive to ants which often tend the scale insects, driving away predators. The brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> does not normally kill the host plant, but the loss of sap probably causes it to grow more slowly and crop less heavily. The main disadvantage to the host is the sooty mould which grows on the honeydew. This reduces the area of leaf available for photosynthesis, and spoils {{the appearance of the}} plant, its flowers and fruits.|$|E
50|$|The brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> is {{ovoviviparous}} {{and produces}} young by parthenogenesis. Over {{the course of}} her life, the female may produce up to 250 eggs, a few being laid each day. The eggs are retained inside the insect until they hatch, at which time small nymphs emerge and are brooded for a few hours before dispersing. These first-stage nymphs are known as crawlers and move a short distance from the mother before settling and starting to feed. They have piercing and sucking mouthparts and feed on the host plant's sap. They are largely sedentary {{for the rest of their}} lives and pass through two more nymphal stages before becoming adults. A generation takes about two months, and there may be three to seven generations in a year, depending on temperature. Males are occasionally produced and these pass through four nymphal stages before becoming winged adults.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> {{has been}} {{controlled}} {{by the use of}} pesticides, but these have the disadvantage that other insects, friends and foes alike, are also killed. Another approach in citrus is to eliminate ants from the trees, either by preventing the ants from climbing the trunks or by destroying their nests. This allows natural predators to flourish and keep the scale insects under control, although this may lead to an increase in the production of sooty mould. Fungicides can be used to prevent the sooty mould from taking hold. Alternatively, the use of such entomopathogenic fungi, such as Verticillium lecanii, has been successfully used under glass. An alternative approach is integrated pest management in which the natural enemies of the scale insects are encouraged. A further possibility is the use of growth regulators such as the hormone hydroprene which disrupts the moulting of juvenile scale insects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>scales</b> are {{insects in}} the family Coccidae and {{are closely related to}} armored and felt scales and mealybugs. Scales are fluid feeders with piercingsucking {{mouthparts}} that remove plant phloem or sap. Most life stages are immobile because they anchor their mouthparts into host tissue. They are difficult to control because of their waxy covering, seasonal abundance, and high fecundity...|$|R

50|$|Little is {{currently}} known about long-tailed pangolin reproduction. They {{are thought to}} mate throughout the year, with an average gestation period of roughly 140 days. Female pangolins {{give birth to a}} live, single offspring at a time. The young are born with <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> that harden within a few days.

50|$|The bigheaded ants feed on dead insects, small {{invertebrates}} and honeydew excreted by insects such as aphids, <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects, mealybugs, whiteflies and planthoppers. These sap-sucking bugs {{thrive in}} the presence of bigheaded ants, being more abundant on plants patrolled by ants than on those not so patrolled. Green scale, Coccus viridis, flourished when bigheaded ants protected their food source by removing predators such as lady beetle larvae and lepidopteran larvae. The minor workers are much more numerous than the soldiers. Trails of ants lead up trunks, along branches and into the canopies of trees and debris-covered foraging tunnels with numerous entrances are created {{on the surface of the}} ground. These may be confused with similar tubes built by subterranean termites. Foraging ants will alert others to new food sources. Honeydew is ingested but other foodstuffs are carried back to the nest by both major and minor workers who may transfer items of food between themselves. Anything too big to be moved may be dissected before being brought back to the nest.|$|E

50|$|The {{crescent}} honeyeater is arboreal, foraging mainly {{among the}} foliage and {{flowers in the}} understory and tree canopy on nectar, fruits and small insects. It has been recorded eating the honeydew of psyllids, <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> and felt scale insects. It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar, and gleaning foliage and bark and sallying for insects. While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs, the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in loose feeding flocks, and gathering in large groups at productive food sources. A study in forest near Hobart in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season, but nectar was a significant component during winter. Insects consumed include moths and flies, and the tree trunks were the site of foraging around two-thirds of the time, and foliage a third. It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter, and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) during the breeding season in spring. The flowering of royal grevillea (Grevillea victoriae) over summer in subalpine areas in the Snowy Mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters. It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath (Astroloma conostephioides) it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute. Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of Banksia species, waratah (Telopea), tubular flowered genera including Astroloma, Epacris and Correa, mistletoes of the genus Amyema, and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. In Bondi State Forest it was also recorded feeding at cluster-flower geebung (Persoonia confertiflora), native holly (Lomatia ilicifolia), tall shaggy-pea (Oxylobium arborescens), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa). Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at Adenanthos flowers {{than those in the}} nearby Fleurieu Peninsula, while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms, and at a higher diversity of plants overall.|$|E
50|$|Some ant {{species can}} {{increase}} infestations of red scale indirectly.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} the economic importance, biology, {{and management of}} soft scales, focusing on pests of agricultural, horti-cultural, and silvicultural crops in outdoor production systems and urban landscapes. We also provide summaries on voltinism, crawler emergence timing, and predictive models for crawler emergence to assist in developing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> management programs. Phloem-feeding <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> pests cause direct (e. g., injuries to plant tissues and removal of nutrients) and indirect damage (e. g., reduction in photosynthesis and aesthetic value by honeydew and sooty mold). Variations in life cycle, reproduction, fecundity, and behavior exist among congenerics due to host, environmental, climatic, and geographical variations. Sampling of <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> pests involves sighting the insects or their damage, and assessing their abundance. Crawlers of most univoltine species emerge {{in the spring and}} the summer. Degree-day models and plant phenological indicators help determine the initiation of sampling and treatment against crawlers (the life stage most vulnerable to contact insecticides). The efficacy of cultural management tactics, such as fertilization, pruning, and irrigation, in reducing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> abundance is poorly documented. A large number of parasitoids and predators attack <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> populations in the field; therefore, natural enemy conservation by using selective insecticides is important. Systemic insecticides provide greater flexi-bility in application method and timing, and have longer residual longevity than contact insecticides. Application timing of contact in-secticides that coincides with crawler emergence is most effective in reducing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> abundance...|$|E
