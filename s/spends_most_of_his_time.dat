5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct.

Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier.

500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music.

[...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You {{just have to be}} well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E
