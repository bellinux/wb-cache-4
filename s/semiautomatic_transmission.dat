5000|$|In 1942 the Mercury Eight's slender bullet {{parking lights}} were {{replaced}} with rectangular units placed {{high on the}} fenders inboard of the headlights. Running boards were now completely concealed under flared door bottoms. The instrument panel now features two identical circles for speedometer and clock with gauges {{to the left of}} the speedometer, a glove compartment to the right of the clock, and a large radio speaker cover in the center. The grille looked more like that of the Lincoln-Zephyr and Continental. The [...] "Eight" [...] script was gone but an [...] "8" [...] appeared at the top of the grille center. Horsepower was increased to 100. Mercury's biggest engineering news for 1942 was [...] "Liquamatic," [...] Ford's first <b>semiautomatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> It wasn't much of a success and Mercury wouldn't have another automatic transmission until Merc-O-Matic appeared in 1951, which was of course a true automatic. Mercury production for the short 1942 model year totaled only 1,902. Output was halted in February 1942 as American auto plants were converted to the exclusive production of war material.|$|E
