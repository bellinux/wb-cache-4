5|$|The new SuperSpeed mode {{provides}} a {{data signaling rate}} of 5.0Gbit/s. However, due to the overhead incurred by 8b/10b encoding, the payload throughput is actually 4Gbit/s, and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve only around 3.2Gbit/s (0.4GB/s or 400MB/s). However, this <b>should</b> <b>increase</b> with future hardware advances. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; earlier modes are half-duplex, arbitrated by the host.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Rolls-Royce {{announced}} that it had increased the AE-1107C engine's power by 17 percent via {{the adoption of a}} new Block 3 turbine, an increase in fuel valve flow capacity, and accompanying software updates. The upgrade <b>should</b> <b>increase</b> the reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions and boost maximum payload limitations from 6,000ft to 8,000ft. A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26 percent, producing close to 10,000hp, and improve fuel consumption.|$|E

For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too <b>should</b> <b>increase</b> under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency. Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.|$|E

5|$|While the {{remaining}} valence electrons in a singly ionized dubnium ion (Db+) organize {{themselves in a}} 6d27s2 configuration, the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms eliminate the 7s electrons, the opposite order to that of its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, however, dubnium is still expected to use five electrons as its valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db3+ {{is expected to have}} two d, rather than s, electrons remaining, the resulting oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium <b>should</b> <b>increase</b> compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry (see below).|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation of}} the sexual division of labor finds that males and females cooperate within pair bonds by targeting different foods so {{that everyone in the}} household benefits.

25|$|Secondly, {{in order}} to {{outweigh}} the aforementioned costs, mating during infertile phases <b>should</b> <b>increase</b> females' reproductive success by {{increasing the number of}} offspring produced. Current research has only investigated this factor indirectly, and it has predominantly been investigated in insects. For example, when male insects deliver material benefits in exchange for sexual access, the reproductive success of the females increases with the number of matings. It {{is important to note that}} the mating behaviour assessed was not limited to extended female sexuality. Hence, it only provides indirect support for the second prediction.|$|E
