40|$|Aims: Preconditioning of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> with aqueous cod muscle extract {{significantly}} impedes subsequent bacterial adhesion {{most likely}} due to repelling effects of fish tropomyosin. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if other food conditioning films decrease or enhance bacterial adhesion to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> Methods and Results: Attachment of Pseudomonas fluorescens AH 2 to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>coated</b> with water-soluble coatings of animal origin was significantly reduced as compared with noncoated <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>coated</b> with laboratory substrate or extracts of plant origin. Coating with animal extracts also decreases adhesion of other food-relevant bacteria. The manipulation of adhesion was not attributable to growth inhibitory effects. Chemical analysis revealed that the <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> were covered by homogenous layers of adsorbed proteins. The presence of tropomyocin was indicated by appearance of proteins with similar molecular weight based in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in several extracts that reduced adhesion but also extracts not containing this protein reduced bacterial adhesion, indicating that several molecular species may be involved in the phenomenon. Conclusions: It is a common perception that food materials facilitate bacterial adhesion to surfaces; however, this study demonstrates that aqueous coatings of food origin may actually reduce bacterial adhesion. Significance and Impact of the Study: Compounds from food extracts may potentially be used as nontoxic coatings to reduce bacterial attachment to inert surfaces...|$|R

Currently, {{a variety of techniques}} are being used to protect reservoirs from exposure to these elements. The most widely used techniques are <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> plating and polymeric coating. In this study, a technique known as arc thermal spraying was used. It is a more convenient and economical method for protecting both concrete and reinforcement steel bar from deterioration in waste {{water treatment}} reservoirs. In this study, 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>coating</b> was applied to a concrete surface, and different electrochemical experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of coatings in different acidic pH solutions. The coating generated from the arc thermal spraying process significantly protected the concrete surface from corrosion in acidic pH solutions, owing to the formation of a double layer capacitance—a mixture of Cr 3 + enriched with Cr 2 O 3 and Cr-hydroxide in inner and Fe 3 + oxide on the outer layer of the coating. The formation of this passive film is defective owing to the non-homogeneous 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>coating</b> surface. In the pH 5 solution, the growth of a passive film is adequate due to the presence of un-dissociated water molecules in the aqueous sulfuric acid solution.

The solid bar and sheet specimens were tested and prepared {{in accordance with}} the test standards "Standard Test Method for Adhesion or Cohesion Strength of Thermal Spray Coatings". The specimens were tensile and fatigue tested pre and post exposure to brine. SEM and EDS analysis were carried out to examine the surface morphology and microstructure of the coatings. The specimens that were subjected to a corrosion environment {{for an extended period of}} three weeks failed at a lower tensile load than those that were not exposed to corrosive environment. Shear deformation of the adjacent zones at the coating-substrate interface resulted in the total failure of the coating. However, in some cases, the coating was almost free from voids or pores and was impervious to electrolytic or any other contaminants. This result was observed from tests performed on different sets of specimens to identify brine exposure effects on coating adherence to the substrate. Foreign materials were observed beneath the coating due to improper surface preparation during the specimen preparation prior to coating. From tensile tests results it was observed that the bond strength of the coating reduced due to corrosion effect which caused degradation of the coating adhesion to the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s surface.

The titania sub-layer is introduced {{in order to improve}} both the corrosion resistance and the mechanical properties of the HAP/ 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>coated</b> system. The two coatings, HAP and TiO 2, were studied separately and afterwards, compared with the bi-layered coating. A film without any cracks is obtained under the optimum conditions in terms of annealing temperature, dipping rate and aging effect. Microstructural, morphological and profilometry analysis revealed the non-stoichiometric carbonated porous nature of the hydroxyapatite coatings, which were obtained after annealing at 500 °C during 60 min in the atmosphere. The obtained TiO 2 coatings exhibit a dense and uniform surface. Addition of TiO 2 as sub-layer of the HAP coating tends to increase the homogeneity and the crystallinity rate as compared to the HAP one. The mechanical properties, i. e. hardness and elastic modulus, are determined by means of nanoindentation experiments and the adhesion between the coating and substrate is estimated by scratch tests. The corrosion behavior is evaluated by potentiodynamic cyclic voltammetry tests. As a main result, the values of the elastic modulus and hardness, respectively of 30 GPa and 2. 5 GPa, are relatively high for the HAP–TiO 2 bilayer coating. This result allows the use of such coated material as a replacement material for hard tissues. The adhesion strength increased from 2925 mN up to 6430 mN after the addition of the TiO 2 intermediate film. According to the Tafel's analysis, the 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> specimens <b>coated</b> with both HAP and titania layers (ECorr = − 234 mV, lCorr = 0. 089 μA cm− 2) present a better resistance than the HAP-coated specimens (ECorr = − 460 mV, lCorr = 0. 860 μA cm− 2) ...|$|R
