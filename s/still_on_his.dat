5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|The legions were {{dismayed by}} his {{behaviour}} and quickly came to regret having supported his accession. While Elagabalus was <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way to Rome, brief revolts broke {{out by the}} Fourth Legion at the instigation of Gellius Maximus, and by the Third Legion, which itself had {{been responsible for the}} elevation of Elagabalus to the throne, under the command of Senator Verus. The rebellion was quickly put down, and the Third Legion disbanded.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Murray {{suffered}} a first round loss at the Australian Open to eventual runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, {{and a third}} round loss at the French Open to Nicolás Almagro. Murray then made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at Wimbledon before making his first final at the US Open. During the tournament in New York, Murray claimed his first win over Nadal. That victory meant that he'd become the first player from Britain since Greg Rusedski in 1997 to reach a major final. In his first Grand Slam final Murray {{suffered a}} straight sets loss to Federer. At the Beijing Olympics, Murray suffered {{one of the worst}} defeats of his career, losing his first round singles match to world No. 77 Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan in straight sets. That abject defeat was <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind in a BBC interview five years later – despite an intervening Olympic gold medal and a head-to-head win – when he met the same player (now ranked 75 in the world) in the 2nd round of Wimbledon 2013.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{took over}} on offense needing {{to get a}} {{touchdown}} to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran out of time. After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson jumped and caught the ball, intercepting it. <b>Still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

25|$|The next night, Blagojevich lost to Patrick Porter by 3rd-round {{technical}} knockout. Porter's aggressive punching attack had Blagojevich {{covering up}} {{his face with his}} boxing gloves. Because Blagojevich did not return punches, the referee stopped the match (with Blagojevich <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet), and awarded it to Porter.|$|E

25|$|The {{bodies of}} Welsh and Morgan {{had not been}} {{recovered}} {{at the time of}} the jury's deliberations; the cause of their disappearance and deaths was not considered by the inquest. The body of Welsh was found in November on a bar in the Yukon River between Tantalus and Five Fingers, about twenty-five (40km) to thirty miles (48km) below the site of the disaster. A lynx had been spotted gnawing on something on the bar; Welsh was identified by the buttons remaining on his vest which was <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> body.|$|E

25|$|Holyfield {{made his}} next defense in Atlanta against Bert Cooper, who {{surprised}} {{him with a}} very good effort. Holyfield scored the first knockdown of the fight against Cooper with a powerful shot to the body, but Cooper returned the favor with a good right hand that sent Holyfield against the ropes; while not an actual knockdown, referee Mills Lane gave Holyfield a standing 8-count. Having suffered the first technical knockdown of his professional career, Holyfield regained his composure quickly and administered a beating that left Cooper <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet, but unable to defend himself. Holyfield landed brutal power shots, culminated by repeated vicious uppercuts that snapped Cooper's head back. Referee Mills Lane stopped the bout in the seventh.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} Falkenhayn, <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> journey south, ordered the {{recapture}} of Ras en Naqb by the 77th Regiment (19th Division) and the 8th Cavalry Regiment. A patrol to reconnoitre the high ground occupied by about half an Ottoman battalion, {{in the direction of}} the Beersheba to Jerusalem road by a troop of the Worcestershire Yeomanry (5th Mounted Brigade), came under heavy rifle fire at 06:00, forcing them to return to Ras en Naqb. The regiment was relieved half an hour later by the Gloucester Yeomanry, although the Worcestershire Regiment remained close by, saddled up in the wadi with the led horses. At 14:00, they returned to take over the line again from the Gloucester Yeomanry. By 15:00, intermittent Ottoman shelling was increasing in volume, when an additional Ottoman battery came into action on the right, and a strong counterattack developed. This attack from the north east was mainly against an advanced troop on the right centre, which was compelled to retire.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, the National Enquirer {{published}} a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, who denied the claim. Two days later, around 2:30a.m. on November 27, Woods left {{home in his}} Cadillac Escalade SUV and, while <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> street, collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges. He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving. Following intense media speculation about {{the cause of the}} accident, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a [...] "private matter" [...] and crediting his wife for helping him from the car. On November 30, Woods announced {{that he would not be}} appearing at his own charity golf tournament, the Chevron World Challenge, nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.|$|E

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|But with a U.S. college tour {{to promote}} The Notorious Byrd Brothers looming, a more {{immediate}} concern was the recruitment of new band members. [...] David Crosby and Michael Clarke had been dismissed from the band in late 1967, leaving Roger McGuinn as de facto leader of the Byrds, along with Chris Hillman, the only other remaining member of the band. To address this problem, McGuinn hired Hillman's cousin, Kevin Kelley (formerly {{a member of the}} Rising Sons), as the band's new drummer, and it was this three-piece line-up, with McGuinn on guitar and Hillman on bass, that embarked on the early 1968 college tour. [...] It soon became apparent, however, that the Byrds were having difficulty in performing their studio material live as a trio, and so it was decided that a fourth member was required. [...] McGuinn, with an eye <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> envisaged American music concept album, felt that a pianist with a jazz background would be ideal for the group.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} part of the fighting, Colonel Powell was accidentally shot in the back from {{friendly}} fire. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, without its two highest-ranking officers (Powell and Hoffman), became disorganized. A portion of the cavalry was trapped in the open against shooters protected by buildings, and many dismounted either for their own safety or because their horse had been shot. At that time, Colonel Toland hurried forward to run the leaderless dismounted cavalry. [...] Freeman and the infantry were already further south in town. The cavalry believed their behavior was appropriate for the situation, and advised Colonel Toland to act in a similar manner. Toland, <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> horse, became an easy target for shooters from a nearby two-story brick house. Despite warnings from the cavalry's Company H that he should take cover, Toland refused to dismount—saying [...] "the bullet that can kill me has not been made". He was shot through the heart immediately after his exclamation. This happened early in the fighting, and men from the 2nd West Virginia's Company H were close enough to hear the bullet strike him. Thus, both colonels were eliminated from the fighting during the first 10 minutes.|$|E

500|$|In 1341, Shuhayb and a eunuch {{entered into}} a dispute related to a pigeon racing competition, in which the eunuch mistreated Shuhayb. In response, Ahmad had the eunuch {{severely}} beaten, and when news of the incident reached an-Nasir Muhammad, the latter attempted to force Ahmad to banish Shuhayb, again sending emirs Qawsun and Bashtak to communicate his demands to Ahmad. Ahmad refused, stating to Qawsun and Bashtak that while they each had a hundred young boys and girls, he had [...] "contented" [...] himself [...] "with regard to worldly pleasures with only this boy because he has shared my exile, having left his family. How can I expel him? If the sultan commands that I do so, then let him expel me too". Ahmad was indeed expelled to Sarkhad, accompanied by Maliktamur. However, upon the intervention of some of an-Nasir Muhammad's emirs, wives and his harem, an-Nasir Muhammad decided to have Ahmad return to Cairo while Ahmad was <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way to Sarkhad, although he first sold all of Ahmad's horses. An-Nasir Muhammad also ultimately decided to send Ahmad back to al-Karak with Maliktamur, who was also reappointed governor of Mamlakat al-Karak.|$|E
500|$|Next, Triple H faced Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match. Flair was <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{way to the}} ring, when Triple H {{attacked}} him and gained the early advantage. After attacking Flair's head with a screwdriver, Triple H continued using foreign objects throughout the match, including a folding chair, a sledgehammer, and the steel steps. The match {{went back and forth}} between Triple H and Flair. Triple H attempted a Pedigree through a broadcast table but Flair countered the move into a back body drop through another broadcast table. Triple H later performed three Pedigrees on Flair but Flair got up each time. Triple H then hit Flair in the back with a sledgehammer, and Flair did not stand by the referee's ten count, giving Triple H the win. After the match, Edge and Lita came to the ring, and Edge announced that he would be hosting a new show on Raw entitled [...] "The Cutting Edge". Edge noted that Dmitri Young was in the audience, and proceeded to criticize the sports teams of Detroit. Young replied by insulting Edge and his lack of a world championship.|$|E
500|$|On lap 18, Rosberg was {{the first}} of the front runners to come in, {{attempting}} to [...] "undercut" [...] the two Williams, who were forced to pit shortly after. Massa came in a lap later and Bottas on lap 22, both emerging from the pit lane behind the Mercedes of Rosberg, who was now third. By lap 26, both Hamilton and Vettel had made pit stops as well, as Hamilton was leading the Ferrari by more than twelve seconds. By that point, Räikkönen, who had yet to stop, was in third place but easily overtaken by Rosberg on lap 28. On lap 29, Daniel Ricciardo, also <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> original tyres, moved past Pérez into sixth position, only for the Mexican to retrieve it a lap later. At the end of lap 29, Räikkönen made a pit stop but almost collided with Roberto Merhi at the pit entrance. After his stop, the Finn emerged tenth, but quickly moved up the order again, taking eighth from Marcus Ericsson on lap 32. By lap 36, Nico Rosberg had moved within four seconds of Sebastian Vettel in front of him, while Räikkönen moved into seventh at the expense of Nico Hülkenberg.|$|E
