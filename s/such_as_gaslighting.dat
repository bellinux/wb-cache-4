5000|$|The Seminole Hotel was a {{hotel in}} Winter Park, Florida. The hotel opened on January 1, 1886 and had 250 guest rooms. It was {{situated}} on a site bounded by Osceola Avenue and Lake Osceola {{and sat at the}} eastern end of New England Avenue [...] Many people referred to it as the grand resort of Florida. At that time, wagons, carriages and bicycles were the only modes of local transportation. However, guests of the Seminole Hotel were brought to the hotel from the South Florida Railroad train depot via a horse car that traveled on rails. Many of these passengers came to Winter Park in the winter months to escape the snow and frigid temperatures of the North. In its early years, the hotel was able to attract many wealthy northerners using luxuries <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>gaslights</b> and steam heating.

6000|$|Happily {{for human}} nature, we are sure no man really {{believes}} that. Which {{of us has}} the impiety not to feel that our souls are only too narrow for the joy of looking into the trusting eyes of our children, of reposing on {{the love of a}} husband or a wife—nay, of listening to the divine voice of music, or watching the calm brightness of autumnal afternoons? But Young could utter this falsity without detecting it, because, when he spoke of “mortal joys,” he rarely had in his mind any object to which he could attach sacredness. He was thinking of bishoprics, and benefices, of smiling monarchs, patronizing prime ministers, and a “much indebted muse.” Of anything between these and eternal bliss he was but rarely and moderately conscious. Often, indeed, he sinks very much below even the bishopric, and seems to have no notion of earthly pleasure but <b>such</b> <b>as</b> breathes <b>gaslight</b> and the fumes of wine.

5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings <b>such</b> <b>as</b> sprung upholstery, <b>gaslighting</b> and water-closets.|$|R

5000|$|In romantic relationships, {{the verbal}} abuser may be {{responding}} to the partner's [...] "separateness", i.e., independent thoughts, views, desires, feelings, expressions (even of happiness) which the abuser views as a threat, irritant or attack. Some people believe the abuser has low self-esteem and so attempts to place their victim in a similar position, i.e., to believe negative things about themselves. Because of the abuser's need for dominance and unwillingness to accept his partner as an equal, the verbal abuser is compelled to negate {{the perceptions of the}} partner, about the abuse, which causes more psychological pain to the victim. This is also known <b>as</b> <b>gaslighting</b> or Jekyl and Hyde-like behavior, because the abuser keeps the target of his abuse off-balance with his hot-and-cold unpredictable behavior. This confusion adds to the pain caused by psychological abuse and keeps the victim off-balance.|$|R
50|$|Gaslamp fantasy (also known <b>as</b> <b>gaslight</b> fantasy or gaslight romance) is a subgenre of both {{fantasy and}} {{historical}} fiction. Generally speaking, this particular realm of fantasy employs either a Victorian or Edwardian setting. The gaslamp fantasy genre {{is not to}} be confused with steampunk, which usually has more of a super-science edge and uchronic tone. Gaslamp fantasy also differs from classical Victorian/Edwardian faerie or pure fantasy in the J.R.R. Tolkien or Lewis Carroll style or from historical crime-novels in the Anne Perry or June Thomson style by the supernatural elements, themes, and subjects it features. Many of its tropes, themes, and stock characters derive from Gothic literature — a long-established genre composed of both romantic and horrific traits and motivated by the desire to rouse fear, apprehension, and other intense emotions within the reader — and could be described as an attempt to modernize literary Gothicism.|$|R

5000|$|THE WORRELL SISTERS: Jennie was one {{of three}} notable sisters who came to fame in the 1800s. Starting out as {{childhood}} stars, the sisters, Jennie, Sophie, and Irene grew to critical acclaim later in life by being the premier burlesque performers of the time. The earliest of the burlesque shows put on by the Sisters and other artists of the time had a sort of set list that the artists followed with precision. This set list included, “an opening with songs, then acrobats and even magicians, and finally a burlesque done in the English or Victorian Style” (Hughes 26). Whether it was due to their father being a clown, or having to be stuck with their two siblings their entire life, these talented sisters were proficient entertainers.Their shows lasted about an hour and varied in the way they were structured. Before the Worrell Sisters were completely on the scene, the structure of a burlesque show was thus: music, then acrobats, then a small parody skit. Once the girls were in their prime however, the shows morphed into more skits and even sometimes a full-blown parody of an entire play or musical. This would include keeping the basic character archetype, and sometimes even poking fun at it, and keeping music but changing lyrics to songs in the score. The shows were hilarious and were even sometimes more popular than the shows they were making fun of. They mocked the musical conventions and the theatrical styles that the shows were originally done in. In fact, the word [...] "burlesque" [...] originated from the Italian burla, which meant mockery. Because of their successes with multiple audiences, they rose to such acclaim that in later years they were able to purchase their own theater right in New York City. Their theater was called the Worrell Sisters’ New York City Theatre and it hosted many burlesque shows of the time that the sisters sometimes acted in themselves. They bought the theatre in 1866. Their theatre was home to not only famous burlesque and parody shows but also melodramas <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Under the <b>Gaslight</b> that required a lot of dramatic and realistic scenery. To keep up with the times, the Sisters tried to keep their theater as up to date as possible. After their fame was over, the oldest and most famous sister Jennie became destitute [...] Her sisters separated themselves from her because of her degenerate lifestyle and their theater was sold later becoming The Globe theatre in 1870 and the New Theatre Comique in 1881. The building became the Broadway Athletic Club and was eventually demolished in 1884, however no one could contest its notoriety thanks to the Worrell trio (Playbill).|$|R

Designed and built by William Chancellor, a prominent Parkersburg businessman, Blennerhassett opened in 1889 and quickly became a grand showplace for what would later be known <b>as</b> the <b>Gaslight</b> Era. The original hotel had approximately 50 guest rooms around a central staircase. Restrooms were common places on each of the four guest floors and the kitchen was located on the fifth floor.
