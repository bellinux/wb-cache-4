2500|$|During the 1990s, King {{was subject}} to {{multiple}} break-ins and encountered Lyndon Fitzgerald Pace, a man who admitted killing women in the area. He broke in {{the house in the}} middle of the night and found her while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> her bed. After nearly eight years of staying in the home following the encounter, King moved to a condominium unit which had also been the home, albeit part-time, for singers Elton John and Janet Jackson. In 1999, the King family finally succeeded in getting a jury verdict saying her husband was the victim of a murder conspiracy after suing Loyd Jowers, who claimed six years prior to having paid someone other than James Earl Ray to kill her husband. On April 4, 2000, King visited her husband's grave with her sons, daughter Bernice and sister-in-law. Regarding plans to construct a monument for her husband in Washington, D.C., King said it would [...] "complete a group of memorials in the nation's capital honoring democracy's greatest leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and now Martin Luther King, Jr." ...|$|E
2500|$|North Carolina {{finished}} {{the regular season}} at 16–15, dropped to third in all-time wins, and bowed {{out in the first}} round of the ACC tournament. The Tar Heels did not receive a post-season tournament bid by the NCAA—the only time in Williams' coaching career that his team didn't take part in that tournament when eligible to do so. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT. The Tar Heels made it to the NIT championship game versus Dayton, which was played on April 1, 2010, at Madison Square Garden. The Tar Heels lost by a score of 79–68, bringing their overall tally to 20–17 for the 2009–10 season. This 20-win season however kept Williams' streak of 20-win seasons alive. Williams stated that the season was [...] "the biggest frustration and the biggest disappointment of my professional life". In addition to frustrating play, Williams was criticized for comparing the season to the disaster in Haiti by stating, [...] "Our massage therapist told me, she said 'You know, Coach, what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe. What you're having is a disappointment.' And I told her that depends on which chair <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in,</b> because it does feel like a catastrophe to me, and that's because it is my life." [...] Williams later apologized for his comments, stating that he misspoke and [...] "neglected to say that it puts basketball in perspective." ...|$|E
