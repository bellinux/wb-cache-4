40|$|In {{the field}} of design and manufacturing, there are many {{problems}} with managing dynamic states of three-dimensional (3 D) objects. In order to solve these problems, the four-dimensional (4 D) mesh model and its modeling system have been proposed. The 4 D mesh model {{is defined as a}} 4 D object model that is bounded by tetrahedral cells, and can represent spatio-temporal changes of a 3 D object continuously. The 4 D mesh model helps to solve dynamic problems of 3 D models as geometric problems. However, the construction of the 4 D mesh model is limited on the time-series 3 D voxel data based method. This method is memory-hogging and requires much computing time. In this research, we propose a new method of constructing the 4 D mesh model that derives from the 3 D mesh model with continuous rigid body movement. This method is realized by making a <b>swept</b> <b>shape</b> of a 3 D mesh model in the fourth dimension and its tetrahe-dralization. Here, the rigid body movement is a screwed movement, which is a combination of translational and rotational movement...|$|E

The study addresses the potential aerodynamic improvements available at both cruise and high angles of attack by use os <b>swept</b> wing-tip <b>shapes.</b> The <b>swept</b> wing tip appears to offer a viable addition to the lift of wing-tip designs which provide improvements in aerodynamic efficiency, with the added safety benefit of providing high angle-of-attack departure resistance...|$|R
5000|$|The second-generation two-line parafoil {{was called}} the Sparless Stunter, {{designed}} by Ted Dougherty. Development began mid-1985 and was available for sale in mid-1988. These parafoil kites were square in shape and had 6 cells. In September 1988 a 460-square-foot (43 m²) version was flown at the Ocean City Sunfest breaking {{the record for the}} World's Largest Stunt kite. In January 1989 the Sparless Stunter was introduced at the KTA show as the first totally sparless parafoil stunt kite. The Sparless Stunter saw a very brief history as kite technology evolved by May 1990 the first version of the original Quadrifoil was flown in competition at Wildwood, NJ. The first Quadrifoil was essentially two Sparless Stunters sewn together with a <b>swept</b> back <b>shape.</b> Later generations were refined into the widely known “classic.” ...|$|R
40|$|Blade {{optimization}} is {{more than}} ever a crucial activity for helicopter manufacturers, always looking for performance im-provements, noise reduction and vibratory comfort increase. Lat-est studies have led to design new blade concepts including a double <b>swept</b> plan <b>shape,</b> an evolutionary and increased twist an-gle at the tip and a new layout for internal components like rov-ing spars. Such blades exhibit a highly coupled behavior between torsion, longitudinal and bending motions that should be accu-rately modeled for predictive numerical tools. In this research a highly accurate beam finite element is formulated in the ro-tating frame to improve the static deformation calculation under aerodynamic and centrifugal loads and thus enhance dynamic and stability analysis usually performed for a helicopter develop-ment. Numerical and experimental investigations are performed to demonstrate the model reliability both for academic beams with extreme shape and for actual blade design...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} and theoretically {{investigate the}} microwave transmission line {{shape of the}} cavity-magnon-polariton (CMP) created by inserting a low damping magnetic insulator into a high quality 3 D microwave cavity. While fixed field measurements are found to have the expected Lorentzian characteristic, at fixed frequencies the field <b>swept</b> line <b>shape</b> is in general asymmetric. Such fixed frequency measurements demonstrate that microwave transmission {{can be used to}} access magnetic characteristics of the CMP, such as the field line width Δ H. By developing an effective oscillator model of the microwave transmission we show that these line shape features are general characteristics of harmonic coupling. At the same time, at the classical level the underlying physical mechanism of the CMP is electrodynamic phase correlation and a second model based on this principle also accurately reproduces the experimental line shape features. In order to understand the microscopic origin of the effective coupled oscillator model and to allow for future studies of CMP phenomena to extend into the quantum regime, we develop a third, microscopic description, based on a Green's function formalism. Using this method we calculate the transmission spectra and find good agreement with the experimental results. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{rotational}} diffusion dynamics of two different chromophores, resorufin and 6 -(N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) amino) hexanoic acid (NBDHA) in water and N-octyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NOP) solvents. We measure the induced orientational anisotropy function, R(t), using time-correlated single photon counting. Our data show that both chromophores exhibit single exponential anisotropy decays in aqueous solution and two-component exponential anisotropy decays in NOP. The change of the anisotropy decay functionality indicates that the effective rotor <b>shape</b> <b>swept</b> out by solute rotational motion is different in the two solvents. We interpret these findings {{in the context of}} Chuang and Eisenthal's theory of fluorescence depolarization by rotational diffusion. The similarity in the behavior of the two different chromophores in these solvent systems points to solvent-solvent interactions and local organization as the dominant factors in mediating motional dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Icing {{calculations}} {{were performed}} for a NACA 0012 swept wing tip using LEWICE 3 D Version 3. 48 {{coupled with the}} ANSYS CFX flow solver. The calculated ice shapes were compared to experimental data generated in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT). The IRT tests were designed to test {{the performance of the}} LEWICE 3 D ice void density model which was developed to improve the prediction of <b>swept</b> wing ice <b>shapes.</b> Icing tests were performed for a range of temperatures at two different droplet inertia parameters and two different sweep angles. The predicted mass agreed well with the experiment with an average difference of 12 %. The LEWICE 3 D ice void density model under-predicted void density by an average of 30 % for the large inertia parameter cases and by 63 % for the small inertia parameter cases. This under-prediction in void density resulted in an over-prediction of ice area by an average of 115 %. The LEWICE 3 D ice void density model produced a larger average area difference with experiment than the standard LEWICE density model, which doesn't account for the voids in the <b>swept</b> wing ice <b>shape,</b> (115 % and 75 % respectively) but it produced ice shapes which were deemed more appropriate because they were conservative (larger than experiment). Major contributors to the overly conservative ice shape predictions were deficiencies in the leading edge heat transfer and the sensitivity of the void ice density model to the particle inertia parameter. The scallop features present on the ice shapes were thought to generate interstitial flow and horse shoe vortices which enhance the leading edge heat transfer. A set of changes to improve the leading edge heat transfer and the void density model were tested. The changes improved the ice shape predictions considerably. More work {{needs to be done to}} evaluate the performance of these modifications for a wider range of geometries and icing conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Flow Visualization Gun (FVG), a novel {{time line}} {{visualization}} technique, {{has been used}} to investigate the flow field of a helicopter rotor with <b>swept</b> back tip <b>shape</b> in hover flight condition. After introducing the FVG-technique, the paper presents some visualization photographs of the rotor blade tip vortices and the rotor downwash. Using orthogonal sets of flow photographs and digital image analysis, the 3 -dimensional time line displacement within the flow and the tip vortex structure are determined. The data of 16 time line experiments are interpolated in space and time to obtain velocity data on an evenly spaced 3 -dimensional grid. Vorticity contour plots of the flow field show the complex arrangement of the tip vortices of the blade itself and of the preceding blade and some additional vorticity in the direct wake which may form a secondary vortex. Understanding and control of this vorticity distribution is important for the design of new efficient tip shapes. While the FVG technique has been used so far for qualitative investigation of complex flow patterns at local velocities of up to 20 m/s, a good comparison to laser velocimetry data validates the technique as an interesting tool for both qualitative and quantitative investigation...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} multiwavelength {{study of the}} SNR G 18. 1 - 0. 1 and nearby several H II regions (infrared dust bubbles N 21 and N 22, and the H II regions G 018. 149 - 00. 283 and G 18. 197 - 00. 181). Our goal is to provide {{observational}} evidence supporting the view that massive stars are usually born in clusters from the same molecular cloud, which then produce, along their evolution, different neighbouring objects such as H II regions, interstellar bubbles and supernova remnants (SNRs). We suggest that the objects analysed in this work belong to a same complex located at the distance of about 4 kpc. Using molecular data we inspected the interstellar medium towards this complex and from optical and X-ray observations we looked for OB-type stars in the region. Analysing public 13 CO J = 1 - 0 data we found several molecular structures very likely related to the H II region/SNR complex. We suggest that the molecular gas is very likely being <b>swept</b> and <b>shaped</b> by {{the expansion of the}} H II regions. From spectroscopic optical observations obtained with the 2. 15 -m telescope at CASLEO, Argentina, we discovered three O-type stars very likely exciting the bubbles N 21 and N 22, and an uncatalogued H II region northwards of bubble N 22, respectively. Also we found four B 0 - 5 stars, one towards the bubble N 22 and the others within the H II region G 18. 149 - 0. 283. By inspecting the Chandra Source Catalogue we found two-point X-ray sources and suggest that one of them is an early O-type star. Finally, we inspected the large-scale interstellar medium around this region. We discovered a big molecular shell of about 70 × 28 pc in which the analysed complex appears to be located in its southern border. Fil: Paron, Sergio Ariel.
