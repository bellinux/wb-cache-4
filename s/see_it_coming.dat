5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
2500|$|The P-47 {{was very}} heavy, {{too heavy for}} some maneuvers. We would <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> from behind, and pull up fast and the P-47 couldn't follow and we came around and got on its tail in this way.|$|E

[...] "It's a big concept and you're not going to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> It'll just land." [...] Later in 2014, Monáe was featured on Sérgio Mendes' latest album, Magic. She sings on the track titled [...] "Visions of You".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2007, Rogers {{was awarded}} his first {{national}} contract with Cricket Australia. On 13 January 2008, he {{was added to}} the Australia Test squad as a cover for the injured Matthew Hayden, who had torn a hamstring, and he made his Test debut in the third Test against India at the WACA Ground on 16 January, but the Baggy Green had to be replaced a day later because Rogers' cap was too small, and he unsuccessfully tried to make it bigger to alleviate headaches caused by fielding all day in the scorching heat. Australia were chasing a world-record 17th consecutive Test victory, but found the going difficult. Rogers scored four runs in the first innings of 212 and 15 in the second innings as Australia unsuccessfully chased a target of over 400. His national contract was subsequently terminated in April 2008. Rogers commented that he [...] "didn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming,</b> I'll have to accept it and try to get back in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with All About Soap Richie revealed how Alfie reacts. He commented: [...] "It's {{the last thing he}} expected to hear. He didn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and {{was not the first}} benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal's Highbury ground had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on {{towards the end of the}} first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to [...] "Keep your eye on the ball, when you <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise." [...] The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: [...] "What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} {{generally}} she <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> In {{that sort of}} wireless telegraphy, that reaching out of two natures through space towards each other, her more sensitive apparatus probably feels the appeal of his before he is conscious of having made any appeal." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lynsey's death shocked Laura Morgan from All About Soap, {{who could}} not believe that she was writing about her death. She felt that it was so {{unexpected}} she would never have foreseen the scenario [...] "in a million years". Sarah Ellis from rival magazine Inside Soap shared Morgan's sentiments, branding it [...] "the mother of all shocks". Ellis said that she did not <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> and concluded that she would miss Lynsey, who was on the path of becoming one of her [...] "favourite Hollyoaks characters". Heat columnist Sophie Wilkinson felt that the episode dealing with the aftermath of Lynsey's death was a [...] "shocker" [...] and questioned [...] "Who could kill butter-wouldn't-melt nurse Lynsey?" [...] Langford also expressed shock at her exit, saying that soaps rarely ever surprise him due to there predictability. He wrote that he did not [...] "see Lynsey's death coming because it was so sudden. One moment she was there and the next she was gone. It was swift and out of nowhere, yet her death not only made perfect sense, it has galvanized this show in a way that has been missing for so long. Because of Lynsey's death, various disparate storylines and plots are finally coming together under one intriguing umbrella arc".|$|E
2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here and Now was released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any more, I think if you look at the way we have evolved over the last few records you could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming.</b> We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E

6000|$|... “I am heartily glad, too, {{that it is}} all settled,” Mr. Palethorpe said. “I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> on {{ever since}} you met us {{the first time in}} London, and I may say that I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> with pleasure, for there is no one to whom I would sooner trust her {{happiness}} than you.

6000|$|... "Don't sob so, my boy; he is right. I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>coming</b> a long time, and, {{hard as it}} seems, it will be better. There is no disgrace in it.
