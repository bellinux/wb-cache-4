40|$|The study {{examines}} the determinant factors for {{the effectiveness of}} quality service offered towards customer <b>satisfactions</b> <b>in</b> museum centers in Tanzania, taking Mkwawa Memorial Museum Center at Kalenga in Iringa Region as the case study. Four independent variables: responsiveness, professionalism, friendliness and honesty were identified as possible constructs that can influence customer satisfaction and loyalty as dependent variable. Previous studies explored the relationship between some of these constructs and loyalty. But this {{study examines}} more constructs. Therefore, the major findings of this research provide insights into the factors determining customer <b>satisfactions</b> <b>in</b> Tanzania. The findings have established that service quality is very important <b>in</b> providing customer <b>satisfaction</b> and loyalty <b>in</b> the traditional industries especially museums in Tanzania. If organization operators strive to improve the service quality for spread of sensitive information to customers, forgiving in case of failure, increasing the reputation (image) of the center, increasing operation of services and advancement in technology can be factors to be used and they will get the benefit of satisfied and loyal customers. Customer service is also found to bring <b>satisfaction</b> and loyalty <b>in</b> the museum market.

Upon Andrianampoinimerina's death in 1810, Radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among Ramavo's relatives, an act that may have strained their relationship. Unable to find <b>satisfaction</b> <b>in</b> her loveless marriage, the neglected Ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with David Griffiths and his fellow missionaries in Griffiths' home.

40|$|AbstractSome new {{concepts}} {{in regards to}} ᾱ-feasibility and ᾱ-efficiency of solutions in fuzzy mathematical programming problems are introduced in this paper, where ᾱ is a vector of distinct satisfaction degrees. Based on the defined concepts, a new method is suggested to solve fuzzy mathematical programming problems. In this sense, the proposed approach enables decision makers {{to take into account}} more flexible solutions by allowing desired distinct <b>satisfactions</b> <b>in</b> constraints. In the case of linear problems with fuzzy constraints, multi-parametric programming is employed to obtain the optimal solution as an affine function of distinct <b>satisfaction</b> degrees. <b>In</b> particular, it proves that the obtained solution is convex and continuous. Therefore, the different optimal solutions can be obtained by a simple substituting the new values of satisfaction parameters into the parametric profiles without any further optimization calculations, which is desirable for online optimization and sensitivity analysis of the profit to satisfaction parameters...|$|R
