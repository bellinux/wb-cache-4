Department of Energy?s (DOE) Building America 1 Industrialized Housing Partnership (BAIHP) has {{collaborated with}} two of its {{industry}} partners {{to work on a}} portion of the project that relates to the construction and evaluation of prototype interior duct systems. In 2006, work began on a duct system design that would locate the entire length of duct work within the air and thermal barriers of the envelope. One of these designs incorporated a high-side <b>supply</b> <b>register</b> that connects to the conventional floor duct. The other design utilized a single soffit located within the conditioned space at the marriage line. The Florida Solar Energy Center?s (FSEC) Manufactured Housing Lab (MHLab) was retrofitted with an interior soffit duct. The duct system was added on so that either the attic duct system or the new interior duct system would be able to supply air to the conditioned space using the same mechanical equipment. The initial results of this work show approximately a 10 % to 20 % heating/cooling savings when compared to conventional attic duct work construction techniques and nearly 7 % savings when compared to a conventional in-floor system...|$|E
40|$|For {{residential}} {{forced air}} {{heating and cooling}} systems conventional thinking is that air <b>supply</b> <b>registers</b> should be located under exterior windows. There were good reasons for this in the past (primarily to counteract the cold downdraught from the window) but new construction standards (well-insulated walls, better glazing and air tight wall/window interface) mean that there is now less downdraught. Positioning the <b>supply</b> air <b>register</b> away from a window could have a large impact for new construction as duct lengths could be shortened (saving materials and construction time). This could also allow greater architectural freedom as the forced air system would {{not need to be}} ducted to the building perimeter. This paper presents results from experiments conducted in a new, well-constructed building to evaluate whether the <b>supply</b> <b>registers</b> can be moved away from the traditional location without impacting indoor air quality or predicted thermal comfort. The physical experiments showed that in both traditional and non-traditional placement: (1) there are minimal changes in predicted thermal comfort (a measure of thermal discomfort - vertical air temperature difference much lower than 3 K), and (2) contaminant-removal effectiveness (a measure of indoor air quality) values were in the same range.

As air is delivered into the ductwork, pressure builds and forces air out of all of the openings in the various ductwork connections or through the seams and joints of the furnace or air-conditioner. The tighter the ductwork system (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the fan to create a change in the ductwork pressure.|$|R

40|$|Background : The nursing {{profession}} {{forms the}} backbone of many healthcare systems. It therefore needs a consistent <b>supply</b> of <b>registered</b> nurses to deliver continuous and safe quality healthcare, and to replace the nurses leaving or retiring from the profession. Attrition actively occurs among nursing students in South Africa and threatens the future <b>supply</b> of <b>registered</b> nurses. Aim : The aim {{of the study was}} to describe the attrition rate at selected South African universities and the factors influencing undergraduate nursing students to discontinue their nursing studies at these universities. Method : A quantitative descriptive design was followed. Heads of the nursing departments at the selected universities captured data with a specifically designed questionnaire. Thereafter their former nursing students provided information via a structured telephonic interview on the reasons why they discontinued the nursing programme. Results : The study revealed that attrition of undergraduate nursing students for three intake years (2007, 2008 and 2009) at the participating universities was between 39. 3 % and 58. 7 %. Academic and financial reasons as well as poor wellness and health were the main causes for attrition. Another factor was failure to cope with the demands of the clinical environment. Conclusion : Attrition might not occur immediately when a nursing student is challenged, as the student might exploit the various types of support offered. Although some nursing students do benefit from the offered support, a large number of nursing students still discontinue the undergraduate nursing programme...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the relationship between the <b>supply</b> of <b>registered</b> nurses and the rate of return on the educational investment to become a registered nurse. Is this rate of return a determining factor in the supply, past, present, and future? Since 98. 8 percent of all registered nurses are women, an integral part of this study is a survey of the data on women in the labor force. The empirical data, statistical, was obtained from government sources and non-government associations, The American Nurses Association, The American Hospital Association, and the educational institutions. The data indicates the following: the yearly average <b>supply</b> of active <b>registered</b> nurses has increased by 3. 15 percent from 1966 through 1970; the demand for registered nurses has decreased from 41. 1 percent of nursing personnel in 1966 to 36. 8 percent in 1970; the average weekly wage of general duty nurses has increased $ 100. 50 in 1966 to $ 141. 00 in 1969; the number of graduates from registered nurse schools has been increasing in recent years. Of the three programs, the Associate Degree shows the largest increase in number of students and it is the one in which the present value of benefits from the investment, $ 10, 414. 00, exceeded the present value of the investment costs (education), $ 6, 923. 00, which yielded a private rate of return of five percent. In summary, the rate of return on the three registered nurse educational programs, Associate Degree, Diploma Degree, and Baccalaureate Degree, based on employment as a general duty nurse and calculated by both the present value of cost and benefit method and internal rate of return method indicated that only the Associate Degree program produced a positive rate of return. In addition, this is the program that has had the large increase in students and graduates in recent years. If this trend continues, the future <b>supply</b> of <b>registered</b> nurses will be adequate and may overshoot the demand.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the associations among length of time between core science course completion and nursing program admission, on-time completion, and National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) success for students at a southeastern community college. A convenience sample of 288 community students admitted to an associate degree level nursing (ADN) program between 2007 and 2012 was selected. The guiding research questions examined if the length of time from completion of core science courses, Anatomy and Physiology, and admission to a selective admission nursing program was associated with on-time completion as well as passing the NCLEX-RN examination on first attempt. Using Karen 2 ̆ 7 s gatekeeping theory as the theoretical foundation, this nonexperimental, nonparametric, quantitative design tested for statistical significance. A Pearson chi square with phi coefficient was utilized for data analysis. The results indicated a statistically significant association between on-time completion and completion of core science courses (X 2 (4, N = 288) = 19. 730, p =. 001, É¸. 262); however, passing the NCLEX-RN on the first attempt was not significant (X 2 (4, n = 178) = 4. 182, p =. 382).

40|$|Introduction: In {{countries}} such as South Africa with a high prevalence of HIV and TB policy directives support program integration. Operational research suggests this is desirable, at least for increasing coverage of HIV and TB services, but warns that implementation models must take local health service infrastructure into account. Methods: A program evaluation of HIV and TB prevention and therapeutic services was performed at facility level in two purposefully selected districts in South Africa – one deep rural and an urban district – in order to describe integration {{and how it is}} implemented. Twenty-six rural and 146 urban public primary-care facilities were evaluated using secondary data generated from two large evaluations of HIV/TB/Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) programs conducted in December 2008 and May 2009. The data collection tools consisted of a review of data in the routine health information system, a facility manager interview, a checklist for equipment and <b>supplies,</b> <b>register</b> reviews and a series of patient folder (health record) reviews. Data were collected on extent to which clients receive integrated services, as well as the quality of care, and the availability of key resources and system capacity to support quality care. Data were entered into MS Excel spreadsheets and proportions calculated for all indicators, and confidence intervals for proportions. Results: Evidence of integration was found across two dimensions - disease programs and the prevention–therapeutic axis. Integration was enabled in both the rural and urban districts because HIV and TB services were co-located in the extensive network of general primary-care services. Smaller rural facilities did not always have staff trained in all the required services, nurses worked without the support of a doctor and supervision was weaker, threatening quality of care. In the rural district there were instances of clients receiving more integrated services. The quality of care in the TB program was high in both districts. Conclusions: In both the districts evaluated, integration across programs and the prevention-care-rehabilitation axis of services was achieved through co-location at primary-care level. Coupled with health system strengthening, this has the potential to improve access across the HIV/TB/STI cluster of services. The benefit is likely to be greater in rural areas. Quality of care was maintained in the long established TB programs in both settings. Web of Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Forced {{air heating}} and cooling systems and whole house {{ventilation}} systems deliver air to individual rooms in a house via <b>supply</b> <b>registers</b> located on walls ceilings or floors; and occasionally less straightforward locations like toe-kicks below cabinets. Ideally, the air velocity out of the registers combined with the turbulence of the flow, vectoring of air by register vanes and geometry of register placement combine to mix the supply air within the room. A particular issue that has been raised recently is the performance of multiple capacity and air flow HVAC systems. These systems vary the air flow rate through the distribution system depending on the system load, or if operating in a ventilation rather than a space conditioning mode. These systems {{have been developed to}} maximize equipment efficiency, however, the high efficiency ratings do not include any room mixing effects. At lower air flow rates, there is the possibility that room air will be poorly mixed, leading to thermal stratification and reduced comfort for occupants. This can lead to increased energy use as the occupants adjust the thermostat settings to compensate and parts of the conditioned space have higher envelope temperature differences than for the well mixed case. In addition, lack of comfort can be a barrier to market acceptance of these higher efficiency systems To investigate the effect on room mixing of reduced air flow rates requires the measurement of mixing of supply air with room air throughout the space to be conditioned. This is a particularly difficult exercise if we want to determine the transient performance of the space conditioning system. Full scale experiments can be done in special test chambers, but the spatial resolution required to fully examine the mixing problem is usually limited by the sheer number of thermal sensors required. Current full-scale laboratory testing is therefore severely limited in its resolution. As an alternative, we used a water-filled scale model of a room in which whole-field supply air mixing maps of two vertical planes were measured using a Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) measurement technique. Water marked with fluorescent dye was used to simulate the supply airflow; and the resulting concentrations within the water filled model show how the supply air mixes with the room air and are an analog for temperature (for thermal loads) or fresh air (for ventilation). In addition to performing experiments over a range of flow rates, we also changed register locations and examined the effects for both {{heating and cooling}} operation by changing the water density (simulating air density changes due to temperature changes) using dissolved salt...|$|R
