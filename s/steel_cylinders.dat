5|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are more}} {{susceptible}} than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{manufactured}} to US {{standards are}} permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10%, and this is indicated by a '+' symbol.

40|$|Abstract. A {{model is}} founded to {{simulate}} the process of artificial island construction by numerical analysis method. The displacement and deformation of the <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> are analyzed. From the results, the settlement of <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> is great, and the maximum is 28. 5 cm. At the same time, the <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> has lateral displacement {{in the process of}} the island construction. The maximum lateral displacement is 12 cm. The major influencing factor to the deformation of <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> is the construction of filling sand inside and outside of island and flinging stone. Therefore, the settlement and displacement of <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> should be monitored nearly during this construction step...|$|R

5|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
5|$|The nominal working {{pressure}} {{is not necessarily}} the same as the actual {{working pressure}} used. Some <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> may be {{manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

5|$|Several {{variants}} on the Hamilcar Mark I were planned, {{although only}} one was actually produced. The Hamilcar Mark X, {{also known as}} the GAL. 58, was designed to specification X 4/44 in an attempt to allow Hamilcars {{to be used in the}} tropical climate of the Pacific, where high temperatures and the high altitudes of many airfields reduced the efficiency of piston-engined aircraft. This meant that Halifax bombers could not tow Hamilcars without a drastically reduced fuel load, which in turn narrowed the range of the Hamilcar. Two initial solutions were proposed to correct this problem; the first was to convert a Hamilcar into a rocket-assisted take off (RATO) aircraft. Two cylindrical <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> filled with twenty-four three-inch rockets were attached to either side of the glider to provide it with 20,000lbs of mean thrust as it took off; they would then be jettisoned once the glider was airborne. Initial trials conducted in January 1943 proved to be successful, but was not pursued any further for unknown reasons. The second solution was double towing, where two Halifax aircraft, one stripped of all unnecessary equipment, attached tow ropes to a Hamilcar and then took off from an airfield; once airborne the normal Halifax would then detach its towrope and land, and the modified Halifax would tow the glider to its destination. However, this idea went no further than initial trials in England, as it was considered to be a high risk operation with a high probability of a serious accident occurring. As such, a powered version of the Hamilcar, the Mark X, was decided upon, as it offered the possibility of long-range airborne operations and the ability to retrieve the glider once it had been used. The decision was taken to start developing the Mark X in November 1943 when the potential for airborne operations against Japan itself began to be considered by the Allies; however, for some reason a relaxed view was taken to the development of the production models, and the first was not available until the early months of 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Kestrel {{came about}} {{as a result of}} the {{excellent}} Curtiss D-12, one of the first truly successful cast-block engines. Earlier designs had used individually machined <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders</b> that were screwed onto a crankcase, whereas the cast-block design used a single block of aluminium that was machined to form cylinders. The result was both simpler to build as well as lighter and much stronger, requiring only an investment in new machining equipment.|$|E
25|$|The DIN fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} {{screw-in}} connection to the cylinder. The DIN system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure <b>steel</b> <b>cylinders.</b> They are less susceptible to blowing the O-ring seal if banged against something while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. The DIN fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, CrZrN {{film was}} {{deposited}} on AISI 4130 cylinder barrel and valve plate using a unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological properties between a coated <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> barrel and coated steel valve plate {{were evaluated by}} a custom-built disk-to-disk tribometer {{and the results were}} compared with those between a coated <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> barrel and a conventional bronze valve plate. The lowest friction coefficients were observed between a coated <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> barrel and coated steel valve plate and they were approximately one half of those between a coated <b>steel</b> <b>cylinder</b> barrel and conventional bronze valve plate in the range of testing up to 1600 rpm. Coated valve plate and bronze valve plate showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but steel valve plate without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial <b>cylinder</b> barrel and <b>steel</b> valve plate, much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze valve plate. Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating. Although further work to reduce the friction coefficient below 0. 13 in the steady state after initial drop is still needed, possibilities of applying CrZrN coating to realize a water hydraulic pump were demonstrated through the present work...|$|R
