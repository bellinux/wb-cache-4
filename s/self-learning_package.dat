The {{importance}} of considering human/organisational factors when reporting transfusion incidents has been highlighted recently. The UK haemovigilance scheme, Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT), has established {{over the past two}} decades that most incidents are caused by human errors in the transfusion process. In order to enhance reporter’s awareness of human and organisational factors, we implemented two interventions and evaluated the effects. First, we created and incorporated a bespoke human factors investigation tool (HFIT) explicitly asking the level of contribution of individual staff member(s), the local environment or workspace, organisational or management and government or regulation. Second, we created and incorporated a <b>self-learning</b> <b>package</b> with good examples of human and organisational factors reporting within the UK national haemovigilance reporting database. Data from this tool have been analysed to investigate whether increased learning is possible. The main conclusion after one year’s use of the HFIT, was that incident reporters tended to attribute culpability mostly to individuals (62. 6 %). It is possible this result is due to lack of system awareness amongst incident reportersSix month initial data analysis after the inclusion of the <b>self-learning</b> <b>package</b> shows that if the incident reporter has studied the <b>self-learning</b> <b>package</b> before scoring the level of contribution associated with an incident, there is a slightly lower tendency to attribute most responsibility to individuals...|$|E
40|$|Advancement in {{information}} technology {{has led to the}} commencement of e-Learning. It has totally changed the concept of learning that has been well adopted for a long time. ‘Any time, any place ’ is becoming a more convenient learning method in the current dynamic world. This paper describes the development of a multimedia teaching package in pneumatic circuit design. It discusses the concept of e-learning, presents the pneumatic contents covered in the package and also the development processes. Various types of emergency circuit design techniques have been incorporated into the package to suit different needs of users. Macromedia Flash MX has been used as the main development platform for this interactive teaching package. The courseware has been fully tested. It serves as a supplementary teaching package for the instructor or a <b>self-learning</b> <b>package</b> for learners who are interested in pneumatic circuit design...|$|E
40|$|Computer-based virtual {{simulation}} {{is being}} widely {{used for the}} purposes of education and skills training. These include special needs education to sophisticate teaching aids in high schools and universities for the delivery of medical and scientific education. This project investigates the issues in the development of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in the teaching of biology to students in a university Life Sciences department, focussing on a laboratory experiment in an immunology module. To explore the potential of VLE in learning concepts, principles, and laboratory skills from experiential of virtual experimental exercise, this paper discusses the process of the development of VLE as a <b>self-learning</b> <b>package.</b> A set of design strategies is proposed to guide the design of VLE. An important feature of the VLE is to employ virtual tutoring agents to scaffold the learning process in order to ensure the important learning tasks are tackled. The virtual agents monitor the student's actions and provide advice in the learning process once a mistake of sequential procedures occurs. The students can carry out non-sequential procedures in their own way. Formative evaluation studies were iteratively carried out with the target students to improve the design of VLE. The evaluation results show that the participants were satisfied with the VLE.

40|$|Background. Even {{though the}} {{effectiveness}} of medi-tation and relaxation skills is controversial in blood pressure control, extensive field studies are limited. A national study targeting 50 communities randomly se-lected from northern Taiwan was conducted to test and compare {{the effectiveness of}} hypertension control incorporating three strategies. Methods. Five hundred ninety hypertensives identi-fied from 3, 128 adults at a screening survey among the 50 communities {{were invited to participate}} in the study and were randomly assigned to three treatment modalities, (a) relaxation techniques training at home, (b) routine blood pressure measurement by a health professional, and (c) reading <b>self-learning</b> <b>packages,</b> or to a control group. Results. After a 2 -month intervention period, the three treatment groups showed a significant reduc-tion in systolic blood pressure levels compared with the control group (11. O mm Hg for group 1, 9. 2 mm Hg for group 2, and 5. 1 mm Hg for group 3). The relax-ation group had the most significant reduction in systolic blood pressure levels, followed by the rou-tine blood pressure monitoring group and the self-learning group. However, the effect of relaxation training at home was not significantly greater than routine blood pressure measurement by a health pro-fessional. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Information and Communication Technology {{development}} is very fast, easy to reach will allow educators to engender the works {{that will help}} learners in learning, such as self-directed learning easy through a network of Information and Communication Technology is there, sharing knowledge, sharing information can even carried sharing instructional media such as multimedia-based learning modules. Multimedia learning modules {{can be interpreted as}} a <b>self-learning</b> <b>package</b> which includes a series of learning experiences planned and systematically designed to help learners achieve learning goals that are multimedia based. Purpose he designed a learning module is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of learning in school, good time, funds, facilities, and personnel in order to achieve the optimal goal. Characteristics into consideration in the design of multimedia-based learning modules are; First, presented learning materials should be presented in a logical and systematic. Second, the learning module must have a mechanism to measure student achievement of learning objectives, primarily to provide feedback for learners in achieving mastery learning. While the development of multimedia learning modules, there are five stages of the procedure which includes First analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The use of multimedia-based learning module is one business that can be done by the teachers. Multimedia-based learning modules today is not too difficult to achieve, either by producing (designing) alone or sharing by fellow educators. Sharing learning modules not only be done on one area or place but can be done by anyone, anywhere and at anytime by using Information and Communication Technology...|$|E
