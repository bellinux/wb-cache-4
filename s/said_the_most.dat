5|$|The {{tour was}} titled Best of Both Worlds Tour after {{the song of}} the same name, which was the theme to Hannah Montana and was {{released}} on the series' first soundtrack. The title was chosen because of how the concert alternates between Cyrus performing as Hannah Montana and herself. She described the tour to differentiate the two according to their respective styles and depict how one girl was able to have two sides to her. She <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable difference between the two characters was the style of music, rather than physical appearance. According to her, Hannah Montana was direct pop music, while her own style was more rock music-oriented and included real-life scenarios set to tunes. Cyrus rehearsed for the tour simultaneous to filming the final episodes for the second season of Hannah Montana from September to October2007.|$|E
5|$|At 09:35 September 2, {{while the}} North Koreans were {{attempting}} to destroy the engineer troops at {{the southern edge of}} Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E

The missing tooth was not created with prosthetics or visual effects, but is naturally occurring: Helms never had an adult incisor grow, and got a dental implant as a teenager, which was removed for filming.|$|E

500|$|The {{duration}} of [...] "Change" [...] is four minutes and forty six seconds. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the song's genre as a [...] "kind of orthodontically perfect pop rock". He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> country {{part of the}} song were lyrics that referenced Catholicism with the word [...] "hallelujah". It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. [...] It is written in the key of F major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from F3 to B♭4. They were described to have a nasal tone when using her voice above mezzo forte. It follows the chord progression F–F/E–Dm–B♭. [...] "Change" [...] relies on a string-swathed instrumentation.|$|E

It follows the chord progression FCGmB♭-C. Tom Ronald of Great American Country interpreted the song's message to be about [...] "taking courage on the dating circuit." [...] In a different perspective, Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine said the lyrics [...] "And I don't know why but with you / I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless" [...] demonstrated how Swift enjoyed making a scene.

500|$|The filmmakers {{retained}} {{the names of}} the real-life protagonists, though several supporting characters were composites of people and types of people from the era. Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins; five actresses campaigned for the role, including Reese Witherspoon and Hilary Swank. Howard and Grazer suggested Jolie; Eastwood agreed, believing that her face fit the period setting. Jolie joined the production in [...] She was initially reluctant because, as a mother, she found the subject matter distressing. She said she was persuaded by Eastwood's involvement, and the screenplay's depiction of Collins as someone who recovered from adversity and had the strength to fight the odds. Jolie found playing Collins very emotional. She <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> difficult part was relating to the character, because Collins was relatively passive. Jolie ultimately based her performance on her own mother, who died in 2007. For scenes at the telephone exchange, Jolie learned to roller skate in high heels, a documented practice of the period.|$|E

500|$|... "Galentine's Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show {{managed to}} cram more character development into 22 minutes than I thought possible.

[...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie when {{she realized she had}} to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E
500|$|The Utah {{portion of}} I-70 was not {{completed}} to Interstate Highway standards until 1990, {{when the second}} Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated. A second dedication ceremony {{was held at the}} bridge declaring the Utah portion of I-70 complete. Archie Hamilton, one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) long enough to see I-70 progress from conception to completion, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> memorable moment was seeing the excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon. He said before construction began, he could stand in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon. To carve the first [...] through the canyon required excavating [...] of rock. It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $183.5million, $105.5million (1970, $595million in 2008) to build the first two lanes, and $78million (1990, $130million in 2008) to construct the rest. At the 1970 dedication, it was noted the cost of land acquisition helped to offset the cost of the massive excavation. UDOT acquired the right of way to build the majority of I-70 from the BLM at the lowest cost per mile of any highway in Utah.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the play}} is {{concerned}} with demonstrating the immensity of the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18. For example, he finds it difficult {{to be away from}} his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue his work or return to Canada. To depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another. The two argue, but their interactions demonstrate the kind of love that Number 18 can only dream of. In the 2012 cross-Canada tour, a torn picture of Number 18's family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what the character has lost. This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father. [...] Anna Borowiecki of the St. Albert Gazette called the play a story of [...] "fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "pilot episode" [...] was {{generally}} well received by fans and critics. Variety criticized the episode for [...] "using reworked concepts", but praised {{the production and}} noted its potential. Of the acting, Variety said [...] "Duchovny's delineation of a serious scientist {{with a sense of}} humor should win him partisans and Anderson's wavering doubter connects well. They're a solid team...'" [...] Variety praised the writing and direction: [...] "Mandel's cool direction of Carter's ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci-fi a boost." [...] The magazine concluded, [...] "Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self-conscious and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV." [...] Entertainment Weekly said that Scully [...] "was set up as a scoffing skeptic" [...] in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of four episodes, the magazine called The X-Files [...] "the most paranoid, subversive show on TV", noting the [...] "marvelous tension between Anderson—who is dubious about these events—and Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer". Virgin Media <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> memorable [...] "Monster-of-the-Week" [...] was Eugene Tooms from [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms".|$|E
500|$|BUF Compagnie {{served as}} the lead visual effects vender working on the film, with Digital Domain also {{providing}} work on the film. Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J. M. W. Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim. Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of Fuel VFX, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> challenging task was interpreting what the Bifröst would look like, [...] "You can't Google what these things look like—they are totally imagined and within {{the heads of the}} stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifröst and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo. In the film, Odin enters {{what is known as the}} [...] "Odinsleep" [...] in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, [...] "For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space".|$|E
