5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired falconry bird, and {{has been used in}} falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> take the quarry. The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E

25|$|Uniting the Church of Byzantium {{with that}} of Rome was a simple matter, since all the {{bargaining}} chips were {{in the hands of}} the Roman Catholic West. John VIII, as the de facto head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the Filioque dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in Ferrara and Florence, not only at the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to <b>stoop</b> <b>to,</b> but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.|$|E
25|$|In Shakespeare's version, Lear, King of Britain, {{is growing}} old, {{and decides to}} divide his kingdom among his three daughters – Goneril, wife of the Duke of Albany, Regan, wife of the Duke of Cornwall, and the {{youngest}} daughter, Cordelia, sought in marriage by the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France. The King decides that he will give {{the best part of}} the kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot or will not <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves him as much as she should, and that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride.|$|E
25|$|The {{journals}} of the reigns of George IV and William IV, extending from 1817 to 1837, {{were published in}} obedience to his directions almost ten years after his death. Few publications have been received with greater interest by the public; five large editions were sold {{in little more than}} a year, and the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made on the mind of a competent observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he associated. Greville did not <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> collect or record private scandal. His object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes which led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind him a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century. Greville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the Past and Present Policy of England in Ireland, in which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.|$|E

25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the gradual}} {{condemnation}} {{of the work and}} the accusation that Sigonio had created it himself, there were some holdouts. Robinson Ellis, in 1893, argued that the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio, while probably not a genuine work of Cicero's, was not a forgery by Sigonio. He reasoned that, because St. Ambrose Traversari had claimed to have found a copy of the work so close to its rediscovery by Sigonio in 1583, it was possible that Sigonio had simply found the Perugian text. He also proposed the idea that, because the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio contained all of the extant fragments from Lactantius's work, the true Consolatio had been lost and replaced by a [...] "spurious one" [...] in the distant past that was read by Lactantius, Augustine, and Jerome, who mistakenly assumed its veracity; this false Consolatio was then rediscovered by Sigonio, who unwittingly believed it also to be genuine. Finally, Ellis argued that, because Sigonio was a man of [...] "high character" [...] who had spent much of his life editing the fragments of Cicero, for Sigonio to <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> forgery would have been completely out of character.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote Peccavi should <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> this".|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song were criticized with BBC's Nick Reynolds saying that {{although}} the group [...] "reinvent themselves as domestic goddesses for some lucky man", the song was neither convincing nor good. He further opined [...] "I thought {{they were supposed to}} be independent women?!" [...] juxtaposing it with the group's earlier song [...] "Independent Women" [...] (2000). Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone echoed his statements, writing [...] "Jerkins should hang his head in shame for having a hand in the maudlin 'Cater 2 U,' a saccharine tune about how low Knowles, Rowland and Williams will <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> prove their devotion to their man... Since when did these independent women become so craven?". Sean Fennessey of Pitchfork Media also stated that [...] "their swan song of sorts... completely defies the winking empowerment most of their greatest jams provided". He further described the production as [...] "milky and slight", the chorus as [...] "limp" [...] and the song overally as [...] "a Prince mock-up of the worst kind". Jess Harvell of the same website offered similar criticism: [...] " [...] reneged on everything early DC stood for in a parade of kept-wifey pleas". Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine dismissed the sincerity of the lyrics classifying [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] as a [...] "queasy" [...] song. Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph panned it as [...] "cringe inducing, with lots of sensuous moaning". Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote, [...] "I thought this was the kind of song bands recorded by mistake then hid guiltily in the attic".|$|E
500|$|The {{origins and}} {{meanings}} of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. In 1898, A Dictionary of British Folklore contained the belief that {{an explanation of the}} game was of pagan origin, based on the Sheffield Glossary comparison of Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, [...] "Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Treyja wept gold." [...] Believing the first instance to be indicative of Pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a [...] "ring" [...] around the roses and bowing with the all [...] "fall down" [...] as a curtsy. In 1892, the American writer, Eugene Field wrote a poem titled Teeny-Weeny that specifically referred to fey folk playing ring-a-rosie. According to Games and Songs of American Children, published in 1883, the [...] "rosie" [...] was a reference to the French word for rose tree and the children would dance and <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> the person in the center. Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme. Addy's interpretation failed to account for the sneezing, which had not carried over to the United States and was losing ground in Britain, as another instance of the Pagan influence. Again in 1898, sneezing was then noted to be indicative of many superstitious and supernatural beliefs across differing cultures.|$|E
500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille is the most {{straightforward}} and formulaic picture to date from Pixar Animation Studios, but it is also among the most enchanting and touching."

[...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't <b>stoop</b> <b>to</b> kid-pandering jokes based on back talk and bodily gases." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like. It's also my pick for Pixar's best." ...|$|E
