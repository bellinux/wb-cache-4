We focused on the ratio of plant numbers to the total mass of contaminant as the factor for selection of contaminant concentration, nature of soil type and plant species in a diesel phytoremediation project. Based {{on the results of}} a preliminary test, Scirpus grossus could survive when the ratio of plant numbers to the total mass of diesel was more than 0. 15 for 3 % (Vdiesel/Vwater) after 14 days of exposure in a sub–surface flow system (SSF) containing 780 mL of diesel contaminated water with 33 % percentage <b>of</b> <b>withered</b> <b>plants.</b> In a phyto{{toxicity test}} containing 7 L of diesel contaminated water, S. grossus could also survive with the ratio more than 0. 07 for 2 % (Vdiesel/Vwater) for 72 days of exposure with 36 % percentage <b>of</b> <b>withered</b> <b>plants.</b> Based on the results of the preliminary and phytotoxicity tests, selection of diesel concentration in pilot scale containing 500 L of diesel contaminated water with 50 plants was fixed.

40|$|The {{relations}} between population {{change of the}} Japanese field vole Microtus montebelli and extrinsic factors (predators, foods and weather) were discussed {{on the basis of}} the results of investigation at near the summit of Mt. Hitome for fice years (from December 1975 to December 1980). We refer also to whether the vole 2 ̆ 7 s outbreaks recorded so far are related to the weather in the south district of Mt. Aso. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The vole population at Mt. Hitome reached to a peak density (outbreak) in June 1976, afterwards declining until December 1980. 2. It appeared that predators and weather had no direct influence on the population change there. 3. Several patches <b>of</b> <b>withered</b> <b>plants</b> which consist mainly of eulalia (Miscanthus sinensis) and bamboo grasses (Sasa nipponica and Arundinaria pygmaea) were caused by the vole 2 ̆ 7 s damage. Although the population might have declined due to shortage of food supply in such an area, it did not necessarily seem to follow that a food supply has always a direct influence on the population change. 4. The vole 2 ̆ 7 s outbreaks appeared to be concerned with scanty precipitation in the south district of Mt. Aso, whereas did not with it at Mt. Hitome. Thus, there seemed to be some regional differences in this respect. 5. Up to the present there seems to be no single extrinsic factor that, by itself, causes population changes. It seems possible that the vole must be exposed to several factors, acting together, in order to experience an increase in population size. 九重の一目山におけるハタネズミ Microtus montebelli について， 5 年間（ 1975 年 12 月～ 1980 年 12 月）に及ぶ個体群変動と外的要因（捕食者，食物および天候）との関連，更に記録に残されている阿蘇地域における本種の大発生と天候との関係について検討した． 1 ）一目山の個体群は 1976 年 6 月に大発生し，その後に若干の増減を示したものの全体的に漸減傾向を辿り，調査期間中には再び大発生レベルの個体数には達しなかった． 2 ）九重におけるこのようなハタネズミの個体数変動と捕食者および天候との間には明確な関係を見出し得なかった． 3 ）一目山における本種の分布は均一でなく，ススキやササの繁茂地を中心としてパッチ状を呈した．このような場所では食物条件は非常に悪化し，これが個体数変動に影響を及ぼした可能性もあるが，逆に食物条件は個体群の変動に必ずしも影響するものではないことも知られた． 4 ）阿蘇における本種の大発生と年降水量の過小との間にはかなり明瞭な相関が認められた．しかし，九重ではこのような一致は見られず，相関のあり方には地域差のあることが推察された． 5 ）本種の個体群変動に必然的に作用する外的要因を見出し得なかった．個体数の増加はこれらの外的要因が相互に絡み合って生じるものと思われる...|$|R

As important ecological factors for vegetation restoration and reconstruction, soil water and the movement rules of it {{have always been the}} focus of many studies (Zang et al. 2010; Zou et al. 2012, 2013). Based on analysis of parameter changes of moisture characteristic curves and penetration coefficient curves caused by changes in soil structure as a result of mining, as well as the adverse effects on the local environment caused by changes in the vadose zone, it can be concluded that ground fissures and surface subsidence have a large impact on soil water migration. Wang et al. (2006) found that soil porosity increased and bulk density decreased because of coal mining subsidence, which led to high soil water losses in the dry season. Zang et al. (2012) studied the effects of coal mining subsidence on lateral seepage and vertical infiltration rate for the sandy slope.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of nitrate reductase (NR) regulation under long-term anoxia in roots of whole {{plants and the}} putative role of nitrate in anoxia tolerance have been addressed. NR activity in tomato roots increased significantly after 24 h of anaerobiosis and increased further by 48 h, with a concomitant release of nitrite into the culture medium. Anoxia promoted NR activation through dissociation of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein inhibitor and NR dephosphorylation. After 24 h of anoxia, {{the total amount of}} NR increased slightly up to 48 h. However, NR-mRNA levels remained constant between 0 h and 24 h of root anoxia and decreased after 48 h. This is probably due to the inhibition of NR degradation and the accumulation of its native form. NR was slightly dephosphorylated in the absence of oxygen and nitrate. Under anoxia, NR dephosphorylation was modulated by nitrate-controlled NR activity. In addition, the presence of nitrate prevents anoxic symptoms on leaves and delays wilting by 48 h during root anoxia. In the absence <b>of</b> nitrate, <b>plants</b> <b>withered</b> within 24 h, as they did with tungstate treatment, an inhibitor of NR activity.
