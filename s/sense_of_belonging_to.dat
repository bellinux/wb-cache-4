5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} one factor {{identified}} by Scialdone et al. [18] in their investigation of how core and peripheral members use language to create “intimacy among team members” thus “building solidarity in teams”. Specifically, for H 3 and H 4, {{we examined the}} use of inclusive pronouns as one way that team members build a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> the group. Scialdone et al. [18] noted that such use of inclusive pronouns is “consistent with Bagozzi and Dholakia [22]’s argument {{about the importance of}} we-intention in Linux user groups, i.e., when individuals think themselves as ‘us’ or ‘we’ and so attempt to act in a joint way”.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is {{intimate}} relationship peak experiences arising from loving or sexual involvement. Different types of peak experiences were described and their relevance to relationship functioning explored qualitatively and quantitatively. In a convenience sample (N = 298), participants who identified having peak experiences were on average significantly older, more passionate, more sexually responsive and had less negative affect. Participants reporting peak experiences of a mystical nature tended to be significantly older and more spiritually focused. We concluded that relationship peak and mystical peak experiences represent important and memorable occasions which are personally significant to some couple members, deepening their bond. As such, therapists may strengthen partners’ <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the relationship by discussion of peak experiences...|$|R

25|$|Under Dermott's influence, penmanship, and oratory, the new Grand Lodge grew to be {{a serious}} {{challenge}} to the original. The Antient's lodges were warranted from 1752, a practice not taken up by the Moderns for another two decades. As the unaffiliated lodges increasingly saw the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> a larger organisation, they usually found that the Antients practice was closer to their own, although it was known for lodges to change allegiance from the Antients to the Moderns. The fact that the practices eventually adopted by the United Grand Lodge largely reflect those of the Antients is attributable to Dermott's industry.|$|E
25|$|Support for Palermo {{is closely}} {{associated}} with a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> Sicily; indeed, {{it is not uncommon}} to see Sicilian flags waved by fans and ultras during Palermo matches. Palermo fans are also twinned with Lecce ultras. The latter was even more strengthened in recent times by the acquisition of Fabrizio Miccoli, who is originally from the outskirts of Lecce and a well-known supporter of the local team, who went on to become a key player and captain for the Sicilians. Miccoli was also the most prolific Palermo player, setting records for: most Serie A league goals (74, from 2007–2013), most goals in all competitions (81, from 2007–2013) and most Serie A league appearances (165, from 2007–2013).|$|E

25|$|The {{seizure of}} power by {{dictator}} Ioannis Metaxas in 1936 had a significant bearing on the pattern of Greek–Jewish relations in Thessaloniki. Metaxas' regime was not antisemitic; it perceived the Venizelists and the Communists as its political enemies, and Bulgaria as its major foreign enemy. This endeared Metaxas to two influential Jewish groups: the upper/middle classes, which felt threatened by organized labor and the socialist movement, and Jewish refugees who had fled Bulgaria and the Bitola region during the Balkan Wars. Antisemitic organizations and publications were banned {{and support for the}} regime was sufficiently strong for a Jewish charter of the regime-sponsored National Organisation of Youth (EON) to be formed. This reinforced the trend of national self-identification as Greeks among the Jews of Salonika, who had been Greek citizens since 1913. Even in the concentration camps, Greek Jews never ceased to affirm their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the Greek nation.|$|E

After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly.

25|$|The Laurel {{apartment}} building on 82nd Street at Northern Boulevard {{was the first}} of the Queensboro Corporation buildings in Jackson Heights, completed in 1914 with a small courtyard. The Greystones on either side of 80th Street between 37th and 35th Avenues were completed in 1918 with a design by architect George H. Wells. There was leftover unused space, which was converted to parks, gardens, and recreational areas, including a golf course; much of this leftover space, including the golf course, no longer exists. This was followed by the 1919 construction of the Andrew J. Thomas-designed Linden Court, a 10-building complex between 84th Street, 85th Streets, 37th Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue. The two sets of 5 buildings each, separated by a gated garden with linden trees and two pathways, included parking spaces with single-story garages accessed via narrow driveways, the first Jackson Heights development to do so; gaps at regular intervals in the perimeter wall; a layout that provided light and ventilation to the apartments, as well as fostered a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> a community; the area's first co-op; and now-prevalent private gardens surrounded by the building blocks.|$|E

500|$|When George {{was about}} three years old, {{the family moved to}} Calgary for a while to be near Frances' ailing mother, and he formed {{memories}} of events such as the Calgary Stampede. When George was six, the family returned to the United States and moved to Mitchell, South Dakota, a community of 12,000. McGovern attended public schools there and was an average student. He was painfully shy as a child and was afraid to speak in class during first grade. His only reproachable behavior was going to see movies, which were among the worldly amusements forbidden to good Wesleyan Methodists. Otherwise he had a normal childhood marked by visits to the renowned Mitchell Corn Palace and what he later termed [...] "a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> a particular place and knowing your part in it". He would, however, long remember the Dust Bowl storms and grasshopper plagues that swept the prairie states during the Great Depression. The McGovern family lived {{on the edge of the}} poverty line for much of the 1920s and 1930s. Growing up amid that lack of affluence gave young George a lifelong sympathy for underpaid workers and struggling farmers. He was influenced by the currents of populism and agrarian unrest and by the [...] "practical divinity" [...] teachings of cleric John Wesley that sought to fight poverty, injustice, and ignorance.|$|E

40|$|Despite all {{recent changes}} in families, and maybe because of them, {{the birth of a}} child remains an event of intense expectation, investment, and {{symbolic}} meaning. In this chapter, we offer a simultaneously new, innovative, and contemporary perspective on the social construction of the family through the lens of family rituals, specifically directed to the postnatal hospital visit following {{the birth of a child}}. The raw data were collected through episodic interviews carried out to Portuguese middle-class men and women. A qualitative content analysis of their detailed descriptions was then conducted making use of software NVivo (©QSR International). The sociological perspective we used allows us to conclude that the moment of the birth of a child is a quintessential time-space for the social construction of the family. Around the baby, for the task of rocking the cradle, men and women join and take on their old and new roles. While the postnatal hospital visit allows the presentation of the newborn family member for the extended family and friends, it strongly underlies the strategies and <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> one particular family, thereby serving the purpose of its social construction...|$|R
