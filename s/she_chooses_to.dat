25|$|Given the definition, {{once the}} child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in gender roles that their {{same-sex}} models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or androgyny, their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or <b>she</b> <b>chooses</b> <b>to</b> emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for {{who they are and}} how they should behave.|$|E
