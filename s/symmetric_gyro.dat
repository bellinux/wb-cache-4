40|$|Chaotic {{motion of}} a <b>symmetric</b> <b>gyro</b> {{subjected}} to a harmonic base excitation is investigated in this note. The Melnikov method is applied {{to show that the}} system possesses a Smale horse when it is subjected to small excitation. The transition from regular motion to chaotic motion is investigated through numerical integration in conjunction with Poincar 9 map. It is shown that as the spin velocity increases, the chaotic motion turns into a regular motion. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTaking {{advantage}} of the angular momentum of the rotating gyroscope, gyrostabilizer systems are expected to become more widely actualized as they provide {{an effective means of}} motion control with several significant advantages for various structures. In this paper, a <b>symmetric</b> <b>gyro</b> with coupling to the tip mass of a column mounted on a vibrating base is considered. The non- linear motions of the gyro-column system and the equations of motion for the system are derived following energy (Lagrange) based approaches and examples provided. On the other hand, the effect of the angular velocity of the gyroscope is studied, and it is shown that the angular velocity (spin velocity) : of gyroscope has a significant effect on the behavior of the dynamic motion. It is also shown how the damper and spring due to the motion between the suporting gimbal and tip mass influence the dynamic behavior of the gyroscope. It was concluded that the numerical investigations of this combined system has not been investigated up to the present time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A simple {{satellite}} is a <b>symmetric</b> <b>gyro.</b> Satellites {{are used}} for communications, weather forecasts, surveying and in several other scienti c and military applications. In particular, for military use secure communications are very important. As chaotic signals are usually broadband and noise like, synchronized chaotic systems {{can be used as}} cipher generators for secure communication. This paper presents chaos synchronization of two identical chaotic motions of symmetric gyros. It has been demonstrated that applying four different kinds of one-way coupling conditions can synchronize two identical chaotic systems. The sign of the sub-Liapunov exponent has been used as an indicator for the occurrence of chaos synchronization. It has also been found that when chaos synchronization occurs the positive major sub-Liapunov exponent transverses the zero value and becomes negative for the last time. Chaos synchronization can also be shown by phase trajectory. In addition, synchronization time is also examined. Furthermore, it has been found that different distances of the initial conditions between the master system and slave system do not affect the occurrence of chaos synchronization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the Humanoid Leagues {{balancing}} during {{walking and}} run-ning {{is still the}} biggest challenge {{for most of the}} teams. We present here some work in which a dynamic walker is stabilised by using a fast heavy rotor, a gyro. The dynamics of a <b>symmetric,</b> fast rotating <b>gyro</b> is dif-ferent from that of a non-rotating solid body, e. g. in the case of small disturbances it tends to keep the axes the same. Results show that the rotor enhances the stability of the walking in the simulations. In a model for an actuated robot the rotor is used as a reaction wheel, i. e. the pitch of the robot is stabilised by accelerating and decelerating it. We see this method –though it is not biologically inspired – as an intermediate step for learning balancing in biped robots. The control algorithm responsible for balancing the pitch is discussed in detail. The simulations show that, by using this kind of stabilisation, movements like stand up, walk and jump are easily possible by using open loop control for the legs, how-ever high torques for the rotor are necessary. Finally, a robot design that consists just of a trunk is presented. ...|$|R
