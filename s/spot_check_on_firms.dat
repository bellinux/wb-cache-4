It has been shown that the total weight of both classes of VG can be minimized by the proper selection of the relative strengths of the members of each system.

There are more than 150 cellular level measurements. Netmonitoring is based on crowdsourcing and mobile mapping. Mobile mapping is the process of collecting geospatial data using mapping sensors mounted on a mobile platform. The search of base stations was carried out by means of such programs as Netmonitoring, Network Signal Info and Antennas. The resulting data, namely the network code, “cell ID” and local area code, were used for geo-information programs creation. The experience in designing KML and Visual Basic languages programs Netmonitoring and AstraNetMonitoring is described in this paper...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the information from household surveys, information was also obtained from water vendors through structured interviews that took place at Duniyar Yangaruwa (water vendor’s world) and the neighboring places where water vendors are found. It took place concurrently with the household survey. Interviews were conducted with 20 retail and 10 wholesale vendors. Respondents were recruited randomly at water collection points while queuing, {{and in some cases}} through word of mouth as employed in Wutich et al. (2016) based on their acceptability to participate because they tend to be very sceptical about interviews. Vendors were asked about water sources, water quality, water price, average time spent queuing, number of trips made daily and distance to the sales point. Focus group discussion (FGD) with the researcher and 5 wholesale vendors were then conducted at a water kiosk and then with five (5) retail water vendors at Duniyar Yangaruwa separately in November 2009. Discussion was recorded using paper and pencil. Between 2009 and now, the dollar exchange rate has gone up considerably (almost doubled) though there are no appreciable price differences of vended water between the two periods. <b>Spot</b> <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> sales prices were made to verify this. Nevertheless, the current rate of ₦ 305 per US$ is used where dollar equivalents are given in the text.|$|R
40|$|The {{subjects}} {{of this article}} are Kozhevnikov and Chistovitch's finding regarding the constancy of relative syllable durations and the inconstancy of relative speech sound durations for different rates of speech, and their proposal that vowels are elided because the necessary minimum duration of a consonant consumes {{all the time that}} happens to have been assigned to the syllable. The relative consonant durations of seven informants (six languages) varied with speaking rate but mostly not as predicted by Kozhevnikov and Chistovitch. Instead of rising continuously at faster rates, the relative consonantal durations decreased again. The variation was so small, however, that a linear model, assuming a constant consonatal proportion, provided an excellent approximation to the results. A <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the syllables in two selected words in the German sample revealed that the relative syllable durations were not less variable than the relative consonant durations there. Several problems and difficulties related to speech production are discussed in general terms. Are segments squeezed out when temporally constrained, or are they deliberately omitted? If segments or gestures are suppressed during production, does this occur peripherally (in the vocal tract) or centrally (in the brain) ? It is concluded that most examples of segment synkope and syllable contraction in everyday speech are regular and habitual and are not necessarily caused by increasing speaking rate, although their occurrence has the effect of accelerating the message...|$|R

On top of the 6-8 hours of training per day, 18 training sessions per week (with growing intensity as Beijing drew near), he also poured his passion into the diabetes community in Canada and tried to remain connected to the US community he had built. Emails came in from {{parents of children with}} diabetes and diabetic athletes from around the world, plus squeezing in over 75 speaking events in 2007 alone - Jarvis was stretched thin. In the peak of the racing season, Jarvis was pulled from a team meeting by the team manager to inform him of a [...] "whereabouts failure". As Jarvis was one of the 5 members of the Olympic rowing team selected for a new focused initiative to track the whereabouts of the worlds top athletes, to insure at any time a <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> banned substance abuse could be possible, he needed to submit proper documentation to the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport - a task he neglected to comply with.

Jarvis was unable to manage his email stream and had missed two emails from the CCES who had faulted him with inadequate information and given 2 warnings.|$|R
