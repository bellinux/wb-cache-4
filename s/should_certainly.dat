5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Boucher {{wrote that}} the book belongs [...] "pretty much to the private-eye school" [...] of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming [...] "manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and {{produced}} as exciting a gambling sequence as I've ever read. But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader {{through a set of}} tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the Stones {{opened their}} set, Jagger {{addressed}} the crowd, {{asking them to}} be quiet so he could read something {{as a tribute to}} Jones. He then read two stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on John Keats's death, Adonaïs, from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred cabbage white butterflies were released, despite the Royal Parks authority having stipulated before the concert that any butterflies released by the Stones should be sterilised and <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> not be of the voracious cabbage white genus (Pieris spp.). 2,500 butterflies were due to be released, but due to the hot weather, many of them died from lack of air in storage. Watts later said that the butterflies [...] "were a bit sad, there were casualties. It was like the Somme".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{had thought}} he was in mid-stream when he issued the order. In fact, he was about seven leagues (about [...] ) north of his proper course, and in the grasp of strong {{currents}} which steered his ships towards the northwest. [...] Propelled by an easterly wind, the fleet was gradually closing on the north-south shore near Île-aux-Oeufs. [...] When Captain Paddon reported to Walker that land had been sighted around 10:30 pm, presumably dead ahead, Walker assumed that the fleet was approaching the south shore, and ordered the fleet to wear, and bring-to on the other tack, {{before he went to}} bed. [...] This manoeuvre put the fleet onto a more northerly heading. [...] Some minutes later, an army captain named Goddard roused Walker, claiming to see breakers ahead. [...] Walker dismissed the advice and the man, but Goddard returned, insisting that the admiral [...] "come upon deck myself, or we <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> be lost".|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews {{for the first}} season were very positive, with critics noting the high production values, the well-realized world, compelling characters, and giving particular note {{to the strength of}} the child actors. Tim Goodman's review for The Hollywood Reporter stated, [...] "a few minutes into HBO's epic Game of Thrones series, it's clear that the hype was right and the wait was worth it". Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "...a great and thundering series of political and psychological intrigue bristling with vivid characters, cross-hatched with tantalizing plotlines and seasoned with a splash of fantasy". New York Posts Linda Stasi gave Thrones 3.5/4 stars stating, [...] "The art direction, acting and incredible sets are as breathtaking as the massive scope of the series". Many critics praised Peter Dinklage for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, with Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly stating, [...] "...if Dinklage doesn't get an Emmy for his clever, rude Tyrion Lannister, I'll be gobsmacked" [...] and Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times stating, [...] "If the man doesn't win an Emmy, heads <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> roll".|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} action taken {{to clarify the}} {{situation}} was Millar v Taylor. Andrew Millar, a British publisher, purchased the rights to James Thomson's The Seasons in 1729, and when the copyright term expired, a competing publisher named Robert Taylor began issuing his own reprints of the work. Millar sued, {{and went to the}} Court of King's Bench to obtain an injunction and advocate perpetual copyright at common law. The jury found that the facts submitted by Millar were accurate, and asked the judges to clarify whether common law copyright existed. The first arguments were delivered on 30 June 1767, with John Dunning representing Millar and Edward Thurlow representing Taylor. A second set of arguments were submitted for Millar by William Blackstone on 7 June, and judgment was given on 20 April 1769. The final decision, written by Lord Mansfield and endorsed by Aston and Willes JJ, confirmed that there existed copyright at common law that turned [...] "upon Principles before and independent" [...] of the Statute of Anne, something justified because it was right [...] "that an Author should reap the pecuniary Profits of his own Ingenuity and Labour". In other words, regardless of the Statute, there existed a perpetual copyright under the common law. Yates J dissented, {{on the grounds that the}} focus on the author obscured the effect this decision would have on [...] "the rest of mankind", which he felt would be to create a virtual monopoly, something that would harm the public and <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> not be considered [...] "an encouragement of the propagation of learning".|$|E

Despite this, {{and the fact that the}} available forces never reached the numbers he thought were required, Brooke considered the situation far from [...] "helpless" [...] in case the Germans invaded. [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> have a desperate struggle and the future might well have hung in the balance, but I certainly felt that given a fair share of the fortunes of war we <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> succeed in finally defending these shores", he wrote after the war.

All the others are worthy of a village." [...] The government responded to these demands for grander fountains by commissioning the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons (1739) [...] and by an even grander project for a square with fountains, Place Louis XV, which became the Place de la Concorde.|$|E

2500|$|Along with Sádlo, Večtomov was {{considered}} one of Czechoslovakia's leading classical artists, drawing comparisons in the international press to Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who had been his contemporary at the Moscow Conservatory. Večtomov was best known for his inimitably sweet tone. “As the concerto develops, it is clear that Večtomov, so august a member of the Czech Trio, was certainly a big enough concerto soloist, but one who does not seek to impose his personality onto the music. Instead he illuminates it from within.” Of the same recording, Fanfare observed: “I am glad to have discovered Saša Večtomov’s playing, for on this evidence he was a world-class artist … his aristocratic playing deserves a hearing, and the disc <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> be of interest to cellists and collectors." ...|$|E

Rosamund was the {{daughter}} of Algernon Henry Grosvenor (1864–1907), and the granddaughter of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury. Vita met Rosamund at Miss Woolf's school in 1899, when Rosamund had been invited to cheer Vita up while her father was fighting in the Second Boer War. Rosamund and Vita later shared a governess for their morning lessons. As they grew up together, Vita fell in love with Rosamund, whom she called 'Roddie' or 'Rose' or 'the Rubens lady'. Rosamund, in turn, was besotted with Vita. [...] "Oh, I dare say I realized vaguely that I had no business to sleep with Rosamund, and I <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> never have allowed anyone to find it out," [...] she admits in her journal, but she saw no real conflict: [...] "I really was innocent." ...|$|E

He went on to state that the UN's failure to halt aggression against Portugal, showed that effective power in the U.N. had passed to the Communist and Afro-Asian countries. Dr. Salazar also accused Britain of delaying for a week her reply to Portugal's request to be allowed the use of certain airfields.

Moses then asked whether perhaps Aaron had been negligent through his grief and allowed the sacrifice to become defiled, but Aaron exclaimed with [...] that these events and even more could have befallen him, but Aaron would not show such disrespect to sacrifices. Thereupon Moses exclaimed that Aaron <b>should</b> <b>certainly</b> have eaten it, as Moses had commanded in [...] Aaron argued from analogy to the tithe (as in Rabbi Nehemiah's version), and Moses accepted Aaron's argument.
