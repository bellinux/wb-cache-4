This requirement is {{more or less the same}} with the Islamic ‘aqad’ however it comes together with the package the prohibition of any element of uncertainty, interest, etc to make sure it complies with the syariah standard. Most of the conventional contract has ignored few aspects of the Islamic contract such as non-spot in the exchange of ribawi item, unjustified increase of premium, and conditional aqad which are totally prohibited. Therefore Islamic Banking in Malaysia has put strong effort to curb these problems and provides a way out by introducing many syariah compliance products and concepts and one of them is al- wa’ad which is the main concern on this article. As a result, by doing this research, it can help people to discover how far the concept of al-wa’ad had been applied in Islamic Banking in Malaysia by comparing its application among few banks including Islamic Bank as well as conventional banks with Islamic Banking window...|$|E

The main goal was to identify these characteristics of contract and assess their balance in relation to the purpose and <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> and long term benefit of both sides of the contract. Attitudes on the maturity of the contract characteristics have been collected between farmers and state administrators in survey (as sites of the contract) on national level and also in four regional case studies. It was revealed that most of the contract characteristics were not mature enough to serve to long term benefit for both sides of the contract, which decreases potential effectiveness of the agri-environmental policy. These are for example: information availability, trust between sides of the contract, tendencies to strategic behaviour, power distribution in the contract, sharing risks in the contract, adequacy of compensation level. Control and penalty system was regarded as rather adequate. Not mature institutions and characteristics of the contract increase transaction costs of both sides of the contract and decrease willingness to renew the contracts in future. The results of the research are for the state administration a good base for improvement of the contract in order to increase effectiveness of the agri-environmental policy in question...|$|E

V naslednjih poglavjih bomo opisali pogodbo o faktoringu in njene udeležence. Faktoring je kratkoročni vir, ki zagotavlja tekočo likvidnost podjetjem. Za faktoring so primerna majhna in srednje velika podjetja, ki prodajajo z odloženim rokom plačila. Faktoring temelji na odstopu terjatev podjetjem ali bankam, ki imajo za to pooblastila, in nato ta podjetja oziroma faktorji izterjajo od dolžnikov denarna sredstva. Zato se sklene pogodba o faktoringu, da se odstopnik terjatev oziroma klient in faktor dogovorita, katere terjatve bodo predmet pogodbe in katere pravice in obveznosti morata izpolnjevati. Faktor in klient skleneta okvirno pogodbo, to je pogodbo o faktoringu. Dogovorita se o predujmu, ki ga faktor mora plačati klientu po prevzemu terjatev in provizijah ter obrestih, ki jih faktor za svoje delo zaračuna. At the {{beginning}} of the diploma thesis, we will define factoring, what functions it includes, and we will describe various types of factoring and explain {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} factoring. In the following chapters, we will describe the factoring contract and its parties. Factoring is a short-term source which ensures current liquidity to the companies. For factoring, small and middle-sized companies are appropriate, which sell with a deferred payment. Factoring is based on the assignment agreement with companies or banks which are authorized for that, and then the latter companies, i. e. factors, collect the receivable payments from the debtors. Thus, the factoring contract is made, in order for the assignor, i. e. the client, and the factor to agree which claims will be the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> and which rights and obligations they both must comply with. The factor and the client conclude a framework contract, i. e. the factoring contract. They agree on the advance, which must be paid to the client by the factor after the acquisition of claims, and the fees and interests, charged by the factor, for its services...|$|E
40|$|The {{contractual}} commitment {{is a tool}} now widely used in the environmental field. As part of payments for environmental services, this contractual obligation, however, raises many questions. These cover not only the legitimacy but also contractors and so intimately linked to {{the object of the}} contract, environmental services. Indeed, the provision of environmental services justifies financial rewards in return. Insofar as this concept of environmental services is uncertain because of a missing definition, it coexists with that of ecosystem services, environmental public goods, the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> and therefore its payment may appear questionable. Including the assumption that this problem is solvable, the legitimacy of contractors is also cause questions. Indeed, who is the payee ? Tha landowner or the land user ? This question involved here is the dimension of equitable participation in natural resource management on farmland. It also refers here directly to the nature of service rendered to qualify for this compensation. In addition, should the contractor who pays for a service ensure that the contract has been respected ? Can it be a payment involving a certain property which was the subject of contractual exchange ? Its legitimacy is also an irritant and often subject to doctrinal differences. So, is a private person entitled to intervene, especially to identify environmental services likely to object to a fee ? Implicitly, the question of the monetary value of these services arises. What contractors is the value determined by? Unequal power relations may arise during contract negotiations. Therefore, to support opportunities for transactions to pay for environmental services, seems to compel the existence of a form of regulation. What might be the scale of action to take? By what authority? Would it necessarily be a legal regulation? Moreover, beyond 2 ̆ 2 the proper functioning legal 2 ̆ 2 logic of this contract, the same transposition of this legal architecture to any transaction intended to pay for environmental services also causes difficulties.
