5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β unsaturation, silyl ethers, various lactams and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant <b>side</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
25|$|Stereospecific cis-hydroalumination is {{possible}} {{through the use}} of dialkylalanes. The most common reagent used for this purpose is di(isobutyl)aluminium hydride (DIBAL-H). Analogous to hydroboration reactions with R2BH, hydroalumination with R2AlH leads to the attachment of aluminium at the carbon less able to stabilize developing positive charge (anti-Markovnikov selectivity). Metalation of terminal alkynes is a significant <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> that occurs under these conditions. If metalation is desired, tertiary amine complexes of DIBAL-H are useful.|$|E
50|$|A major {{difficulty}} of 2+2 photocycloadditions {{is the possibility}} of <b>side</b> <b>reactions</b> associated with the diradical intermediate or excited enone. These <b>side</b> <b>reactions</b> can often be minimized by a judicious choice of reaction conditions.|$|R
50|$|The neutral superbase P4-t-Bu is {{superior}} to ionic bases if those are sensitive to oxidation or <b>side</b> <b>reactions</b> (such as acylation) when they cause solubility problems or Lewis acid catalysed <b>side</b> <b>reactions</b> (such as aldol reactions, epoxy ring opening etc).|$|R

25|$|Enzyme {{promiscuity}} is {{the ability}} of an enzyme to catalyse a fortuitous <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> in addition to its main reaction. Although enzymes are remarkably specific catalysts, they can often perform side reactions in addition to their main, native catalytic activity. These promiscuous activities are usually slow relative to the main activity and are under neutral selection. Despite ordinarily being physiologically irrelevant, under new selective pressures these activities may confer a fitness benefit therefore prompting the evolution of the formerly promiscuous activity to become the new main activity. An example of this is the atrazine chlorohydrolase (atzA encoded) from Pseudomonas sp. ADP which evolved from melamine deaminase (triA encoded), which has very small promiscuous activity towards atrazine, a man-made chemical.|$|E
25|$|The Chisso Minamata factory {{first started}} {{acetaldehyde}} production in 1932, producing 210tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000tons {{per year and}} reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960. Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter {{and a third of}} Japan's total acetaldehyde production. The chemical reaction used to produce the acetaldehyde used mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely methylmercury. This highly toxic compound was released into Minamata Bay from the change of the co-catalyst in 1951 until 1968, when this production method was discontinued.|$|E

50|$|Direct anionic {{polymerization}} of nitroxyl-containing monomers {{has also been}} used to synthesis PTMA. Anionic polymerization is not ideal because it must be carried using very strict procedures to avoid <b>side</b> <b>reactions.</b> Using 1,1-diphenylhexylllithium as an initiator of the <b>reaction</b> eliminates some <b>side</b> <b>reactions</b> by steric effects, however, the procedures necessary are not amenable to large-scale synthesis.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{tetrafluoroethylene}} can explosively {{decompose to}} tetrafluoromethane and carbon, special apparatus {{is required for}} the polymerization to prevent hot spots that might initiate this dangerous <b>side</b> <b>reaction.</b> [...] The process is typically initiated with persulfate, which homolyzes to generate sulfate radicals: ...|$|E
2500|$|Protodeboronation is a {{chemical}} reaction involving the protonolysis of a boronic acid (or other organoborane compound) {{in which a}} carbon-boron bond is broken and replaced with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Protodeboronation is a well-known undesired <b>side</b> <b>reaction,</b> and frequently associated with metal-catalysed coupling reactions that utilise boronic acids (see Suzuki reaction). For a given boronic acid, the propensity to undergo protodeboronation is highly variable and dependent on various factors, such as the reaction conditions employed and the organic substituent of the boronic acid: ...|$|E
2500|$|These <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> are {{significantly}} less important for RI than for RBr, since the iodine-lithium exchange is several {{orders of magnitude}} faster than the bromine-lithium exchange. [...] For these reasons, aryl, vinyl and primary alkyl iodides are the preferred substrates, and t-BuLi rather than n-BuLi is usually used, since the formed t-BuI is immediately destroyed by the t-BuLi in a dehydrohalogenation reaction (thus requiring 2 equiv of t-BuLi). [...] Alternatively, vinyl lithium reagents can be generated by direct reaction of the vinyl halide (e.g. cyclohexenyl chloride) with lithium or by tin-lithium exchange (see next section).|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages: the {{relative}} {{rates of the}} various stages of radical cyclization <b>reactions</b> (and any <b>side</b> <b>reactions)</b> must be carefully controlled so that cyclization and trapping of the cyclized radical is favored. <b>Side</b> <b>reactions</b> are sometimes a problem, and cyclization is especially slow for small and large rings (although macrocyclizations, which resemble intermolecular radical reactions, are often high yielding).|$|R

2500|$|In most {{naturally}} occurring unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrogen atoms {{are on the}} same side of the double bonds of the carbon chain (cis configuration— from the Latin, meaning [...] "on the same side"). However, partial hydrogenation reconfigures most of the double bonds that do not become chemically saturated, twisting them so that the hydrogen atoms end up on different sides of the chain. This type of configuration is called trans, from the Latin, meaning [...] "across". The trans configuration is the lower energy form, and is favored when catalytically equilibrated as a <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> in hydrogenation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the minor}} {{reaction}} pathway, a Prilezhaev epoxidation {{results in the}} formation of thiophene-2,3-epoxide that rapidly rearranges to the isomer thiophene-2-one. [...] Trapping experiments demonstrate that this pathway is not a <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> from the S-oxide intermediate, while isotopic labeling with deuterium confirm that a 1,2-hydride shift occurs and thus that a cationic intermediate is involved. [...] Trifluoroperacetic acid is prepared immediately prior to use, and the method chosen determines whether or not water is present; if the reaction mixture is not anhydrous, this minor reaction pathway is suppressed as water acts as a competing base.|$|E
2500|$|IPCC has {{provided}} estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs (see table below). While [...] is drastically reduced though never completely captured, emissions of air pollutants increase significantly, generally {{due to the}} energy penalty of capture. Hence, the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality. Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology. [...] is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic [...] at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing [...] at higher temperatures in a desorber. Chilled Ammonia CCS Plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air. [...] "Functionalized Ammonia" [...] emit less ammonia, but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines by a <b>side</b> <b>reaction</b> with nitrogendioxide, which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx. Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions. Nevertheless, all the capture plants amines have in common, that practically 100% of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas, {{the same applies to}} dust/ash.|$|E
30|$|The basic {{tenet of}} white {{biotechnology}} is to minimize {{damage to the}} environment rather than taking recourse to remediation as an “end of the pipe” solution [1],[2]. Enzymes either in isolated form or {{in the form of}} whole cells can play an important role because of their two well known virtues. The biocatalysts normally do not require high temperature or other conditions which involve high consumption of energy. The biocatalysts are believed to be fairly specific, which would mean less number of <b>side</b> <b>reactions.</b> <b>Side</b> <b>reactions</b> lead to <b>side</b> products which lower the atom economy of the <b>reactions.</b> These <b>side</b> <b>reactions</b> hence lower the yield of the desired product (making the catalysis less efficient) and necessitate complicated downstream processing.|$|R

2500|$|Toluene {{derivatives}} with heteroatom-containing substituents in the ortho position undergo site-selective benzylic lithiation in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds (either alkyllithiums or lithium dialkylamides). Coordination of the Lewis acidic lithium atom to the Lewis basic heteroatom, as well as inductive effects derived from the electronegativity of the heteroatom, encourage selective deprotonation at the benzylic position. Competitive ring metalation (directed ortho-metalation) is an important <b>side</b> <b>reaction,</b> but a judicious choice of base often allows for selective benzylic metalation. Useful heteroatom-containing directing groups include dialkylamines, amides (secondary or tertiary), ketone enolates, carbamates, and sulfonates. Lateral lithiation of alkyl-substituted heterocycles incorporating heteroatom-containing substituents is also possible, although ring lithiation α to the ring heteroatom may compete with lateral lithiation. The products of lateral lithiation react with a variety of electrophiles, including reactive alkyl halides (allylic, benzylic, and primary), carbonyl compounds, silyl and stannyl chlorides, disulfides and diselenides, and others. A general, highly selective method for benzylic metalation using a mixed lithium and potassium metal amide (LiNK chemistry) has been developed which permits metalation regardless of the relative position (ortho, meta or para) of the methyl group to the heteroatom containing substituent ...|$|E
