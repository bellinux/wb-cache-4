5|$|The temple takes {{advantage}} of Singapore's abundant sunlight by having three different kinds of solar energy cells on its rooftop. They are the poly-crystalline silicon <b>solar</b> <b>array,</b> mono-crystalline silicon <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> and amorphous silicon <b>solar</b> <b>array.</b> Poh Ern Shih's water is heated by its solar panels, and its night lighting is powered by electricity converted from solar energy, With its breezy location, wind generators have also been erected to convert wind activity into electricity.|$|E
5|$|The crew of EO-19 {{conducted}} {{their first}} Extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, on July 14. Before the mission, {{the crew had}} trained to use special tools in order to release a stuck <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> on {{the exterior of the}} Spektr module. During the spacewalk, the pair cut a problematic restraint from the <b>solar</b> <b>array.</b> All but one section of the array deployed successfully. They then proceeded to inspect a docking mechanism in preparation for the relocation of the Kristall module. The final task of the spacewalk was to inspect a <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> on Kristall that was not tracking the Sun properly. The excursion ended after five hours and thirty-four minutes outside the station.|$|E
5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> string close to its peak power point.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>arrays</b> on <b>solar</b> {{cars are}} mounted and {{encapsulated}} very differently from stationary <b>solar</b> <b>arrays.</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>arrays</b> on <b>solar</b> cars are usually mounted using industrial grade double-sided adhesive tape right onto the car's body. The arrays are encapsulated using thin layers of Tedlar.|$|R

50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>arrays</b> {{produced}} on {{the lunar surface}} {{can be used to}} support lunar surface operations as well as satellites off the lunar surface. <b>Solar</b> <b>arrays</b> {{produced on}} the lunar surface may prove more cost effective than <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> produced and shipped from Earth, but this trade depends heavily on the location of the particular application in question.|$|R
5|$|After a 40-day delay {{caused by}} faulty {{computer}} chips, Kvant-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's airlock.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> once in geostationary orbit, and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload Flight Test Article evaluation found that the Canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a precision of 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
5|$|The mission's only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, {{took place}} on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary {{objectives}} of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir's exterior components and record panoramas of the station's hull in order for experts on Earth to analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> on the Kvant-1 module of the station. They discovered that a burnt-through wire connecting the array with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. The array was subsequently deemed a loss.|$|E
5000|$|Normally the {{photovoltaic}} <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> of {{the space}} station track the sun. However, {{one of the main}} causes of orbital decay on the space station is that the area of the <b>solar</b> <b>arrays,</b> brushing against the thin residual atmosphere at orbital altitude, results in a small amount of aerodynamic drag. The drag can be lowered by orienting the <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> in [...] "sun slicer" [...] mode, where they fly edge-on to the orbital direction, rather than tracking the sun, however, this orientation reduces the power produced. The [...] "night glider" [...] mode is a hybrid orientation, where the <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> track the sun during the period when the space station is illuminated, but are oriented edge-on to the orbital direction when it is in the Earth's shadow. This reduces the average drag on the station's <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> by about 30 percent, with no reduction in power.|$|R

5|$|In March 2012, the MBTA {{announced}} that the contamination had been fully removed, and revealed plans to place solar panels in the west part of 5-Yard. The panels would be installed and maintained for at least 20 years by an outside contractor. Bidding began in May 2012, with the stipulation that the <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> would be operational {{by the spring of}} 2013. The contract was chosen in September 2012, with a revised completion date of October 2013. In July 2013, MassDOT (the MBTA's parent agency) {{announced that}} construction would not begin until at least 2014 due to a state solar program reaching capacity earlier than expected. , the installation was to occur in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|NigComSat-1, a Nigerian {{satellite}} {{built in}} 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after {{running out of}} power because of an anomaly in its <b>solar</b> <b>array.</b> It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of solar technologies {{starting in the}} 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. Charles Fritts installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic <b>solar</b> <b>array,</b> using 1%-efficient selenium cells, on a New York City roof in 1884. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum. In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems. The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhoferâ€“ISE). Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from 1984 to 1996.|$|E

Impact induced discharges have been generated in highly instrumented impact experiments using a two-staged light gas guns and a plasma dynamic accelerator. The discharges {{were found to be}} temporary and without consequences for the functioning of the power generating network of state-of-the-art <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> designs. Permanently sustained destructive discharges have been generated for current-voltage characteristics that are significantly exceeding current ESD safe levels.
