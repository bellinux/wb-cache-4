5|$|The Presidency of the Council rotates {{every six}} months among the governments of EU member states, with the {{relevant}} ministers of the respective country holding the Presidency {{at any given time}} ensuring the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of the meetings and setting the daily agenda. The continuity between presidencies is provided by an arrangement under which three successive presidencies, known as Presidency trios, share common political programmes. The Foreign Affairs Council (national foreign ministers) is however chaired by the Union's High Representative.|$|E
5|$|Until 1707, The Privy Council met {{in what is}} now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. By {{the early}} modern period the Privy Council was a {{full-time}} body and critical to the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of government. Its primary function was judicial, but it also acted as a body of advisers to the king and as a result its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy. After James VI departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around thirty persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group consisting mainly of the officers of state. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E

25|$|Court {{officials}} may {{be divided into}} those who served the King, and those who ensured the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of his court (in the 16th century, comprising some 1,000–1,500 persons). Since the first group were {{not subject to the}} principle of incompatibilitas, they often held another title, usually that of a lesser district official such as a starosta. Of those who served the King, the most important was the Master of the Kitchen, who supervised the kitchen staff and equipment and the preparation of foods. During feasts, he announced the successive dishes.|$|E

25|$|Typical of an Episcopal cathedral, St. Paul's {{is led by}} a dean (currently the Very Rev. Penelope Bridges). The cathedral is {{the formal}} seat of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of San Diego. Oversight is {{provided}} by {{a board of directors}} (cathedral chapter), a board of elected representatives from the cathedral community and the diocese. There are numerous affiliated clergy, many of whom are retired, and some of whom are canons of the cathedral. There are also several lay canons who serve in administrative positions. Several volunteer groups contribute to the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of the cathedral and its worship services. These include the altar servers, the vergers, the altar guild and sacristans, the ushers, the docents, and the greeters.|$|E
50|$|The CM models {{featured}} a new grille, revised tail lights plus new mouldings and badges. All body panels were carried {{over from the}} previous model.

25|$|The various IITs {{function}} autonomously, {{and their}} special status as Institutes of National Importance facilitates the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of IITs, virtually free from both regional {{as well as}} student politics. Such autonomy means that IITs can create their own curricula and adapt rapidly to the changes in educational requirements, free from bureaucratic hurdles. The government has no direct control over internal policy decisions of IITs (like faculty recruitment and curricula) but has representation on the IIT Council. The medium of instruction in all IITs is English. The classes are usually held between 7:30am and 5:30pm, though there are some variations within each IIT. All the IITs have public libraries {{for the use of}} their students. In addition to a collection of prescribed books, the libraries have sections for fiction and other literary genres. The electronic libraries allow students to access on-line journals and periodicals. The IITs and IISc have taken an initiative along with Ministry of Human Resource Development to provide free online videos of actual lectures of different disciplines under National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning. This initiative is undertaken to make quality education accessible to all students.|$|E
25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably <b>smooth</b> <b>running.</b> The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|Millwrights {{preferred}} to have engaging teeth {{of iron and}} wood. In this way almost all the wear of the engaging gears was {{taken up by the}} wooden ones and these had to be periodically replaced. As well as this, it was felt that iron and wood engaged better than iron and iron and that quieter and <b>smoother</b> <b>running</b> resulted.|$|R
50|$|For some engines it is {{necessary}} to provide counterweights for the reciprocating mass of each piston and connecting rod to improve engine balance. These are typically cast as part of the crankshaft but, occasionally, are bolt-on pieces. While counter weights add a considerable amount of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a <b>smoother</b> <b>running</b> engine and allows higher RPM levels to be reached.|$|R
50|$|On September 4, 2009, Honda {{announced}} the eleventh {{generation of the}} RR as a 2010 model. Honda increased {{the diameter of the}} flywheel for more inertia.

500|$|Around 5 July 1941, Nebe {{consolidated}} Einsatzgruppe B near Minsk, {{establishing a}} headquarters and remaining {{there for two}} months. The killing activities progressed apace. In a 13 July Operational Situation Report, Nebe stated that 1,050 Jews {{had been killed in}} Minsk, and that in Vilna, the liquidation of the Jews was underway, and that five hundred Jews were shot daily. In the same report Nebe remarked that: [...] "only 96 Jews were executed in Grodno and Lida during the first days. I gave orders to intensify these activities". He also reported that the killings were being brought into <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> order and that the shootings were carried out [...] "at an increasing rate".

500|$|Burrell {{served on}} {{exchange}} with the Royal Navy as navigator aboard the cruisers [...] and , the latter during her {{tour of duty}} in the Spanish Civil War. Described as being [...] "egalitarian" [...] and [...] "approachable", his familiarity with ratings earned him the criticism of Devonshires captain; Burrell however believed that a close relationship between officers and men was necessary for the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of a ship. [...] After completing the Royal Navy's staff course in 1938, he returned to Australia and was appointed staff officer (operations) at the Navy Office, Melbourne, in March 1939.

500|$|The {{question}} of land ownership had deep emotional resonance within Kenya, {{having been a}} major source of grievance against the British colonialists. As part of the Lancaster House negotiations, the British government had agreed to provide Kenya with £27 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population. To ease the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of this transition, Kenyatta made McKenzie the Minister of Agriculture and Land. Kenyatta's government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians. The government sold or leased lands in the former White Highlands to these companies, who in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders. In this way, there was a bias in the land redistribution programs that favoured the ruling part's chief constituency. Kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around Gatundu. Kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people, including Kenyans from different parts of the country. Voices began to condemn the redistribution; in 1969, the MP Jean Seroney for instance openly censured the sale of historically Nandi lands in the Rift to non-Nandi, describing the settlement schemes represented [...] "Kenyatta's colonization of the rift".|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was again}} praised by Wisden {{in its report}} on the 1948 tour. [...] "Indebtedness for the <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, {{hard-working}} and always genial," [...] it said. [...] "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said {{there had not been}} a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Flanagan labelled Johnson as [...] "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever hope to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will ever have a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." [...] Bradman said that Johnson [...] "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.|$|E
2500|$|Smooth running: It is {{typically}} easier to achieve <b>smooth</b> <b>running</b> with a radial engine ...|$|E
25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} poppet valves {{driven by}} pushrods and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder.
