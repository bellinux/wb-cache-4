2500|$|The {{computer}} clustering approach connects {{a number}} of readily available computing nodes (e.g. personal computers used as servers) via a fast, private local area network. The activities of the computing nodes are orchestrated by [...] "clustering middleware", a <b>software</b> <b>layer</b> that sits atop the nodes and allows the users to treat the cluster as by and large one cohesive computing unit, e.g. via a single system image concept.|$|E
2500|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite does not presume any specific hardware or software environment. [...] It only requires that hardware and a <b>software</b> <b>layer</b> exists that {{is capable of}} sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.|$|E

These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements. Custom, certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers (such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense) may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system. There may also be [...] "binary blob" [...] drivers required for certain hardware components in the device.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability for}} {{scientific}} simulation software {{to detect and}} recover from errors and failures of supporting hardware and <b>software</b> <b>layers</b> is becoming more important due to the pressure to shift from large, specialized multi-million dollar ASCI computing platforms to smaller, less expensive interconnected machines consisting of off-the-shelf hardware. As evidenced by the CPlant{trademark} experiences, fault tolerance can be necessary even on such a homogeneous system and may also prove useful {{in the next generation}} of ASCI platforms. This report describes a research effort intended to study, implement, and test the feasibility of various fault tolerance mechanisms controlled at the simulation code level. Errors and failures would be detected by underlying <b>software</b> <b>layers,</b> communicated to the application through a convenient interface, and then handled by the simulation code itself. Targeted faults included corrupt communication messages, processor node dropouts, and unacceptable slowdown of service from processing nodes. Recovery techniques such as re-sending communication messages and dynamic reallocation of failing processor nodes were considered. However, most fault tolerance mechanisms rely on underlying <b>software</b> <b>layers</b> which were discovered to be lacking {{to such a degree that}} mechanisms at the application level could not be implemented. This research effort has been postponed and shifted to these supporting layers...|$|R

40|$|Timely {{operation}} {{is a key}} factor in CPS that is challenged by their inherent distributed nature. The variability intro- duced by the network and its unpredictable effects have to be handled. Thus, a vertical understanding of the involved <b>software</b> <b>layers</b> is needed at the levels of the operating sys- tem, the networking software and the middleware. Typi- cally, middleware has been described in a quite independent way from the underlying operating system kernel and the network software. That is not appropriate in a CPS as some degree of control over the resource assignment is expected as a means to ensure timeliness. In this paper, we look into the details of middleware in relation to its sorround- ing <b>software</b> <b>layers</b> to provide a middleware design, namely OMA-Cy, suiting the needs of CPS. We target subsystems where timing deadlines are not hard nor safety critical, but require quality of service guarantees such that resource man- agement techniques are applied both at the individual nodes {{as well as in the}} distributed communication...|$|R
