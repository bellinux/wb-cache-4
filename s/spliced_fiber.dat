5000|$|Recoating is {{the process}} of {{restoring}} the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. In the recoating process, the <b>spliced</b> <b>fiber</b> is restored to its original shape and strength, using a recoater. The stripped fiber section is recoated by filling a recoating resin, usually acrylate into transparent moulds. The resin is then cured with UV light. It is often desirable to perform a proof-test after recoating, to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use.|$|E
50|$|Current fusion splicers {{are either}} core or {{cladding}} alignment. Using {{one of these}} methods the two cleaved fibers are automatically aligned by the fusion splicer in the x,y,z plane, then are fused together. Prior to {{the removal of the}} <b>spliced</b> <b>fiber</b> from the fusion splicer, a proof-test is performed to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use. The bare fiber area is protected either by recoating or with a splice protector. A splice protector is a heat shrinkable tube with a strength membrane and less loss.|$|E
50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic cable (also called {{breakout}} cable or fanout cable), is an {{optical fiber cable}} containing several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket. This differs from distribution-style cable, in which tight-buffered fibers are bundled together, with only the outer cable jacket of the cable protecting them. The design of breakout-style cable adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the cable is larger and more expensive than distribution-style cable. Breakout cable is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple cable run is planned to avoid {{the use of any}} splicebox or <b>spliced</b> <b>fiber</b> pigtails.|$|E

50|$|A cleave in {{an optical}} fiber is a deliberate, {{controlled}} break, intended {{to create a}} perfectly flat endface, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the fiber. The process of cleaving an optical fiber forms one of the steps in the preparation for a <b>fiber</b> <b>splice</b> operation regardless of the subsequent splice being a fusion splice or a mechanical splice; the other steps in the preparation being those of stripping and fiber alignment. A good cleave is required for a successful low loss splice of an optical fiber, often {{it is the case}} that <b>fibers</b> <b>spliced</b> by identical methods tend to have different losses, this difference can often be attributed to the quality of their initial cleaves.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of measurement results, we should {{do our best to}} reduce the optical loss while welding FBG Sensors and adopt appropriate bonding technology. Taking simple tools and suitable approach can also achieve good result. We take three steps while welding FBG sensors, the steps are manufacture end face, welding, and heat shrinkable. Manufacturing end face of a fiber is the key step among them. It is important to adopt the sequence diagonal welding method and use a damp cloth to cool the other parts of the sensor while welding which can increase the accuracy of measurement. Use pen-made red light to check the fiber joints.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{limit for}} the scaling of the output power of fiber lasers is the heat {{generated in the}} core of the active fiber and fiber components. In this work the heat generation in fiber laser components is examined and means for heat removal are analyzed. To determine the heat load in the active fiber the temperature is measured along the fiber. The heat transport is examined with two models: A one-dimensional model allows the analytical study of the subject. The thermal resistances of the individual fiber layers are determined to examine how the fiber design affects the heat transport. Furthermore the convective cooling of the fiber is evaluated and interacting groups of fiber layers are optimized for the heat transport. To optimize the fiber cooling two- and three-dimensional models of the fiber are generated and experimentally verified. With the models a cooling scheme for the fiber is designed which avoids the direct contact of the fiber with water but provides a heat removal comparable to convective water cooling up to a heat load of 150 W/m. The heat sink is optimized using the one-dimensional model. The results of the temperature measurements are used to analyze the thermo-optical effects in the fiber. It is shown, that their influence on the modal properties of the fiber is an order of magnitude smaller than the effects from bending the fiber for mode selection. Furthermore the thermal characteristics of <b>splices,</b> <b>fiber</b> Bragg gratings and a new concept for pump fiber coupling are analyzed. Temperature measurements like on the active fiber allow conclusions concerning the causes of the heat generation. As an example a cooling scheme for splices is analyzed which allows the removal of local heat loads up to 4000 W/m. Thus a cooling scheme for fiber integrated resonator with up to 2 kW output power is developed.
