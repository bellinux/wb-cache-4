25|$|After David Cameron {{announced}} {{his intention to}} resign as Prime Minister, with his successor now {{likely to be in}} office by September 2016, Gove was not a candidate, having <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> that he had no interest in becoming Prime Minister. Instead, he was seen as a strong, highly influential supporter of Boris Johnson for that role. In a move that surprised most political analysts, Gove withdrew his support for Johnson on 30 June 2016, hours before the deadline, without any previous notice to Johnson and {{announced his}} own candidacy in the Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016. Subsequently, Johnson declined to run.|$|E

500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL {{had begun}} to change. It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said to do otherwise would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E

2500|$|A person's own prior {{statements}} can be hearsay. For example, {{suppose a}} person is testifying on the stand.

This statement is an out-of-court statement offered for the purpose of proving {{the truth of the matter}} asserted, and is therefore hearsay. The witness is testifying about what someone <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The fact that it is his own statement does not change the hearsay nature of the statement.|$|E
2500|$|Obama opposes {{offering}} reparations to {{the descendants}} of slaves. [...] "I have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> – and I'll repeat again – that the best reparations we can provide are good schools {{in the inner city}} and jobs for people who are unemployed," [...] Obama said. An apology for slavery would be appropriate but not particularly helpful in improving the lives of African Americans, he said. Reparations could also be a distraction, Obama said. [...] "I consistently believe {{that when it comes to}} whether it's Native Americans or African-American issues or reparations, the most important thing for the U.S. government to do is not just offer words, but offer deeds," [...] Obama told a meeting in Chicago in July 2008.|$|E

[...] The European Parliamentary deputy Richard Howitt, spoke for the European Parliament's Socialist and Democrat Group when he declared his support for the referendum results. [...] "The unexpectedly large 'yes' vote in Turkey's constitutional referendum is a sign of the population's support for reforms that will prepare the country for European Union membership." [...] He also said it would be a blow to European critics who suggested Turkey does not have the political will to make the necessary reforms to join the EU. He also supported calls to draw up a new constitution through cross-party consensus.|$|E

2500|$|The debate {{began in}} 1972, when, in his paper [...] "Signature Event Context", Derrida {{analyzed}} J. L. Austin's {{theory of the}} illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes [...] "force", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a [...] "structure of absence" [...] (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by [...] "iterability" [...] (the constraints on what can be said, given by what has been <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past).</b> Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or [...] "parasitic" [...] speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply {{due to a lack}} of interest.|$|E

60|$|It was a relief, for in {{that case}} he was {{certainly}} {{still in love with}} her; but it made his behaviour very puzzling. If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat? It was unnatural. Mildred was not a woman who conceived the possibility of compassion, generosity, or kindness. Her only conclusion was that Philip was queer. She took it into her head that the reasons for his conduct were chivalrous; and, her imagination filled with the extravagances of cheap fiction, she pictured to herself all sorts of romantic explanations for his delicacy. Her fancy ran riot with bitter misunderstandings, purifications by fire, snow-white souls, and death in the cruel cold of a Christmas night. She made up her mind that when they went to Brighton she would put an end to all his nonsense; they would be alone there, everyone would think them husband and wife, and there would be the pier and the band. When she found that nothing would induce Philip to share the same room with her, when he spoke to her about it with a tone in his voice she had never heard before, she suddenly realised {{that he did not want}} her. She was astounded. She remembered all he had <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and how desperately he had loved her. She felt humiliated and angry, but she had a sort of native insolence which carried her through. He needn't think she was in love with him, because she wasn't. She hated him sometimes, and she longed to humble him; but she found herself singularly powerless; she did not know which way to handle him. She began to be a little nervous with him. Once or twice she cried. Once or twice she set herself to be particularly nice to him; but when she took his arm while they walked along the front at night he made some excuse in a while to release himself, as though it were unpleasant for him to be touched by her. She could not make it out. The only hold she had over him was through the baby, of whom he seemed to grow fonder and fonder: she could make him white with anger by giving the child a slap or a push; and the only time the old, tender smile came back into his eyes was when she stood with the baby in her arms. She noticed it when she was being photographed like that by a man on the beach, and afterwards she often stood in the same way for Philip to look at her.|$|E
