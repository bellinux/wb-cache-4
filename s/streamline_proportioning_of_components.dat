40|$|Abstract: Land surface {{corresponding}} to a pixel of remotely sensed image {{does not necessarily}} consist of only one cate-gory of objects. Several techniques of subpixel analysis have been developed which estimate the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> land cover in a pixel.

40|$|When human {{subjects}} lose money in 50 % <b>of</b> multiple-schedule <b>components,</b> {{the most common}} finding is a decreased response rate in the other components (i. e., punishment induction). When money is lost in only 10 % <b>of</b> <b>components,</b> however, the most common finding is an increased response rate in the other components (i. e., punishment contrast). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to provide an experimental assessment of the relation between <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> punishment <b>components</b> and contrast and induction. Four adult humans pressed a lever or pulled a plunger for money on a multiple VI VI schedule arranged with green and red rectangles.

Across 10 punishment conditions, there was no systematic relation between <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> punishment <b>components</b> and contrast and induction. With both the 10 % and 50 % proportions, induction occurred in four punishment conditions and contrast occurred in one. There were, however, systematic effects of condition sequence. For all subjects, the pattern across punishment conditions was induction, then contrast or less induction, then induction. Present results show that <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> punishment <b>components</b> cannot account for discrepancies found in previous studies, and that effects of punishment on unpunished responses change over time, perhaps because of punisher novelty...|$|R

Thereby scientists may improve their ability to understand and suggest solutions for the problems facing {{those who have the}} responsibility of making sound agricultural decisions. Nitrogen (N) availability is known to be highly heterogeneous in terrestrial plant communities (Stevenson and van Kessel, 1997), a heterogeneity that in natural systems is often associated with variation in the distri-bution of plant species. In intercropping systems the relative <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>component</b> crops is influenced by the distribution of growth factors such as N in both time and space (Jensen, 1996). In pea-barley intercrops, an increase in the N supply promotes the growth of barley thereby decreasing the N accumulation of pea and giving rise to changes in the relative <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> the intercropped <b>components</b> (Jensen, 1996). The pres-sure of weeds may, however, significantly change the dynamics in intercrops (Hauggaard-Nielsen et al., 2001).
