40|$|This study {{posits that}} as an {{academic}} discipline, Black Studies has as its historical antecedent {{more than a century}} of vigorous struggle for interpretive power and definitional control of the Black experience. The demands of Black students on black and white campuses for an education relevant to the needs and aspirations of the Black community shook the foundations of the Academy. Yet the thrust of angry Black students during the late 1960 s was not the first serious intellectual offensive launched against white-controlled education. Though distinguished by its passion and polemics, Black Studies was not new. Rather, the Black Studies movement represented a resurgence of Black nationalist sentiment inextricably linked with the quest for the redemption of Black history and its meaningful interpretation. ^ At least a century prior, Dr. Edward W. Blyden of St. Thomas and Liberia devoted his life to challenging the West 2 ̆ 7 s racist, ahistorical image of Blacks. An educator, Blyden was profoundly committed to the development of what he termed 2 ̆ 2 the African personality 2 ̆ 2 and politically espoused repatriation of Disasporan Africans. A generation later, his 2 ̆ 2 disciple 2 ̆ 2, Joseph E. Casely-Hayford of the former Gold Coast was equally concerned with the 2 ̆ 2 African nationality 2 ̆ 2 and the appropriate role for the emerging Western-educated elite. In the United States a decade later, Carter G. Woodson, 2 ̆ 2 the father of Black history 2 ̆ 2 grappled with the same issue, charging the West with the deliberate 2 ̆ 2 miseducation of the Negro 2 ̆ 2. ^ This study examines the politics of knowledge in the context of these three Black responses to the West 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>distortion</b> of Black history and Black humanity. Their indictment of Western education as a retarding factor in racial uplift and the complicity of Western academicians in the perpetuation of racism is central to the focus of this study. It is argued that Afrocentric Black Studies create a constant tension in the Academy due to inherent ideological differences. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{formulate}} and solve the high-frequency electromagnetic problem of wave propagation through nematic liquid crystal cells of arbitrary shape, and subsequently approach the inverse problem of reconstructing the orientational order by means of recovering the dielectric tensors in the interior from a finite set of boundary polarization measurements. The numerical solution of the forward electromagnetic problem is achieved by hybridizing the conventional vector finite elements with a boundary integral method, so that to preserve the necessary continuity conditions for the electromagnetic fields at the boundary of the domain. Combining the finite element equations with a magnetic field integral boundary equation yields surface integrals involving Green s function and its gradient. These integrals have kernels that become asymptotically singular as the distance between the observation and integration points reduces to zero, essentially making the numerical integration process problematic. For their computation a new basis of functions are introduced for the surface current density, the so-called Rao-Wilton-Glisson functions, which e®ectively substitute the tangential components of the magnetic field in the original boundary integrals. The transformed integrals are then treated with the singularity extraction method, essentially separating the smooth from the singular components of the kernels, the former of which are computed using conventional numerical integration and the later using closed form expressions derived for the RWG functions. The forward problem is then linearized with the aid of the Fr´echet derivative of the forward Maxwell operator and subsequently regularized using a Tikhonov type regularization. In regularization we construct a penalty term based on Frank <b>s</b> <b>distortion</b> energy functional, which is known to have a minimum in the neighborhood of stable liquid crystal director configurations. The inverse problem of reconstructing the orientation of the director vector in a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal using a finite set of noise infused boundary polarization measurements is approached as a special case of the inverse permittivity tensor problem, where the dielectric tensors are symmetric and expected to vary most significantly along the directions of their two biggest eigenvalues, which correspond to the associated Euler angles of the director vector...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation from distant astrophysical objects provides essential data in understanding physics of these sources. In particular, non-thermal radiation provides great {{insight into the}} properties of local environments, particle populations, and emission mechanisms, knowledge which otherwise would remain untapped. Throughout the projects conducted for this dissertation, we modeled certain aspects of observed non-thermal emission from three classes of sources: radio pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae, and supernova remnants. ^ Orbital variation in the double pulsar system PSR J 0737 - 3039 A/B {{can be used to}} probe the details of the magnetospheric structure of pulsar B. Strongly magnetized wind from pulsar A distorts the magnetosphere of pulsar B in a way similar to the solar wind 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>distortion</b> of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere. Using the two complimentary models of pulsar B 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere, adapted from the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere models by Dungey and Tsyganenko, we determine the precise location of the coherent radio emission generation region in pulsar B 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere. This analysis is complemented by modeling the observed evolution of the pulse profiles of B due to geodetic precession. The emission region is located at about 3750 stellar radii and has a horseshoe-like shape centered on the polar magnetic field lines. The best fit angular parameters of the emission region indicate that radio emission is generated on the field lines which, according to the theoretical models, originate close to the poles and carry the maximum current. When considered together, not only do the results of the two models converge, they can explain why the modulation of B 2 ̆ 7 s radio emission at A 2 ̆ 7 s period is observed only within a certain orbital phase region. We discuss the implications of these results for pulsar magnetospheric models and mechanisms of coherent radio emission generation. ^ We also developed a spatially-resolved, analytic model for the high-energy non-thermal emission from pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). Theoretically, synchrotron cooling should cause a gradual change in particle spectrum downstream. This effect is indeed observed in the X-ray spectra of The Crab Nebula, 3 C 58, and G 21. 5. 0. 9. However, current theoretical models of PWNe that only account for the bulk motion in the pulsar outflow overestimate the steepening of the resulted emission spectrum. This implies that there is an additional mechanism of particle transport which would supply energetic particles to the outer layers of the PWN. Our model solves the lack of high-energy electrons in the outer regions of the nebula by taking the diffusion of particles into account. The resulting multi-wavelength spectra exhibits multiple breaks, which is in agreement with observations. ^ Thin non-thermal X-ray filaments are often seen near shock fronts in young supernova remnants (SNRs), often spatially coincident with the high energy gamma-ray emission. The formation of such discrete features is likely influenced by the combined effects of radiative cooling, advection, and diffusion. Spatially-resolved spectral studies of the filaments may, therefore, provide significant insights into the relative importance of main physical processes involved in young SNRs. Using 1 Ms Chandra observation of Cassiopeia A, we perform advection-diffusion modeling of synchrotron emission of filaments to measure the magnetic field, shock obliquity, the diffusion strength and the plasma turbulence level. ...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen donor ligands {{have been}} found to cause d-block metal {{fluorides}} to dissolve in water ethanol and methanol. From some of these solutions metal fluoride hydrate complexes were isolated. The work had been concentrated on fluorides of metals that have a role in enzymes; copper, zinc, nickel and cobalt. A large number of fluoride complexes have been made and some of them produced crystals suitable for the X-ray analysis. The X-ray and infrared studies indicated that the structures were stabilized by extensive fluoride hydrogen bonding interactions involving ligand or lattice molecules. In some fluoride complexes, the fluoride hydrogen bonds were very strong. The X-ray structure determination of [Ni(im) 6]F 2. 5 H 2 O (1 a) (im = imidazole) revealed the presence of octahedral configuration around nickel. This complex presents a rare example of a complex with lattice water hydrogen bonded to lattice fluoride. Both the intra and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds were observed in the structure of [Ni(im) 6]F 2. 5 H 2 O (1 a). The lattice fluorides are connected by short hydrogen bonds to lattice waters. Moreover intra-molecular hydrogen bonds connect the lattice water to Æ’{NH group of imidazole. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds between lattice fluoride and Æ’{NH group of imidazole and between lattice water of one molecule and lattice fluoride of other molecule also exists and stabilizes the crystal. In [Ni(dmen) 2 F 2]. 8 H 2 O (1 b) (dmen = 1, 1,N,N-dimethylethane- 1, 2 -diamine) nickel has some what distorted octahedral geometry, in which it is coordinated to two fluorides and two 1, 1,N,N-dimethylethane- 1, 2 -diamine ligands (dmen). The fluoride ligands are trans to each other and occupy axial positions. This is an example of molecular complex. The two hydrogen bonds of apical fluorides are R(F [...] -O) = 2. 6104 (11) and 2. 6798 (12) A which are among the short F [...] -HÆ’{O hydrogen bonds between lattice water and fluoride ligand in a neutral complex.

The X-ray analysis revealed weak hydrogen bonds between lattice fluoride and lattice waters. There are also strong hydrogen bonds between lattice waters with R(O 2 [...] -O 1) = 2. 780 (2) A. This distance is significantly shorter than sum of their Vander WaalÂ¡Â¦s radii (3. 04 A). The crystal structure of [Co(bpy) 2 (CO) 3]F. 8 H 2 O (2 d) (bpy = 2, 2. -bipyridine) showed that the cobalt has distorted octahedral environment. The complex has been synthesized without adding any carbonate. The source of carbonate could be air CO 2, dissolved and get trapped in lattice during slow evaporation. OÆ’{H [...] -O and OÆ’{H [...] -F hydrogen bonds generate a one dimensional chain. The R (O [...] -F) bond length in this complex is within the range of short lattice fluoride lattice water hydrogen bond distances. Two isostructural complexes [Co(dmen) 2 F 2]. 2 H 2 O (2 b) and [Zn(dmen) 2 F 2]. 2 H 2 O (3) (dmen = 1, 1,N,N-dimethylethan- 1, 2 -diamine) were prepared. Their X-ray analysis revealed that coordinated fluorides occupied apical positions in both complexes. Lattice waters are strongly hydrogen bonded to apical fluorides. These F [...] -HOH hydrogen bonds extend through the lattice and stabilize the complex. A relatively weak intramolecular hydrogen bond exists between axial fluorides and Æ’{NH groups. The linear chain complex [Cu(isna) 4 SiF 6]. 9 H 2 O (4) (isna = isonicotinamide) was prepared by reacting copper fluoride in methanol water mixture with isonicotinamide (isna). The X-ray structure of the complex [Cu(isna) 4 SiF 6]. 9 H 2 O (4) revealed the presence of chains built up by [Cu(isna) 4] 2 + and SiF 6 2 - ions, attached to each other via CuÆ’{FÆ’{Si bonds.

The effect of a distorted earth magnetic field on orientation estimation with IMU's (using both a quaternion and a Kalman fusing algorithm) was compared to orientations derived from an optical system. Findings: The magnetic field varied considerably, with the strongest effects at 5 cm above floor level with a standard deviation in heading of 29 °, decreasing to 3 ° at levels higher than 100 cm. Orientation estimation was poor with the quaternion filter, for the Kalman filter results were acceptable, despite a systematic deterioration over time (after 20 - 30 <b>s).</b> Interpretation: <b>Distortion</b> of the earth magnetic field is depending on construction materials used in the building, and should be taken into account for calibration, alignment to a reference system, and further measurements. Mapping the measurement volume to determine its ferromagnetic characteristics in advance of planned experiments can be the rescue of the data set. Conclusions: To obtain valid data, "mapping" of the laboratory is essential, although less critical with the Kalman filter and at larger distances (> 100 cm) from suspect materials. Measurements should start in a "safe" area and continue no longer than 20 - 30 s in a heavily distorted earth magnetic field. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

From the organism's view, segregation distortion is the preferential retention of chromosomal blocks carrying genes beneficial to its fitness and reproductive viability. In wheat the best studied segregation distortes are those introduced from Aegilops species; these selfish genetic elements are named gametocidal (Gc) genes and the chromosomes carrying them are called Gc chromosomes. This genetic mechanism causes chromosome breakage in gametophytes lacking the Gc carrier chromosome, thus favoring its own retention in the genome. While the mode of action of the Gc genes is not yet known, they have been used extensively in wheat genetics {{for the development of}} deletion stocks, a key resource for elucidating the structure of physical regions containing important genes. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop the tools necessary to map the Gc 2 gene derived from Ae. sharonensis and perform map-based cloning. Extensive physical and genetic mapping located the gametocidal gene on the distal 1 % of the 4 BL arm present in the T 4 BS[dot in middle of line] 4 BL- 4 S[sh superscript]# 1 L translocation chromosome. Comparative genomics using rice provided markers distal and proximal to the Gc 2 locus; however, synteny broke down at the locus. The characterization of this chromosomal region has provided insight into its recombination frequency, synteny and composition; however, the dynamic architecture of the end of the chromosome has made comparative mapping of this region difficult...|$|R

We aim at characterizing this wet merger candidate via a multi-lambda analysis, from near-UV to optical using SWIFT-UVOT, and mapping the Halpha intensity (I) distribution, velocity (Vr), and velocity dispersion (sigma) fields with SAM+Perot-Fabry at SOAR observations. Luminosity profiles suggest that NGC 454 E is an <b>S</b> 0. <b>Distortions</b> in its outskirts {{caused by the}} on-going interaction are visible in both optical and near-UV frames. In NGC 454 W, the NUV-UVOT images and the Halpha show a set of star forming complexes connected by a faint tail. Halpha emission is detected along the line connecting NGC 454 E to the NGC 454 main HII complex. We investigate the (I-sigma), (I-Vr) (Vr-sigma) diagnostic diagrams of the HII complexes, most {{of which can be}} interpreted in a framework of expanding bubbles. In the main HII complex, enclosed in the UV brightest region, the gas velocity dispersion is highly supersonic reaching 60 km/s. However, Halpha emission profiles are mostly asymmetric indicating the presence of multiple components with an irregular kinematics. Observations point towards an advanced stage of the encounter. Our SPH simulations with chemophotometric implementation suggest that this mixed pair can be understood in terms of a 1 : 1 gas/halos encounter giving rise to a merger in about 0. 2 Gyr from the present stage.

40|$|Nowadays, {{austenitic}} stainless steels (A. S. S.) have many industrial applications {{in the fields of}} chemical and petrochemical processing, marine, medicine, water treatment, petroleum refining, food and drinks processing, nuclear power generation etc. The secret behind this wide range of applications is the fact that A. S. S. have great corrosion resistance, high strength and scale resistance at elevated temperatures, good ductility at low temperatures approached to absolute zero in addition to notable weldability. On the other hand, manual metal arc (MMA) is probably the most common process used for the welding of A. S. S. Unfortunately, MMA welding of A. S. S. could be associated with considerable distortion. Uncontrolled or excessive distortion usually increases the cost of the production process due to the high expense of rectification or replacing the weldment by a non-distorted one. MMA welding of A. S. S. was carried out using the back-step technique with various bead lengths, and without using this technique for comparison. Results have showed that the angular distortion was a function of the bead length in the back-step welding of A. S. <b>S.</b> The angular <b>distortion</b> decreased by (14. 32...|$|R

Objective video {{quality assessment}} {{still has a long way}} to go before it reaches the level of success. Perception video sequences quality metrics are of great potential benefit to the video industry. Many researchers have focused on developing digital video sequences quality metrics which produce results that accurately emulate subjective responses. However, to be widely applicable a metric must also work over a wide range of quality, and be useful for in-service quality monitoring. In this paper, we propose novel quality metric s for video sequences. The temporal correlations of video frames and the visual interest feature are considered in this method. Meanwhile t h e metric s are capable of capturing spatial distortions in video sequences. And t hey can quantify the spatial <b>distortion</b> <b>s</b> and differentiate the type of distortion.

40|$|In the {{development}} of fast axial flow (FAF) high power CO 2 lasers the increase of mass flow and the reduction of phase distortions are of main interest in the realisation of high output power with high beam quality. Both topics strongly depend on {{the layout of the}} flow system for the convective cooling of the medium. Reducing the pressure losses in the closed loop gas circuit guarantees an enhanced mass flow in the system. The element at the outlet of the discharge tubes is the place of the largest pressure losses in FAF CO 2 lasers. Optimized geometries have been developed to increase the mass flow significantly. The inlet into the discharge tube is of major interest due to phase distortions of the active medium. Besides stationary, statistical phase distortions strongly influence the output power and beam quality. The influence of inlet geometries on the flow profile has been investigated. The discharge stability could be clearly improved by new developed geometries. Measurements of <b>s</b> tatistical phase <b>distortions</b> under different flow and discharge conditions have been obtained. The work on optimizing the geometries enabled the enhancement of power incoupling into the discharge with an simultaneous decrease in the statistical phase distortions.

40|$|The {{principle}} of transmitting time-equidistant pulses to carry discrete information is fundamental. When the pulses overlap, intersymbol interference occurs. Maximum-likelihood sequence detection of such signals observed in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) {{was known in}} the early 1970 <b>s.</b> Due to <b>distortion</b> and multipath propagation, it is less artificial {{to assume that the}} received pulse shape is unknown to the receiver designer, and in this thesis, the channel is modeled as an unknown (and time-dispersive) linear filter with AWGN. First, we discuss how the conventional optimal front-end (based on the notion of a sufficient statistic and matched filtering) is inappropriate in this context. We revisit continuous time in order to derive an equivalent vector channel, and an alternative optimality criterion is reviewed. Moreover, we present an optimal sequence detector that performs joint estimation/detection by employing the generalized maximum-likelihood technique, and it is seen how such a detector relies on an exhaustive tree search. Pruning the optimal search tree leads to a suboptimal complexity-constrained algorithm, where only a subset of all sequences are evaluated as candidates. These elementary ideas are subsequently extended to the case of blind (or semiblind) soft decision detection, which also incorporates the concept of bi-directional estimation. The soft decisions are generated in the form of approximate a posteriori probabilities (APPs), and their soundness is evaluated by considering iterative detection of interleaved serially concatenated codes...|$|R

40|$|Condensation nucleus {{counters}} (CNCs) exhibit slower {{time response}} than expected due to mixing effects within the detector. This mixing produces an exponential distribution of delay {{times with a}} characteristic mixing time τ_m that ranges from 0. 1 s to 0. 9 s for commonly used instruments and limits their usefulness for measuring rapidly changing aerosols. Moreover, when used as detectors in the scanning electrical mobility spectrometer (SEMS; also known as scanning mobility particle sizer, SMPS), CNCs limit {{the speed with which}} size distribution measurements can be made. In order to overcome this limitation, a new, fast-response mixing CNC (MCNC) has been developed and characterized. The time response of this new detector and TSI Models 3025 and 3010 CNCs has been measured using a spark source to generate an aerosol pulse. The mixing induced response smearing of this new detector, τ_m, of this instrument is 0. 058 s, which is significantly shorter than either of the other instruments tested. Its lower detection limit is about 5 nm diameter. The high aerosol flow rate of the MCNC (0. 65 l min^(- 1)), fast time response, and low detection limit make it an ideal detector for SEMS/SMPS measurements. Using this MCNC as a detector for the SEMS, size distribution measurements over the 5 nm to 140 nm range have been made in 3 <b>s</b> with minimal <b>distortion.</b> The size distribution of a coagulation aerosol was effectively recovered by deconvolution with scans as short as 1 s.
