30|$|Investigation of the {{character}} of carbon fillers distribution in epoxy matrix under electric field treatment was performed for composites with the content of carbon filler of 0.05  wt%. This was done with a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> МBS- 1 equipped with digital camera Etrek DCM- 510. This setup provided the opportunity of observation online of the liquid epoxy with dispersed carbon nanoparticles under electric field influence. The configuration of experiment is described in detail in [26, 27]. A series of optical observations of the MWCNTs/− and GNPs/Larit 285 composites was conducted in real time supplying electrodes with AC voltage of 15  kHz or DC voltage and changing the value of electric field magnitude.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{development}} of micro/nano technologies and the evolvement of biotechnology {{have led to}} the research of assembling micro components into complex microsystems and manipulation of cells, genes or similar biological components. In order to develop advanced inspection/handling systems and methods for manipulation and assembly of micro products and micro components, robust micromanipulation and microassembly strategies can be implemented on a high-speed, repetitive, reliable, reconfigurable, robust and open-architecture microassembly workstation. Due to high accuracy requirements and specific mechanical and physical laws which govern the microscale world, micromanipulation and microassembly tasks require robust control strategies based on real-time sensory feedback. Vision as a passive sensor can yield high resolutions of micro objects and micro scenes along with a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> Visual data contains useful information for micromanipulation and microassembly tasks, and can be processed using various image processing and computer vision algorithms. In this thesis, the initial work on the design and implementation of a vision system for microassembly workstation is introduced. Both software and hardware issues are considered. Emphasis is put on the implementation of computer vision algorithms and vision based control techniques which help to build strong basis for the vision part of the microassembly workstation. The main goal of designing such a vision system is to perform automated micromanipulation and microassembly tasks for a variety of applications. Experiments with some teleoperated and semiautomated tasks, which aim to manipulate micro particles manually or automatically by microgripper or probe as manipulation tools, show quite promising results...|$|R
30|$|Curiosity {{and desire}} to see {{microscopic}} world have leaded {{the invention of the}} <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> Thanks to the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> the small structures that had been invisible to the naked eyes could be seen. Modern biology and medical science where large portions are based on the observation of micro-objects such as cells and bacteria have been developed with the advance in the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> With fluorescent materials, <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> became more useful and essential for the decades, but there is still a fundamental question how to achieve the spatial resolution below diffraction limit.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the digital}} {{microscope}} has the image projected directly {{on to the}} CCD camera, {{it is possible to}} have higher quality recorded images than with an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> With the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> the lenses are designed for the optics of the eye.

50|$|The <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> often {{referred}} to as light microscope, is a type of microscope which uses visible light and a system of lenses to magnify images of small samples. <b>Optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century. Basic <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> can be very simple, although there are many complex designs which aim to improve resolution and sample contrast.|$|R
40|$|Scientists {{have long}} dreamt of an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> {{that can be}} used to see a sample in {{nanometre}} resolution. Because light propagates through water and air, an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> can be used to see, in vivo, the details of living matter and other materials in their unperturbed natural condition. In addition, an optical micro-scope provides colour images that contain much richer information than other microscopes in which only monochrome images are pro-duced. In particular, the visible and mid-infrared region of light cov-ers the energies corresponding to the electronic transitions in atoms and to molecular vibrations, allowing <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> to provide information related to the intrinsic properties of the sample. But the resolution attainable with an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> is limited to about 0. 5 μm because of the di"raction of light 1 – 3. #erefore, it becomes almost impossible to image a sample at the nanoscale through an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> Breaking through this limit, an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> was proposed in which a nano-sized metallic probe tip scans the sample surfac...|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{observing a}} sample (1) with a TEM column and an optical high resolution scanning microscope (10). The sample position when observing the sample with the TEM column {{differs from the}} sample position when observing the sample with the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> in that {{in the latter case}} the sample is tilted towards the light-optical microscope. By using an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> of the scanning type, and preferably using monochromatic light, the lens elements (11) of the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> facing the sample position can be sufficiently small to be positioned between the pole faces (8 A, 8 B) of the (magnetic) particle-optical objective lens (7). This is in contrast with the objective lens systems conventionally used in <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes,</b> which show a large diameter. Furthermore the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> or at least the parts (11) close to the sample, may be retractable so as to free space when imaging in TEM mod...|$|R
50|$|Microscopes can be {{separated}} into several different classes. One grouping {{is based on}} what interacts with the sample to generate the image, i.e., light or photons (<b>optical</b> <b>microscopes),</b> electrons (electron microscopes) or a probe (scanning probe microscopes). Alternatively, microscopes can be classed on whether they analyze the sample via a scanning point (confocal <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes,</b> scanning electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes) or analyze the sample all at once (wide field <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> and transmission electron microscopes).|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{microscope}} (and the first invented) is the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses producing an enlarged image of a sample placed in the focal plane. <b>Optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> have refractive glass and occasionally of plastic or quartz, to focus light into the eye or another light detector. Mirror-based <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> operate in the same manner. Typical magnification of a light microscope, assuming visible range light, is up to 1250x with a theoretical resolution limit of around 0.250 micrometres or 250 nanometres. This limits the practical magnification limit to ~1500x. Specialized techniques (e.g., scanning confocal microscopy, Vertico SMI) may exceed this magnification but the resolution is diffraction limited. The use of shorter wavelengths of light, such as the ultraviolet, is one way to improve the spatial resolution of the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> as are devices such as the near-field scanning optical microscope.Sarfus, a recent optical technique increases the sensitivity of standard <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> to a point it becomes possible to directly visualize nanometric films (down to 0.3 nanometre) and isolated nano-objects (down to 2 nm-diameter). The technique is based on the use of non-reflecting substrates for cross-polarized reflected light microscopy.|$|R
