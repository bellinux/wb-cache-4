40|$|Ring shaped {{patches of}} clonal plants fascinated plant ecologists since long time. In this work we review the {{reports on the}} {{occurrence}} of ring pattern in different environmental conditions, the growth forms of ring-forming plants, the mechanisms underlying ring formation, and the consequences for species diversity at community <b>scale.</b> <b>Rings</b> formed by 83 species of clonal vascular plants {{have been found in}} grasslands, deserts, bare substrates of lava flow, harvested peat lands, salt marshes, and sand dunes. Four causal hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence of ring patterns: i. occurrence of architectural constraints for ramets development; ii. induction by fire, drought, trampling or overgrazing; iii. nutrient and water depletion by competition inside the ring; and iv. onset of species-specific negative plant-soil feedback in the inner zone of the clone. Since almost all the available studies are observations of ring structure or modelling exercises, none of the putative mechanisms for ring formation emerged from the literature as either generally applicable or suitable for rejection. Therefore, long-term field experiments are needed to investigate the relative prevalence of different mechanisms in different environments. Ring formation bears important consequences at community <b>scale,</b> because <b>ring</b> forming plants often act as “nurses”, enhancing the recruitment and development of different plant species. In fact, ring establishment modifies above- and below-ground environmental conditions, providing specialized safe sites for beneficiaries in the inner zone of the clones. Such interspecific facilitation by ring forming plants, particularly in chronically stressed environments, contributes to increase plant species richness and can locally promote the successional dynamics...|$|R

Fish {{were divided into}} 2 categories, sexually immature and sexually mature (grilse), using criteria typically employed at processing plants (external morphology). K. thyrsites was, {{with the exception of}} a few harvests, undetectable in the immature fish sampled between January and April 1995.

40|$|The early {{freshwater}} {{life of the}} {{two species}} of New Zealand freshwater eels, Anguilla australis schmidtii Phillipps and A. dieffenbachii Gray was studied involving an examination of 8131 glass-eels, 5275 migratory elvers, and 4291 resident eels of less than 26 cm. Most eels were collected from the Makara Stream, Wellington by set-net, hand-net and electric fishing. These extensive samples together with subsidiary collections from elsewhere in New Zealand show that glass-eels of both species arrive in fresh-water from July to December. Their otoliths indicate a marine larval life of about 18 months {{but it is not}} possible as yet to locate the precise oceanic spawning areas. Migratory movements of glass-eels are in two phases: an invasion of fresh-water from the sea and an upstream migration. The former occurs only at night with a periodicity corresponding to the daily ebb-flood tidal rhythms. There is a seasonal reversal in this response which is attributable to the onset of the behavioural transition taking place prior to the second migratory phase. Increased pigmentation and changes in response to light, flowing fresh-water and schooling tendencies characterise this latter migration which occurs primarily at spring tide periods. Such juvenile eels show specific habitat preferences and a high degree of olfactory differentiation of water types. This behaviour, together with pigment development and physical tolerances, was studied in the laboratory. Measurements of invading glass-eels show that mean length, weight and condition all decline throughout the season of arrival but mean vertebral numbers remain constant. An upstream migration of small eels (elvers) occurs each summer and is readily observed at many hydro-electric stations. These migrations, comprising eels of mixed sizes and age groups, penetrate progressively further upstream each year. In both species, scales begin formation at body lengths of 16. 5 - 20 cm. All features of scale formation, including the number of <b>scale</b> <b>rings,</b> are related to length with relative differences in rate of development occurring between the species. In contrast to <b>scale</b> <b>rings,</b> otolith rings are annual in formation and become visible after grinding or burning the otolith. Growth rates established for 273 eels to 29 cm in length from the Makara Stream, Wellington, are slow, with mean annual increments of 2. 2 and 2. 1 cm respectively for shortfins and longfins. In contrast, shortfins from a coastal lake near Wellington reach 26 cm in their third year of freshwater life. Length-weight relationships for small eels are given together with mean monthly condition factors. Growth studies on elvers held in a multiple tank unit in which temperature, density, and amount and frequency of feeding could be controlled, show that young eels grow more slowly than normal under such conditions. However, growth appears optimum at 20 degrees C with a feeding rate of 5 - 7 % body weight per day. Feeding efficiency decreases with higher temperatures. At both glass-eel and elver stages, shortfins adapt and survive better under artificial conditions...|$|R
