25|$|Through {{his brother}} Jemmy, Wilson forged {{links with the}} new Conservative leader Bonar Law. Jemmy {{had been on the}} {{platform}} in Belfast in April 1912 when Law addressed a mass meeting against Home Rule, and in the summer of 1912 he came to London to work for the Ulster Defence League (run by Walter Long and Charlie Hunter). At Charlie Hunter’s suggestion, Wilson dined with Law (23 June 1912). He was impressed by him and <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and three quarters discussing Ireland and defence matters. That summer he began having regular talks with Long, who used Wilson as a conduit to try to establish cross-party defence agreement with Churchill.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 1967, McVitie {{was invited}} to a party in Evering Road in Stoke Newington, London, with several of his underworld {{associates}} and their families. The Krays had secretly arrived at the party first and had <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> clearing away guests. Reggie Kray's initial plan to shoot McVitie upon entry failed. His gun jammed and, instead, he stabbed McVitie repeatedly in the face, chest and stomach {{as part of a}} brief but violent struggle. The twins quickly fled the scene and McVitie's body was deposited, wrapped in an eiderdown and left outside St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe by Tony and Chris Lambrianou, and Ronnie Bender, who were minor members of the Firm.|$|E
25|$|In June 1880, {{while the}} Republican Convention was in session in Chicago, former General and President Grant {{and his family}} were living in Galena. After being persuaded by his wife and {{political}} friends to stand for a nomination and run for office a third time, he finally consented. Grant would come down town in the morning on a daily basis and would <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> or two with Judge Rowley, now an old friend and former comrade, at his office, and would often talk about his recent tour around the world. During the convention Rowley's office would receive many telegrams, and while Rowley and others would receive them with great interest, Grant showed little, until one arrived with some descending news about an old trusted friend, Elihu B. Washburne, also on the list of presidential nominations. Washburne, now a competitor of Grant, was withdrawing his support and making disparaging statements about Grant, which ultimately ended their long friendship. While Grant received the news in his usual calm manner, Rowley and others, however, were very outspoken with their denunciation of Washburne.|$|E

He flew to London and met the couple at Paul McCartney's recording studio, where the McCartneys <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> recording their parts. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was supposed to go with Mirkin to London, but missed his plane. Groening commented that having McCartney and the rest of The Beatles on The Simpsons [...] "was a dream come true for all of us".|$|E
500|$|Less {{positive}} was Peter Bradshaw, {{film critic}} for The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film two out of five stars. While initially looking forward to Blunt's performance, he believed the [...] "black-belt minx" [...] actress was [...] "never really allowed to let rip. All that coiled feline sensuality stay coiled". He thought the queen's relationship with Prince Albert [...] "very, very unsexy", as their devotion [...] "makes for a boring film". Bradshaw did praise the power dynamics around Victoria, but concluded [...] "I <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and three-quarters waiting for this film to start. Where was the tang and the zing and the oomph of Fellowes's cracking script for Robert Altman's Gosford Park?" ...|$|E
500|$|Senator and {{physician}} Bill Frist opposed {{the removal of}} her feeding tube and in a speech delivered on the Senate Floor, challenged the diagnosis of Schiavo's physicians of Schiavo being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS): [...] "I question it based on {{a review of the}} video footage which I <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> or so looking at last night in my office". Frist was criticized by a medical ethicist at Northwestern University for making a diagnosis without personally examining the patient and for questioning the diagnosis when he was not a neurologist. After her death, the autopsy showed signs of long-term and irreversible damage to her brain consistent with PVS. Frist defended his actions after the autopsy.|$|E

500|$|From the start, {{fans were}} very wary of {{bringing}} in female characters to the male-dominated show; they feared Bela was brought {{on to be}} [...] "arm candy or [...] ". To make matters worse, when {{coming up with the}} scenes for the auditions for Bela, executive producer Robert Singer <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> writing a lackluster script not intended {{to be used in the}} show. Mere hours after the script was given to the casting director, the show's fans had found them on casting websites and were [...] "obsessively going over these scenes". According to Kripke, the fan reaction was the characters [...] "really look like they suck". Bela's overly-antagonistic actions throughout the season did not calm the viewers' fears. [...] " [...] over the boys so badly," [...] Kripke explained, [...] "that she became unlikeable to the fans because she was irredeemable". Kripke has confessed [...] part of the decision to kill the character off was due to the negative reaction from the fans.|$|E
500|$|... "La Llamada" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for Live! (1993). It was written by Selena y Los Dinos backup singer Pete Astudillo and Selena's brother, principal record producer and songwriter A. B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti. The song {{was intended to be}} one of three studio tracks for Selena's Live! album. Astudillo and Quintanilla III had <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> writing a song together. They wanted to write a song on a topic that many women face with their boyfriends. Quintanilla III had wanted to empower women, letting them know that they should hold their heads up and remember that life goes on. Selena favored the lyrical content and central theme, a common one in her songs. [...] "La Llamada" [...] was recorded in Corpus Christi, Texas, at Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording studio Q-Productions. Before Live! was released, the song was mixed by Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore, a family friend. Because Selena favored the song, the band released a music video. It was filmed in a beach house in Malibu, California. The video features Selena dancing with guys on one side and woman on the other. In other scenes, Selena is belting the lyrics behind blue curtains.|$|E
500|$|After season six, Mirkin {{suggested}} Oakley and Weinstein {{take over}} as showrunners, but remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping them with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing, and attending table readings of the scripts. He was the executive producer for three other episodes from season seven: [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", [...] "Radioactive Man" [...] and [...] "Team Homer". [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] was approved by Mirkin after the story was pitched by Cohen; Mirkin had just become a vegetarian himself, {{and so many of}} Lisa's experiences in the episode were based on his own. Mirkin flew to London to record the episode's guest stars Paul and Linda McCartney at Paul's recording studio, where the McCartneys <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> recording their parts. Mirkin later said that recording with the McCartneys {{was one of the most}} [...] "amazing" [...] experiences of his life and considers the episode to be one of his favorites. Mirkin returned to the role of showrunner to produce the episodes [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] and [...] "All Singing, All Dancing" [...] for season nine. He pitched the plot for [...] "The Joy of Sect", because he was attracted to the notion of parodies of cults, calling them [...] "comical, interesting and twisted".|$|E

500|$|At 9:08 pm, Chicago {{police in}} full riot gear arrived to the applause of the {{baseball}} fans remaining in the stands. Those on the field hastily dispersed upon seeing the police. [...] Thirty-nine people were arrested for disorderly conduct; estimates of injuries to those at the event range from none to over thirty. Bill Veeck wanted the teams to play the second game once order was restored. [...] However, the field was so badly torn up that umpiring crew chief Dave Phillips {{felt that it was}} still not playable even after White Sox groundskeepers <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> clearing away debris. [...] Tigers manager Sparky Anderson refused to allow his players to take the field in any event due to safety concerns. Phillips called American League president Lee MacPhail, who postponed the second game to Sunday after hearing a report on conditions. [...] Anderson, however, demanded that the game be forfeited to the Tigers. [...] He argued that under baseball's rules, a game can only be postponed due to an act of God, and that, as the home team, the White Sox were responsible for field conditions. The next day, MacPhail forfeited the second game to the Tigers 9–0. In a ruling that largely upheld Anderson's arguments, MacPhail stated that the White Sox had failed to provide acceptable playing conditions.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Nesbitt and {{his agent}} met with BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter to discuss {{a new series of}} Murphy's Law. At the meeting's conclusion, Tranter offered Nesbitt the first episode script of Jekyll, a {{television}} series by Steven Moffat that updated Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Nesbitt spent three hours reading the script before accepting the role of Tom Jackman—and his alter-ego Mr Hyde. After signing on for the role, he met with Moffat and Hartswood Films executive producer Beryl Vertue to discuss the character, and had several make-up tests. His anticipation for the part was heightened because filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006. Nesbitt <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> each day being made up as Hyde; a wig altered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde [...] "soulless", though CGI was used to show the transformation from Jackman in close-ups. The series was broadcast on BBC One in June and July 2007. The role secured him a nomination from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, and a nomination for the Rose d'Or for Best Entertainer.|$|E

2500|$|According to pretrial testimony, Hasan {{entered the}} Guns Galore store in Killeen on July 31, 2009, and {{purchased}} the FN Five-seven semi-automatic pistol {{that he was}} to use in the attack at Fort Hood. According to Army Specialist William Gilbert, a regular customer at the store, Hasan entered the store and asked for [...] "the most technologically advanced weapon on the market and the one with the highest standard magazine capacity". Hasan was allegedly asked how he intended to use the weapon, but simply repeated that he wanted the most advanced handgun with the largest magazine capacity. The three people with Hasan—Gilbert, the store manager, and an employee—all recommended the FN Five-seven pistol. As Gilbert owned one of the pistols, he <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> describing its operation to Hasan.|$|E
