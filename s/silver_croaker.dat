40|$|The fish family Sciaenidae has {{numerous}} {{species that}} produce sounds with superfast muscles that vibrate the swimbladder. These muscles form post embryonically and undergo seasonal hypertrophy-atrophy cycles. The {{family has been}} the focus of numerous passive acoustic studies to localize spatial and temporal occurrence of spawning aggregations. Fishes produce disturbance calls when hand-held, and males form aggregations in late afternoon and produce advertisement calls to attract females for mating. Previous studies on five continents have been confined to temperate species. Here we examine the calls of the <b>silver</b> <b>croaker</b> Plagioscion squamosissimus, a freshwater equatorial species, which experiences constant photoperiod, minimal temperature variation but seasonal changes in water depth and color, pH and conductivity. Dissections indicate that sonic muscles are present exclusively in males and that muscles are thicker and redder during the mating season. Disturbance calls were recorded in hand-held fish during the low-water mating season and high-water period outside of the mating season. Advertisement calls were recorded from wild fish that formed aggregations in both periods but only during the mating season from fish in large cages. Disturbance calls consist of a series of short individual pulses in mature males. Advertisement calls start with single and paired pulses followed by greater amplitude multi-pulse bursts with higher peak frequencies than in disturbance calls. Advertisement-like calls also occur in aggregations during the off season, but bursts are shorter with fewer pulses. <b>Silver</b> <b>croaker</b> produce complex advertisement calls that vary in amplitude, number of cycles per burst and burst duration of their calls. Unlike temperate sciaenids, which only call during the spawning season, <b>silver</b> <b>croaker</b> produce advertisement calls in both seasons. Sonic muscles are thinner, and bursts are shorter than at the spawning peak, but males still produce complex calls outside of the mating season...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{increasing}} population of giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai has negatively affected coastal fisheries in Korea. As a result, {{the fishing industry}} has begun developing devices to prevent jellyfish capture. In this study, we assessed {{the performance of a}} conical jellyfish exclusion device in the coastal areas of Yokji Island in southern Korea during 2009. After hauling, we measured the length, diameter, and weight of the jellyfish and fish that were captured by the cod end and cover net. We found that the captured species included N. nomurai, <b>silver</b> <b>croakers</b> Pennahia argentata, yellow croakers Larimichthys polyactics, shotted halibut Eopsetta grigorjewi, largehead hairtails Trichiurus lepturus, and melon seeds Psenopsis anomala. The catch ratios of the giant jellyfish that entered the cod end in terms of weight ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 027. In contrast, the catch ratios of total fish in terms of weight and number were 0. 793 and 0. 835, respectively. On selectivity analysis of a conical separator for individual fish species, their exclusion ratios were independent of their length, and were similar to their observed exclusion ratios in terms of number. These results indicated that the conical jellyfish exclusion device performs well; however, some improvements are needed to minimize the escape of fish from the net...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{results of a}} trawl survey during 2003 ^ 2004 to assess the {{abundance}} of demersal ¢sh resources in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. Samples were taken at a total of 316 trawl stations selected following a strati¢ed random procedure. Catch rates (catch per unit area, CPUA) and total biomass were estimated. Total demersal ¢sh biomass {{was estimated to be}} approximately 73, 000 tonnes in Persian Gulf waters and approximately 39, 000 tonnes in the Oman Sea. The lowest CPUA was recorded in the west of the study area (stratum A, approximately 1700 kg/n. m. 2) and the highest in the east (stratum Q, 13943. 4 kg/n. m. 2), although density of commercially important species was higher in the central area (stratum K). Catch rate and biomass varied signi¢cantly in relation to seabed depth. Commercially impor-tant demersal species made up around 60 % of the estimated total biomass. The most abundant species groups were rays, cat¢sh, grunts, nemipterids and carangids. Several important species (e. g. <b>silver</b> pomfret, <b>croakers</b> and sharks) appear to have declined since the late 1970 s while others, such as rays and cat¢sh, have increased...|$|R
30|$|For n- 3 and n- 6 PUFAs, {{the highest}} content {{was found for}} Atlantic salmon and grey mullet {{at the level of}} 2, 900 and 1, 980  mg per 100  g, respectively. Regarding EPA, DHA, and DPA, fatty acids that need to be intake from food, the total amount varied from 31.3 to 2, 510  mg per 100  g. No matter whether the {{individual}} or sum of these n- 3 fatty acids is concerned, the highest amount was found in Atlantic salmon. While Japanese eel, laced moray, grunt, yellow <b>croaker,</b> <b>silver</b> pomfret, false halibut, white trevally, purple amberjack, and yellowtail kingfish from region B were also found to contain more than 1, 000  mg per 100  g of these n- 3 fatty acids.

40|$|Neoechinorhynchus manubrianus Amin, Ha & Ha, 2011 (Acanthocephala: Neoechinorhynchidae) (formerly Neoechinorhynchus manubriensis Amin, Ha & Ha, 2011), was {{recently}} described based on optical microscopy of four males and two females (none was gravid) from caroun croaker, Johnius carouna (Cuvier), flower croaker, Nibea albiflora (Richardson), and <b>silver</b> <b>croaker,</b> Pennabia argentata (Houttuyen) (Sciaenidae) in Halong Bay, Vietnam. Subsequently, many more specimens became available from N. albiflora that were studied using SEM. SEM studies showed many additional features {{that were not}} possible to discern with optical microscopy. These included the prominent angulation of the anterior trunk, the presence of (1) anterio-dorsal and (2) undulating mid-lateral fin-like protrusions of the body wall, uniquely shaped eggs as well as details of trunk micropores, proboscis, bursa, and female gonopore. Microscopical examination of eggs from the new collection demonstrated the presence of polar prolongation of fertilization membrane which places N. manubriensis in the subgenus Hebesoma. The features of trunk angulation, trunk fins, and egg morphology further distinguish N. manubriensis from all other species of Neoechinorhynchus Stiles and Hassall, 1905 from Vietnam or from any where else in the world...|$|E
40|$|Vila do Conde is an {{important}} industrial complex {{in the south of}} the Marajó Bay. Despite the important fishery activity and the vulnerability in terms of environmental impacts, no relevant scientific study on fishery and ichthyofauna has been carried out in the area. This study aimed to describe the fishing activity by monitoring commercial landings of the main site (Praia do Conde) of the region between December 2005 and November 2006. The relative abundance index, catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE in kg/fishing trip), was used to identify the harvest season, species and fleet most relevant in the region. Forty-three boats were monitored, mainly small wooden boats. The main fishing gear was the long-line. The main local species were Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii (dourada catfish), Plagioscion squamosissimus (South American <b>silver</b> <b>croaker),</b> Pellona flavipinnis (yellowfin river pellona), P. castelnaeana (Amazon pellona) e B. filamentosum (filhote). Fleets caught an average of 19 kg/trip. Motorised boats were more productive than non-motorised. Two maximum harvest periods were observed: in January and September/October. The gross revenue of the fishery was over R$ 100, 000. 00. Wooden small boats contributed to 36 % of the total catch...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In November 2014 and May 2015, a {{total of}} 44 {{specimens}} of the South American <b>silver</b> <b>croaker</b> Plagioscion squamosissimus were collected: 30 in Marajó Bay and 14 in the Tapajós River, state of Pará, Brazil. The aim {{was to investigate the}} presence of anisakid nematodes and determine their parasitism indices and sites of infection, because of their importance regarding health inspection. Sixty-nine Anisakis sp. larvae were found; among them, 16 larvae in seven fish collected in Marajó Bay and 53 larvae in four fish in the Tapajós River. The parasitism indices of the nematodes collected from the fish in Marajó Bay comprised prevalence (P) of 23 %, mean infection intensity (MI) of 2. 28, mean abundance (MA) of 0. 53, range of infection (RI) of 1 - 4, and infection site (IS) in the mesentery. The fish from the Tapajós River showed P = 28 %, MI = 13. 2, MA = 3. 8, RI = 1 - 22, and IS = mesentery and intestine. To assist in taxonomic identification, images of the specimens obtained through optical microscopy with Nomarski's interferential contrast system and scanning electron microscopy were used. This is the first record of Anisakis sp. parasitizing P. squamosissimus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. -Guri Reservoir in Venezuela {{supports}} {{sport fisheries}} for two cichlid species (pavon venado or speckled pavon Cichla temensis and pavon mariposa C. orinocensis) and payara Hy-drolycus scomberoides. The lake receives acidic, hyperoligotrophic "black waters " from the Caroni River and experiences water level fluctuations associated with seasonal precipitation and hydro-electric operations. During the early 1980 s, piscivore populations expanded {{in the new}} reservoir, but the quality of sportfishing declined during the 1990 s. During 1993 - 94, we studied {{the ecology of the}} two Cichla species, H. scomberoides, and a fourth piscivore, Plagioscion squamosissimus (curvinata or <b>silver</b> <b>croaker)</b> and compared our data with those from similar surveys performed 7 - 9 years earlier (0 - 2 years after attainment of the reservoir's current crest height). Seine and gill-net samples from the lake's northern region produced 50 fish species from 18 families. Seine samples were dominated by a small characid, Hemigrammus micropterus, whereas gill-net samples were dominated by a large detritivorous characiform, Prochilodus rubrotaeniatus. Gill-net catch rates were low in all three surveys. All four piscivores from our recent survey had better body condition than in a 1985 - 1986 study, an indication of possible growth compensation. Diet breadths of all piscivores were low, and diet overlap was low for H. scomberoides with the two Cichl...|$|E
