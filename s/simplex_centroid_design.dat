For this purpose, response surface methodology based on a <b>simplex</b> <b>centroid</b> mixture <b>design</b> with constrain (sum of salt percentages = 10 %) was used. All treatments reached appropriate titratable acidity levels, but this parameter could not {{be related to the}} initial chloride salt concentration. The presence of CaCl 2 led to lower initial and after-fermentation pHs, delayed sugar diffusion into the brine, its maximum concentration and titratable acidity formation. CaCl 2 also delayed Enterobacteriaceae and yeast sprang, decreasing their overall growth. This chloride salt also showed a tendency to reduce overall lactic acid bacteria growth. KCl had a similar behaviour to NaCl but, in general, increased overall microbial growth. Thus, a partial substitution of NaCl in Spanish-style green olives with KCl and CaCl 2 does not substantially modify the fermentation profile but does produce some changes, which, when properly managed, could help to improve product processing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The contour plots of each response were drawn based on the equation given by the statistical fitted models. With the optimization of more than one criterion, a combined contour plot was made so that the optimum formulation to satisfy the overall goal was obtained. The formulation containing 33. 33 % of each polymer gave an optimal result. This final product met not only the requirements placed on it, but also the practical mass production criteria of process and product reproducibility. Moreover, it showed a good stability at ambient condition. ^ Artificial neural networks were utilized for modeling and predicting the characteristics of the granule properties, the tablet properties, and the dissolution profiles. The artificial neural networks satisfactorily predicted all the granulation properties, the tablet properties, and the dissolution profiles in both the training and the testing step. The artificial neural network methodology showed to be an excellent modeling tool, in comparison to the traditional response surface methodology both for data fitting and prediction abilities. ^ The granulation method was found to produce similar tablet properties and dissolution profiles, but had a significant effect on the granule properties. The drug loading had a high correlation to the intrinsic dissolution rate of the drug. The effects of the intrinsic dissolution rate were differences in a swelling matrix, an erosion matrix, and a porous matrix. The different model drugs had significant effect on the granule properties, tablet properties and dissolution profiles. The release of the given drugs from the matrix systems was influenced by the aqueous solubility of the drugs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to prepare buccal {{adhesive}} tablets of miconazole nitrate. The <b>simplex</b> <b>centroid</b> experimental <b>design</b> was used to arrive at optimum ratio of carbopol 934 P, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose K 4 M and polyvinylpyrollidone, which will provide desired drug release and mucoadhesion. Swelling index, mucoadhesive strength and in vitro drug release of the prepared tablet was determined. The drug release and bioadhesion was dependent on type and relative amounts of the polymers. The optimized combination was subjected to in vitro antifungal activity, transmucosal permeation, drug deposition in mucosa, residence time and bioadhesion studies. IR spectroscopy was used to investigate any interaction between drug and excipients. Dissolution of miconazole from tablets was sustained for 6 h. based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the prepared slow release buccoadhesive tablets of miconazole would markedly prolong the duration of antifungal activity. Comparison of in vitro antifungal activity of tablet with marketed gel showed that drug concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration were achieved immediately from both formulations but release from tablet was sustained up to 6 h, while the gel showed initially fast drug release, which did not sustain later. Drug permeation across buccal mucosa was minimum from the tablet as well as marketed gel; the deposition of drug in mucosa was higher in case of tablet. In vitro residence time and bioadhesive strength of tablet was higher than gel. Thus the buccoadhesive tablet of miconazole nitrate may offer better control of antifungal activity as compared to the gel formulation...|$|R

Normally the elements to be determined in the organic matrix must {{be transformed into a}} simple inorganic form. A digestion method by heating on a block digestor has been developed for the determination of Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, V and Zn in Oyster tissue by ICP OES. A <b>simplex</b> <b>centroid</b> statistical mixture <b>design</b> has been used to study the effects of changing HNO 3, HCl and H 2 O 2 reagent proportions on the digestion of these samples. Response surface and principal component analyses show that the species Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn have very similar analytical tendencies under this experiment. By means of mixture modeling maximum recoveries for these ions were predicted using 19 %, 18 % and 63 % of the HCl, HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 pseudocomponent mixtures, respectively. This corresponds to 21. 4 %, 30. 8 % and 47. 8 % of the HCl, HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 commercial solutions. Furthermore the As, Co and V ions present large recoveries for these mixtures as well. The Al and Ba ion recoveries are seen to be independent of the mixture proportions. The analysis of Oyster tissue reference material (SRM 1566 b – NIST) under optimized conditions at the selected wavelengths resulted in ion recoveries between 90 % and 100 %...|$|R

For this procedure, powdered samples were treated with an acid mixture and submitted to ultrasound energy for extracting the target elements (Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Sr and Zn). <b>Centroid</b> <b>simplex</b> mixture <b>design</b> was used for optimize the acid proportions (nitric, acetic and chloride acid) and Box Behnken design {{was applied for}} optimize the process variables (particle size, final concentration of extracting solution and sonication time) after mixture optimization. Iron had not presented quantitative extractions and it was excluded from final samples analysis. The developed method presents the follow limits of quantification in μg g− 1 : Ba (0. 90); Ca (5. 2); Cu (4. 0); K (0. 90); Mg (1. 4); Mn (0. 22); Sr (0. 25) and Zn (4. 0). Accuracy was accessed by comparison of determined concentration with the values obtained by the microwave digestion procedure. The proposed method was applied toward the determination of elemental composition in bean samples collected in the country zone from Jequié city located on the Bahia State, Brazil.
