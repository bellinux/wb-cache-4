50|$|The tractor {{is built}} using a {{frameless}} block construction. The rear axle is a portal axle, the front axle is a swing axle. The wheelbase is 1668 mm. The {{track of the}} front wheels can be increased by turning the rims on the vertical axis. The internal expanding brake brakes the back wheels only. It can also act as a <b>steering</b> <b>brake.</b> The steering gear and the gearbox were produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. All Porsche-Diesel 218 tractors have a six gear gearbox with a crawler gear. The clutch is the single-disk dry clutch K 200 Z by Fichtel & Sachs. It operates with an oil hydraulic clutch by Voith. The exception is the Standard V 218, which has a five gear gearbox only. It also lacks the oil hydraulic clutch. Porsche-Diesel offered a Three-point linkage as an optional equipment. It can lift up to 550 kg The second optional equipment is a mowing bar. It was offered for DM 500. The weight of the tractor is 1625 kg including the three-point-linkage, the mower bar and the extra weights. The maximum weight allowed is 2300kg. The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims. The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.|$|E

40|$|NIST is {{applying}} their Real-time Control System (RCS) {{methodology for}} control of ground vehicles for both the U. S. Army Research Lab, {{as part of the}} DOD's Unmanned Ground Vehicles program, and for the Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle / Highway Systems (IVHS) program. The actuated vehicle, a military HMMWV, has motors for <b>steering,</b> <b>brake,</b> throttle, etc. and sensors for the dashboard gauges. For military operations, the vehicle has two modes of operation: a teleoperation mode - where an operator remotely controls the vehicle over an RF communications network; and a semi-autonomous mode called retro-traverse - where the control system uses an inertial navigation system to steer the vehicle along a prerecorded path. For the IVHS work, intelligent vision processing elements replace the human teleoperator to achieve autonomous, visually guided road following. 1.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-contact, non-wear-out solution for long span absolute linear position sensing. This solution utilizes {{an array of}} magnetoresistive (MR) sensors, a magnet and signal conditioning electronics. The sensors are {{used to determine the}} position of a magnet that is attached to a moving object. In addition to mechanical benefits, this solution offers a high accuracy, low power solution. In this paper we will discuss the operating principles, system error and applications of this approach. This approach will be beneficial in applications for linear position or displacement, LVDT replacements, proximity detection, valve positioning, shaft travel, automotive <b>steering,</b> <b>brake</b> and throttle position systems. This will be used in industries including Automotive, Aviation and Industrial Process Control. Background Linear position sensors {{play an important role in}} automation control where precision positioning is required. Many manufacturers are looking for new approaches to meet today’s needs of high reliability and accuracy. [1] The benefits of this approach for position sensing are a non-contact, long-lasting, solid-state design with no moving parts to wear out, and no dropped signals from worn tracks, as can occur in conventional contact-based position sensing. [2] This approach fits rugged environments, such as high temperature. Because the angle direction of the field from the magnet i...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the development history and technical {{highlights of the}} Space Shuttle Orbiter Drag Chute Program. Data and references are given on the design, development, and testing of the system, plus several interesting operational issues and solutions. The last Shuttle flight was completed in 2011 and all the Orbiters have now become museum pieces. Before all the data from system development and the 86 Orbiter Drag Chute (ODC) operational landings is lost or forgotten, {{it may be useful}} to summarize it here and to identify data sources for future reference. Much has been written about various aspects of the program, and this summary has attempted to cite many such references to make available more detailed information. The ODC program was a high-visibility NASA program that afforded the opportunity to thoroughly engineer and test the chute system, far beyond so many of today s tight-budget programs. So the ODC program was extremely informative [...] it provided a wide scope of information including protective door jettison issues and solutions, wind tunnel data and analyses on chute stability and drag behind a huge and rather blunt forebody, component and system reuse, and chute cleaning methods. Technology and data created have aided several current and past parachute programs, {{and will continue to do}} so in the future. The original Orbiter preliminary design included a drag parachute [...] it was deleted early to save weight. But after the 1987 Challenger accident and during the program redefinition phase that followed, Astronaut John Young presented a strong case for enhancing landing safety by adding nosegear <b>steering,</b> <b>brake</b> improvements, and reviving the drag chute...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} CityCarControl, {{a system to}} manage the <b>steering,</b> <b>braking,</b> and {{throttle}} of {{a new class of}} intra-city electric vehicles. These vehicles have a focus on extreme light-weight and a small parking footprint. In order to maximize maneuverability within a city environment, we show the feasibility of omnidirectional steering, and the integration of a folding chassis. Furthermore, we apply traditionally programming best-practice techniques to simplify the design of the control system. Specifically, we present the concept of a modular, fail-silent wheel-robot with a standardized API responsible for controlling <b>steering,</b> <b>braking</b> and throttle within the vehicle. by Thomas B.

30|$|Some driver {{assistance}} systems focus on detecting unavoidable collisions. This computation {{is a special}} case of binary collision prediction where risk is assigned the value 0 or 1 depending on whether there exists a collision-free maneuver that the driver can perform. Determining whether such a maneuver exists {{can be done in}} two ways. The first one consists in computing escape maneuvers (i.e. how the vehicle should steer, brake or accelerate to avoid the collision) and check whether these maneuvers are feasible (with “feasible” meaning that the <b>steering,</b> <b>braking</b> or accelerating does not exceed the physical limitations of the vehicle) [[2]]. The second one is to consider the entire space of combined <b>steering,</b> <b>braking</b> and accelerating maneuvers, and to perform an optimized search for collision-free trajectories [[7]]. This concept is closely related to the notion of Inevitable Collision States (ICS) [[62]] used in robotics.|$|R
