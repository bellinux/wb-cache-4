50|$|In 1997, the United States CENTRASBAT program paid over $5 {{million to}} fund a {{training}} exercise between Uzbek and American troops {{that were going to}} be stationed in the country. Later in 1998, a US general attended an Uzbek base that had a unit which took part in the training. After asking for a show of hands of who took part in it, only two raised them. Most Uzbek soldiers leave the service when their mandatory conscription ends. The US forces have found this to be the case in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan as well. The army was similarly run to the Soviet one, in terms of command, <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> Senior commanders gave strict orders that allowed little freedom of decision.|$|E
50|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{change to the}} State Floor was revising the Grand Stair to discharge eastward into the Entrance Hall {{to provide a more}} ceremonial procession from the upstairs. The opening to the south was kept with a railing providing a balcony-type overview into the Cross Hall. On the Second Floor, the rooms above the East Room were lowered due to a thinner (yet stronger) steel floor structure. This allowed access from the Central Hall via a short ramp in a central passageway that was narrowed to accommodate an additional service stair and added closets. Additions to the Ground Floor included additional service elevators to service the upper floors, a bowling alley, expanded kitchen, broadcast studio, barber shop, medical and dental clinics, carpentry and upholstery shops, and large <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> spaces.|$|E

Performance appraisals of operation centers are becoming more precise and effective and are inspiring increasing competition [15].|$|E

40|$|Current B 2 B (Business to Business) {{models are}} not capable to cover neither {{customer}} expectations {{in terms of}} quality nor personalization. Network, <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> providers are tied to traditional business models, missing the opportunity to increase their revenues derived from the integration of Quality of Experience (QoE) models in their frameworks. In this work, we propose a B 2 B QoE model which comprises the main guidelines to successfully integrate the QoE within the value chain and provide with added-value services to potential subscribers. We also evaluate the potential QoE end-user market for six European countries. Results indicate {{that there is a}} niche for QoE based models which rely on the joint action of value chain actors and its agreement with the regulatory environment. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{principal}} regional entity must {{be established}} and must be responsible to the primary-level organization. The regional operations center is solely responsible for service delivery. The operations center is responsible for routine management within its operation zone, including not only the station service but also all equipment maintenance and emergency responses. By optimizing the organizational structure and combining the station attendant staff with the staff responsible for maintaining passenger interface equipment, the two positions will be better coordinated. As a result, resource sharing and faster response rates will be realized, thus strengthening the collaboration between passenger <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> maintenance. Considering service delivery (e.g., “customer-oriented, serve society”) as a starting point, the traditional boundaries of specialized departments are no longer valid; instead, each regional manager is now responsible for meeting customers’ demands as quickly as possible.|$|E
40|$|When {{studying}} the rank-size {{relationship in the}} settlement system, principles like hierarchy, centrality, and specialization should be the prevailing instruments, whilst primacy should be considered just to a lower extent. According to the NPSP (National Plan of Spatial Planning) in the Turda - Alba Iulia Corridor there are settlements of rank II, III and IV, correspondingly municipalities as county capitals, other municipalities and towns. According to the NPSP, rank II may correspond to differently ranked localities, such as Alba-Iulia and Aiud. However, the first mentioned clearly has a larger size {{from the perspective of}} administration, <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> facilities (hospitals, supermarkets). The relationships between the urban centers in the Turda - Alba Iulia Corridor can be grouped into four categories: county subordinate relationships, relationships of inter-county independence, relationships of local competition, and local collaboration relationships. The subordination relationships prevail in Alba County, as they are induced by the hierarchic position of its capital town, Alba Iulia, which is a classical case of administrative subordination. The independence relationships are developed between the urban settlements in Cluj County and those in Alba County. Relationships of competition appear mainly between the urban centers in the same county, both in Alba and Cluj. Relationships of collaboration are developed between Turda and Câmpia Turzii towns, although relations of competition were also identified between these two...|$|E
