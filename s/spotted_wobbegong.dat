40|$|Wobbegongs are benthic sharks {{that are}} commercially {{targeted}} in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Given a dramatic reduction {{of more than}} 50 % in landed catch in a decade, {{there is a clear}} need to ensure that basic ecological data such as distribution and abundance are available for management use. Opportunistic sightings of wobbegongs collected by recreational scuba-divers were used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of wobbegongs in NSW. From July 2003 until January 2005, 304 dives were undertaken by recreational divers and 454 wobbegongs were reported. Larger numbers of wobbegongs were sighted in northern compared to southern NSW. <b>Spotted</b> and ornate <b>wobbegongs</b> were sighted in similar numbers, but species composition was highly variable across locations. Only a few juvenile and newborn <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegongs</b> were sighted, whereas small ornate wobbegongs were mostly sighted north of central NSW. The latter were possibly the third, cryptic species, the dwarf ornate wobbegong. The paucity of sightings of small wobbegongs suggests that juveniles and newborns are inconspicuous to divers or that small wobbegongs are found in areas not visited by divers. Potential species and size segregation suggest that closing areas to fishing may enable populations to sustain current levels of commercial exploitation. The cost-effectiveness of using recreational scuba-divers to opportunistically collect distribution and relative abundance data was apparent from this study. However, the lack of spatial and temporal homogeneity in diving effort suggests that future studies should consider incorporating organized surveys and a facilitator, rather than using opportunistic records of sightings. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Several visual traits have {{previously}} been assessed in elasmobranchs; however, {{few studies have}} examined and compared multiple visual attributes within a particular genus. The primary advantage of studying closely related species is that any differences between them are more likely to reflect functional ecological adaptations rather than the effects of phylogenetic separation. In this study, the visual capabilities of 4 wobbegong shark species, which vary in life-history and/or habitat, were examined: the western wobbegong (Orectolobus hutchinsi), the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (O. maculatus), the ornate wobbegong (O. ornatus) and the dwarf <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (O. parvimaculatus). The retinae of all 4 wobbegong species are duplex; rod and cone photoreceptors can be distinguished easily on the basis of morphology. Some variation in relative eye size exists, with O. parvimaculatus possessing the largest eyes. The topographic distribution of cells within the ganglion cell layer of O. hutchinsi reveals a weakly elongated central visual streak of increased cell density, mediating a higher spatial resolving power of 2. 06 cycles deg⁻¹ in the frontal visual field. Retinal topography of O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus is similar, with both possessing a dorsal horizontal streak facilitating an increased spatial resolving power of 3. 51 cycles deg⁻¹ and 3. 91 cycles deg⁻¹, respectively, in the lower visual field. O. parvimaculatus also possesses an area of increased cell density in the naso-ventral region of the retina, mediating acute vision in the upper caudal region of the visual field. While all 4 species have visual systems optimised for increased visual sensitivity, O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus appear to be particularly well suited to activity under low light conditions. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs {{are thought}} to possess an acute sense of smell, but the {{relationship}} between the anatomy of their olfactory organs and their sensory ecology is poorly understood. Moreover, the ecological diversity of elasmobranchs as a group indicates that there might be considerable interspecific variation in the importance of the olfactory sense. Wobbegong sharks, with their sedentary lifestyle and ambush predatory technique, probably utilize their senses differently than other shark species, making it difficult to generalize about their olfactory capabilities and olfactiondependent behaviors. In this study, the number of olfactory lamellae and the surface area of the olfactory epithelium were measured as a means of assessing relative olfactory sensitivity in four species of wobbegong shark (the Western wobbegong, Orectolobus hutchinsi; the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. maculatus; the ornate wobbegong, O. ornatus; and the dwarf <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. parvimaculatus). We also present a phylogenetic comparative analysis between wobbegongs and other elasmobranchs for which published data on olfactory morphology are available. There is {{a significant difference in the}} total number of olfactory lamellae between most species, but not between O. hutchinsi and O. maculatus, although the olfactory sensory surface area is comparable between these two species and O. ornatus. Orectolobus parvimaculatus has a significantly larger olfactory sensory surface area than the other three species, and there is a positive relationship between total body length and olfactory sensory surface area for all four species. Assuming that these morphological measures are true indications of olfactory capability, the olfactory abilities of wobbegongs are as good as, or better than, other benthic elasmobranchs. Interspecific differences in olfactory ability within this group of benthic ambush predators could indicate relative differences in prey detection, intraspecific recognition and mate detection. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Electroreception is {{an ancient}} sense found in many aquatic animals, {{including}} sharks, which {{may be used in}} the detection of prey, predators and mates. Wobbegong sharks (Orectolobidae) and angel sharks (Squatinidae) represent two distantly related families that have independently evolved a similar dorso-ventrally compressed body form to complement their benthic ambush feeding strategy. Consequently, these groups represent useful models in which to investigate the specific morphological and physiological adaptations that are driven by the adoption of a benthic lifestyle. In this study, we compared the distribution and abundance of electrosensory pores in the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> shark (Orectolobus maculatus) with the Australian angel shark (Squatina australis) to determine whether both species display a similar pattern of clustering of sub-dermal electroreceptors and to further understand the functional importance of electroreception in the feeding behaviour of these benthic sharks. Orectolobus maculatus has a more complex electrosensory system than S. australis, with a higher abundance of pores and an additional cluster of electroreceptors positioned in the snout (the superficial ophthalmic cluster). Interestingly, both species possess a cluster of pores (the hyoid cluster, positioned slightly posterior to the first gill slit) more commonly found in rays, but which may be present in all benthic elasmobranchs to assist in the detection of approaching predators. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Many shark species form groups; yet {{the drivers}} of this {{behaviour}} {{are not well}} understood. Aggregations have been presumed to {{be a function of}} resource availability or phenology. However, recent studies have suggested that some sharks display preferences in their associations with conspecifics and that complex social networks may underpin their movement patterns, demographic distribution and fitness. This study used a network approach to investigate patterns of sociality of a benthic predator, the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> shark, Orectolobus maculatus (Family Orectolobidae), in a small marine reserve. Spatial data obtained from fine-scale passive acoustic telemetry were used to infer association preferences of 15 tagged sharks over a 15 -month period. Thirty-five associating dyads emerged, with permutation tests indicating that these were nonrandomly formed. Many dyads were temporally stable, with some persisting even after sharks returned to the reserve from their seasonal migration. A complete but sparse network was observed and although association patterns were evident at the dyadic level, indication of stable communities or network structure was limited. The population was not found to be gregarious and exclusive pairs were not observed, with 14 sharks associating with more than one individual. Assortative mixing (by sex, size and familiarity) was not present and range overlap did not strongly correlate with association indices. This suggests that these relationships are not a random result of nonsocial grouping behaviours but can be explained, at least in part, by genuine social affiliation. As such, anthropogenic influences on the population may have more complex impacts than previously thought. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} the mechanosensory lateral line (MLL) have {{provided}} valuable insights into the predatory, escape and navigation behaviours of teleost and elasmobranch fishes. Recent work on the MLL in elasmobranchs has focused on canal morphology and pore topography in batoid species, with considerably less detailed examination of the canal system of sharks. In this study, the spatial arrangement of MLL canals and pit organs, and the morphology of the sensory neuromasts, are described for two species of wobbegong shark: the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> Orectolobus maculatus and the ornate wobbegong O. ornatus. Wobbegongs are benthic species that employ an ambush feeding strategy, and it is hypothesised that the MLL will be adapted for both these ecological traits. The spatial distribution of the MLL system in both species is broadly similar to other elasmobranchs, with a dorsal concentration of canals and pit organs that is ideally suited for detecting water flow {{over the top of}} the head. This arrangement may facilitate the detection of prey and predators swimming above and in front of the shark. The non-pored canals positioned directly above the mouth may be used as mechanotactile receptors to optimise 2 ̆ 7 touch 2 ̆ 7 sensation when feeding. Wobbegong canal and pit organ neuromast hair cell morphology is typical of other sharks; however, canal neuromast sensory tissue differs from other elasmobranch species in that it is not continuous throughout the canals. The study provides evidence that the MLL system of wobbegong sharks is well adapted for their rather unique feeding mode and benthic lifestyle...|$|E

This study used a network approach to investigate patterns of sociality of a demersal predator, the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> shark, in a small marine reserve. Spatial data obtained from fine-scale passive acoustic telemetry were used to show that some sharks display preferences in their associations, many of which persisted after sharks returned to the reserve from their seasonal migration. These relationships were not exclusive, with some sharks forming associations with multiple individuals. Patterns were evident at the dyadic level, but limited evidence was found of a stable community or network structure. It appears that the species is not primarily gregarious but that benefits may be gained by maintaining a level of familiarity with a limited number of conspecifics. The composition of groups in terms of individual attributes (sex, size and familiarity) suggested that non-social aggregative behaviour was not a strong influence on association patterns. Site fidelity and home range overlap were also found to only marginally influence these associations. This suggests that the observed relationships can be explained, at least in part, by genuine social affiliation and that anthropogenic influences on the population may have more complex impacts than previously thought.

40|$|The {{present study}} used {{wobbegong}} sharks (genus Orectolobus) {{to assess the}} threshold value proposed by previous research to categorize strict lecithotrophic from incipient histotrophic species. Totals of 236 and 135 ornate wobbegong Orectolobus ornatus and <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong</b> Orectolobus maculatus, respectively, were collected from the New South Wales commercial fishery between June 2003 and May 2006. Eight pregnant gulf wobbegong Orectolobus halei were also recorded outside the sampling period for the first time. The three species were reproductively synchronous with a gestation of c. 10 - 11 months. Embryos started to be macroscopically visible during January and external yolk sacs were fully absorbed by June to July when embryos were c. 200 mm total length (LT). Internal yolk sacs were first observed during April to May when embryos were c. 160 mm LT, reached a peak during June and persisted in embryos immediately prior to parturition. The total wet mass from uterine egg to full-term embryos increased by 44 - 89 % and 45 - 62 %, whereas the total organic mass decreased by 32 - 33 % and 26 %, for O. o rnatus and O. maculatus, respectively, suggesting that these species are strict lecithotrophic yolk-sac viviparous sharks with no maternal nutrient input. A {{review of the literature}} identified various issues and suggested that the previously proposed organic mass loss threshold value separating strict lecithotrophic species from incipient histotrophic species might not be appropriate. Instead, it is recommended that a combination of methods (e. g. estimation of organic mass gain or loss between ovarian egg and developed embryo, histology and electron microscopy of the uterus, radio-tracer assay and uterine fluid analysis throughout gestation) is used to discern between strict lecithotrophic and incipient histotrophic species. 15 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) {{possess a}} {{sophisticated}} array of sensory systems that are, undoubtedly, {{of great importance}} to their survival. Representing the earliest group of extant jawed vertebrates, detailed study of elasmobranch sensory biology can provide much-needed information {{on the evolution of}} vertebrate sensory systems. Some sensory modalities have been studied in detail in several species, but few studies have examined and compared multiple sensory systems within a particular genus. By examining the morphology and physiology of the different sensory systems, correlations can be made within both an ecological and a phylogenetic context. The primary advantage of studying the sensory systems of closely related species is that any differences between them are more likely to reflect functional ecological adaptations rather than the effects of phylogenetic separation. Wobbegongs sharks (Orectolobidae) are a distinctive group of benthic sharks that are characterised by a highly patterned, dorso-ventrally compressed body. Wobbegongs are ambush predators that employ a unique ‘sit and wait’ strategy. Their morphologically distinct body shape, sedentary lifestyle and mode of predation suggest that wobbegong sharks may differ from other elasmobranchs in how they employ their different sensory systems. In this study, four wobbegong species that vary in life-history and/or habitat were examined: the Western wobbegong, Orectolobus hutchinsi, the <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. maculatus, the ornate wobbegong, O. ornatus and the dwarf <b>spotted</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. parvimaculatus. Vision and olfaction were assessed in all four species. Detailed assessment of electroreception and mechanoreception (lateral line) was conducted only for O. maculatus and O. ornatus. Morphology, physiology and molecular genetics were examined in the visual system, and morphological assessment was conducted for the olfactory, electroreceptive and mechanosensory lateral line systems. The retinae of all four wobbegong species are duplex; rod and cone photoreceptors can be distinguished easily on the basis of morphology. The wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) of the rod visual pigment is 496 nm in O. hutchinsi, 484 nm in O. maculatus, 498 nm in O. ornatus and 494 nm in O. parvimaculatus. Absorbance spectra of cone visual pigments were only obtained from O. maculatus and O. ornatus. Only one spectral type of cone was measured in each species, with max values at 553 nm and 560 nm, respectively. Partial sequences were obtained for the rh 1 opsin gene in all four species, and for the lws opsin gene in every species except O. parvimaculatus. The apparent presence of only one cone pigment raises the possibility that wobbegongs do not have colour vision. The topographic distribution of cells within the ganglion cell layer of Orectolobus hutchinsi show a weakly elongated central visual streak of increased cell density, mediating a higher spatial resolving power of 2. 06 cycles deg- 1 in the frontal visual field. Retinal topography of O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus are similar, with both possessing a dorsal horizontal streak facilitating increased spatial resolving power in the lower visual field. Orectolobus parvimaculatus also possesses an area of increased cell density in the naso-ventral region of the retina mediating acute vision in the upper caudal region of the visual field. Spatial resolving power reaches 3. 51 cycles deg- 1 and 3. 91 cycles deg- 1 in O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus, respectively. The topographical variation in retinal sampling indicates that different regions of the visual field are relatively more important and may reflect interspecific differences in behaviour and habitat. The mean number of lamellae in the olfactory rosette is 47. 0 for Orectolobus hutchinsi, 48. 7 for O. maculatus, 40. 7 for O. ornatus and 55. 7 for O. parvimaculatus. Olfactory sensory epithelial surface area is comparable in O. hutchinsi, O. maculatus and O. ornatus, while O. parvimaculatus has a significantly larger surface area, relative to body size, compared to the other three species. Olfaction appears to be relatively more important in O. parvimaculatus, especially during low light conditions, when vision is limited. The distribution of ampullary electroreceptive pores and mechanosensory lateral line pores (pored and non-pored canals) is almost entirely concentrated on the dorsal region of the head in both O. maculatus and O. ornatus. This suggests that both sensory systems are well-adapted and specialised to detect prey swimming overhead when the wobbegong is sitting motionless, thereby facilitating its unique, predatory, “lie-in-wait’ ambush strategy. Orectolobus hutchinsi and O. ornatus appear to be well-suited to both diurnal and nocturnal activities, whereas O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus are probably most active under low light conditions. Sensory system information inferred from this study correlates well with what is known of the diet and habitat of the four wobbegong species examined. Therefore, in the absence of other biological data, sensory neurobiological approaches can be used to predict such bio-ecological factors as predatory strategy, habitat preference, and behaviour. Electrophysiology and behavioural approaches will provide major advances in future studies in order to understand how each of the different senses is integrated at both peripheral and central levels and how such studies are vital to our understanding of evolutionary and ecological processes...|$|E
