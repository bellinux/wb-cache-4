50|$|The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) {{connects to}} the {{concentrator}} and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) which consists of Time Switches and a <b>Space</b> <b>Switch.</b> Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function. To allow access to a large range of outgoing routes, individual Time Switches are connected to each other by a <b>Space</b> <b>Switch.</b> The Time Slot inter-connections are held in Switch Maps which are updated by Software running on the Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Space</b> <b>Switch</b> (SSW) {{was under}} the control of the TPCs and APC, which {{accessed}} it via the Space Interface Controller (SIC). The SSW was divided into eight <b>Space</b> <b>Switch</b> Units (SSUs). Each SSU could switch all 772 channels between 32 TCUs. The first 32 TCUs connected in sequential order to the first two SSUs. Connecting the two SSUs in parallel this way provided the doubling of network capacity required in a CLOS network. When the system grew beyond 32 TCUs, an additional 6 SSUs were added. Two of these SSUs connected to TCU32-TCU63 in a manner directly analogous to the first two SSUs. Two connected the inputs from TCU0-TCU31 to the output of TCU32-TCU63, while the final two connected the outputs of TCU32-TCU63 to the input of TCU0-TCU31.|$|E

50|$|While {{selective}} flushing of the TLB is {{an option}} in software managed TLBs, the only option in some hardware TLBs (for example, the TLB in the Intel 80386) is the complete flushing of the TLB on an address <b>space</b> <b>switch.</b> Other hardware TLBs (for example, the TLB in the Intel 80486 and later x86 processors, and the TLB in ARM processors) allow the flushing of individual entries from the TLB indexed by virtual address.|$|E
50|$|On {{an address}} <b>space</b> <b>switch,</b> as occurs on a process switch {{but not on}} a thread switch, some TLB entries can become invalid, since the virtual-to-physical mapping is different. The {{simplest}} strategy {{to deal with this}} is to completely flush the TLB. This means that after a switch, the TLB is empty and any memory reference will be a miss, and it will be some time before things are running back at full speed. Newer CPUs use more effective strategies marking which process an entry is for. This means that if a second process runs for only a short time and jumps back to a first process, it may still have valid entries, saving the time to reload them.|$|E

5000|$|The precise {{meaning of}} [...] "context switch" [...] varies {{significantly}} in usage, most often to mean [...] "thread switch or process switch" [...] or [...] "process switch only", either {{of which may}} be referred to as a [...] "task switch". More finely, one can distinguish thread switch (switching between two threads within a given process), process switch (switching between two processes), mode switch (domain crossing: switching between user mode and kernel mode within a given thread), register switch, a stack frame switch, and address <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> (memory map switch: changing virtual memory to physical memory map). The computational cost of context switches varies significantly depending on what precisely it entails, from little more than a subroutine call for light-weight user processes, to very expensive, though typically much less than that of saving or restoring a process image.|$|E
50|$|Context {{switches}} {{are usually}} computationally intensive, {{and much of}} the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches. Switching from one process to another requires {{a certain amount of time}} for doing the administration saving and loading registers and memory maps, updating various tables and lists, etc. What is actually involved in a context switch varies between these senses and between processors and operating systems. For example, in the Linux kernel, context switching involves switching registers, stack pointer, and program counter, but is independent of address space switching, though in a process switch an address <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> also happens. Further still, analogous context switching happens between user threads, notably green threads, and is often very light-weight, saving and restoring minimal context. In extreme cases, such as switching between goroutines in Go, a context switch is equivalent to a coroutine yield, which is only marginally more expensive than a subroutine call.|$|E

40|$|Optical space {{switches}} {{are important}} subsystems in optical crossconnects (OXCs) and reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (R-OADMs), while also having applications in more long-term communications scenarios, such as optical packet switching. This chapter develops {{the theory of}} operation of planar optical space switches, and illustrates the interrelationship that exists between device characteristics, choice of architecture and <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> performance. The chapter also describes how switching elements {{from a variety of}} technologies can be combined into larger switch fabrics in different ways. Recent technological developments such as 3 D MEMS, covered elsewhere in this book, have radically changed the performance tradeoff landscape for very large, slow optical crossconnects typically having a reconfiguration time in the order of milliseconds. However, the original vision of interconnected waveguide-based switches still has relevance, especially for sub-nanosecond multiplexing and switching, including the emerging field of fast optical packet switching. Appropriate design can yield fabric performance significantly better than the individual switching elements can separately achieve. An optical <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> has multiple inputs and outputs, and can establish an optical connection between any idle input and any idle output, without involving conversion of the signal into electronic form. Similar systems, intended for purely electronic implementation, have been studied for over 50 years, and much of that work is amenable to optical implementation. Furthermore, the particular characteristics of optical switches (such as loss, crosstalk and problems of integration) have suggested a number of new architectures which are also discussed here. Besides describing the optical space switches and their implementation, the theory of their blocking performance is developed. (For further reading on theoretical results in switching, including additional topics such as Banyan networks and Baseline networks, see Reference [1]). Also, formulae are developed for optical loss, crosstalk and noise, which are important aspects of optical <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> performance.
