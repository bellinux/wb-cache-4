50|$|There {{are seven}} <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic Church, which {{according}} to Catholic theology were instituted by Jesus and entrusted to the Church. Sacraments are visible rites seen as signs and efficacious channels of the grace of God {{to all those who}} receive them with the proper disposition. The sevenfold list <b>of</b> <b>sacraments</b> is often organized into three groups: the <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> initiation (into the Church, the body of Christ), consisting of Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist; the <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> healing, consisting of Penance and Anointing of the Sick; and the <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> service: Holy Orders and Matrimony.|$|R
50|$|The Ecclesia Gnostica recognizes five initiatory sacraments as {{listed in}} the Gospel of Philip: Baptism, Chrism or Confirmation, Eucharist, Redemption (sacrament) and Bride-Chamber, with the {{additional}} two sustaining <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> Holy Orders and Anointing of the Sick. (The <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> Penance and Matrimony {{are considered to be}} secondary sacraments having been substituted for those of Redemption and Bride-Chamber.) The initiatory <b>sacraments</b> <b>of</b> Baptism and Chrism or Confirmation and the two sustaining sacraments are offered by the church.|$|R

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> {{initiation}} {{into the}} visible church, or body {{of people who}} publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> {{confirmation}} as {{required to complete}} the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism are largely rooted in his {{conflict}} with the Anabaptists, a group whose beliefs included the rejection of infant baptism and centered on the leadership of Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz. In October 1523, {{the controversy over the}} issue broke out during the second Zürich disputation and Zwingli vigorously defended the need for infant baptism and his belief that rebaptism was unnecessary. His major works on the subject include Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism (1525), A Reply to Hubmaier (1525), A Refutation (1527), and Questions Concerning the <b>Sacrament</b> <b>of</b> Baptism (1530).|$|E

5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E

5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> penance).|$|E

5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> Penance.|$|E
5|$|The liturgy of the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> the Eucharist, {{called the}} Mass in the West and Divine Liturgy or other {{names in the}} East, is the {{principal}} liturgy of the Catholic Church. This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself. The most widely used is the Roman Rite, usually in its ordinary form promulgated by Paul VI in 1969, but also in its authorised extraordinary form, the Tridentine Mass as in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal. Eastern Catholic Churches have their own rites. The liturgies of the Eucharist and the other sacraments vary from rite to rite based on differing theological emphasis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some Christians {{to serve}} the whole body as members of three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons). The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Church, the priesthood is {{generally}} restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men. Men who are already married may be ordained in certain Eastern Catholic churches in most countries, and the personal ordinariates and may become deacons even in the Western Church (see Clerical marriage). But after becoming a Catholic priest, a man may not marry (see Clerical celibacy) unless he is formally laicised.|$|E

5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|In 1552, Las Casas {{published}} A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. This book, {{written a}} decade earlier {{and sent to the}} attention of then-prince Philip II of Spain, contained accounts of the abuses committed by some Spaniards against Native Americans during the early stages of colonization. In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote a letter in which he described Las Casas as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how Las Casas had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who had walked many leagues to receive it, only on the grounds that he did not believe that the man had received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> baptism between the two orders, was intended to bring Las Casas in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.|$|E
5|$|In 1633, Charles {{appointed}} William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury. Together, {{they began}} a series of anti-Calvinist reforms that attempted to ensure religious uniformity by restricting non-conformist preachers, insisting that the liturgy be celebrated as prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer, organising the internal architecture of English churches so as to emphasise the <b>sacrament</b> <b>of</b> the altar, and re-issuing King James's Declaration of Sports, which permitted secular activities on the sabbath. The Feoffees for Impropriations, an organisation that bought benefices and advowsons so that Puritans could be appointed to them, was dissolved. To prosecute those who opposed his reforms, Laud used the two most powerful courts in the land, the Court of High Commission and the Court of Star Chamber. The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views, and became unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen. For example, in 1637 William Prynne, Henry Burton and John Bastwick were pilloried, whipped and mutilated by cropping and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti-episcopal pamphlets.|$|E
