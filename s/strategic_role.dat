5|$|Design {{management}} {{has taken a}} more <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> within business since 2000, and more academic programs for design management have been established. Design {{management has}} been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management {{was influenced by the}} following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the Roman army {{underwent}} a radical restructuring. In {{the rule of}} Diocletian (284–305), the traditional Principate formations of legiones, alae and cohortes {{appear to have been}} broken up into smaller units, many of which bore a variety of new names. Under Constantine I (r. 312–337) it appears that military units were classified into three grades based on <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> and to some extent quality: palatini, elite units normally part of the exercitus praesentales (imperial escort armies); comitatenses, higher-grade interception forces based in frontier provinces; and limitanei, lower-grade border troops.

5|$|No.82 Wing's Liberators played both a {{tactical}} and a <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> in the Borneo Campaign, {{beginning with the}} lead-up to Operation Oboe One, the invasion of Tarakan on 1May 1945. During that month a detachment relocated from Fenton to Morotai, attacking targets in Celebes and Balikpapan prior to Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan. In June, while the final Allied offensive of the Borneo Campaign got under way as Operation Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan, the remainder of No.82 Wing transferred from NWA to the command of the Australian First Tactical Air Force in Morotai. In {{the middle of the}} month the wing dropped 120 tons of bombs on Balikpapan's oil fields and surrounding areas, as well as coastal defence sites. During July it bombed targets at Celebes and Borneo, losing five Liberators for the month, including that of its new commanding officer, Group Captain Donald McLean. McLean died with most of his crew after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and ditching into the sea, a notoriously risky operation in the Liberator owing to the fuselage's tendency to break in two upon striking the water.|$|E

Drawing on an agency theory perspective, we examine the effects of agency problems in the headquarters-subsidiary relationships on the design of corporate governance in transnational corporations. We propose that corporate governance of foreign subsidiaries in a transnational corporation should be constructed in response to different levels of agency problems associated with varying <b>strategic</b> <b>roles</b> of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we postulate that differentiating governance structures for each foreign subsidiary is a key contingency requirement in order to achieve superior MNE performance as a whole.

25|$|Cities play {{a crucial}} <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> in warfare due to their economic, demographic, symbolic, and {{political}} centrality. For the same reasons, they are targets in asymmetric warfare. Many cities throughout history were founded under military auspices, a great many have incorporated fortifications, and military principles continue to influence urban design. Indeed, war may have served as the social rationale and economic basis for the very earliest cities.|$|E
25|$|The Maltese islands {{had been}} part of the Byzantine Empire since 535 AD, and archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that they probably had an important <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> within the empire. When the early Muslim conquests began in the 7th century, the Byzantines were threatened in the Mediterranean, so probably efforts were made to improve the defences of Malta. At this point, they might have built a retrenchment which reduced Melite to one third of its original size.|$|E
25|$|For example, if cannons were massed {{to cover}} a road and their {{position}} led to an engagement through cannon fire or a direct attack on the guns, then the position would {{be included in a}} Core Area boundary. If, however, the cannons were not engaged but their mere presence caused the opposing force to move on a different road, then their position would be considered as playing a <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> in the overall battle and would be included in the larger Battlefield Boundary.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of global organizations have adopted knowledge management practices and implemented worldwide knowledge management systems utilizing global communication networks and collaborative technology. The existing literature on knowledge management has focused on a common, firm-wide approach to knowledge sharing. Substantial differences exist, however, among the sub-units within many global organizations in terms of strategic, operational, and socio-cultural contexts. Such differences in the environments lead to internal differences in knowledge sharing practices. A field study at four offices of a large, global management consulting firm revealed that knowledge sharing practices at local offices were shaped by the unique <b>strategic</b> <b>roles</b> of the offices. The results suggest that global organizations must, contrary to the frequently-suggested uniform approach, understand the the <b>strategic</b> <b>roles</b> of the local units, and consider these in designing knowledge management support tools and practices...|$|R

The huge {{growth in the}} number of trains increased the potential for accidents. There were three head-on collisions and in 1942 six H class 4-6-0s were written off in accidents. The war effort both increased wear on equipment and reduced resources for maintenance. In November 1944 a downpour derailed an El Kantara – Haifa train, killing seven people and injuring 40.|$|E
25|$|In 533, Byzantine general Belisarius briefly {{landed at}} Malta while {{on his way}} from Sicily to North Africa, and by 535, the island was {{integrated}} into the Byzantine province of Sicily. During the Byzantine period, the main settlements remained the city of Melite on mainland Malta and the Citadel on Gozo, while Marsaxlokk, Marsaskala, Marsa and Xlendi {{are believed to have}} served as harbours. The relatively high quantity of Byzantine ceramics found in Malta suggests that the island might have had an important <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> within the empire from the 6th to 8th centuries.|$|E
25|$|It was decided, {{in light}} of the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, to equip the B-2 for conventional precision attacks {{as well as for the}} <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> of nuclear-strike. The B-2 features a sophisticated GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) that uses the aircraft's APQ-181 synthetic aperture radar to map out targets prior to deployment of GPS-aided bombs (GAMs), later superseded by the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). In the B-2's original configuration, up to 16 GAMs or JDAMs could be deployed; an upgrade program in 2004 raised the maximum carriable capacity to 80 JDAMs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Socio-Cognitive Systems (SCS) Section at Defence Research and Development Canada—Toronto (DRDC Toronto) has {{undertaken}} a Technology Investment Fund (TIF) Project entitled “A Conceptual Framework for Understanding Armed Non-state Actors (ANSAs) : <b>Strategic</b> <b>Roles</b> and Operational Dynamics. ” The {{aim of this}} Project is to advance our understanding of (a) the <b>strategic</b> <b>roles</b> of ANSAs {{in the context of}} violent intergroup conflict, and (b) the operational dynamics of ANSAs that facilitate the performance of these roles. To assist us in this endeavour, we have constructed a Concept Map (Cmap) of an Irregular Adversary (Insurgent) [IA(I) ], derived from Canadian Army doctrine on land and counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. This “first-cut ” IA(I) Cmap will serve as the point of departure for the development of an ANSA Cmap that will provide a means to guide and manage our efforts to explore the intentions and behaviours of ANSAs the Army is liable to encounter in future expeditionary operations. ...|$|R

He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a <b>strategic</b> <b>role</b> in Zahir's sheikhdom because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee.
