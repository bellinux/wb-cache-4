2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} local train had been shunted onto the Up (southbound) main line, two {{failures}} in correct signalling procedure occurred. Firstly, Kirkpatrick signal box was not sent the [...] "blocking back" [...] signal, which {{ought to have}} been sent immediately after the [...] "train out of section" [...] bell for the coal train (sent at 6.34 am) [...] This would have informed the Kirkpatrick signalman that the Up line was occupied, preventing him from offering any more trains to Quintinshill. Secondly, the signalman at Quintinshill should have placed a <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> collar over the relevant <b>signal</b> <b>lever,</b> which would have served as a physical reminder not to clear his own signals for the Up line.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the local}} train had been stopped {{for longer than}} three minutes, its fireman, George Hutchinson, was {{dispatched}} to the box. Contrary to the rule, Hutchinson merely signed the train register, using a pen which Tinsley (who was intent on filling in the missing entries in the train register) handed over his shoulder without looking up. [...] Hutchinson then returned to his engine without reminding the signaller of his train's position, or checking that the signalman had placed a collar on the <b>signal</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many {{railways}} {{had adopted}} reminder appliances, simple mechanical collars that the signalmen {{were required to}} place on <b>signal</b> <b>levers</b> to remind them that trains were stopped at signals, as a back-up to prevent them clearing the signals by mistake. The Midland Railway had not adopted these simple devices.|$|R

25|$|Minor changes {{occurred}} from 1986 to 89, {{including new}} paint colors, a center high mount stop lamp (CHMSL) midway through 1986 for North American models, a {{move away from}} the fade-prone brown carpet and new turn <b>signal</b> <b>levers.</b> Some 1988 models featured automatic seatbelts that extended from a large device between the front seats.|$|R
50|$|Also {{associated}} with signalling and safeworking in the Toowoomba yard is the A signal cabin, {{taken out of}} use mid-1993. This cabin possibly dates from the 1920s. The cabin interior is still intact, and includes <b>signal</b> <b>levers,</b> safeworking instruments and Toowoomba yard diagram. Associated with this structure are the now dismantled semaphore signals from the signal gantry.|$|R

50|$|The {{new engine}} has the extra {{refinement}} in running noticeable {{in the other}} new Austin units and shows much improvement on the former Twenty. The horn button and the <b>signalling</b> <b>lever</b> are {{on the top of}} the thin three-spoked steering wheel. The brake lever is inverted and under the dash. Accessible it does not interfere with entrance and has a thumb-plate trigger. The greatest comfortable speed was 70 miles per hour.|$|R
60|$|The {{stations}} are black-tiled, red-walled, and concrete-floored, {{and all the}} plant from <b>signal</b> <b>levers</b> to goods-truck is English. The official colour of the bridges is a yellow-brown most like unto a faded chrysanthemum. The uniform of the ticket-collectors is a peaked forage cap with gold lines, black frock-coat with brass buttons, very long in the skirt, trousers with black mohair braid, and buttoned kid boots. You cannot be rude {{to a man in}} such raiment.|$|R
50|$|The turn {{indicator}} stalk or turn <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> is the control lever which operates the turn signal or indicator {{lights on the}} front, sides and rear of the vehicle. It is usually operated by lifting or lowering the lever, the direction being commensurate with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in which the steering wheel {{is about to be}} turned.|$|E
5000|$|The lever {{frame is}} a series of levers {{contained}} and interlocked in a frame. At Ledbury this frame is designed for 41 levers numbered 1 to 41. However, in 1948 following a modification to the track design at Ledbury station an additional <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> was added onto the outside of the left (west) end of the frame and, being next to and below number 1 lever, was numbered [...] "0" [...] (zero) - See L0 [...] below.|$|E

50|$|The {{elevated}} {{signal cabin}} is a rectangular timber structure three storeys high. It has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting with a timber finial at each end. The cabin houses a 55-lever T-bar interlocking machine by MacKenzie and Holland. The top level houses the <b>signal</b> <b>levers</b> and good visibility is {{provided for the}} signalman by banks of windows to each side. The machinery to which the levers are connected is below and single windows light the two lower levels.|$|R
2500|$|Druitt {{concluded}} that even {{had all the}} trains been lit by electricity, a fire would still have occurred as the wagons of the goods train in the down loop caught fire. [...] He also {{concluded that}} had Quintinshill been equipped with track circuiting, then the accident would have been avoided as the electrical interlocking of the signals would have prevented Tinsley from pulling the relevant <b>signal</b> <b>levers,</b> but that with its simple layout and good visibility from the signal box Quintinshill was a low priority for track circuits to be installed.|$|R
50|$|It {{required}} that, if a {{train was}} brought to a stand at a signal, within three minutes in clear weather or immediately in rain, snow, or fog, {{the driver of the}} train must despatch his fireman, guard, or any shunter riding on the train, to the signal box to ensure that the signalman was aware of the presence of the train, and that all safeguards to protect it, such as slides or collars on the <b>signal</b> <b>levers,</b> were in place, the crewman then signing the train register to confirm this.|$|R
50|$|Assuming {{that the}} <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> had frozen (when {{in fact it}} was {{electrically}} locked by the stationary train), he authorised the driver to pass the signal at danger, and the train set off into the still-falling snow. Glancing again at his diagram, he saw that the lights towards Beaconsfield were not in fact lit, and realised that the empty train was still in the section near Seer Green. He quickly went to the window and tried to attract the driver's attention by shouting, but nobody heard him.|$|E
50|$|The new Cutlass Salon was {{an upscale}} Euro-style luxury/sports sedan similar in concept to the Pontiac Grand Am of the era. The Salon, which {{included}} {{items such as}} uprated suspension, radial tires, reclining bucket seats and hand-operated headlamp dimmer switch (integral to the turn <b>signal</b> <b>lever)</b> {{was based on the}} Cutlass Supreme series, first as a 4-door Colonnade sedan, joined by a 2-door Colonnade hardtop coupe in 1974. The Cutlass Salon was the first Oldsmobile with the international-flags emblem, later carried on the Cutlass Ciera. Front disc brakes were standard.|$|E
5000|$|... 1985 - New black {{gearshift}} knob introduced (1982 to 1984 {{models have}} chromed knobs). Turn <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> is now also black (1984 and below models were interior color keyed) {{with the exception}} of models with two-tone paint. A revised 5.2L V-8 now with a roller camshaft, swirl-port heads, and carburetor change from a Carter 2bbl to a Holley 2bbl increased horsepower from 130 to 140 and torque was also increased to 265 lb-ft (from 230). The interiors were given a make-over with plusher leather seats, headliners, and upgraded door panels featuring larger armrests with the power window switch's located on them, as opposed to being on the door panels separately.|$|E
50|$|A closed {{signal box}} {{is located on}} Platform 2. All the signals and the {{crossover}} points and the <b>signal</b> control <b>levers</b> inside the <b>signal</b> box were removed in March 2011.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the two signalling errors, another important precaution designed specifically to prevent such errors also failed to be implemented on the day - Rule 55. Under this rule, if any train was stopped on the main line for longer than three minutes, the driver must send one of the crew to the signal box to remind the signaller {{of the presence of}} the train, and to ensure that all safeguards to protect the train (such as slides or collars on the <b>signal</b> <b>levers)</b> were in place, with the crewman then obliged to sign the train register to confirm this.|$|R
2500|$|A new {{terminal}} station was opened in 1914 {{to deal with}} excursion traffic, being known as Locking Road station, while the main station was known as Weston-super-Mare General. Locking Road closed on 6 September 1964. [...] The area once used by the 1866 and Locking Road stations, along with the sidings, has now {{been replaced by a}} Tesco store and a large car and coach park. [...] The only surviving railway building is the old signal box; originally controlling the 1866 station, it shows signs of a later extension to allow extra <b>signal</b> <b>levers</b> for the larger station.|$|R
5000|$|The FD mount {{was based}} upon and {{replaced}} Canon's earlier FL mount (which in turn had replaced the R mount); FD-mount cameras can use FL lenses in stop-down metering mode. Though never officially explained by Canon, others have attempted to assign a meaning to the [...] "FD" [...] designation. One such attempt states that the [...] "FD" [...] notation stands for [...] "Focal-plane shutter with Dual linkage for diaphragm control"; in actuality, there were two linkages and two signals: the automatic aperture lever, aperture <b>signal</b> <b>lever,</b> full aperture signal pin, and automatic exposure lock pin. This is twice the previous lens series, which used the [...] "FL" [...] designation, said to mean [...] "Focal-plane shutter, Linked mount." ...|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{along the}} line was {{regulated}} by block working. Abbots Ripton and Holme had signal boxes and between them were two intermediate boxes. All controlled 'home' signals near the box and 'distant' signals {{about half a mile}} (c 800 m) before the home signals. The line was thus divided into three blocks, each roughly 2 miles (c 3.1 km) long; entry to each block was controlled by the signal box {{at the start of the}} block. Shunting into the siding at Abbots Ripton took place in a fourth block. The 'home' signals at Abbots Ripton were interlocked with the siding points and so that whenever the points were open to the main line the Abbots Ripton home <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> had to be at 'danger'.|$|E
5000|$|The Times {{correspondent}} {{thought the}} car travelled rapidly and smoothly {{and found the}} lines of the body pleasing. Front seat access, he said, is easy but the rear seat though having good leg and elbow room and just enough head clearance is as difficult as most sports models to climb into. The car seemed [...] "well-found" [...] - two wipers with two motors, a fitted tool tray below the instrument panel, a windscreen with a handle and concealed chain for security. The <b>signal</b> <b>lever</b> has an automatic return. Driving position, location and action of all controls were all fine. There is a harmonic stabiliser. Though a sports car the engine is not fussy or hesitant at low speeds. The best speed on the open road was about 80 miles an hour.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two signalling errors, another important precaution designed specifically to prevent such errors also failed to be implemented on the day - Rule 55. Under this rule, if any train was stopped on the main line for longer than three minutes, the driver must send one of the crew to the signal box to remind the signaller {{of the presence of}} the train, and to ensure that all safeguards to protect the train (such as slides or collars on the <b>signal</b> <b>levers)</b> were in place, with the crewman then obliged to sign the train register to confirm this.|$|R
50|$|Three of {{the unusual}} six-wheeled coaches survive {{on the island}} with one {{accompanying}} Thornhill in private ownership and two on the railway: one without its running gear and another in private ownership having spent 1976-1998 in the Port Erin Railway Museum. The unique Foxdale Coach survives in regular traffic on the south line, and a goods van (Gr. 12) was rebuilt in 1997 and remains in use on the line. As part of the annual transport festival a genuine Manx Northern Train has operated in recent times. Many smaller items survive in use on the railway today, such as <b>signal</b> <b>levers</b> and various point levers inherited in 1905 and transferred around the system.|$|R
