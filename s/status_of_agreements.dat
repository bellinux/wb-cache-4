50|$|A <b>status</b> <b>of</b> forces <b>{{agreement}}</b> (SOFA) is {{an agreement}} between a host country and a foreign nation stationing military forces in that country.

30|$|In addition, it is {{important}} to note at this juncture the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> peace <b>agreements.</b> Prior to 2005, peace agreements were understood as being legally binding documents, serving as a kind of contract between the signatory parties (Kastner 2015, 13). Since the Armed Activities Case before the ICJ (International Court of Justice 2005), however, the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> peace <b>agreements</b> has been in doubt. In this case, the Court effectively ‘downgraded’ the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> peace <b>agreements</b> from legally binding instruments to modus operandi (para 99). The reasoning for this seems to have been to prevent states from relying on peace agreements to escape international responsibility for wrongful acts (an argument on which Uganda was relying in the case) (Lang 2008, 109). Andrea Lang has argued that the Court’s judgement was also based on a reluctance to engage with the issue <b>of</b> the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> NSAGs under international law (Lang 2008, 125), which is an issue that would be unavoidable, should agreements signed by NSAGs constitute a legally binding document. However, the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the kinds <b>of</b> ceasefire <b>agreements</b> between states and NSAGs focused on in the current paper remains somewhat anomalous (see Kastner 2015, 13 – 14). Even though many <b>of</b> these <b>agreements</b> do not fall within the realm of public international law, it is still possible for a NSAG to conclude a legally binding agreement with states (for example by “including a third state party as a guarantor or using a Security Council Resolution”: Public International Law and Policy Group 2013, 7). The legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>agreements</b> proposed will therefore depend upon the situations of their adoption.|$|R
