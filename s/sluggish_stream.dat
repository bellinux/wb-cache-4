2500|$|Before {{the flood}} control {{measures}} of the 20th century, the location of human settlements in the San Fernando Valley was constrained by two forces: the necessity of avoiding winter floods and need for year-round water sources to sustain communities through the dry summer and fall months. [...] In winter, torrential downpours over the western-draining watershed of the San Gabriel Mountains entered the northeast Valley through Big Tujunga Canyon, Little Tujunga Canyon, and Pacoima Canyon. [...] These waters spread over the Valley floor {{in a series of}} braided washes that was seven miles wide as late as the 1890s, periodically cutting new channels and reusing old ones, before sinking into the gravelly subterranean reservoir below the eastern Valley and continuing their southward journey underground. [...] Only when the waters encountered the rocky roots of the Santa Monica Mountains were they pushed to the surface where they fed a series of tule marshes, sloughs, and the <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> that is now the Los Angeles River.|$|E

60|$|We {{descended to}} the Bulkley through clouds of {{mosquitoes}} and endless sloughs of mud. The river {{was out of}} its banks, and its quicksand flats were exceedingly dangerous to our pack animals, although the river itself at this point was a small and <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

60|$|There {{was true}} heroism {{in the spirit}} in which this young girl braced herself to uncomplaining {{acceptance}} of desertion in this unwholesome swamp, with her two little ailing sisters, beside the <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream,</b> amid the skeleton trees--heroism the greater {{because there was no}} enthusiastic patriotism to uphold her--it was only the land of her captivity, whence she looked towards home like Judah to Jerusalem.|$|E
60|$|After half an hour's {{walking through}} a swampy soil {{they arrived at the}} edge of a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> of water. Here tied to a bush was a boat {{constructed}} of basket work covered with hide. In it lay two long poles. The men took their places in the coracle, pushed out into the stream, and using their poles vigorously were soon lost to sight among the thick grove of rush and bushes. Aska and Beric returned to the hamlet.|$|E

60|$|It was but two evenings {{after this}} that, {{as the two}} midshipmen were leaning against the bulwarks, {{watching}} {{the reflection of the}} stars in the <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream,</b> a native sampan stole silently out from the shadow of the shore and dropped down alongside the Serpent. So noiseless was the movement that the two men on the lookout in the bow did not notice it, and the midshipmen thought it was a shadow of some dark object floating down stream, when it came alongside and a man stood up.|$|E
60|$|Twenty {{miles up}} the Seine a {{suitable}} spot was found, and {{the crew of the}} Dragon, with the hundred men whom the Count Eudes had lent for the purpose, at once set about their work. They had but little trouble, for a spot was chosen where a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream,</b> some fifteen feet wide, drained the water from a wide-spreading swamp into the river. The channel needed widening but a little to allow of the Dragon entering, and the water was quite deep enough to permit her being taken some three hundred yards back from the river.|$|E
6000|$|That {{night they}} dropped anchor {{at the mouth}} of a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> whose warm waters swarmed with {{millions}} of tiny tadpolelike organisms--minute human spawn starting on their precarious journey from some inland pool toward [...] "the beginning"--a journey which one in millions, perhaps, might survive to complete. Already almost at the inception of life they were being greeted by thousands of voracious mouths as fish and reptiles of many kinds fought to devour them, the while other and larger creatures pursued the devourers, to be, in turn, preyed upon by some other of the countless forms that inhabit the deeps of Caprona's frightful sea.|$|E

60|$|So Aylward, {{having given}} {{instructions}} to the bearer of his feather-bed, rode away in spite of shrill protests from his French companions, who speedily consoled themselves with those of his comrades {{who seemed to have}} most to give. Nigel's party was soon clear of the column of archers and riding hard {{in the direction of the}} Prince's army. They passed by a narrow and winding track, through the great wood of Nouaille, and found before them a marshy valley down which ran a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream.</b> Along its farther bank hundreds of horses were being watered, and beyond was a dense block of wagons. Through these the comrades passed, and then topped a small mound from which the whole strange scene lay spread before them.|$|E
6000|$|His Two grand Feats that {{dwell in}} the Prussian memory are perhaps {{none of his}} greatest, but were of a kind to strike the imagination. They both relate to what was the central problem of his life,--the {{recovery}} of Pommern from the Swedes. Exploit First is the famed [...] "Battle of FEHRBELLIN (Ferry of BellEEN)," [...] fought on the 18th June, 1675. Fehrbellin is an inconsiderable Town still standing in those peaty regions, some five-and-thirty miles northwest of Berlin; and had for ages plied its poor Ferry over the oily-looking, brown, <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> called Rhin, or Rhein in those parts, without the least notice from mankind, till this fell out. It {{is a place of}} pilgrimage to patriotic Prussians, ever since Friedrich Wilhelm's exploit there. The matter went thus:-- ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{not likely}} to forget; but you cannot dam up life like a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream.</b> It will break out and flow over a man's troubles, it will close upon a sorrow like the sea upon a dead body, {{no matter how much}} love has gone to the bottom. And the world is not bad. People had been very kind to him; {{especially}} Mrs. Gardner, the wife of the senior partner in Gardner, Patteson, & Co., the owners of the Condor. It was she who volunteered to look after the little one, and in due course took her to England (something of a journey in those days, even by the overland mail route) with her own girls to finish her education. It was ten years before he saw her again.|$|E
50|$|The white-tufted grebe (Rollandia rolland), {{also known}} as Rolland's grebe, is a species of grebe in the family Podicipedidae. Found in the {{southern}} half of South America, its natural habitat is freshwater lakes, ponds and <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams.</b>|$|R

40|$|Among the {{measures}} used {{in attempts to}} control the snail host of S. japonicum in Leyte Province, Philippines, where the terrain is unsuited to the application of molluscicides, have been removal of vegetation in and around infested streams, drainage of water-logged areas, filling low-lying areas with earth or flooding them, and digging fishponds in <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams.</b> Each of these measures is described in detail...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; we tow a rowboat and a store boat up, {{behind this}} craft, {{as far as}} she can go; that is, as long as she has wind enough to make against the <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream.</b> When she can go no further, I take to the rowboat. It has eight rowers, carries a gun--it is a twelve-pounder howitzer--that I have had cut short, so that it is only about a foot long. Of course it won't carry far, but that is not necessary. Its charge is a pound of powder and a ten-pound bag of bullets and, at a couple of hundred yards, the balls scatter enough to sweep two or three canoes coming abreast and, as we can charge and fire the little thing three times in a minute, it is all that we require, for {{practical}} purposes.|$|E
6000|$|All {{immediately}} {{closed with}} this proposal, and some {{went to work}} with swords and knives to cut down the alder and hawthorn bushes which grew {{by the side of}} the <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream,</b> many of which were sufficiently decayed and dried for their purpose, while others began to collect them in a large stack, properly disposed for burning, as close to the iron-grate as they could be piled. Fire was speedily obtained from one of their guns, and Hobbie was already advancing to the pile with a kindled brand, when the surly face of the robber, and the muzzle of a musquetoon, were partially shown at a shot-hole which flanked the entrance. [...] "Mony thanks to ye," [...] he said, scoffingly, [...] "for collecting sae muckle winter eilding for us; but if ye step a foot nearer it wi' that lunt, it's be the dearest step ye ever made in your days." ...|$|E
60|$|On one occasion, having parted {{from his}} mate {{for a day}} or two, wishing to try his luck alone, our young peddler found himself, late in the afternoon, {{approaching}} the Dismal Swamp. A tempest arose, adding to the loneliness and terror of the hour. The cypresses uprooted by the blast fell now and then across the road, endangering the poor boy's head. A <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> rolled through tangled junipers and beds of reeds, and the fen on either side was full of ugly creatures, lizards, snakes, and toads; while owls, scared by the storm, flew wildly about and hooted dismally. Just {{at the height of the}} tumult, Eli saw three men coming toward him, and gladly hastened to meet them, hoping to have their company or learn of them where he could find a shelter. But their bad faces daunted him, and he would have hurried by without speaking if they had not stopped him, roughly demanding his name and business.|$|E
50|$|The region also shares several {{plant species}} with Sri Lanka. The higher {{altitude}} forests were, if at all, sparsely populated with tribal people. Rice cultivation in the fertile valley proceeded gardens of early commercial crops like areca nut and pepper. The original vegetation of the ill-drained valley bottoms with <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams</b> in elevations below 100m would be often a special formation, the Myristica swamp.|$|R
50|$|The Italian {{pool frog}} {{is native to}} the {{mainland}} of Italy, south of Rimini and Genoa, and to the islands of Sicily, Elba and Corsica. It has been introduced into Sardinia. Its typical habitat is <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams</b> and rivers, lakes and swamps and their environs, and it is present at altitudes of 1800 m or more. It has been introduced into the United Kingdom but whether it persists there is unclear.|$|R
5|$|This is {{the most}} aquatic species of the genus Agkistrodon, and is usually {{associated}} with bodies of water, such as creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. The U.S. Navy (1991) describes it as inhabiting swamps, shallow lakes, and <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams,</b> but it is usually not found in swift, deep, cool water. Behler and King (1979) list its habitats as including lowland swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation ditches, canals, rice fields, and small, clear, rocky, mountain streams.|$|R
60|$|Vane rose {{early the}} next morning, {{as he had been}} {{accustomed}} to do, and taking a towel he made his way across dewy meadows and between tall hedgerows to the tarn. Stripping where the rabbit-cropped sward met the mossy boulders, he swam out, joyously breasting the little ripples which splashed and sparkled beneath the breeze that had got up with the sun. Coming back, where the water lay in shadow beneath a larchwood which as yet had not wholly lost its vivid vernal green, he disturbed the paddling moor-hens and put up a mallard from a clump of swaying reeds. Then he dressed and turned homeward, glowing, beside a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> which wound through a waste of heather where the curlew were whistling eerily. He had no cares to trouble him, and it was delightful to feel that {{he had nothing to do}} except to enjoy himself in what he considered the fairest country in the world, at least in summertime.|$|E
60|$|He {{learned that}} all but those who were cos-ata-lu came up cor-sva-jo, or from the beginning. The egg from which they first {{developed}} into tadpole form was deposited, with millions of others, {{in one of the}} warm pools and with it a poisonous serum that the carnivora instinctively shunned. Down the warm stream from the pool floated the countless billions of eggs and tadpoles, developing as they drifted slowly toward the sea. Some became tadpoles in the pool, some in the <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> and some not until they reached the great inland sea. In the next stage they became fishes or reptiles, An-Tak was not positive which, and in this form, always developing, they swam far to the south, where, amid the rank and teeming jungles, some of them evolved into amphibians. Always there were those whose development stopped at the first stage, others whose development ceased when they became reptiles, while by far the greater proportion formed the food supply of the ravenous creatures of the deep.|$|E
60|$|The country round {{was most}} monotonous. As {{far as the}} eye could see it was nothing but a {{succession}} of bare, sandy flats, and, beyond these, hills sprinkled with bush and occasional clumps of aloes and elephant trees. Upon the following morning the troop marched, followed by a waggon containing their baggage and provisions, drawn by ten oxen. A little naked boy marched at the head of the oxen as their guide, and they were driven by a Hottentot, armed with a tremendous whip of immense length, made of plaited hide fastened to the top of a bamboo pole. After a fourteen miles' march the troop reached the Zwart Kop river, and, crossing the ford, encamped among the scattered mimosas and numerous wait-a-bit thorns. The horses were then knee-haltered, and they and the oxen were turned out to feed till night. The next day's march was a very long one, and for the most part across a sandy desert, to the Sunday River, a <b>sluggish</b> <b>stream</b> in which, as soon as the tents were pitched, the whole party enjoyed a bath.|$|E
60|$|Here {{we caught}} our {{first glimpse of}} the James River valley, which seemed to us at the moment as illimitable as the ocean and as level as a floor, and then {{pitching}} and tossing over the rough track, with our cars leaping and twisting like a herd of frightened buffaloes, we charged down the western slope, down into a level land of ripened grass, where blackbirds chattered in the willows, and prairie chickens called from the tall rushes which grew beside the <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The species prefers densely vegetated, shallow {{waters in}} lakes, ponds, and <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams.</b> Its diet can include insects, aquatic invertebrates, and small fish. Avoiding strong currents, longear sunfish are usually present in small to {{moderate}} flowing streams, rivers, and reservoirs. The genus Lepomis has a well-characterized mating behavior where parental care {{is done by}} the male. He makes and defends the nest. Males fan the eggs to remove silt and other debris until the larvae hatch. Some longear females produce 4,000 eggs. They spawn in groups but do not form large colonies.|$|R
60|$|The solid land {{which the}} cow-herd called his farm {{was only about}} two acres in extent. All around it was a black morass, of great extent, wooded with alders, among which green sedges grew, and <b>sluggish</b> <b>streams</b> meandered, and mossy tracts of verdure spread treacherously over deep bogs and sloughs. In the driest season of the summer the goats and the sheep {{penetrated}} into these recesses, but, excepting in the devious and tortuous path by which the cow-herd found {{his way to his}} island, it was almost impassable for man.|$|R
