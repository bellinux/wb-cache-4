The same effect can be assumed for a change of the interest rate on stock of currently 8 % in the model. Any rise of interests would increase the capital costs and render a centralized distribution network more competitive compared to a decentralized.

We gathered data through a mail survey of New Zealand auditors in order to ascertain their opinion on the effectiveness of these audit procedures. The results suggest that relatively few (less than half) of the 56 standard audit procedures are perceived by our surveyed auditors as being more effective in detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> and <b>warehousing</b> cycle. Further, more than half of the 56 audit procedures are perceived by respondents as moderately effective in detecting fraud. Fifteen audit procedures are perceived as being less effective in detecting fraud the stock and warehousing audit cycle. A univariate analysis reveals no significant perpetual differences among our respondents on the basis of the location of their employers in New Zealand, and the type of audit firm employing them. We employed logit regression analysis to test a model to predict the likelihood of detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> and <b>warehousing</b> cycle, given certain auditor and audit firm specific factors. The results of the regression analysis suggest that size of audit firm (measured by the number of employees), auditor’s position tenure, and auditor’s years of experience are statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> and <b>warehousing</b> cycle <b>in</b> New Zealand.

On {{the basis of the}} analysis of the known mathematical methods applied in transport logistics, the authors drew a conclusion that the route of freight delivery is estimated according to the distance passed by the vehicle. However the time of freight delivery depends not only on distance, but also on a set of other factors, such as vehicle type, road capacity, intensity of transport stream, weather conditions, season and others. For taking note of additional factors when optimizing a freight delivery route the method of analogy and similarity is used by the authors. The transportation parameters were estimated by analogy with an electric chain. For this purpose the authors entered the new concepts “fictitious distance” and “conductivity of the road”. The mathematical model allowing optimizing the organization of freight delivery taking into account not only distances, but also the probable speed of the vehicle movement depending on the road quality, intensity of transport stream and weather conditions is developed. Further development of the system of decision-making support while choosing the optimum route of cargo delivery is planned...|$|R

40|$|As {{according}} to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, automobile manufacturers are required to provide spare parts for any model they sell, for a minimum span of 10 years. In the automobile/ aviation industry, the demand for replacement parts is generally met using conventional manufacturing processes such as injection molding (IM) and <b>stocking</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>warehouses.</b> IM proves economical when the demand is high and continuous. The demand for replacement parts is generally low and intermittent and <b>stocking</b> parts <b>in</b> inventory to meet future demands proves expensive {{and the possibility of}} stock-outs or parts going obsolete is high. Rapid Manufacturing (RM) is an additive manufacturing technique that prints parts without the need of tools, unlike conventional manufacturing processes. Thus, it saves on the tooling cost, time to make the mold, and the need to <b>stock</b> various parts <b>in</b> order to meet the intermittent demand. There is a need for an alternative approach to meet low volume intermittent demands, and the Just in Time (JIT) production strategy incorporating RM serves as an option. In JIT, production starts when a demand is received from the customer. It also gives the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) an option to make parts on the demand site, eliminating transportation and inventory holding costs. The objective of this thesis is to develop a decision making framework to determine the economical supply chain strategy to meet the demand for replacement parts. The supply chain strategies considered are in-house manufacturing by the RM process called Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) in a JIT production environment, and <b>stocking</b> parts <b>in</b> centralized <b>warehouses</b> manufactured by IM to meet future demands. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model has been formulated to determine the unit cost of parts for the supply chain strategies under consideration. The results from the model are used to determine the significant part parameters affecting the cost of manufacturing by SLS using Regression Analysis. Based on the results, material volume and height of the part proved to be significant factors and a regression equation has been derived and validated for estimating the unit supply chain cost of parts manufactured by SLS...|$|R
