40|$|M. Cur. It is {{explicit}} {{that the}} change in the South African government since 1994 accompanied by the transformation of nursing services with its new policies and practices is inevitable, and poses challenges for the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in Gauteng hospitals. The transformation of nursing services can be a difficult process creating a period of fear, uncertainty, stress and role ambiguity for the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers.</b> The transformation has been so extensive that the nursing <b>service</b> <b>manager's</b> role responsibilities have changed {{to such an extent that}} they are now required to manage grossly reduced levels of resources, multicultural societies with different values, beliefs and attitudes and increased numbers of patients, resulting in overcrowded hospitals. The transformation of nursing services demands the demonstration of appropriate nursing service management. The abilities of the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> are critical to the effectiveness of the future. Most nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> are unprepared for their new roles and the present concern is for the quality of the management of the transformation process. No written standards for transformation management in a nursing service are available in Gauteng public hospitals. Consequently, nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> find themselves making major decisions about nursing service transformation with little information about the effectiveness of alternative approaches. The experiences and perceptions of the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> regarding transformation of nursing services in selected Gauteng hospitals are also not known. Understanding the nursing service managers' experiences and perceptions will provide a basis for the formulation of standards for transformation management in a nursing service...|$|R

25|$|The Outlaws, {{who have}} around 150 British members across 14 {{chapters}} mainly {{based in the}} West Midlands, have since become the Hells Angels' main rivals in the UK since opening chapters {{in the country in}} 2000. Hells Angels member Gerry Tobin was shot dead as he rode his motorcycle home to London, where he worked as a Harley-Davidson <b>service</b> <b>manager,</b> from the Bulldog Bash in Warwickshire on August 12, 2007. Two bullets were fired from a Rover car which drove up alongside him as he sped down the M40 motorway, one hitting him in the head. Seven members of the Outlaws, the entire South Warwickshire chapter, were convicted over his murder and sentenced to a total of 191 years in prison. It is believed that Tobin was killed {{due to the fact that}} the Hells Angels-run Bulldog Bash is held in Outlaws territory, and that the killing may have been sanctioned by Outlaws leadership in the United States.|$|E

40|$|M. Cur. The {{establishment}} of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in 1994 was coupled with problems for all the members that were integrated into the new defence force. The perception exists {{that members of the}} former non-statutory forces are receiving preferential treatment {{to the members of the}} old South African Defence Force. These perceptions create a spirit of negativity amongst members of the former statutory forces. On the other hand members of the former non-statutory forces are frustrated because they feel that top management in the SANDF is resistant to change. The South African Medical Health Service (SAMHS) is an integral part of the SANDF, and therefore the changes that took place in the last five years have had a direct effect on the members of the service, inter alia, the nursing staff It seems as though nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in the South African Military Health Service are suffering from a lack of motivation. At the moment they are also unable to motivate their subordinates. The following research questions were posed: What are the perceptions of the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in the SAMHS with regard to their own level of motivation? What problems do the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in the SAMHS encounter with regard to the motivation of their subordinates? Which factors motivate nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in their work setup (SAMHS and SANDF) ? Which factors demotivate nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in their work setup (SAMHS and SANDF) ? Which strategy must be developed to enhance the motivation of the nursing <b>service</b> <b>managers</b> in the SAMHS...|$|R
