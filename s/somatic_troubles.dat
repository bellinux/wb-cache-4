40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{describe}} how the employees of OMFS clinics in Sweden perceive their health, to compare with female unpromoted general practice dentists and other human service groups and to explore the dimensionality of the health measure. Data were collected by way of a questionnaire with 67 questions, related to quality management at the clinic, working situation, questions about the content of “good work”, the connection between physical environment and health, emphasis on physical environment. 22 clinics with 297 employees responded, 65 % of the clinics and 86 % of the employees. The results showed that employees of OMFS clinics in Sweden perceived their health as rather problematic. In comparison, the present study group placed itself between general practice dentists and other human service groups as to their health. Three factors explained {{more than half of the}} variance of symptoms. They were interpreted as (1) psychosomatic troubles, (2) <b>somatic</b> <b>troubles,</b> and (3) muscle and joint troubles. These factors were almost the same as previously reported, confirming the basic dimensionality of the question battery. This study has shown that OMFS employees are feeling unhealthy, but no worse than other high-risk-groups in human service working situation and better than female general practice dentists. The women among OMFS employees felt worse than the men. Three factors of symptoms could be established, i. e. psychosomatic troubles, <b>somatic</b> <b>troubles,</b> and muscle and joint troubles...|$|E
40|$|Dhat {{syndrome}} (“semen loss”-related psychological distress) is a culture-bound syndrome seen in {{the natives}} of Indian subcontinent, but it is prevalent in other cultures also. Its diagnosis and management issues {{need to be taught}} to postgraduates in their teaching program. This syndrome involves vague and multiple somatic and psychological complaints such as fatigue, listlessness, loss of appetite, lack of physical strength, poor concentration, forgetfulness and other vague <b>somatic</b> <b>troubles.</b> These symptoms are usually associated with an anxious and dysphoric mood state. These patients may also present with or without psychosexual dysfunction. The management of Dhat syndrome needs serious attention. The understanding of this condition by Modern Medicine fails to impress most of the patients, and the explanations and reassurances offered prove to be not of much use...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} is a psychoanalytic reading of the {{clinical}} material arising from ongoing developmental research into international adoption {{within the framework of}} the Attachment Adoption Research Network (AAARN). The primary objective of the study is to verify whether the severity of deprivation experienced preadoption is a risk factor for narcissistic identity pathologies in adolescence with regard to international adoption. A grounded theory approach is used to identify a set of qualitative variables, which are later quantitatively assessed. The findings are discussed in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results and suggest the greater presence of chronic <b>somatic</b> <b>troubles</b> and observable signs of primary trauma in the adoption population compared to the control group. Future areas for research are suggested in the conclusion...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{prevalence}} rates and predictors of somatic symptoms among {{child and adolescent}} survivors with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an earthquake. A total of 3053 students from 21 primary and secondary schools in Baoxing County were administered the Patient Health Questionnaire- 13 (PHQ- 13), a short version of PHQ- 15 without the two items about sexuality and menstruation, the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES), and the self-made Earthquake-Related Experience Questionnaire 3 months after the Lushan earthquake. Among child and adolescent survivors, the prevalence rates of all somatic symptoms {{were higher in the}} probable PTSD group compared with the controls. The most frequent <b>somatic</b> symptoms were <b>trouble</b> sleeping (83. 2 %), feeling tired or having low energy (74. 4 %), stomach pain (63. 2 %), dizziness (58. 1 %), and headache (57. 7 %) in the probable PTSD group. Older age, having lost family members, having witnessed someone get seriously injured, and having witnessed someone get buried were predictors for somatic symptoms among child and adolescent survivors with probable PTSD. Somatic symptoms among child and adolescent earthquake survivors with probable PTSD in schools were common, and predictors of these somatic symptoms were identified. These findings may help those providing psychological health programs to find the child and adolescent students with probable PTSD who are at high risk of somatic symptoms in schools after an earthquake in China...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the Study: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the symptom profile, including somatic symptoms among elderly patients with first episode depression using the Geriatric depression scale (GDS- 30) and Patient Health Questionnaire- 15 (PHQ- 15) items version scale. Additional aims were {{to carry out the}} factor analysis of symptoms reported on GDS- 30 and PHQ- 15 among elderly. Methodology: Seventy-nine elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years) were evaluated on GDS- 30 item Hindi version and Hindi version of the PHQ- 15. Results: As per GDS- 30, the most common symptom noted among elderly was “dropped many of your activities and interests” (91. 1 %), mind not as clear as it used (88. 6 %), feeling that life is empty (86. 1 %), bothered by thoughts you cannot get out of your head (86. 1 %) and hard to get started on new projects (86. 1 %), prefer to avoid social gatherings (86. 1 %). All patients reported at least one somatic complaint as per PHQ- 15. The most common <b>somatic</b> symptoms were <b>trouble</b> sleeping (97. 5 %), feeling tired or having little energy (96. 2 %), feeling that the heart is racing (52. 9 %), constipation, loose bowels, or diarrhea (49. 6 %), shortness of breath (46. 8 %), nausea, gas or indigestion (45. 6 %), pain in the arms, legs, or joints (43. 3 %), and back pain (41. 8 %). The prevalence of somatic symptoms was not influenced to a large extent by the demographic variables, clinical variables and presence or absence of physical comorbidity. However, the severity of somatic symptoms correlated positively with GDS- 30 score. Factor analysis of Hindi version of GDS- 30 yielded a four-factor solution, which was similar to many studies across the world. The addition of items of PHQ- 15 items of factor analysis still yielded a four-factor solution. Factor 1 of combined GDS- 30 and PHQ- 15 items included items only from GDS- 30 and Factor 3 and 4 included items only from PHQ- 15. There was some overlap of items on Factor 2. Conclusion: The present study suggests that GDS- 30 does not tap all the symptoms of depression among elderly in the Indian context. Further, the present study shows that GDS- 30 is not a one-dimensional scale. Accordingly, the symptom evaluation among elderly depressed patient should go beyond GDS- 30...|$|R
