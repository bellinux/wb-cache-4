40|$|Abstract. We {{prove that}} any sound logic for {{arithmetic}} must be incomplete. From this {{it follows that}} Hoare logic is incomplete too. We also <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the validity problem and the provability problem for first-order predicate logic are undecidable problems. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> any sound logic for second-order predicate logic must be incomplete. The crucial step in proving these results is establishing the expressive power of the logics. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> propositional logic can express exactly the recursive languages. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> first-order predicate logic can express exactly the recursively enumerable languages, and we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the logic for arithmetic and second-order predicate logic can express languages which are not recursively enumerable. ...|$|R

5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and-run driver.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

3000|$|... (1) In fact, if (1) {{does not}} hold, i.e., to given a number ϵ_ 0 > 0, {{there exists a}} {{sequence}} of positive numbers {δ_n} convergent to 0 such that y_n∈ F_s(E^n) and y_n∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ_ 0 (0)] for all E^n∈E such that ρ_s^u(E^n,E)<δ_n. Since X is compact, without loss of generality, we may assume that y_n→ y. Hence, y_n∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ _ 0 (0)] implies y∉[F_s(E)+B_ϵ_ 0 (0)]. Thus, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y∉ F_s(E). For every x∈ X, since y_n∈ F_s(E^n), we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> (x,y_n) ∈ A^n, which implies that y_n∈ E^n(x). By using that ρ_s^u(E^n,E)=_y∈ E^nd(y,E)<δ_n, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there exists a sequence { y_n^ 1 } of E(x) such that d(y_n,y_n^ 1)<δ_n. Note that y_n→ y, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y_n^ 1 → y. By the closeness of E(x), we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y∈ E(x), which implies that y∈_x∈ XE(x), by using that _x∈ XE(x)=F_s(E), we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> y∈ F_s(E). Hence, y∉ F_s(E) does not hold, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (1) holds.|$|R

He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun.

Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E

Rekha's female friend Pallavi comes to Bangalore to meet her, and telephones her for her residential address. The conversation is overheard by the Madam of a brothel, who misleads Pallavi. Instead of being taken to Rekha's house, Pallavi is taken to the brothel and forced into prostitution. Rekha and Raghunath search for Pallavi. Chandru comes to the same brothel and takes Pallavi in his car, but kills her. Rekha learns of Pallavi's murder through Raghunath; neither Rekha nor Raghunath are aware that Chandru is the murderer.|$|E
