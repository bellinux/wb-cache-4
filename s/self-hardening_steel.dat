50|$|Mushet steel, {{also known}} as Robert Mushet's Special Steel (RMS), <b>self-hardening</b> <b>steel</b> and air-hardening steel, is {{considered}} the first tool steel and air-hardening steel. It was invented in 1868 by Robert Forester Mushet. Prior to Mushet steel, steel had to be quenched to harden it. It later led {{to the discovery of}} high speed steel.|$|E
50|$|In 1899 and 1900, Taylor and Maunsel White were {{experimenting with}} {{hardening}} processes for Mushet steel and other self-hardening steels. They discovered if the steel is heated to near its melting point {{it creates a}} more durable metal. The metal will retain its hardness up to a red heat. This type of hardened <b>self-hardening</b> <b>steel</b> was the first high speed steel.|$|E
50|$|Mushet steel was {{primarily}} used in machine tools {{due to its}} ability to retain its hardness at high temperatures. In 1894, Frederick Winslow Taylor conducted machining comparison tests between Mushet steel and high carbon tool steel. He found that it could cut 41 to 47% faster on hard tire steel forgings and approximately 90% faster on mild steels. He also found that if a stream of water {{was used as a}} cutting fluid the cutting speed could be increased by 30%. After Taylor's tests results were published Mushet and other <b>self-hardening</b> <b>steels</b> became popular in machine tools. Prior to Taylor's tests Mushet steel was often just used to increase the time between regrinds, take larger cuts, or machine harder materials.|$|R
50|$|In {{a second}} key advance in {{metallurgy}} Mushet invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (RMS) in 1868. It was both the first true tool steel {{and the first}} air-hardening steel. Previously, {{the only way to}} make steel hard enough for machine tools had been to quench it, by rapid cooling in water. <b>Self-hardening</b> (or tungsten) <b>steel</b> machine tools could run much faster and were able to cut harder metals than had been possible previously. RMS revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of high speed steel.|$|R
