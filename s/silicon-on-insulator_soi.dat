50|$|Both {{bulk and}} surface silicon {{micromachining}} {{are used in}} the industrial production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, deep reactive-ion etching, has made it possible to combine good performance typical of bulk micromachining with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of surface micromachining. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2 µm, in HAR silicon micromachining the thickness can be from 10 to 100 µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon micromachining are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> (<b>SOI)</b> wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR silicon micromachining.|$|E
50|$|The {{drive to}} {{increase}} density and performance {{has led to}} the one-transistor, zero-capacitor (1T) DRAM cell being a topic of research since the late-1990s. In 1T DRAM cells, there is a transistor for controlling access to a capacitive region used to store the bit of data, but this capacitance is not provided by a separate capacitor. Instead, the parasitic body capacitor inherent in <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> (<b>SOI)</b> transistors is used. Subsequently, 1T DRAM cells have the greatest density, and can be easily integrated with logic since they are constructed from the same SOI process technologies used for high-performance logic. A key difference from 1T1C DRAMs is that reads in 1T DRAM are non-destructive; the stored charge causes a detectable shift in the threshold voltage of the transistor. Refresh, however, is still required. Performance-wise, access times are significantly better than capacitor-based DRAMs, but slightly worse than SRAM. Examples of such DRAMs include A-RAM and Z-RAM.|$|E
