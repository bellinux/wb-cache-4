500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I {{think there will be}} a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films."

500|$|In March 2009, the Parents Television Council (PTC), a {{conservative}} decency campaigning group, filed an indecency complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

[...] Dan Isett, PTC director of public policy, {{said that this was}} the first time since last fall that the PTC had asked its members to send complaints to the FCC, although the PTC regularly discusses issues it has with shows. The PTC named [...] "Family Gay" [...] the [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] for the week of March 13. MacFarlane responded to the PTC's decrees against the show in an interview with The Advocate, [...] "For an organization that prides itself on Christian values— I mean, I’m an atheist, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> I know?— they spend their entire day hating people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] {{illustrates}} the things Bart raps {{about in the}} song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler {{and as a result}} he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' written all over it." [...] "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> I know?", she added.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation.
