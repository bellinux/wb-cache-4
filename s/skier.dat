5|$|Kari Traa of Norway has {{won three}} medals (one gold, one silver, one bronze) in three {{successive}} Games, {{more than any other}} freestyle <b>skier</b> at the Winter Olympics. Begg-Smith and Janne Lahtela of Finland are the most successful male freestyle skiers, with one gold and one silver medal each. No <b>skier</b> has won more than one gold medal or has managed to defend their Olympic title. The youngest freestyle <b>skier</b> to win an Olympic medal is Russian Yelizaveta Kozhevnikova, who secured a silver in 1992 with 18 years old, while Tatjana Mittermayer of Germany is the oldest medalist, following her silver in the 1998 moguls event, aged 33.|$|E
5|$|Biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway {{won four}} gold medals, while Croatian alpine <b>skier</b> Janica Kostelić won three golds and a silver, making them the two athletes {{with the most}} medals at the Games.|$|E

2500|$|Standing <b>skiers</b> {{generally}} {{follow the}} same rules as sighted <b>skiers</b> laid out by the International Ski Federation. [...] They may wear a prosthesis, use modified length ski poles, and/or use a ski pole called an outrigger that had a small ski on the end. LW1 <b>skiers</b> use two poles but may ski {{on one or two}} skis. LW2 <b>skiers</b> use one ski and two poles. LW3, LW4 <b>skiers</b> use two skis and two poles. LW5 and LW7 <b>skiers</b> do not use poles. [...] LW6 and LW8 <b>skiers</b> use two ski and one pole.|$|R

5|$|Medics were at Kumaritashvili's side {{immediately}} after the crash. Both Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation were performed. He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries. It was luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger was killed. Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympicsafter British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and Australian <b>skier</b> Ross Milne (both 1964 Innsbruck), and Swiss speed <b>skier</b> Nicolas Bochatay (1992 Albertville)and the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing {{the wreck of the}} Orca. A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water <b>skier</b> and speedboat driver, killing the <b>skier,</b> while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
50|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that <b>skiers</b> wearing helmets go faster on average than non-helmeted <b>skiers,</b> and that overall risk index is higher in helmeted <b>skiers</b> than non-helmeted <b>skiers.</b> Moreover, while helmets may help prevent minor head injuries, increased usage of helmets has not reduced the overall fatality rate.|$|R
50|$|Fourteen <b>skiers</b> were pre-qualified, on {{the basis}} of their World Cup performance, meaning that they {{directly}} advanced to the final round. These <b>skiers</b> still jumped in the qualifying round, but they were not included with non-pre-qualified <b>skiers</b> in the standings. The fifty-two <b>skiers</b> who were not pre-qualified competed for thirty-six spots in the final round.|$|R
50|$|Another variant can tow <b>skiers</b> {{behind an}} all terrain carrier {{such as the}} Bandvagn 206. In this case, several <b>skiers</b> or {{soldiers}} can be towed on the same rope.

5|$|Senegal {{participated in}} five Winter Olympics between its debut at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. No Senegalese athlete had ever won a medal at a Winter Games. In {{two out of}} the three initial appearances, the country was {{represented}} by a single alpine <b>skier,</b> Lamine Guèye, {{with the exception of}} 1992 when Alphonse Gomis also competed. In 2006, fellow <b>skier</b> Leyti Seck was the national teams sole athlete.|$|E
5|$|The leading medal winner at the Games was Russian <b>skier</b> Larisa Lazutina, who {{won five}} medals, {{including}} three golds.

2500|$|Para-Alpine <b>skiers</b> in this {{classification}} [...] {{have their}} choice regarding how many skis and ski poles {{they wish to}} user, along {{with the type of}} ski poles they wish to utilize. In para-Nordic skiing, <b>skiers</b> use two skis and have an option to use one or two ski poles. Outriggers are one type of ski pole LW9 <b>skiers</b> can use, which requires its own techniques to use. As there are a broad range of disabilities in this class, different skiing techniques are learned by competitors. <b>Skiers</b> missing an arm use a technique that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. <b>Skiers</b> with cerebral palsy have the introduction of ski poles delayed as <b>skiers</b> may overgrip them.|$|R
40|$|Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to {{methacholine}} with asthma-like symptoms ("ski asthma") is frequent in elite cross-country <b>skiers.</b> To {{further the}} understanding of "ski asthma", 10 nonasthmatic, nonatopic controls and 30 adolescent elite <b>skiers</b> were investigated by bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Nine <b>skiers</b> were atopic without allergy symptoms. Compared with controls, the macroscopic inflammatory index in the proximal airways in <b>skiers</b> was three-fold greater (median (interquartile range) 3. 0 (2. 0 - 5. 0) versus 1. 0 (0. 8 - 2. 3), p= 0. 008). In the BAL fluid, <b>skiers</b> had significantly greater total cell (p< 0. 05) and percentage lymphocyte (p< 0. 01) and mast cell counts (p< 0. 05). Neutrophil and eosinophil counts {{were not significantly different}} and eosinophil cationic protein was not detected. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha and myeloperoxidase were detected in 12 (40 %) and six (20 %) <b>skiers,</b> respectively. In <b>skiers</b> with ski asthma, the inflammatory index was greater than in nonasthmatic <b>skiers.</b> Lymphocyte subtypes and activation markers, and concentration of albumin, fibronectin and hyaluronan were not different from those in controls. Cross-country <b>skiers</b> have a minor to moderate degree of macroscopic inflammation in the proximal airways at bronchoscopy and a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid profile which differs in several respects from healthy controls. <b>Skiers</b> with ski asthma tend to show even higher degrees of bronchial inflammation...|$|R

5|$|As a young adventurer, Fossett {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{participants}} in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as a <b>skier,</b> he was in the first group of 'citizen athletes' to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth <b>skier</b> to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59h, 53min, 30s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.|$|E
25|$|<b>Skiers</b> in {{this class}} use two skis and no ski poles in para-Alpine and para-Nordic, though <b>skiers</b> can use mini-ski poles {{provided}} they cannot hold a ski pole {{without the use of}} a prosthesis. <b>Skiers</b> develop techniques to ski that compensate for balance issues as a result of missing arms. A factoring system is used in para-Alpine and para-Nordic to allow LW5/7 <b>skiers</b> to compete fairly against other <b>skiers</b> with disabilities. While this classification was not grouped with others at the 1984 Winter Olympics Exhibition Competition, it was grouped with other standing classes during events in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|R
2500|$|As this {{classification}} includes <b>skiers</b> with {{cerebral palsy}} and amputations, there are different skiing techniques used specific to these disability types. For <b>skiers</b> with amputations falling is an important skill to learn, while addressing balance is an important thing for <b>skiers</b> {{with cerebral palsy}} to master.|$|R

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} every Winter Paralympics since the inaugural games in 1976. Their sole {{participant}} in 1976 was Ron Finneran, {{although he was}} not an official entrant. In 1980, alpine and cross-country <b>skier</b> Kyrra Grunnsund and cross-country <b>skier</b> Peter Rickards became the first official competitors for Australia. The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, and all of the athletes were alpine skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since then. All of the medals have been won in alpine skiing.|$|E
25|$|As {{this class}} {{includes}} <b>skiers</b> with paralysis, amputations and cerebral palsy, a variety of skiing techniques and training types are needed. <b>Skiers</b> in this classification who have paralysis {{as a result of}} hemiplegia, stroke or polio tend to initially favour a strong side of their body when they learn to ski, which sometimes results in overskiing. Ski-bras and bungie cords are used in training to correct this. If this is not corrected, <b>skiers</b> are likely to fall over when their skis cross in front of them. <b>Skiers</b> with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied <b>skiers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Australia {{won four}} medals in 1992—one gold, one silver and two bronze. Michael Milton, an amputee alpine <b>skier,</b> won {{gold in the}} slalom and silver in the super-G. In {{paraplegic}} sit-skiing, David Munk won bronze in the super-G, and Michael Norton won bronze in the downhill. In 1994, Australia won three gold, two silver and four bronze medals. Milton won gold in the giant slalom, silver in the slalom and bronze in the downhill and super-G, and Norton won gold in the slalom and super-G. James Patterson, a <b>skier</b> with cerebral palsy, won silver in the downhill and bronze in the giant slalom. Munk won another bronze, {{this time in the}} giant slalom. In 1998, Australia won two medals, both through Paterson: gold in the downhill and bronze in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|Biathlon {{combines}} {{cross-country skiing}} and rifle shooting. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time {{is added to}} the contestant's total running distance/time.

5|$|Boston born Kenza Tazi was {{the sole}} female athlete {{competing}} for Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She had skied {{from the age of}} three onwards, and said her hero was American <b>skier</b> Bode Miller. At the time of the start of the 2014 Games, she was also 17; she celebrated her 18th birthday while in Sochi. She chose to represent Morocco over the United States as the Moroccan Ski Association offered to fund her training. Tazi qualified for the Sochi Olympics after competing successfully at a number of qualification events, despite injury problems. Also accompanying the two athletes was a third <b>skier,</b> Sami Lamhamedi, the brother of Adam. However, Sami did not compete in events, and was only there as a potential substitute.

5000|$|<b>Skiers</b> {{from around}} the world come to Hayward, Wisconsin for the race. The Birkie has a {{reputation}} for attracting <b>skiers</b> of varying ability levels. Olympians and national team members have competed in the event, and the Birkie also draws recreational <b>skiers</b> from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and countries such as Canada. The race day also includes the shorter 23 km Kortelopet [...] "Korte", a race geared more toward recreational <b>skiers,</b> and the Prince Haakon 13 km event for those who are not ready to take on the challenge of the longer courses. Registration is capped at 10,000 <b>skiers</b> in 2013, with an additional 20,000 spectators on the sidelines cheering on the competitors.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of asthma (asthma symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness) in Swedish cross country <b>skiers</b> compared with non-skiers and monitor changes in symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness during the year. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional study during the winter ski season and in the summer. SETTING [...] Six ski clubs for élite <b>skiers</b> (total 47) in two different areas of Sweden. SUBJECTS [...] 42 élite cross country <b>skiers</b> and 29 non-skiing referents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Bronchial responsiveness, asthma symptoms, and lung function. RESULTS [...] Bronchial responsiveness was significantly greater and asthma symptoms more prevalent in the <b>skiers</b> than in the referents. There {{was no difference in}} bronchial responsiveness within either group between winter and summer. 15 of the 42 <b>skiers</b> used antiasthmatic drugs regularly and 23 had a combination of asthma symptoms and hyperresponsive airways or physician diagnosed asthma, or both. Altogether 33 <b>skiers</b> had symptoms of asthma or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. One of the referents had symptoms of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and none used antiasthmatic drugs regularly. CONCLUSIONS [...] Asthma, asthma-like symptoms, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are much more common in cross country <b>skiers</b> than in the general population and non-skiers. Strenuous exercise at low temperatures entailing breathing large volumes of cold air is the most probable explanation of persistent asthma in <b>skiers...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Sit <b>skiers</b> {{generally}} {{follow the}} same rules as sighted <b>skiers</b> laid out by the International Ski Federation. They use a mono-ski, which has a specially fitted chair attached to the single ski. [...] The <b>skiers</b> also use outrigrer poles to aid in balance. The monoskis are sometimes called tubs or buckets. Wheelchair users are classified as sit-skiers.|$|R
