50|$|Most of Sumatra used to {{be covered}} by {{tropical}} rainforest, but economic development coupled with corruption and illegal logging has <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> its existence. Even designated conservation areas have not been spared from this destruction.|$|R
6000|$|Bel. Yes, faith, sir, I was foretelling {{her of a}} {{disaster}} that <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> her: And--one thing I foresee already by my stars, that I must bear up boldly, or I am lost. [...] [Aside.|$|R
50|$|Climate change also could, through {{extreme weather}} events, {{have a more}} direct impact on {{national}} security by damaging critical infrastructures such as military bases, naval yards and training grounds, thereby <b>severely</b> <b>threatening</b> essential national defense resources.|$|R
50|$|The Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota {{girls were}} {{encouraged}} to learn to ride, hunt and fight. Though fighting was mostly left to the boys and men, occasionally women fought with them, especially if the tribe was <b>severely</b> <b>threatened.</b>|$|R

40|$|The current {{electrical}} system poses {{a variety of}} problems that <b>severely</b> <b>threaten</b> America’s energy future and national security.

50|$|Soon {{after the}} dam's {{construction}} was announced, the Coalition for Susitna Dam Alternatives {{was formed to}} fight its construction. It is their argument that recreation, nature and the town would be <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by the dam, and have compared it to the Three Gorges Dam in China.|$|R
5000|$|The FAA, in particular, {{appeared}} exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} this threat -- {{in a way}} <b>severely</b> <b>threatening</b> public safety -- because the nation's {{air traffic control system}} was largely computerized. As it turned out, the global threat was much less than feared, and the year transition proved relatively uneventful, worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Due to overuse, the mpingo tree is <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> in Kenya and is needing {{attention}} in Tanzania and Mozambique. The trees are being harvested at an unsustainable rate, {{partly because of}} illegal smuggling of the wood into Kenya, {{but also because the}} tree takes upwards of 60 years to mature.|$|R
50|$|Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota {{girls are}} {{encouraged}} to learn to ride, hunt and fight. Though fighting in war has mostly been left to the boys and men, occasionally women fought as well - both in battles and {{in defense of the}} home - especially if the tribe was <b>severely</b> <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shawnee is <b>severely</b> <b>threatened,</b> with {{speakers}} {{shifting to}} English. The approximately 200 remaining speakers are older adults. The decline in usage of Shawnee is largely {{the result of}} reform schools for Native American children that forced an education in English, causing some Native Americans to cease teaching their languages to children.|$|R
40|$|Mass {{media have}} transitioned {{in the past}} five years from being one-way {{communication}} mediums, from journalists to audiences, into an era of networked digital media in which individuals can easily publish text, photos and video to a world-wide audience.

50|$|Non-breeding birds call only at {{dawn and}} dusk, {{sometimes}} in duet. Their natural habitat is seasonal marshland of subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland. The species is <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss, causes of which include grass trampling by cattle, grass cutting and drainage of swamps for pasture. Regulated land management could improve the situation markedly.|$|R
50|$|The Berserkers have <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> human civilizations {{and wiped}} out millions. The {{remnants}} of human civilization {{have learned to}} be wily in order to survive.

50|$|The {{land-based}} biotopes of the Maldives {{are highly}} endangered. The little land {{available in the}} country is being swiftly developed.

40|$|Abstract Computer {{security}} is <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by softwarevulnerabilities. Prior work shows that information flow tracking (also {{referred to as}} taint analysis) is a promisingtechnique to detect {{a wide range of}} security attacks. However, current information flow tracking systems are not verypractical, because they either require program annotations, source code, non-trivial hardware extensions, or incur pro-hibitive runtime overheads...|$|R
40|$|Heathlands are <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{decreasing}} habitat {{quantity and}} quality. In these habitats, bryophytes form {{an important component}} of plant diversity. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of management and adjacent forest land use on the heathland bryophyte layer. Furthermore, effects of these factors on invasive bryophyte species were studied. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|It is {{endemic to}} the summit of Mount Winipat on Tol, in the Faichuk group of islands within the Chuuk (Truk) atoll in Micronesia. Its habitat is montane {{rainforest}} dominated by the endemic Chuuk poisontree. Due to its restricted range on one small mountaintop and the locals' disdain for the native poisontree, it is <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Only once in its 150 {{years of}} {{existence}} the lighthouse was <b>severely</b> <b>threatened.</b> Wehrmacht plans proposed {{the expansion of}} an airfield on the nearby Braderup heath and the tower {{would have to be}} detonated. With the occupation of Denmark and Norway in 1940 these plans became obsolete though as the strategic importance of Sylt had significantly decreased.|$|R
50|$|The {{decrease}} in anxiety and fear {{may also be}} due to the situation itself. Situations that seem <b>severely</b> <b>threatening,</b> such as giving a presentation, are not actually very harmful. By avoiding the situation through the use of safety behaviors, the user is unable to realize that the situation is harmless, allowing the cycle of anxiety and behavior to continue.|$|R
50|$|The Sumatran {{water shrew}} (Chimarrogale sumatrana) is a red-toothed shrew {{found only in}} the Padang {{highlands}} of western Sumatra, Indonesia. Its natural habitats are streams in montane forests. The species is only known from a holotype, which is damaged, and was previously listed as critically endangered by IUCN. It {{is believed to be}} <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Although New Guinea is {{the most}} northerly part of the continent, and could be {{expected}} to be the most tropical in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia-New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by overpopulation pressures.|$|R
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are tropical moist montane forests and intermittent freshwater marshes. It {{is found in}} the lower canopy and understory of tropical moist evergreen forest, all within about 100 km2 in the Indira Gandhi National Park region of the Western Ghats. It mates on vegetation hanging over temporary pools, where the tadpoles develop. It is <b>severely</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss.|$|R
