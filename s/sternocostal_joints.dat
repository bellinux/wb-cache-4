40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} (a) {{the influence}} of HIV in developing osteoarticular infections in intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) and (b) {{the differences between the}} clinical features of osteoarticular infections in IVDAs and a control group of non-IVDAs. METHODS [...] A comparative study of the clinical features of osteoarticular infections in all HIV positive and HIV negative IVDAs admitted to the departments of rheumatology and internal medicine during a 10 year period was carried out. The joint infections of all IVDAs, irrespective of HIV status, were compared with those of a control group of non-IVDAs lacking risk factors for HIV infection. RESULTS [...] A total of 482 HIV positive and 85 HIV negative IVDAs was studied, in whom 25 (5 %) and six (7 %) osteoarticular infections were found respectively. There were no differences in age, sex, joints affected, and causative agents between these two groups. A comparison of the 31 (5. 5 %) osteoarticular infections in all IVDAs with 21 infections in 616 (3. 4 %) non-IVDAs showed significant differences in the mean age (27. 5 v 54), the frequency of affection of the axial joints (hip, sacroiliac, and <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joints)</b> (64. 5 % v 16. 6 %), and in the incidence of Candida albicans (19 % v 0 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] (1) HIV may not predispose to osteoarticular infections in IVDAs. (2) The hip, sacroiliac, and <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joints</b> (axial joints) were most commonly affected in IVDAs.

40|$|The manubriosternal joint {{has been}} a matter of {{histological}} and anatomical discussion due to diversity of clasifications. It has been described as sinfisis, cartilagonous primary joint, synchondrosis or as a synovial joint. The objetive {{of this study was to}} determine the type of tissue that from this structure. Sternons were obtained from 10 chilean male cadavers (7 fresh and 3 formalized), 40 to 60 years old. The manubriosternal joint was examined macro and microscopally. Each joint was identified and the manubriosternal joint was examined sectioning the bone 1 cm above and 1 cm below the inter articular line. The segments were descalcified and 9 pieces were obtained in anteroposterior sections: 3 from the median part of the joint and 3 from each lateral proximal part of the <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joint.</b> The samples were stained with hematoxiline-eosin stain and van Giesson. The histologic examination determined, that in 5 cases (50 %) the was a fine periferic layer of hialinic tissue. This tissue covered the surfaces articulars of the manubrium and sternal body. It was also found, between both surfaces a moderate (+++) fibrocartilaginous tissue in 3 cases (30 %) was found a hialinic tissue between the articulars surfaces and abound fibrocartilaginosus tissue (+++) and in 2 cases (20 %), the cartilaginosus tissues thar covered the articulars surfaces was abound with minimum fibrocartilaginous (++) in the central region. In 6 cases (60 %) there was a small cavity in the fibrocartilaginous. The manubriosternal joint presented their surfaces covered with cartilaginosus tissue of hialinic type in relation with fibrocartilaginous tissue. This last tissue was a real disc between the articulars surface. In the majority of the cases was found a small cavity, perhaps due to the absortion that its central part suffers this loock more like a synovial joint than a synchondrosis. This could be due to a periferic calcification or to a sinostosis manubriosternal. In conclusion, this joint could be defined as a sinfisis. This reminded an old clasification that defined it as "diartroanfiartrosis", a transition joint between the synovial articulations and cartilaginosu...|$|R

40|$|Breathing {{is a vital}} {{phenomenon}} that implies synergy of various anatomical structures that constitute the thorax. Joint physiology remains a relatively poorly-known component of the overall thorax physiology. Quantitative literature related to in vivo thorax kinematics during breathing is scarce. The present work focuses specifically on developing and applying a methodology to reach this goal. The developed method combined processing of CT data obtained at different lung volumes and infographic techniques. Detailed ranges of motion (ROMs) and axes of movement (mean helical axes, MHAs) were obtained at costovertebral joints in 12 asymptomatic subjects; rib ROMs gradually decrease with increasing rib number; lung volume and rib level have a significant influence on rib ROM; MHAs did not differ between rib levels. In addition, the method was applied on a sample of 10 patients with cystic fibrosis. The pathological condition significantly influenced CVJ ROMs while {{the orientation of the}} MHAs did not differ. Finally, the sternal displacement, sternal angle variations and <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joints</b> (SCJ at rib 1 to 7) kinematics during breathing motion were analyzed. Rib ranges of motion relative to sternum decreased with increasing rib number similarly to CVJ. Orientation of the MHAs did not differ between SCJ levels. A significant linear correlation was demonstrated between sternum vertical displacement and rib ranges of motion at both CVJ and SCJ. The present work substantially contributes to 3 D modelling of human thorax in breathing at a joint level both qualitatively and quantitatively.

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} {{to the understanding of}} the combination of in vivo sternum displacement, sternal angle variations and <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joints</b> (SCJ) kinematics of the seven first rib pairs over the inspiratory capacity (IC). Retrospective codified spiral-CT data obtained at total lung capacity (TLC), middle of inspiratory capacity (MIC) and at functional residual capacity (FRC) were used to compute kinematic parameters of the bones and joints of interest in a sample of 12 asymptomatic subjects. 3 D models of rib, thoracic vertebra, manubrium and sternum were processed to determine anatomical landmarks (ALs) on each bone. These ALs were used to create local coordinate system and compute spatial transformation of ribs and manubrium relative to sternum, and sternum relative to thoracic vertebra. The rib angular displacements and associated orientation of rotation axes and joint pivot points (JPP), the sternal angle variations and the associated displacement of the sternum relative to vertebra were computed between each breathing pose at the three lung volumes. Results can be summarized as following: (1) sternum cephalic displacement ranged between 17. 8 and 19. 2 mm over the IC; (2) the sternal angle showed a mean variation of 4. 4 °± 2. 7 ° over the IC; (3) ranges of rib rotation relative to sternum decreased gradually with increasing rib level; (4) axes of rotation were similarly oriented at each SCJ; (5) JPP spatial displacements showed less variations at first SCJ compared to levels underneath; (6) linear relation was demonstrated between SCJ ROMs and sternum cephalic displacement over the IC. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} changes of human {{organism}} during physiological aging. Initially changes occur in internal organ function, followed by morphological changes of particular organs. The body start {{showing signs of}} growing old {{at the beginning of}} the fourth decade. Some organs age faster as the kidneys, while others age slower such is the liver. Among the general changes which occur along with aging, body mass increases as a result of fatt tissue increase, but decreases in highly advancing age. Changes of body water also occur and is reduced by about 10 – 15 % in comparison to middle-aged persons. The human body contains more extracellular than intracellular water and that is why is greater plasma volume with advancing age. The quantity of the connective tissue in heart muscle increases, particularly in the endocardium and the epicardium, while the pigment lipofuscin is deposited in the myocardium. From the beginning of the fourth decade, cardiac output decreases by about 1 % yearly, stroke volume decreases for about 0. 7 %, and peripheral vascular resistence increases for about 1. 2 % yearly. In the respiratory system, from the fourth decade the number of cilia diminish, alveolar macrophages are less efficient, lung elasticity decreases, <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joints</b> became inelastic, chest expansion is diminished, the speed of expiratory air can be reduced. In the kidneys changes in blood vessels leading to the alteration of nephron function. The number of capillaries dwindles, influencing both glomerular and peritubular parts, the total weight of the kidneys can be reduced, the connective tissue increases as the basalmembrane become thicker. Glomerular capillaries degenerate and are bridging by arterioles. Other internal organs change with advancing age also...|$|E

Ten sternum plates removed from unclaimed cadavers were used in this study. Sternal plates were removed using bilateral incisions of the ribs at the midclavicular lines. The characterization of the internal mammary vessels and the anatomical integrity of the parietal pleura were indispensable requirements during the procedure. The study was descriptive experimental. A total of 56 lymph nodes were removed from the second, third and forth intercostals spaces, being 30 at the right side and 26 ones at the left side. The second intercostal space was the one that shows the greatest number of lymph nodes in both sides. The lymph nodes of the chain of internal mammary vessels were dissected by a safe and practical technique, different from the one practiced by the Italian surgeons, pioneers at the dissection of the lymph nodes of the internal mammary vessels. The first stage of the dissection consisted of detaching the pectorals major muscle from its attachments to the manubrium and sternal body, exposing the <b>sternocostal</b> <b>joints.</b> Upon identification and detachment of the intercostals muscles approximately five cm from the ribs, special attention is paid to the neurovascular structures located at the superior border of the intercostal space, forming a window in a format of âUâ, exposing the internal mammary vessels and the lymph nodes to them related.
