Was this to be Meriwether Lewis as the Colin Powell of another day? Or as the original of John Wesley Powell? Either way, I was nervous that this book might set popular western history back a decade or more. My fears were excessive. Ambrose has written an honest and at times moving and insightful book about an important man and moment in our history.

40|$|A <b>summer</b> <b>ago</b> I {{returned}} to India {{for two months}} to look for new fieldsites and also to attend a series of ceremonies being conducted by the Dalai Lama in a previously closed section of the Greater Himalayas, the tiny Tibetan kingdom of Spiti. Nestled in a steep river valley up against the Chinese border, Spiti is known to Tibetologists from the earliest historical records as an ancient Tibetan Buddhist kingdom, located hundreds of {{miles to the west}} of the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. With the drawing of the territorial borders between China and India after the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1960, Spiti was excluded from the Chinese controlled plateau by a mere five miles. It is now part of the Indian perimeter of defense against the Chinese, and there is a small military outpost in the valley- Until last summer, the valley was closed to all visitors Visiting the kingdom of Spiti was an exciting prospect. My research over the past fifteen years on Tibetan Buddhist legal systems drew me to Spiti as a possible site for on-the-ground examination of the legal procedures, fora, and rules I had encountered only as detailed historical reconstructions among the Tibetans. Here was the possibility of a living community that had been using the Tibetan Buddhist legal system up to the present day, largely unimpeded by the Indian government that had inherited it. At the same time, I was also reading widely on the topic of secularity in both law and religion, and I was anxious to return to a society considered nonsecular in order to try out some preliminary conjectures...|$|R

6000|$|That evening, as we {{were sitting}} smoking on the porch, old Peter's mind reverted {{to the subject of}} the unfounded charge against me. [...] "It goes pretty hard," [...] he remarked, [...] "to have to stand up and take a thing you don' like when there's no call fur it. It's bad enough when there is a call fur it. That matter about your fish buyin' reminds me of what {{happened}} two <b>summers</b> <b>ago</b> to my sister, or ruther to her two little boys--or, more correct yit, to one of 'em. Them was two cur'ous little boys. They was allus tradin' with each other. Their father deals mostly in horses, and they must have got it from him. At the time I'm tellin' of they'd traded everythin' they had, and when they hadn't nothin' else left to swap they traded names. Joe he took Johnny's name, and Johnny he took Joe's. Jist about when they'd done this, they both got sick with sumthin' or other, the oldest one pretty bad, the other not much. Now there ain't no doctor inside of twenty miles of where my sister lives. But there's one who sometimes has a call to go through that part of the country, and the people about there is allus very glad when they chance to be sick when he comes along. Now this good luck happened to my sister, fur the doctor come by jist at this time. He looks into the state of the boys, and while their mother has gone downstairs he mixes some medicine he has along with him. 'What's your name?' he says to the oldest boy when he'd done it. Now as he'd traded names with his brother, fair and square, he wasn't goin' back on the trade, and he said, 'Joe.' 'And my name's Johnny,' up and says the other one. Then the doctor he goes and gives the bottle of medicine to their mother, and says he: 'This medicine is fur Joe. You must give him a tablespoonful every two hours. Keep up the treatment, and he'll be all right. As fur Johnny, there's nothin' much the matter with him. He don't need no medicine.' And then he went away. Every two hours after that Joe, who wasn't sick worth mentionin', had to swallow a dose of horrid stuff, and pretty soon he took to his bed, and Johnny he jist played round and got well in the nat'ral way. Joe's mother kept up the treatment, gittin' up in the night to feed that stuff to him; but the poor little boy got wuss and wuss, and one mornin' he says to his mother, says he: 'Mother, I guess I'm goin' to die, and I'd ruther do that than take any more of that medicine, and I wish you'd call Johnny and we'll trade names back agen, and if he don't want to come and do it, you kin tell him he kin keep the old minkskin I gave him to boot, on account of his name havin' a Wesley in it.' 'Trade names,' says his mother, 'what do you mean by that?' And then he told her what he and Johnny had done. 'And did you ever tell anybody about this?' says she. 'Nobody but Dr. Barnes,' says he. 'After that I got sick and forgot it.' When my sister heard that, an idee struck into her like you put a fork into an apple dumplin'. Traded names, and told the doctor! She'd all along thought it strange that the boy that seemed wuss should be turned out, and the other one put under treatment; but it wasn't fur her to set up her opinion agen that of a man like Dr. Barnes. Down she went, in about seventeen jumps, to where Eli Timmins, the hired man, was ploughin' in the corn. 'Take that horse out of that,' she hollers, 'and you may kill him if you have to, but git Dr. Barnes here before my little boy dies.' When the doctor come he heard the story, and looked at the sick youngster, and then says he: 'If he'd kept his minkskin, and not hankered after a Wesley to his name, he'd a had a better time of it. Stop the treatment, and he'll be all right.' Which she did; and he was. Now {{it seems to me that}} this is a good deal like your case. You've had to take a lot of medicine that didn't belong to you, and I guess it's made you feel pretty bad; but I've told my gals to stop the treatment, and you'll be all right in the mornin'. Good-night. Your candlestick is on the kitchen table." ...|$|E
