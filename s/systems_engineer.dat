25|$|Immediately {{after the}} explosion, the {{aircraft}} banked {{hard to the}} right, but the autopilot quickly corrected the bank. After the blast, Captain Reyes asked <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineer</b> Dexter Comendador to survey the blast site to check for damage. Reyes placed the Mayday call, requesting landing at Naha Airport, Okinawa Island, Okinawa Prefecture. The Japanese air traffic controller experienced difficulty in trying to understand Reyes' request, so an American air traffic controller from a United States military base on Okinawa took over and processed Reyes' landing. The American air traffic controller directed a USAF Lear jet towards PAL 434 to visually check for damage of the outer fuselage and to verify that the landing gear was in place. The autopilot had stopped responding to Reyes' commands and the aircraft flew past Okinawa.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{requirements}} are understood, {{it is now}} the responsibility of a <b>systems</b> <b>engineer</b> to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A decision matrix, or Pugh method, is one way (QFD is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the system (without changing {{the requirements}}). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, reliability analysis, system dynamics (feedback control), and optimization methods.|$|E
25|$|Mixing {{consoles}} {{often include}} high-pass filtering at each channel strip. Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100Hz {{that can be}} engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400Hz on the Midas Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000Hz on the Yamaha M7CL digital mixing console. Veteran <b>systems</b> <b>engineer</b> and live sound mixer Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as kick drum, bass guitar and piano, sources which will have useful low frequency sounds. Main writes that DI unit inputs (as opposed to microphone inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they {{are not subject to}} modulation by low-frequency stage wash—low frequency sounds coming from the subwoofers or the public address system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a proximity effect—a low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500Hz high-pass filter setting on the console.|$|E

South Africa, and indeed internationally, has been {{experiencing}} a shortage of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers.</b> On the other hand {{we seem to have}} only introductory systems engineering courses at local universities. <b>Systems</b> <b>engineers</b> have developed by means of experience on the job. This is a long route fraught with many challenges. We look to develop a strategic solution to the problem in this paper. We start by considering a number of reasons why systems engineering is difficult to learn. A framework for defining the required system engineering competencies is introduced. A practice-based approach is presented as part of the solution, including the roles of universities, students and industry within this approach. Finally we elaborate on a proposed curriculum for a practice-based SE educational programme. The shortage of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> requires strategic action. In order to accelerate the development of high competency <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> we will need to adopt new (old) approaches. What is being proposed will require considerable effort, but is expected to yield good results and will contribute to developing the next generation of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Parallels between {{divergent}} thought processes, {{studied in}} creativity research by developmental psychologists, and the intellectual control imperatives of systems engineering are examined. A metaphorical template of the <b>systems</b> <b>engineer's</b> thought processes {{as defined by}} and taught {{from the standpoint of}} convergence is presented, and a core set of training modules to aid in evolving <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> from domain engineer stock is recommended. A. D. Hall's 1969 model of the <b>systems</b> <b>engineer's</b> thought structure is resurrected and is found to still apply to the convergent mode of systems engineering training. It is suggested that teaching <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> to develop divergent thought processes is analogous to teaching “creativity ” in other fields. An examination technique, employed with success in a related field (e. g., Microsoft certification), that uses the traditional "convergent " multiple choice question, but forces divergent thinking to arrive at the “correct ” answer, is discussed...|$|R

500|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, Shea took {{a position}} at Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey. [...] There he first worked as <b>systems</b> <b>engineer</b> on the radio guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the Titan II ICBM. Shea's specialty was systems engineering, {{a new type of}} engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large-scale projects, turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole. He {{played a significant role in}} the Titan I project; as George Mueller writes, [...] "e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system." [...] In addition to Shea's technical abilities, it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people. Known for his quick intellect, he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings. During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant, sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed.|$|E
