The group includes the albatrosses, shearwaters, and petrels (Procellariiformes), cormorants (Pelecaniformes), and two families of the Charadriiformes: gulls (Laridae), and auks, such as puffins, murres, auklets, and murrelets (Alcidae). Several species of sea ducks (Merganini) also spend much of their life in marine waters.

40|$|This memory {{organization}} is implemented using four page tables, {{one of each}} UNIX process and each page table maps the same shared memory. The disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that there can never be pointers from the shared area to any of the private mapped areas and vice versa. However, addresses from one file structure can be stored in another file structure, but such addresses can only be dereferenced in the file structure they come from. Hence, either data must be copied out of a file structure to be manipulated by an application and copied back again, or an application light-weight task must migrate to the UNIX process implementing the representatives to perform a series of operations. As well, in object-oriented languages, objects with virtual members cannot be instantiated in the file structure as the virtual pointer refers back to data in shared memory (virtual routine vectors). 2 Dynamic linking would solve this problem.

40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} several {{devices that}} are formed by joining two different materials together. PN junction and metal–semiconductor junction are analyzed in the forward-bias and reverse-bias conditions. Of particular importance are {{the concepts of}} the depletion region and minority carrier injection. Solar cells and light-emitting diode are presented in some detail because of their rising importance for renewable energy generation and for energy conservation through solid-state lighting, respectively. The metal–semiconductor junction can be a rectifying junction or an ohmic contact. The latter is of growing importance {{to the design of}} high-performance transistors. PART I: PN JUNCTION As illustrated in Fig. 4 – 1, a PN junction can be fabricated by implanting or diffusing (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>3.</b> <b>5)</b> donors into a P-type substrate such that a layer of semiconductor is converted into N type. Converting a layer of an N-type semiconductor into P type with acceptors would also create a PN junction. A PN junction has rectifying current–voltage (I–V or IV) characteristics as shown in Fig. 4 – 2. As a device, it is called a rectifier or a diode. The PN junction is the basic structure of solar cell, light-emitting diode, and diode laser, and is present in all types of transistors. In addition, PN junction is a vehicle for studying the theory FIGURE 4 – 1 A PN junction can be fabricated by converting a layer of P-type semiconductor into N-type with donor implantation or diffusion.

40|$|The context which {{occasions}} {{this study}} is the established multicultural reality of India and the developing multicultural spectrum of Scotland (see Sections 3. 2, 3. 3, 3. 4). The aims, objectives and/ or policies of the two governments (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>3.</b> <b>5)</b> - and the respective boards of education in the two countries (see Section 3. 6) - provide the high idealistic foundations that such institutions stand for. The study uses the discourse analysis method (see Section 4. 2 for definition) to evaluate how far the texts used by schools in India and Scotland reflect such high ideals – how far the texts contain multicultural markers (see Section 5. 4 for definition) and how these markers are exploited through the exercises. The study takes into account even the materials containing multicultural markers that may not {{have anything to do with}} social injustice. It is a case study because, due to lack of time and space, the study takes into account only one representative book each from India and Scotland. The study is an endeavour to incorporate two features influenced by Norman Fairclough’s ideas (see Section 5. 2 and Section 1. 5, respectively) : one, a selective discourse analysis approach; and two, an interdisciplinary approach – interdisciplinary in the sense that it integrates discourse analysis, cultural studies and history. As part of the second approach, this study includes the following: first, critical discourse analysis (see Section 4. 3 for definition) of a representative text – one out of the 108 texts from the two books; and second, two chapters – Chapters 2 and 3 – which elucidate on the following ideas and issues: multiculturalism; ethnicity, nation and state; ethnic compositions of the two states; history of multiculturalism in India and Scotland; the policies towards multiculturalism in India and Scotland; and objectives of the two respective boards of education. My research question is answered (see Section 5. 1 for research question; see Section 7. 2 for its answer) and my hypothesis is tested (see Section 5. 1 for hypothesis; see Section 7. 2 for its test) on the basis of the evaluation of the texts by using the discourse analysis method. The study incorporates critical discourse analysis of a representative text in order to complement the findings of the discourse analysis method and to demonstrate how various aspects of a text can be exploited to raise the awareness of learners about cultures and related social issues.

The conceptual framework for the ELLI-Index is loosely based on the UNESCO's International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century and the four major dimensions of learning identified: (a) Learning to Know (includes acquisition of knowledge and mastery of learning tools such as concentration, memory and analysis), (b) Learning to Do (concerns occupational, hands-on and practical skills), (c) Learning to Live Together (concerns learning that strengthens cooperation and social cohesion), and (d) Learning to Be (includes the fulfilment of a person, as an individual/member of a family/citizen). The JRC analysis, which was based on the recommendations of the OECD (2008) Handbook on Composite Indicators, suggests that the 2010 ELLI-Index classification provides a reliable picture of the situation at the national level in the EU and can be used to generate a discussion about what policies contribute to lifelong learning, to study the association between lifelong learning and other concepts, such as competitiveness, innovation, and to provide insight into the nature of relevant policy challenges at the EU scale. Besides some fine-tuning issues which were spotted in the ELLI model (<b>see</b> <b>Sections</b> <b>3</b> to <b>5</b> for detailed discussion and summary in Table 17), this JRC report shows that the ELLI-Index is built according to a sound statistical methodology, its dimensions are well balanced and country ranking's dependence upon input assumptions does not exhibit any of the pathologies which at time affect composite measures.

Features equally hazardous appear further north on the western edge of the planned landing ellipse and on the eastern edge of the landing ellipse. These risks were known and accepted when the landing site was selected and did not represent risks that were higher than any alternative landing site during the early fall of 1999 at the time when a burn could have been executed to move the landing site. During the days prior to EDL, the cross-range drift (subsequently attributed to TCM- 4 execution errors) was observed; however, as previously discussed, the project maneuver strategy did not allow for cross-track corrections at TCM- 5.

40|$|For {{any system}} model, a solid {{foundation}} of well-defined quantities, units and dimensions system is very important. Properties that describe many aspects of a system depend on it. At the same time, such a foundation should be a shareable resource that can reused in many models within and across organizations and projects. The most widely accepted, scrutinized and globally used system of quantities and system of units are the International System of Quantities (ISQ) and the International System of Units (SI). They are formally standardized through [ISO 31] and [IEC 60027]. Currently, work is in progress to harmonize these two sets of standards into one new set [ISO/IEC 80000], of which a number of parts are already released with the remaining parts {{expected to be completed}} in the near future.

SysML should provide the means to support all such specific systems of quantities and units, including precise definitions of the relationships between different systems of units, and with explicit and unambiguous unit conversions to and from SI as well as other systems.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} Zwiebach invariants that generalize Gromov-Witten invariants and homotopical algebra structures. We outline the induction procedure that induces the structure of Zwiebach invariants on the subbicomplex, that gives the structure of Gromov-Witten invariants on subbicomplex with zero diffferentials. We propose to treat Hodge dGBV with 1 / 12 axiom as the simplest set of Zwiebach invariants, and explicitely prove that it induces WDVV and Getzler equations in genera 0 and 1 respectively. 1. Pre-introduction In [1], Barannikov and Kontsevich have found {{a solution to the}} WDVV equation starting from the algebra of polyvector fields on Calabi-Yau manifolds. The algebraic properties of polyvector fields used in their construction are captured by an abstract algebraic structure called dGBV-algebra with Hodge property. One of the main results of this paper is a new interpretation of Barannikov-Kontsevich construction. We represent their solution as a sum over trivalent trees. Using this representation we give a new independent proof that this sum over trivalent trees satisfies the WDVV equation. Since we have a sum over trivalent trees, it is very natural to study the sum over graphs of higher genera (with the same tensor expressions associated to elements of graphs). We prove that in genus 1 our construction satisfied the Getzler elliptic equation [8]. But in order to prove this we have introduced a new surprising algebraic axiom (we call it 1 / 12 axiom, <b>see</b> <b>Sections</b> <b>5.</b> <b>3).</b> Probably, the main problem for us was to find a proper explanation of this additional axiom. In fact, in order to obtain naturally the genus 0 part of our construction (i. e., Barannikov-Kontsevich solution in terms of trivalent trees) it is enough to study the BCOV-action written down A.

40|$|This is {{a working}} document. All lattices are finite for now. An equaclosure {{operator}} on a finite lattice has the following properties. (1) x ≤ h(x). (2) x ≤ y implies h(x) ≤ h(y). (3) h 2 (x) = h(x). (4) h(0) = 0. (5) h(x) = h(y) implies h(x) = h(xy). (6) h(x) (y + z) = h(x) y + h(x) z. Equaclosure operators were introduced by Adaricheva and Gorbunov [5] to abstract {{the properties of}} the equational closure operator on lattices of quasivarieties, which had been put to good use by Dziobiak in [6]. For more, <b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>5.</b> <b>3</b> of Gorbunov [8]. Note that two quasivarieties have the same equational closure if and only if they have the same free algebras. The real objective here is to characterize lattices of quasivarieties. These are known to be join semidistributive and biatomic, in addition to admitting an equaclosure operator and being dually algebraic. Moreover, the equational closure operator on quasivarieties satisfies another condition, which is not quite so natural. For atoms a, b we write a ∼ b if | ↓(a + b) | = 4. The last condition is: (7) If a, b, c, d are atoms of L with a ∼ d, d ≰ h(a), d ≤ h(c) and h(c) = h(a + b), then h(c) = h(b + d). A map satisfying (1) –(7) will be called a strong equaclop. We note that if h is an equaclop and a, b and c are distinct atoms, then h(c) = h(a + b) if and only if c ≤ a + b. 1. A general perspective: MD(L) and equaclosure operators Call an element a ∈ L meet distributive if a(x + y) = ax + ay for all x, y ∈ L. Let MD(L) denote the set of all meet distributive elements of L. Note that this is a meet subsemilattice of L containing 0 and 1. With each 0 - 1 -meet subsemilattice S of MD(L) we can associate the closure operator σ(x) = ∏ ↑ x ∩ S, that is, the least element of S above x. All these closure operators satisfy conditions (1) –(4) and (6), while none of them need satisfy (5). We can use (5) directly: σ(x) = σ(y) implies σ(x) = σ(xy), or the subsemilattice for...|$|R
