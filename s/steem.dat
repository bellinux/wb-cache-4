Making use of his thesis methodology, the author attempts to make clear the nature and logic of the use of « search » and/or theoretical models in « scientific » geography. Following a criticism of methodology of explanation with special reference to the difficulty which <b>steems</b> from the equivocal nature of terms « explanation » and « models », the author goes on to present the logic stages of mathematical testing an hypothetical spacial structure using a factorial analysis framework.

40|$|In this article, we {{conjugate}} time marching schemes with Finite Differences splittings into low {{and high}} modes {{in order to build}} fully explicit methods with enhanced temporal stability for the numerical solutions of PDEs. The main idea is to apply explicit schemes with less restrictive stability conditions to the linear term of the high modes equation, in order that the allowed time step for the temporal integration is only determined by the low modes. These conjugated schemes were developed in [10] for the spectral case and here we adapt them to the Finite Differences splittings provided by Incremental Unknowns, which <b>steems</b> from the Inertial Manifolds theory. We illustrate their improved capa-bilities with numerical solutions of Burgers equations, with uniform and non-uniform meshes, in dimensions one and two, when using modified Forward– Euler and Adams–Bashforth schemes. The resulting schemes use time steps of the same order of those used by semi-implicit schemes with comparable accuracy and reduced computational costs...|$|R

This change in focus has implications on the desirability portfolio diversification from society's perspective. Indeed while the individually risk reducing effect of diversification has been known since Markowitz (1952), it also forms connections between investors through common asset holdings, who {{have been identified as}} a major carrier of contagion in the presence of fire sales. The paper takes a first step towards quantifying this contagion externality diversification and compares it to its individual risk-reducing effect. We do so through the distribution of the vector of investor wealth, where marginal densities capture the former effect, while the latter is embedded in the dependence structure. Covariance matrices between investors are obtained from a micro-founded model that captures the contagion <b>steeming</b> from cross asset holding, which translates into a linear system of N recurrence equations of price returns. This paper is in its preliminary stages, comments are very welcome. ...|$|R

In this study, effects of Nodularin (NODLN), a cyclic pentapeptide hepatotoxin, on liver and gill tissues of A. persicus were studied. Nodularin was produced in high amounts by Nodularia spumigena, a cyanobacterium species during the algal bloom in the Caspian Sea and was accumulated in biota of the Sea. Persian sturgeon were exposed directly to NODLN as prolonged immersion containing N. spumigena in two different doses (1 × 104 and 1 × 108 cells. ml- 1) for 24, 48 and 96 hours to examine its histopathological effects on fish liver and gill. Histopathological examinations revealed loss of liver architecture, degeneration of hepatocytes, nuclear pyknosis, karyolysis and finally necrosis of the cells over the time. Observation of gill tissues following immersion in algal cells treatments showed hypertrophy, fusion of secondary lamellae due to proliferation (hyperplasia) of branchial epithelium in low dose and vacuolization of epithelial and pilar cells, tellangiectasis, fusion of secondary and primary lamellae, complete necrosis and sloughing of secondary lamellar epithelium in high dose...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply to}} the massive scalar field a method {{recently}} proposed by Schwinger to calculate the Casimir Effect. The method is applied with two different regularization schemes: the Schwinger’s original one by means of Poisson formula and another one by means of analytical continuation.

The Casimir method of calculation (3) (summation of the zero-point energies) as well as other methods applied to several different setups, require the subtraction of infinities to arrive at the final correct result. In such circumstances it is highly desirable to have different methods of calculations, with the infinities controle...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the coming}} decades, global change {{will have an}} impact on food and water {{security}} in highly significant and yet uncertain ways. There are strong indications that developing countries will bear the brunt of any adverse conditions, particularly those <b>steeming</b> from climate change. T his is largely because poverty levels are high, and developing-country capacity to adapt to global change is weak. Furthermore, the rural populations of developing countries—for whom agricultural production is the primary source of direct and indirect employment and income—will be most affected due agriculture’s vulnerability to global change processes. T he agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water resources, and variability in water supply has a major influence on health and welfare in poor areas. With water scarcity and extreme weather events expected to increase under climate change, water security could decline significantly in rural areas and in agriculture. Consequently, it is important to understand the impacts of global change (in terms of climate, demography, technology, and so on), on agriculture and natural resources in developing countries and to develop adaptive capacity to respond to these impacts. Moreover, there is a need to develop informed and effective adaptation measures and investment options that can be taken now to alleviate adverse impacts of global change in the future...|$|R

In order to solve this problem, we need to enhance the use of wood by optimalizing the use of wooden raw material wich has a great potensial, but not well used, for example hybride coconut wood. The purpose of this research were to determine physical, mechanical and chemical properties of hybride coconut wood and its vertically and horizontally variation in order to optimalize the use of hybride coconut wood. This research used three hybride coconut <b>steems,</b> the 6 cm disks were extracted from each stem at 1, 4, 7, and 10 m heights. The analyze of vascular bundle and parenchyma consisted of covered area per cm 2 and their chemical composition. Hybride coconut wood had a low specific gravity because vascular bundle covered area was lower than parenchyma per cm 2 and low wood substance portion. Low specific gravity caused low mechanical properties. Hight moisture content (specially fresh one) was cause by sugar and starch extractives which had high hygroscopic ability. These extractives content also caused it to be easily attacked by wood destroying factors. Parenchyma covered area per cm 2 caused high sugar and starch content. Height and depth factors were visible influence at almost all basic properties of vascular bundle and parenchyma at different level...|$|R
40|$|A hemotransfusÃo Ã uma necessidade que acompanha a humanidade desde seus primÃrdios. A partir do sÃculo XV vÃrios estudiosos tentaram utilizar o sangue atravÃs da transfusÃo. Somente no sÃculo XX com a descoberta dos grupos sangÃÃneos e a descriÃÃo da prova cruzada, tornaram a transfusÃo como um mÃtodo cientÃfico. Os institutos de transfusÃo de sangue foram criados na Europa a partir do ano de 1920. No Brasil somente na dÃcada de 1940 surgiram as primeiras organizaÃÃes hemoterÃpicas. Em 1949 surgiu a Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia. A primeira Lei incentivando a doaÃÃo voluntÃria de sangue no Brasil data de 1950. Com o surgimento do movimento militar em 1964 e a constataÃÃo de que numa {{eventual}} catÃstrofe nÃo haveria sangue suficiente para atender a demanda nacional, Ã recomendada uma definiÃÃo na PolÃtica Nacional de Sangue. Em 1965 Ã editado pelo Governo Federal a Lei nÂ 4. 071 disciplinando a atividade hemoterÃpica no paÃs. E este foi o primeiro passo para regulamentar estes serviÃos. Somente em 1980 Ã criado o Programa Nacional de Sangue e Hemoderivados â Pro-Sangue tendo com meta a implantaÃÃo dos Hemocentros no Brasil. Comparando-se o ano de 1999 quando 2. 096. 190 coletas de sangue foram realizadas pela Hemorrede Nacional em relaÃÃo ao ano de 2000 quando 2. 329. 937 pessoas doaram sangue, notamos um aumento significativo no nÃmero de doadores em todo o Brasil. A GerÃncia Nacional de Sangue e Hemoderivados responsÃvel pelo setor de sangue no Brasil estima o percentual das doaÃÃes espontÃneas em torno de 41, 74 % sendo que 54, 99 % representam os doadores de reposiÃÃo. Em 1971 surgem os primeiros bancos de sangue privados no CearÃ. Em 1983 HEMOCE inicia suas atividades. ApÃs dez anos os Hemocentros Regionais sÃo implantados no interior do Estado. Hoje a cobertura hemoterÃpica no CearÃ se aproxima dos 100 % atendendo a todos os hospitais pÃblicos e privados. The hemotransfusion {{is a need}} {{which has}} accompanied the humanity since its origins. Starting from the 15 th century, several specialists tried to use the blood trough transfusion, however, only in the 20 th century, {{with the discovery of}} blood groups and description of the crossed proof, transfusion was recognized as a scientific method. Blood Tranfusion Institutes were created in 1920, but in Brazil, only in the decade of 1940 apperead the first hemotherapics organizations. In this period, the Brazilian Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy was founded (in 1949) and the first law motivating the voluntary donation of blood in Brazil was written (which dates from 1950). In 1964, with the appereance of the military movement and the verification that in an eventual catastrophe there would not be enough blood to assist the national demand, was recommended a definition in the National Politics of Blood. In 1965 was edited by the Federal Government the law number 4. 071 which has established rules to hemotherapic activity in the country and this was the first step to regulate this kind of service. But only in 1980 the National Program of Blood and Stems â Pro-Sangue was created tends with main goal the implantation of Hemocenters in Brazil. Comparing the year 1999, when 2. 096. 190 blood collections were accomplished by National Hematology Network, with the year 2000, when 2. 329. 937 people donated blood, we noticed {{a significant increase in the}} number of donors throughout Brazil.
