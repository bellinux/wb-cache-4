The fight arose from a family feud and Caunt took Langham to 60 rounds in September 1853.

25|$|The film is {{also thought}} notable for {{being one of}} the first adult films to be {{produced}} or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which contained sex acts which might anger or offend the target audience (straight men). That Bernard would do so is a testament, film historians have <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> willingness to take risks and his subtle understanding of the role homoeroticism and homosexuality play in French male sexual identity.|$|E

In Alomía Robles' third year studying medicine, he traveled {{with other students}} to the Amazon jungle regions where he met Catholic missionary Gabriel Sala, who came to have a decisive influence on Alomía Robles' life in music.

25|$|At any rate, in 1464 (9 Aug.), Billing {{was added}} to the three judges of the king's bench, but by the king's writ only: and the {{question}} being thereupon raised, it was decided that a commission in addition to the writ was required for the appointment of a justice of assize. Baker in his Chronology,' and Hale in his ‘Pleas of the Crown,' says that on the trial of Walter Walker for treason in 1460, for having <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son, 'Tom, if thou behavest thyself well, I will make thee heir to the Crown' i.e. of the Crown Inn, of which he was landlord, Billing ruled a conviction, and Lord Campbell accepts the story. But it would seem from the report of the judgment of Chief-justice Bromley in the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, 17 April 1554, that the judge at that trial was John Markham, afterwards chief justice next before Billing, and that he directed an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|Horthy clearly saw {{his country}} as trapped between two {{stronger}} powers, {{both of them}} dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could — not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide yearning to recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance. The {{means by which the}} regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged. Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one – largely due, he <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.|$|E

Gittings remembered, [...] "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people." [...] The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the pickets at a press conference.

His decision to commit suicide was sealed when he learned that the Soviets had indicted him for war crimes, specifically the deaths of 577,000 people in concentration camps in Latvia and the deportation of 175,000 others as slave labor. He shot himself in the head in a forest on 21 April 1945. The site of the event, between Duisburg and the village of Lintorf, is today part of the city of Ratingen.|$|E
