5000|$|Rossignol (Australia, 1993): Named for Skis Rossignol, {{this was}} a three-door V8i painted in Caprice blue-green {{metallic}} and fitted with a <b>ski</b> <b>rack.</b> It was also fitted with rub strips, wheel arch protectors, and other items that were optional on the base models.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{principle}} behind the rack lock is as follows: To begin, skis are placed in the <b>ski</b> <b>rack,</b> and a pin is used to fix them into place so they cannot be removed. The rack lock then ensures that the pin cannot be removed by anyone other than the owner. Rack locks are always fastened with a key.|$|E
5000|$|The Ski Country Special was {{a region}} specific, dealer promotional package {{available}} {{in the winter of}} 1967 and was not limited to the Mustang line. The combination of features identifying a Ski Country Special were: a <b>ski</b> <b>rack,</b> [...] "coffee bar" [...] (luggage rack), a limited slip axle, a unique emblem and two snow tires.

50|$|Harriet Carter Gifts {{started as}} a home based mail order {{business}} in 1958. The kitchen served as the office and the Carter children helped their mother fulfill orders. The company found its first success selling five different styles of decorative wood switch-plate covers which were hand cut and stained in the family's basement. Besides switch-plate covers, the first catalog also featured products such {{as a set of}} Peter Rabbit prints, a federal eagle mirror, a teak desk caddy, a <b>ski</b> <b>rack,</b> a medieval wall lamp, and canned candles molded to look like fresh vegetables.|$|E

5000|$|A {{customized}} show car {{was displayed}} along production models during the 1966 automobile show circuit, the snow- and ski-themed Rambler St. Moritz station wagon. The wagon with three rows of seats featured tinted rear side [...] "observation" [...] windows that curved {{up and over}} the roof. The {{less than half of the}} original metal roof remaining over the cargo area was finished by a polished metal band and equipped with special <b>ski</b> <b>rack.</b> The exterior was a light ice-blue pearlescent paint, while the car's dark blue interior featured Corfam upholstery with a metallic embroidered snowflake in each seat back.|$|E
50|$|Rack locks {{are another}} form of lock common at many European and American ski resorts. They provide {{a high level of}} {{security}} and are generally smaller and more convenient than either cable or tether locks. One of the downfalls of rack locks are that they must be used in conjunction with certain types of <b>ski</b> <b>racks</b> which are not found at all ski resorts. Another is that they only work at locations where these racks are located meaning less freedom.|$|R
50|$|As {{the network}} {{expanded}} and trains were needed for longer journeys, 9 trains of the Desiro Classic class were bought in 2000 from Siemens Transportation Systems. These are classified by Deutsche Bahn as class 642. These were comfortable trains with good upholstery with {{seat in a}} 2+2 formation, in the first class compartment the seats were in a 1+2 formation. Desiros were fitted with on-board ticket machines and <b>ski</b> <b>racks.</b> A second series of 15 were ordered in 2002. The first series were fitted with two 275 kW motors and the second series had two 315 kW motors and wheelchair friendly access. Desiros are scheduled to run on lines VB 3, VB 3, VB 4, half of operations on VB 2 and on the trilex lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{light blue}} back {{lighting}} {{introduced in the}} third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States. For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors {{as well as a}} rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats. The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus <b>ski</b> <b>racks,</b> under dash lights, headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994-97) Honda Accord. It also shares many suspension components with the 5th generation Prelude's that are not equipped ATTS system.|$|R
5000|$|Baxter {{searches}} for funding elsewhere {{and finds a}} friendly banker in the next town named Mr. Wainwright (George Kirkpatrick) who is interested in Baxter's venture. Wainwright agrees to meet with Baxter at a ski lodge — Baxter, not {{willing to make the}} same mistake as he did with Ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. Wainwright, taking Baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called [...] "Nightmare Alley." [...] Faking an injury, Baxter convinces Wainwright to start without him. However, after knocking down a <b>ski</b> <b>rack,</b> Baxter is shoved by an irate skier, sending him down the run anyway. After quite a few close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, Baxter ends up crashing into a tree. The sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by Baxter's run a fair amount of coverage.|$|E
40|$|Edmonton is {{very lucky}} for many reasons. Light Rail Transit (LRT) and {{extensive}} green space {{are just two}} reasons. During the winter months, however, the green belts that surround our neighborhoods and run along our utility corridors become white belts. We’ve seen attempts to battle the cold and recreate warm-weather commuting: increased ped-ways, large malls, heated bus terminals, and other mechanisms. Yet the more we treat winter as something to be accommodated and worked around, the more we retreat, hibernate, and use our cars, the greater our negativity about winter. And so the question remains: How can we shift our thinking around winter and reclaim our abundant public space and corridors {{in a way that}} is inherently meaningful for Edmontonians? What if we could ski to work, or to the LRT? Systems mapping, using rich picture as a design method, helped a group of community enthusiasts understand commuting practices and available green space (white space) in the area. What we found was a vast amount of interconnected white space linked to the train line. The group used causal layered analysis to better understand the systemic causes, worldviews, and mental model underlying why these two transportation systems had never interacted before. As the group dove into an understanding of these two systems, what became clear was a common link around a broader overarching system: winter. The group framed a new mental model for how to tap into this potential. From this premise, a participatory, community based initiative, #Ski 2 LRT, was formed. #Ski 2 LRT launched as an emergent movement that attempted to shift mindsets around three concepts: Winter, cross-country skiing in urban settings and LRT usage. A simple Facebook page was designed and a cross-country <b>ski</b> <b>rack</b> was placed at the Century Park LRT station. What happened next and the unintended ripple effects went beyond the original intention. It was unknown that neighborhood ski enthusiasts felt isolated. Unintentionally, this initiative connected a community and gave like-minded individuals a space to convene. This initiative and shift impacted the identity of the city and a new municipal group called “SkiWay” formed, connecting the ski clubs in the city, alongside urban transportation initiatives, to reinvigorate cross country skiing in the city...|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} Roadblock of the Race, the team member that didn't perform the first Roadblock {{was given a}} single ski of {{specific}} height and binding size, and had to search among thousands of <b>skis</b> on <b>racks</b> for the one that completes the set, then show it to an instructor. Once they had a matching pair, both team members had to ride the Peak 2 Peak Gondola to Blackcomb Peak and {{make their way to}} Momentum Ski Camp. For {{the second part of the}} Roadblock, the participating team member had to ski down a ramp and successfully complete a ski jump into a pool to receive their final clue.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{controls}} a skier {{across a}} white background representing snow on a mountainside. The {{object of the}} game is to ski down an endless slope and avoid the obstacles. The game includes three modes: slalom, free style, and tree slalom. In slalom, players ski between two sets of flags (red and blue) while trying to get the best time. In free style, players <b>ski</b> downhill while <b>racking</b> up points by doing tricks. Tree slalom is slalom with only trees, stumps, and dogs. There is also a [...] "free ski" [...] mode, with no objective. When the player heads past 2000 m, the Abominable Snow Monster appears and starts to chase the player, eating them if it catches them.|$|R
