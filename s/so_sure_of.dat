5|$|Clarke {{began writing}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in 1992; {{ten years later}} she {{submitted}} the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury were <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best-seller list. It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E
25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E
25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} despite the [...] "burden" [...] placed on [...] "Marionette" [...] because of its timing, [...] "by now, the series is <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> its tone, its surging story-telling power, that it more than met its challenges". Tucker believed the show had become [...] "exhilaratingly fearless" [...] by pulling in the many references from literature, movies and other sources, and also thought that Olivia's reaction to the Peter-Fauxlivia relationship [...] "felt right". The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray gave the episode an A, explaining that he felt the episode was [...] "very strong" [...] and [...] "was especially impressed with how Fringe handled the Olivia/Peter relationship". Television Without Pity graded the episode a B. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times called the episode [...] "the perfect epilogue to that first chapter," [...] explaining: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} deflects {{the romantic}} attention of fellow attending Mark Sloan, admitting that she finds him attractive but wishes {{to keep her}} private life separate from her working life. She also develops a friendship with Callie Torres which becomes temporarily strained when Callie is led to believe Hahn has romantic designs on her. Although Hahn laughs off the notion, {{she goes on to}} kiss Callie in front of Sloan, to prove that he couldn't handle a threesome with the two of them, leaving Callie stunned. In the season four finale, Callie initiates a second passionate kiss, which Hahn reciprocates. The two attempt a romantic relationship, but while Erica comes to terms with her sexuality quickly, Callie is not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> herself, and sleeps with Mark Sloan to [...] "make sure". Erica initially forgives her, but eventually decides that she does not want a relationship with Callie while she is still so unsure about her sexuality, and so leaves her post at Seattle Grace.|$|E

500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commander Carrion stated if the United States stopped aid, {{support and}} training, this {{would result in}} the end of the contras {{military}} activities within three months. Asked why he was <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> this, Commander Carrion answered, [...] "Well, because the contras are an artificial force, artificially set up by the United States, that exists only because it counts on United States direction, on United States training, on United States assistance, on United States weapons, on United States everything...Without that kind of support and direction the contras would simply disband, disorganize, and thus lose their military capacity in a very short time".|$|E
2500|$|F. Homes Dudden {{declared}} The Temple Beau as [...] "a {{fairly good}} comedy of intrigue" [...] {{and says that}} [...] "The plot of the comedy, though rather too complicated, is more skilfully constructed than that of Love in Several Masques, {{and some of the}} situations are diverting. One of the best things in the piece is the interview between the deluded Sir Harry [...] young Wilding [...] and Pincet". Robert Hume believed that [...] "Fielding had begun to master the mechanics of intrigue comedy. The results are not wonderful, but they show distinctly more technical competence. Fielding still employs more characters than he can comfortably control [...] but at least he involves them in related complications." [...] Albert Rivero believed that [...] "The initial rejection of The Temple Beau, however, convinced Fielding that his future success would depend on his ability to satisfy the town's taste for less conventional entertainments." [...] Harold Pagliaro describes the play by saying, [...] "Though the dramatic structure of The Temple Beau is improved over that of Fielding's first play, it has some obvious weaknesses. The lovers are too nearly perfect to engage us in what is or ought to be their burdensome complication of distress. They are <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> each other and of themselves that they are unassailable, however threatened by the loss of love, freedom and financial self-sufficiency." ...|$|E
