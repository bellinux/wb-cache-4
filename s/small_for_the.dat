5|$|St. Martin is {{the patron}} saint of Idstein, to whom a Gothic church was {{dedicated}} in 1330. The present building designed by architect Johannes Krahn was consecrated in 1965. It replaced a church built in 1888 in Gothic revival style and dedicated to Mary Magdalene which was too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> congregation growing after World War II.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the cathedral, {{including}} the chapter house, was finished in 1306, {{it was already too}} <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. Bishop John Droxford initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided Lady chapel was added at the east end by 1326. Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and retrochoir beyond. He oversaw the building of Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men who were employed to sing in the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
5|$|Finnhorses {{are popular}} as {{recreational}} riding horses, and well-suited for use at riding schools, trekking, and riding therapy. Of the ten horses currently {{employed by the}} mounted police of Helsinki, two are Finnhorses, though they are considered a bit <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> job. They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase {{the popularity of the}} breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds, they are a highly reliable mount for cross-country riding, particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted. In endurance riding. Uusi-Helinä, ridden by Ritva Lampinen, successfully finished the endurance riding world championship competition in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990, finishing 28th.|$|E
5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily built-up area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street {{of the same name}} remains.|$|E

5|$|The capitol {{contained}} three {{rooms and}} quickly became too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state government, {{which had to}} erect additional office buildings across the street for the state's administration. The lower floor of the statehouse {{was used by the}} Indiana House of Representatives. The upper floor was split into two rooms, one for the Indiana State Senate and another for the Indiana Supreme Court, with a narrow hall between them. The building was abandoned as the capitol in 1824 and was given to Harrison County to use as a courthouse. The old capitol building is still preserved and is now a state historic site.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} four {{separate}} buildings in which North has operated. The first housed just three grades when North opened in 1888. Three {{years later the}} first class graduated in 1891. The building grew to be too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> school and a new building was built, opening in 1896 at a new location. On June 18, 1913 a fire burned down most of the building, forcing a new building to be rebuilt. A new building was built over the destroyed one and was completed in 1914. Later additions were added in 1921, 1923 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|At Hell, there arose a {{disagreement}} {{about where the}} Hell–Sunnan Line should branch from the Meråker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before Hell Station, thus forcing trains to back up from Hell Station before continuing northwards. The station building at Hell was also too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was built at Hell. In Skatval, there was a controversy {{as to whether the}} station should be built at Mæhre or Alstad. Mæhre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta. The station was placed at Mæhre, while a passing loop was built at Alstad.|$|E

5|$|In 1779, the {{congregation}} of Hanley Wesleyan Chapel were {{expelled from the}} chapel for supporting Alexander Kilham. Kilham denounced the Methodist conference for giving too much power to church ministers, at the expensive of the laity; his disagreements led to a schism in the Methodist church and his founding of the Methodist New Connexion. In Hanley, the New Connexion congregation, foremost led by William Smith, Job Meigh and George and John Ridgway, initially met {{in the house of}} one of its prominent members, and then acquired a coach-house at the corner of Albion Street that was converted into a meeting house. During the following year the first chapel was built on the site with seating for 600people. It was formally opened by Wiliam Thom, the first president of the New Connexion, and Alexander Kilham, its secretary. This chapel {{was the head of the}} Hanley Circuit, and by 1812 this Circuit was the strongest in the New Connexion. During the previous year the chapel had been expanded to seat 1,000. It was still too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> size of {{the congregation}} and was demolished and replaced by the present chapel in 1819.|$|E
5|$|The Doughnut {{was already}} too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> number of GCHQ staff at its completion, as a vast {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} employees had occurred {{as a consequence of the}} September 11 attacks in 2001. The staff numbered almost 6,500 by 2008. The addition of a two-storey office block and a three-storey car park to the Doughnut was proposed in 2008, but eventually suspended in 2011. The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ's former site at Oakley. Though it was initially felt that the Doughnut would be adequate for the new staff, 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the 'Gloucestershire area'. The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused 'annoyance' among local residents in Benhall. It was believed that the arrival of new staff may have further affected local parking but GCHQ stated the presence of the new employees would have been offset by redundancies.|$|E
5|$|The Wii U version {{released}} on March 30, 2013. The beta test began on March 5. A port for Microsoft Windows was {{released on}} September 26. Ports to both the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Nintendo Switch were announced as being in development in August 2016. These ports will both be released in 2017; the PS4 version will release on August 17, and the Switch version on September 21, 2017. With {{the announcement of the}} Switch version, Square Enix offered players the option of switching their characters and progress to the Switch version. In addition to the standard home console releases, versions for potable and mobile platforms have been released that rely on cloud streaming, needing an internet connection to function. A version for Android and iOS was co-developed by Square Enix with NTT DoCoMo and Ubitus: NTT DoCoMo's dGame service was used as the release platform, while Ubitus' cloud technology was used for the streaming. It released on December 16, 2013. A second version was developed for the 3DS, using a similar streaming function to the mobile versions. This version released on September 4, 2014. On release, the 3DS version suffered from multiple technical problems, including issues with logging in, frequent maintenance periods, disconnection issues, poor sound quality, and the game's native text font being too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 3DS screen. The negative feedback caused Square Enix to temporarily stop shipments so they could fix the issues.|$|E

30|$|Third, the {{standard}} deviations of the simulated results are relatively <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Whittle estimates than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> power analyses.

Thus, it would appear {{on the basis of}} their smaller variation (coupled with the reduced inflationary bias with larger vectors) that the Whittle estimate is a more trustworthy approach to the study of long-range dependence in this context. Moreover, the smaller size of {{the standard}} deviations makes it use more appropriate <b>for</b> <b>smaller</b> samples, as we will see in Study 5.|$|R
30|$|We also {{observed}} that, LO-refinement improves the reconstruction more significantly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> subunit than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> large subunit (Table  1).

5|$|Out of {{a desire}} to have four trains {{regularly}} running at once each day on the DRR, in the mid-1990s the Disneyland park began to search for an additional narrow-gauge steam locomotive to add to the railroad's rolling stock. One such locomotive was acquired from Bill Norred in 1996 in exchange for the combine car and four coaches from the DRR's retired Retlaw 1 passenger train set, but after the park received it, the new locomotive was deemed to be too large for the DRR's operations. It was then sent to the Walt Disney World Railroad in the Magic Kingdom park of Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, where the locomotive was dedicated, despite being too <b>small</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> railroad's operations, and named after Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ward Kimball. Still needing a fifth locomotive for the DRR, the park traded the Ward Kimball locomotive in 1999 to the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad in the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, for a new locomotive suitable for the railroad. Named Maud L., the locomotive was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1902 and was originally used to haul sugar cane at the Laurel Valley Sugar Plantation in Louisiana owned by the Barker and Lepine Company. After arriving in Disneyland, the Maud L., later renamed Ward Kimball like the locomotive for which it was traded, was given a new cab built by Disney and a new boiler built by Hercules Power, which was subcontracted by Superior Boiler Works. Due to budget issues, the restoration of the locomotive was suspended not long after its arrival, and its parts were planned to be placed in long-term storage in late 2003. The Ward Kimball locomotive's restoration efforts were resurrected soon after, when it was decided that its addition to the DRR would be incorporated into the celebration of Disneyland's fiftieth anniversary in July 2005. In late 2004, Boschan Boiler and Restorations led by Paul Boschan, a former roundhouse manager and engineer at the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad in Felton, California, was awarded the contract to complete the restoration of the Ward Kimball. The restoration work performed included installing new driving wheels, attaching a new smokebox door, and applying gold-leaf silhouettes of Kimball's Jiminy Cricket character {{on the sides of the}} headlamp. The Ward Kimball locomotive, which entered service on June 25, 2005, became the DRR's No. 5 locomotive, and on February 15 the following year, John Kimball, the son of Ward Kimball, who died in 2002, christened the locomotive during its dedication ceremony.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} organo-metallic {{complexes}} of 8 -hydroxyquinoline of copper, manganese and zinc {{were used as}} lubricant additives. The tribological tests were performed using four-ball machine. Test balls were chrome alloy bearing steel, with diameter 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in.). Dependence of friction coefficient and wear scar diameter on applied load was tested. Due to the obtained results one can conclude that addition of metal 8 -hydroxyquinolinate improves anti-wear properties of the lubricant, because the wear scar diameter is significantly <b>smaller</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> composition containing organo-metallic complex than for lithium grease. Moreover, the results revealed that <b>for</b> high loads <b>the</b> wear scar diameter was <b>smallest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> composition with the copper additive...|$|R
