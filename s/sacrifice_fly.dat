5|$|The Cardinals scored one run in {{both the}} second and third innings on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Mike Matheny to score Jim Edmonds and a home run to right field by Walker, respectively. However, {{in the bottom of the}} third, the Red Sox scored three runs after seven {{consecutive}} batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren came in from the Cardinals' bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.|$|E
5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Mantilla. Don Demeter pinch hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three {{successive}} walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an Alex Rodriguez walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by a two-run home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
5|$|After {{six innings}} of {{allowing}} no earned runs – {{which gave him}} a total of 13 innings against the Yankees and Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a scoreless seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.|$|E
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by five runs, the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler grounded out to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, Davis {{was elected}} to start the 2013 All-Star Game, his first ever appearance. He was the leading vote-getter with 8,272,243 votes. Davis was also chosen to {{participate}} in the Home Run Derby for the first time, by American League captain Robinson Canó. Davis advanced to the second round and hit a total of 12 home runs. However, a blister broke on his hand, leaving him unable to hit enough homers to advance to the third and final round. At the All-Star Game the next night, July 16, 2013, Davis went 1-3, with a fly out, a single and a strikeout. Davis's single against Patrick Corbin advanced Miguel Cabrera to third, where he would score the game's first run on José Bautista's <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down. Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski got up, he bumped into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in a}} World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b> Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game on a home run in the ninth inning.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{responded in}} the top of the 9th, scoring their only runs of the game. Kevin Tapani allowed {{successive}} singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to load the bases. Bonds came to bat with the bases loaded for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> and Javier advanced to third base. Rod Beck entered and got successive outs by Jeff Kent, which scored Javier, and Joe Carter to end the game 5–3 for the Cubs.|$|E
5|$|The game {{then became}} a pitcher's duel; Maglie and Newcombe did not allow a hit in {{the third or fourth}} innings. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled on a bunt, and Thomson hit a double, but the score {{remained}} 1–0 through five innings. Duke Snider singled in the sixth inning, but was caught stealing second. Neither team got another hit until the seventh inning. Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin led off the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E

5|$|The series {{then moved}} to Shibe Park in Philadelphia for Game 3, where Martin had two hits, {{including}} a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove. In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to Earnshaw, 3-0. Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with two singles, a home run and a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> as the Cardinals triumphed 5-1. Although he was held hitless {{in the final two}} games of the series, he made an impressive catch to extinguish an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman, leading to the only death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey.|$|E
5|$|The Astros' Joe Niekro retired the Dodgers {{in order}} {{in the first and}} second innings. The Astros added to their lead {{in the top of the}} third as Cedeño singled, stole second (after Cruz had been caught {{stealing}} earlier in the inning), and scored on Art Howe's home run to make the game 4–0. Niekro allowed two successive singles to lead off the bottom of the inning, but proceeded to retire three straight Dodgers without allowing either runner to score. The Astros further added to their lead in the fourth, as Puhl singled on a bunt to third base and then stole second and third base while Cabell batted. Both he and Morgan walked to load the bases with one out. Puhl scored on a Cruz <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> Cedeño walked to re-load the bases, and finally a Howe single gave the Astros another two runs to make the game 7–0.|$|E

5|$|The Reds won Game 3 after scoring seven {{runs in the}} top of {{the third}} inning off of Mike Moore. Pitcher Tom Browning earned the win for Cincinnati, as the game ended at a score of 8–3. The Athletics took a lead in Game 4, as Carney Lansford hit a single that scored Willie McGee from second base. In the eighth inning, however, the Reds loaded the bases after singles by Barry Larkin and Herm Winningham, and an error that allowed Paul O'Neill to reach base. Larkin scored on a groundout and Winningham scored on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> to give Cincinnati the lead, 2–1. The lead held, as Myers came in for Rijo after one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Reds became World Series {{champion}}s. Bates did not play in either game. As with all players on the World Series champion Reds, Bates received a World Series ring and visited the White House.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first when}} Matsui hit a two-run home run with Rodriguez on base after a walk. The Phillies {{responded with a}} triple by Ruiz, who scored on a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Rollins {{in the top of}} the third inning. Matsui added to the Yankee lead with a bases-loaded single in the bottom of the inning, scoring Jeter and Damon. Martínez was {{relieved}} after four innings by Durbin, who allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who later scored on a Teixeira single. Durbin hit Rodriguez and was relieved by Happ after recording one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E
5|$|The game {{remained}} tied through nine innings, forcing extra innings. There too {{the game}} stayed tied until {{the top of}} the 13th inning when Giles singled off of Jorge Julio and scored on a home run by Scott Hairston. Ramón Ortiz relieved Julio and no further runs scored in the inning, but the Padres entered the bottom of the 13th with an 8–6 lead. The Padres brought in Trevor Hoffman to secure the game and a wild-card victory. However, Hoffman blew the save, allowing doubles to Matsui and Tulowitzki and a triple to Holliday which tied the game 8–8. Hoffman then intentionally walked Todd Helton leaving baserunners at first and third base. Carroll then hit a line drive to right fielder Brian Giles. Holliday tagged up at third and slid headfirst on a close play at home plate. Home plate umpire Tim McClelland ruled Holliday safe on the <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> and the Rockies won the game 9–8.|$|E
