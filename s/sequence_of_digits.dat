25|$|Despite the {{essential}} role of digits in describing numbers, {{they are relatively}} unimportant to modern mathematics. Nevertheless, {{there are a few}} important mathematical concepts that make use of the representation of a number as a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a basic digital system, a numeral is a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits,</b> {{which may}} be of {{arbitrary}} length. Each position in the sequence has a place value, and each digit has a value. The value of the numeral is computed by multiplying each digit in the sequence by its place value, and summing the results.|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} number is a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> {{assigned to a}} fixed-line telephone subscriber station connected to a telephone line or to a wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) or other private networks.|$|E

500|$|The <b>digits</b> <b>of</b> [...] have no {{apparent}} pattern and have passed tests for statistical randomness, including tests for normality; {{a number of}} infinite length is called normal when all possible <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> (<b>of</b> any given length) appear equally often. The conjecture that [...] is normal has not been proven or disproven.|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, {{a normal}} number {{is a real}} number whose {{infinite}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> in every positive integer baseb is distributed uniformly {{in the sense that}} each of the b digit values has the same natural density1/b, also all possible b2pairs of digits are equally likely with densityb−2, all b3triplets of digits equally likely with densityb−3, etc.|$|E
25|$|Credit cards have {{a printed}} or {{embossed}} bank card number {{complying with the}} ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. The card number's prefix, called the Bank Identification Number, is the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> {{at the beginning of}} the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the usual}} decimal {{representation}} of whole numbers gives every nonzero whole number a unique representation as a finite <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits,</b> {{beginning with a}} non-zero digit. However, when decimal representation {{is used for the}} rational or real numbers, such numbers in general have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.|$|E

5000|$|Numbers {{consisting}} <b>of</b> long <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> can be {{made more}} readable by separating them into groups, preferably groups of three, separated by a small space. For this reason, ISO 31-0 specifies that such groups <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> should never be separated by a comma or point, as these are reserved for use as the decimal sign.|$|R
500|$|However, {{there are}} mathematically {{coherent}} ordered algebraic structures, including various {{alternatives to the}} real numbers, which are non-Archimedean. Non-standard analysis provides a number system with a full array of infinitesimals (and their inverses). A. H. Lightstone developed a decimal expansion for hyperreal numbers in (0, 1)∗.

For the purpose of discussing 0.999..., the integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives, so a decimal expansion has the form ...|$|E
500|$|If a {{real number}} x {{is known to}} lie in the closed {{interval}} [...] (i.e., it is {{greater than or equal}} to 0 and less than or equal to 10), one can imagine dividing that interval into ten pieces that overlap only at their endpoints: , , , and so on up to [...] The number x must belong to one of these; if it belongs to [...] then one records the digit [...] "2" [...] and subdivides that interval into , , ..., , [...] Continuing this process yields an infinite sequence of nested intervals, labeled by an infinite <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> b0, b1, b2, b3, ..., and one writes ...|$|E

Any random <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the infinite monkey theorem. [...] Thus, because the sequence of 's digits passes statistical tests for randomness, it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non-random, such as a sequence of six consecutive 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of [...] This is also called the [...] "Feynman point" [...] in mathematical folklore, after Richard Feynman, although no connection to Feynman is known.|$|E

2500|$|The decimal {{system has}} been {{extended}} to infinite decimals, for representing any real number, by using an infinite <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> after the decimal separator (see Decimal representation).
