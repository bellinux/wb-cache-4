40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{validity and reliability}} of digitised circle and square spiral drawing for quantifying intention tremor severity and related disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The tremor amplitude was measured as the standard deviation of the drawing velocity of the arm in the radial and tangential direction for circle spiral drawing, and in the horizontal and vertical direction for square spiral drawing. Results were {{compared with those of}} MS patients without tremor and healthy controls, and correlated with clinical assessments of tremor severity and arm functionality including Fahn's tremor rating scale, Test d’Evaluation des Membres supérieurs des Personnes Agées (TEMPA) and the nine-hole-peg test to examine validity. Comparison of patient's performance between four repeated trials examined short-term test-retest reliability. All digitised <b>spirography</b> variables discriminated between the MS-tremor and both MS-no-tremor and healthy control groups. Validity was also shown by high spearman correlation coefficients between <b>spirography</b> variables and clinical ratings. Tremor appeared to be most profound in the radial and vertical direction during circle and square spiral drawing, respectively.

40|$|Summary. Aim of {{the study}} – to {{establish}} the indications for surgical treatment of the funnel chest. Patients and methods. There was a retrospective and prospective analysis performed of the methods of investigation and treatment of 504 patients operated for the funnel chest {{during the period of}} 35 years (1968 – 2002). In order to make a right diagnosis and to establish the indications for surgical treatment a standard algorithm of investi-gations was prepared: examination, collecting the detailed life history, establishing a type and a degree of deformation, chest and column radiological examination, ECG, <b>spirography</b> and heart ultrasound examination. Results. On basis of physical examination and anamnestic data the most clinical signs and complaints were established. The heart compression was found in preopera-tive X-rays in 476 (94. 4 %) patients, the heart was rotated and dislocated in 441 (87. 5 %) patients. Postoperatively 96. 1 % of patients were free of the heart compression symp-toms and for 71. 8 % the heart rotation has disappeared.

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{physical}} re education {{are used for}} the persons suffering from severe chronic bronchitis. The patients are submitted to three functional cardiopulmonary balances: the two first balances are made before the training period {{in order to see}} the patients' stationary state; the third balance is made after the re education period in order to see the effects obtained. Such balances involve: <b>spirography</b> before and after bronchodilators; measure of the capacity of diffusion in apnea, of the resistance of the air passages and of the specific conductance; a maximal effort tolerance test; a right microcatheterism at rest and at the two stages of the effort; the blood gas is taken off at rest and at the two stages of the effort. Physical training involves three times a week the following exercises: gymnastics, walking, running, ergometric bicycle and rowing.

The number of researches showed decrease in efficacy of some cardiovascular drugs in smokers. Aim. To compare efficacy and safety of selective and non-selective beta–adrenoceptor blockers in smokers and nonsmokers with chronic ischemic disease. Material and Methods. Antianginal efficacy of drugs in patients of both groups was evaluated by burden tests on treadmill, effective doses of bisoprolol and propranolol were adjusted. Results. The result shows that smokers two times more often need prescription of double doses of drugs. Depressed antianginal activity of both beta-adrenoceptor blockers, especially of non-selective propranolol, in smokers was revealed. When evaluating the parameters of <b>spirography,</b> {{it was found that}} non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranol statistically significant decreases figures of bronchial passage, irrespective of the status of smoking. Moreover, with propranol treatment, bigger number of side effects is registered in both groups, demonstrating 30 % more in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Conclusion.

We have seen three patients with diaphragmatic flutter of higher frequency not associated with respiratory disease. The patients presented with longstanding oesophageal belching, hiccups, and retching, respectively. The diagnosis was established by the presence on electromyography of the diaphragm and scalene and parasternal intercostal muscles of repetitive discharges of 9 - 15 Hz. Spirographic tracings, especially those of volume or flow vs time, showed similar high-frequency oscillations superimposed on tidal respiratory movements. Treatment with carbamazepine 200 - 400 mg three times daily led to disappearance or great improvement of flutter and clinical symptoms in all three patients. The phenomenon was not seen in other patients with chronic hiccups or oesophageal belching or in patients without these symptoms who had undergone electromyography or <b>spirography</b> for other reasons.

Clinical disability was assessed by Hoehn and Yahr scale, Northwestern University Disability Scale and Websterscore. All patients were on levodopa substitution therapy and used anticholinergics. Pulmonary {{function was}} investigated by <b>spirography,</b> determination of a maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume curve and, when possible, maximal static mouth pressures were determined. Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow, maximal expiratory flow at 50 % and maximal static mouth pressures were significantly below normal values. Vital capacity, forced inspiratory volume in 1 s and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and vital capacity were relatively normal. Nine patients had upper airway obstruction (UAO) as judged by abnormal values for peak inspiratory flow, the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and peak expiratory flow and the ratio of maximal expiratory and inspiratory flow at 50 %. Flow-volume curves were normal in eight patients; four patients demonstrated flow decelerations and accelerations (type A) and 16 had a rounded off flow-volume curve (type B).

Children {{were divided into two}} groups depending on presence of concomitant chronic tonsillitis (18 patients) or absence of the latter (32 patients). In all cases by the data of <b>spirography</b> in children against chronic tonsillitis in the period between the attacks of the disease there were revealed ventillation disorders in the lungs by obstruction type, this promoted elevation of pressure in the pulmonary artery. Only in this group of patients in 27, 8 % of cases pulmonary arterial hypertension of moderate severity was revealed. By echocardiography data in children with asthma against chronic tonsillitis reliably more often (р< 0, 01) there was revealed decrease of contractile function of myocardium of the left cardiac ventricle; this was caused by the presence of metabolic disturbances in the myocardium in the majority of cases (83, 3 %). These changes were registered on the electrocardiogram in the form of repolarisation changes of the ventricular complex. Presence of concomitant chronic tonsillitis in children with bronchial asthma favored formation of pulmonary hypertension on the one side and worsening of contractile ability of myocardium of the left cardiac ventricle on the other side; this required performing therapeutic-preventive measures for sanation of chronic infectious focus in the nasopharynx to prevent formation of chronic cardiac insufficiency during asthma course...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work was to define impact of comorbid pathology on the increase {{of the risk of}} rehospitalization due to COPD acute exacerbation. Materials and methods. There was carried out retrospective analysis of case histories of patients with COPD exacerbation, hospitalized to the in-patient department over the three years’ period.  Medical history, results of <b>spirography</b> and general clinical investigations on admission to the in-patient department were studied. Results. All patients were allocated in two groups: the first group comprised 112 people (those who have been hospitalized one time) and the second one comprised 19 people (those who have been hospitalized due to COPD exacerbation twice or more times during the three years’ period). It was established that in the group ІІ there were significantly more patients with some or other comorbidity. Cardiovascular pathology, namely ischemic heart disease, was the most prevalent pathology among patients of both (34. 82 ± 4. 50 and 63. 16 ± 11. 07 % correspondingly, р = 0. 019) groups. Patients of the group ІІ suffered more often from diabetes mellitus (р = 0. 039). Conclusions. Prevalent majority of COPD patients, hospitalized due to exacerbation, had at least one more disease. Concomitant cardiovascular pathology was the most prevalent. Presence of even one comorbid state increases the risk of future repeated severe COPD exacerbation, which will require in-patient treatment. Presence of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus are the gravest among the risk factors of future hospitalizations.

40|$|Aim — This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the impact of the features of fractional composition of atmospheric suspensions and toxic heavy metals on external respiration function (ERF) of healthy people and patients with respiratory pathology living in Vladivostok, Russia. Methods — The study of ERF of healthy people and patients with respiratory diseases was conducted by <b>spirography</b> and body plethysmography. Air pollution by suspended particulate matter (SPM; 0 - 700 µm and > 700 µm) and toxic heavy metals was determined by collection of atmospheric precipitation (snow) in place of residence of patients. The effect of SPM on ERF was measured by discriminant analysis. Results — We identified that small (0 - 1 µm) and medium (10 - 50 µm) dispersed fractions impact on total bronchial resistance in healthy people, SPM 50 - 100 µm influence on patency of small and medium-sized bronchi, expiration time; toxic metals (Mn, Cu, Zn) impact on bronchial patency. We revealed that the 0 - 50 µm fractions and metals (Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn) impact on patency of large and medium-sized bronchi and bronchial resistance of patients with chronic catarrhal non-obstructive bronchitis. The impact of SPM and toxic metals on ERF of patients with controlled asthma has not been demonstrated.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} spiral drawing performance {{as an indicator}} of fine motor function, as well as to gain insight into adaptive movement strategies used by people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Seven people with MS, nine younger controls (mean age of 20) and eight older controls (mean age of 40) drew spirals on a graphics tablet at a comfortable speed and size. <b>Spirography</b> (i. e., a subjective visual assessment of the static trace) revealed indications of reduced control of the pen for people with MS. Analysis of the movements showed that people with MS tended to draw the spirals slower and with less pen pressure than controls. All groups increased their speed and pressure along with spiral size, but this increase was much steeper for the controls. MS participants drew spirals with more variability around an ideal trajectory, highlighting fine motor control degradation. MS patients tended to use a smaller scaling ratio, resulting in smaller spirals for a given number of revolutions. The younger and older control groups drew the spirals in a similar manner, and age was not a significant factor in any of the analyses. It is argued that the relatively lower pressure used, and slower, smaller movements (particularly during the more difficult outer sections of the spiral) are in part an adaptive strategy used to reduce movement variability. These results demonstrate the utility of the analysis of spiral movements as an objective technique for assessing motor control degradation, which can compliment the subjective rating based on the static pen trace. As such, it can provide further insight into the biomechanical strategies used when performing fine movements. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

It was established, that additional prescription of S-amlodipine or Nebivolol to Enalapril and standard therapy of COPD during 6 month had strong antihypertensive effect, normalized 24 -hours blood pressure profile, decreased blood pressure loading and subclinical damage indices, such as: pulse blood pressure, heart rate and ASI. Conclusion. Treatment of patients with AH and COPD should be differentiated. In case of prevalence of the clinical, laboratory and instrumental signs of broncho-obsctructive syndrome, presence of subclinical damages and elastic qualities of vessels and endothelial dysfunction in patients with AH and COPD S-amlodipine should be prescribed additionally to Enalapril and basic therapy of CODP. In case of AH and COPD with hypersympatheticotonia, sings of blood pressure loading, increase of pulse BP and tachycardia beta-blocker Nebivolol should be added to the treatment. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: A {{longitudinal}} {{evaluation of}} lung involvement in primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS). METHODS: Eighteen non-smoking women fulfilling the European criteria for primary SS were followed for 55 months (range 26 - 137 mos.). These were consecutive patients with exclusion for current smokers and patients with lung diseases. Every patient underwent clinical examination, chest radiographs and lung function tests (<b>spirography,</b> flow/volume loop and CO lung diffusing capacity measurements). No patient was given any immunosuppressive or mucolytic therapy. RESULTS: Cough, dyspnea on exertion and recurrent bronchitis {{were observed in}} 50, 40 and 20 % of the patients respectively and their frequency did not change with time. Chest radiographs were and remained normal. At presentation, lung volumes and diffusing capacity were in the normal range, whereas expiratory flows in the small airways tended {{to be in the}} low range. With time, the peak expiratory flow (PEF) significantly increased (95. 8 +/- 4. 6 v 103. 5 +/- 4. 6, mean +/- SE, % of predicted, Wilcoxon, p < 0. 05) whereas the lung transfer factor for CO (TLCO) and the transfer coefficient (KCO = TLCO/alveolar volume) decreased (92. 9 +/- 4. 0 v 87. 0 +/- 4. 0 and 89. 7 +/- 2. 4 v 84. 2 +/- 2. 6 respectively, p < 0. 05 for both). The TLCO decrease, corrected for the duration of follow-up, correlated with the titers of IgA circulating immune complexes (CIC) at presentation {{and to a lesser extent}} with the occurrence of cough. CONCLUSION: During the follow-up of these primary SS patients, respiratory symptoms did not change, the recurrent respiratory infection rate was low, and no cases of pulmonary hypertension or lymphoma was observed. The diffusion capacity decrease was associated with IgA CIC titers at presentation. This impairment could contribute to dyspnea during its evolution over a lifetime but is too slight to explain the dyspnea on exertion seen in most of our patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stereotactic}} lesional surgery {{for the treatment}} of tremor in multiple sclerosis was examined in a prospective case-controlled study. Surgery was not undertaken in 33 patients (72 % of 46 cases referred for stereotactic surgery), two of whom died within 4 months of referral. Twenty-four multiple sclerosis patients were included in the study; 13 underwent surgery and were matched against 11 controls on the basis of age, sex, expanded disability system scores (EDSS) and disease duration. Assessments were carried out at baseline/preoperatively, and then 3 and 12 months later; these included accelerometric and clinical ratings of tremor, <b>spirography,</b> handwriting, a finger-tapping test, nine-hole peg test, tremor-related disability, general neurological examination, Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index of general disability, EDSS, a 0 - 4 ataxia scale, Mini-Mental State (MMS) examination, speech and swallowing assessments and grip strength. Postoperative MRI scans demonstrated that tremor could be attenuated by lesions centred on the thalamus in seven cases, on the zona incerta in five cases and in the subthalamic nucleus in one case. Two patients developed hemiparesis and in two cases epilepsy recurred. Two surgical patients and one control patient died between the 3 and 6 months assessments. Both groups had a significant deterioration in EDSS but not Barthel ADL Index scores at 1 year, but the difference between the groups was not significant. Similarly, no differences between the groups' rates of deterioration of speech or swallowing or MMS were found. Significant improvements in contralateral upper limb postural (P 2) and kinetic tremors, spiral scores and head tremor were detected at 3 and 12 months after surgery (but not handwriting or nine-hole peg test performance). Tremor-related disability and finger-tapping speed were also significantly better 12 months after surgery, the latter having significantly worsened for the control group. A 3 Hz 'filter' for postural (P 2) upper limb tremor was detected by accelerometry/spectral analysis above which tremor was always abolished and at or below which some residual tremor invariably remained. Criteria for selecting multiple sclerosis patients for this form of surgery are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{challenge}} for the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the large within- and between-patient variability in symptom profiles {{as well as the}} emergence of motor complications which represent a significant source of disability in patients. This thesis deals with the development and evaluation of methods and systems for supporting the management of PD by using repeated measures, consisting of subjective assessments of symptoms and objective assessments of motor function through fine motor tests (<b>spirography</b> and tapping), collected by means of a telemetry touch screen device. One aim of the thesis was to develop methods for objective quantification and analysis of the severity of motor impairments being represented in spiral drawings and tapping results. This was accomplished by first quantifying the digitized movement data with time series analysis and then using them in data-driven modelling for automating the process of assessment of symptom severity. The objective measures were then analysed with respect to subjective assessments of motor conditions. Another aim was to develop a method for providing comparable information content as clinical rating scales by combining subjective and objective measures into composite scores, using time series analysis and data driven methods. The scores represent six symptom dimensions and an overall test score for reflecting the global health condition of the patient. In addition, the thesis presents the development of a web-based system for providing a visual representation of symptoms over time allowing clinicians to remotely monitor the symptom profiles of their patients. The quality of the methods was assessed by reporting different metrics of validity, reliability and sensitivity to treatment interventions and natural PD progression over time. Results from two studies demonstrated that the methods developed for the fine motor tests had good metrics indicating that they are appropriate to quantitatively and objectively assess the severity of motor impairments of PD patients. The fine motor tests captured different symptoms; spiral drawing impairment and tapping accuracy related to dyskinesias (involuntary movements) whereas tapping speed related to bradykinesia (slowness of movements). A longitudinal data analysis indicated that the six symptom dimensions and the overall test score contained important elements of information of the clinical scales and can be used to measure effects of PD treatment interventions and disease progression. A usability evaluation of the web-based system showed that the information presented in the system was comparable to qualitative clinical observations and the system was recognized as a tool that will assist in the management of patients...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is considered to}} be one of the most widely spread disease in the world. The main peculiarity of COPD is persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with chronic inflammatory process in the airways. Chronic systemic inflammation is considered to play role in forming of arterial hypertension (AH) too. Systemic inflammation in COPD and AH patients is characterized by pathological increasing of neutrophils, macrophages, B- and T- cells, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and others in small airways. This inflammation cells produce a huge amount of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, like interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). At the same time, despite the large number of data on pathogenesis of COPD and AH, it is less known about systemic inflammation and its influence on heart and vessels in patients with combined flow of COPD and AH. Aim. To study peculiarities and links between parameters of systemic inflammation and lesions of heart and vessels in patients with combined course of COPD and AH. Materials and methods. A total of 98 patients with COPD, AH and with combined course of COPD and AH were examined. The patients were divided into 3 groups. The first group was formed by patients with AH (n= 27) the second group was formed by patients with COPD (n= 27), the third group was formed by patients with combined course of COPD and AH (n= 44). Control group was formed from healthy persons of the same age and sex (n= 20). All patients underwent <b>spirography,</b> echocardiography, ultrasound measurement of common carotid artery intimal-medial thickness and estimation of endhothelium-dependent vasodilatation. ELISA method was used to measure serum concentrations of IL- 6 and TNF-α. Immunoturbidimetric method was used to measure C-reactive protein (CRP). Results. Patients with combined course of COPD and AH had higher levels of IL- 6 (p< 0, 01), TNF-α (p< 0, 01) and CRP (p< 0, 001) comparing with first, second and control group. The correlation links between CRP and end-diastolic diameter of left ventricle (R=+ 0, 53; p< 0, 05), left ventricle mass (R=+ 0, 45; p< 0, 05) and fractional area change of right ventricle (R=- 0, 40; p< 0, 05) were found. Also, there were a correlations between IL- 6 and thickness of right ventricle (R=- 0, 38; p< 0, 05) and left ventricle (R=- 0, 39; p< 0, 05). The concentration of serum IL- 6 correlated with vascular intima-media thickness in right (R=+ 0, 42; p< 0, 05) and left (R=+ 0, 39; p< 0, 05) common carotid artery. The level of TNF-α was associated with vascular intima-media thickness in right (R=+ 0, 44; p< 0, 05) and left (R=+ 0, 42; p< 0, 05) common carotid artery. Conclusion. Patients with combined course of COPD and AH have increased levels of systemic inflammation biomarkers – C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. The significant correlation links between systemic inflammation biomarkers and systolic, diastolic parameters of left and right ventricle and vascular intima-media thickness were found...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{importance}} of psychosocial {{factors in the}} management of bronchial asthma (BA) is discussed in clinical guidelines, including in international and national clinical guidelines. However, a specific evaluation of their role as a cause of poor asthma control in susceptible patients is required. Aim. Assessment of psychological health of women with different levels of asthma control. Materials and methods. The study included 108 women with asthma observed in Saratov center for Allergology who were stratified into 3 groups according to the control level (good, partial, uncontrolled, according to GINA). In establishing a diagnosis of asthma, standard methods were used (medical history, symptoms, <b>spirography).</b> To assess the level of control, ACQ- 5 (Asthma Control Questionnaire 5 items-self-administered) was used, to assess the quality of life, questionnaires AQLQ-S (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire S); SF- 36 (36 -ltem MOS Short-Form Health Survey), a standardized and validated Russian version of the women’s health questionnaire WHQ (Women’s Health Questionnaire) were used; for psychological diagnosis and evaluation of social and personal competencies that contribute to the preservation and improvement of human health (the intellectual, personal, emotional, physical, social, creative, spiritual aspects), integrated multimodal questionnaire was used. The comparison was conducted with a control group of men with bronchial asthma, comparable in age and level of control. Results. Women with poorly controlled asthma had worse performance of AQLQ-S (combined median score of 3, 43 instead of 5, 13 in the group of good control; p < 0, 05); all scales of the SF- 36, including the general condition (43, 48 against 55, 07), role of physical (25, 93 against 57, 76) and emotional problems (43, 83 against 64, 37); at p < 0. 05. According to the WHQ questionnaire (the inverse relationship: the higher the score, the lower the quality of life) in the group with poor control there is a high level of depression (mean 0, 36 versus 0, 24; p < 0, 05); physical health problems are marked (0, 47 against 0, 27; p < 0, 05). There is a very low selfestimation of their attractiveness in BA (0, 71 and 0, 64 for bad and good control, respectively). According to the integrated multimodal questionnaire, in both men and women with asthma almost identical results were obtained on the scales sensitive to manifestations of anxiety-depressive symptoms, emotional balance, scales of emotional skills, correlating with severe alexithymia and low capacity for reflection. Among women the proportion of individuals with high scores of intellectual functioning, strong-willed competence, goal-setting, and ability of making contacts was higher. Conclusion. The severity of asthma and disease control are closely linked with the psychological condition of the patient. Psychological dysfunctions are correlated with suboptimal BA control. It is important to understand psychological differences in women and to educate patients in both effective BA control and in establishing individualized asthma management strategies. There is a need for a multidisciplinary approach aimed at the identification and effective correction of asthma. The study of the psychological characteristics of personality and motivational sphere of the patient can help to optimize therapy, improve monitoring and prognosis of the disease.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether spirography-based objective measures {{are able to}} effectively characterize the severity of unwanted symptom states (Off and dyskinesia) and discriminate them from motor state of healthy elderly subjects. Background: Sixty-five patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 10 healthy elderly (HE) subjects performed repeated assessments of <b>spirography,</b> using a touch screen telemetry device in their home environments. On inclusion, the patients were either treated with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel or were candidates for switching to this treatment. On each test occasion, the subjects were asked trace a pre-drawn Archimedes spiral shown on the screen, using an ergonomic pen stylus. The test {{was repeated three times}} and was performed using dominant hand. A clinician used a web interface which animated the spiral drawings, allowing him to observe different kinematic features, like accelerations and spatial changes, during the drawing process and to rate different motor impairments. Initially, the motor impairments of drawing speed, irregularity and hesitation were rated on a 0 (normal) to 4 (extremely severe) scales followed by marking the momentary motor state of the patient into 2 categories that is Off and Dyskinesia. A sample of spirals drawn by HE subjects was randomly selected and used in subsequent analysis. Methods: The raw spiral data, consisting of stylus position and timestamp, were processed using time series analysis techniques like discrete wavelet transform, approximate entropy and dynamic time warping in order to extract 13 quantitative measures for representing meaningful motor impairment information. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of the quantitative measures into 4 principal components (PC). In order to classify the motor states into 3 categories that is Off, HE and dyskinesia, a logistic regression model was used as a classifier to map the 4 PCs to the corresponding clinically assigned motor state categories. A stratified 10 -fold cross-validation (also known as rotation estimation) was applied to assess the generalization ability of the logistic regression classifier to future independent data sets. To investigate mean differences of the 4 PCs across the three categories, a one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons was used. Results: The agreements between computed and clinician ratings were very good with a weighted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) coefficient of 0. 91. The mean PC scores were different across the three motor state categories, only at different levels. The first 2 PCs were good at discriminating between the motor states whereas the PC 3 was good at discriminating between HE subjects and PD patients. The mean scores of PC 4 showed a trend across the three states but without significant differences. The Spearman’s rank correlations between the first 2 PCs and clinically assessed motor impairments were as follows: drawing speed (PC 1, 0. 34; PC 2, 0. 83), irregularity (PC 1, 0. 17; PC 2, 0. 17), and hesitation (PC 1, 0. 27; PC 2, 0. 77). Conclusions: These findings suggest that spirography-based objective measures are valid measures of spatial- and time-dependent deficits and can be used to distinguish drug-related motor dysfunctions between Off and dyskinesia in PD. These measures can be potentially useful during clinical evaluation of individualized drug-related complications such as over- and under-medications thus maximizing the amount of time the patients spend in the On state...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether advanced visualizations of spirography-based objective measures {{are useful in}} differentiating drug-related motor dysfunctions between Off and dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Background: During {{the course of a}} 3 year longitudinal clinical study, in total 65 patients (43 males and 22 females with mean age of 65) with advanced PD and 10 healthy elderly (HE) subjects (5 males and 5 females with mean age of 61) were assessed. Both patients and HE subjects performed repeated and time-stamped assessments of their objective health indicators using a test battery implemented on a telemetry touch screen handheld computer, in their home environment settings. Among other tasks, the subjects were asked to trace a pre-drawn Archimedes spiral using the dominant hand and repeat the test three times per test occasion. Methods: A web-based framework was developed to enable a visual exploration of relevant spirography-based kinematic features by clinicians so they can in turn evaluate the motor states of the patients i. e. Off and dyskinesia. The system uses different visualization techniques such as time series plots, animation, and interaction and organizes them into different views to aid clinicians in measuring spatial and time-dependent irregularities that could be associated with the motor states. Along with the animation view, the system displays two time series plots for representing drawing speed (blue line) and displacement from ideal trajectory (orange line). The views are coordinated and linked i. e. user interactions in one of the views will be reflected in other views. For instance, when the user points in one of the pixels in the spiral view, the circle size of the underlying pixel increases and a vertical line appears in the time series views to depict the corresponding position. In addition, in order to enable clinicians to observe erratic movements more clearly and thus improve the detection of irregularities, the system displays a color-map which gives an idea of the longevity of the <b>spirography</b> task. Figure 2 shows single randomly selected spirals drawn by a: A) patient who experienced dyskinesias, B) HE subject, and C) patient in Off state. Results: According to a domain expert (DN), the spirals drawn in the Off and dyskinesia motor states are characterized by different spatial and time features. For instance, the spiral shown in Fig. 2 A was drawn by a patient who showed symptoms of dyskinesia; the drawing speed was relatively high (cf. blue-colored time series plot and the short timestamp scale in the x axis) and the spatial displacement was high (cf. orange-colored time series plot) associated with smooth deviations as a result of uncontrollable movements. The patient also exhibited low amount of hesitation which could be reflected both in the animation of the spiral as well as time series plots. In contrast, the patient who was in the Off state exhibited different kinematic features, as shown in Fig. 2 C. In the case of spirals drawn by a HE subject, there was a great precision during the drawing process as well as unchanging levels of time-dependent features over the test trial, as seen in Fig. 2 B. Conclusions: Visualizing spirography-based objective measures enables identification of trends and patterns of drug-related motor dysfunctions at the patient’s individual level. Dynamic access of visualized motor tests may be useful during the evaluation of drug-related complications such as under- and over-medications, providing decision support to clinicians during evaluation of treatment effects as well as {{improve the quality of life}} of patients and their caregivers. In future, we plan to evaluate the proposed approach by assessing within- and between-clinician variability in ratings in order to determine its actual usefulness and then use these ratings as target outcomes in supervised machine learning, similarly as it was previously done in the study performed by Memedi et al. (2013) ...|$|E
