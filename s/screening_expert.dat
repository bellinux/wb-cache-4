The nurse hands the patient a laptop computer. Using knowledge-based questioning, subjective complaints are collected directly from the patient. The questions are response driven. Simultaneous analysis of the pattern of answering also determines {{the direction of the}} questioning. If indicated by the patient's answers, standardized published self-rating and self-assessment scales from the medical literature are administered totally unseen by the patient. The patient's complaints are succinctly presented to the physician as he enters the exam room.

Both he and the patient are totally focused on the problem at hand. Limitless potential for enhancing physician productivity is evoked...|$|E
40|$|In August 2012, {{the first}} case of a novel strain of /Theileria orientalis/ (Ikeda) was {{discovered}} in a dairy herd near Auckland, New Zealand. The strain was unusually pathogenic, causing haemolytic anaemia in up to 35 % of animals within an infected herd. In the ensuing months, more cases were discovered in a pattern that suggested wave-like spread down New Zealand’s North Island. Theileria orientalis is a blood-borne parasite of cattle, which is transmitted by the tick vector /Haemaphysalis longicornis/. This tick was known to exist in New Zealand, but although its behaviour and life cycle were known from laboratory experiments surprisingly little was known about its country-wide distribution. Predicting the spread of /T. orientalis/ (Ikeda) for management and economic purposes was therefore complicated by not knowing which {{areas of the country}} would be conducive to transmission, if an infected cow happened to be imported via transportation. The approach to prediction presented here uses a Bayesian probability model of dynamical disease spread, in combination with a separable discrete-space, continuous-time spatial model of tick abundance. This joint model allows inference on tick abundance by combining information from independent disease <b>screening,</b> <b>expert</b> opinion, and the occurrence of theileriosis cases. A fast GPU-based implementation was used to provide timely predictions for the outbreak, with the predictive distribution used to provide evidence for policy decisions...|$|E

After having taught a course on Curriculum Theory and Development (CTD) via {{face-to-face}} instruction to undergraduate students of Basic Education for many years, in the academic years 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13 I taught the same course via e-learning, at the University of the Azores (UA), Portugal. Considering that the full virtualization of a course is still a rare phenomenon at the UA, I decided to use Curriculum Design Research (CDR) to study the development of the above-mentioned online version of the course on CTD, which, from now on, will be designated as CTD-O. CDR usually follows a prototyping approach, whereby tentative versions of the product being developed are evaluated and revised in a systematic way through a combination of different kinds of evaluation criteria and different evaluation techniques. Accordingly, the quality of CTD-O has been evaluated in the light of validity, practicality and effectiveness criteria, through the application of some techniques that are common in CDR (Nieveen, 1997) : micro-evaluation, <b>screening,</b> <b>expert</b> appraisal, and tryout. The outcomes provided some evidence of a slow and resistant adaptation to some principles of the Bologna process, whose implementation has been facilitated by the virtualization of the course...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} how the topic of overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening is framed by experts and to clarify differences and similarities within these frames in terms of problems, causes, values and solutions. Methods: We used a qualitative methodology using interviews with breast <b>screening</b> <b>experts</b> across Australia and applying framing theory to map and analyse their views about overdiagnosis. We interviewed 33 breast <b>screening</b> <b>experts</b> who influence the public and/or policy makers via one or more of: public or academic commentary; senior service management; government advisory bodies; professional committees; non-government/consumer organisations. Experts were currently or previously working in breast screening in a variety of roles including clinical practice, research, service provision and policy, consumer representation and advocacy. Results: Each expert used one or more of six frames to conceptualise overdiagnosis in breast screening. Frames are described as: Overdiagnosis is harming women; Stop squabbling in public; Don’t hide the problem from women; We need to know the overdiagnosis rate; Balancing harms and benefits is a personal matter; and The problem is overtreatment. Each frame contains a different but internally coherent account of what the problem is, the causes and solutions, and a moral evaluation. Some of the frames are at least partly commensurable with each other; others are strongly incommensurable. Conclusions: Experts have very different ways of framing overdiagnosis in breast screening. This variation may contribute to the ongoing controversy in this topic. The concept of experts using different frames when thinking and talking about overdiagnosis might be a useful tool for those who are trying to negotiate the complexity of expert disagreement in order to participate in decisions about screening.

It is not always clear, however, {{what it is that}} communication should be expected to achieve, and why or how this is so. We investigated Australian experts’ opinions on breast screening communication. Our research questions were: 1 What are the views of Australian experts about communicating with consumers on breast screening? 2 How do experts reason about this topic? Methods: We used a qualitative methodology, interviewing 33 breast <b>screening</b> <b>experts</b> across Australia with recognisable influence in the Australian mammographic breast cancer screening setting. We used purposive and theoretical sampling to identify experts from different professional roles (including clinicians, program managers, policy makers, advocates and researchers) with a range of opinions about communication in breast <b>screening.</b> Results: <b>Experts</b> discussed the topic of communication with consumers by focusing on two main questions: how strongly to guide consumers’ breast cancer screening choices, and what to communicate about overdiagnosis. Each expert adopted one of three approaches to consumer communication depending on their views about these topics. We labelled these approaches: Be screened; Be screened and here’s why; Screening is available please consider whether it’s right for you. There was a similar level of support for all three approaches. Experts’ reasoning was grounded in how they conceived of and prioritised their underlying values including: delivering benefits, avoiding harms, delivering more benefits than harms, respecting autonomy and transparency. Conclusions: There is disagreement between experts regarding communication with breast screening consumers. Our study provides some insights into this persisting lack of consensus, highlighting the different meanings that experts give to values, and different ways that values are prioritised. We suggest that explicit discussion about ethical values might help to focus thinking, clarify concepts and promote consensus in policy around communication with consumers. More specifically, we suggest that decision-makers who are considering policy on screening communication should begin with identifying and agreeing on the specific values to be prioritised and use this to guide them in establishing what the communication aims will be and which communication strategy will achieve those aims...|$|R

Total joint arthroplasty patients {{are one of the}} primary target groups for clinical pathway development. Despite the worldwide use of clinical pathways, it is unclear which key interventions multidisciplinary teams select as pathway components, which outcomes they measures and what the effect of this complex intervention is. This literature study is aimed at three research questions: (1) What are the key interventions used in joint arthroplasty clinical pathways? (2) Which outcome measures are used? (3) What are the effects of a joint arthroplasty clinical pathway? Method Systematic literature review using a multiple reviewer approach. Five electronic databases were searched comprehensively. Reference lists were <b>screened.</b> <b>Experts</b> were consulted. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria and critical appraisal, 34 of the 4055 publications were included. Results Joint arthroplasty clinical pathways address pre-admission education, preadmission exercises, pre-admission assessment and testing, admission and surgical procedure, postoperative rehabilitation, minimal manipulation, symptoms management, thrombosis prophylaxis, discharge management, primary caregiver involvement, homebased physiotherapy and continuous follow-up. An overview of target dimensions and corresponding indicators is provided. Clinical pathways for joint arthroplasty could improve process and financial outcomes.

Data Extraction and synthesis: Data extraction was carried out independently and in duplicate. Validity assessment of the chosen trials was carried out {{at the same time as}} data extraction. Discrepancies were discussed and a third reviewer consulted. The author of the primary study was contacted where necessary. The studies were grouped according to treatment type and duration of follow-up. Results: Twenty potentially relevant RCT were identified. Eight were later excluded, leaving 12 trials for analysis. Stabilisation splint therapy (SS) was compared with: acupuncture, bite plates, biofeedback/stress management, visual feedback, relaxation, jaw exercises, non-occluding appliance and minimal/no treatment. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of SS in reducing symptoms in patients with pain dysfunction syndrome (PDS) compared with other active treatments. There was weak evidence to suggest that the use of SS for the treatment of PDS may be beneficial for reducing pain severity, at rest and on palpation, compared with no treatment. Conslusions: There is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of SS for the treatment of temporomandibular PDS. This review suggests the need for further, rigorous RCT that consider the method of allocation and outcome assessment, have large sample size and sufficient duration of follow-up.

40|$|Muir-Torre {{syndrome}} (MTS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} inherited genodermatosis that {{is considered to be}} a phenotypic subtype of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), commonly referred to as Lynch syndrome. We describe the clinical course of a 57 -year-old female patient with MTS. She has a confirmed HMSH 2 mutation. Recently she presented with two nodular lesions. Histologic examination confirmed these lesions to be sebaceous neoplasms. The patient has a history of endometrial and colorectal adenocarcinoma as well as several nonspecific sebaceous lesions throughout her life. She has a confirmed extensive family history of MTS with both male and female family members harbouring either HMLH 1 or HSMH 2 mutations. Affected relatives have presented at different ages throughout their lives with cutaneous neoplasms and visceral malignancies, including malignancies rarely associated with MTS. MTS presents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. The case demonstrates that the management of MTS, a potentially underreported syndrome, requires a multiprofessional approach incorporating vigilance, <b>screening,</b> and <b>expert</b> knowledge for successful diagnosis and potentially improved prognosis for patients and their families.

40|$|Abstract Background Health-policy {{decision}} making is a complex and dynamic process, for which strong evidentiary support is required. This includes scientifically produced research, {{as well as information}} that relates to {{the context in which the}} decision takes place. Unlike scientific evidence, this “contextual evidence” is highly variable and often includes information that is not scientifically produced, drawn from sources such as political judgement, program management experience and knowledge, or public values. As the policy decision-making process is variable and difficult to evaluate, it is often unclear how this heterogeneous evidence is identified and incorporated into “evidence-based policy” decisions. Population-based colorectal cancer screening poses an ideal context in which to examine these issues. In Canada, colorectal cancer screening programs have been established in several provinces over the past five years, based on the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or the fecal immunochemical test. However, as these programs develop, new scientific evidence for screening continues to emerge. Recently published randomized controlled trials suggest that the use of flexible sigmoidoscopy for population-based screening may pose a greater reduction in mortality than the FOBT. This raises the important question of how policy makers will address this evidence, given that screening programs are being established or are already in place. This study will examine these issues prospectively and will focus on how policy makers monitor emerging scientific evidence and how both scientific and contextual evidence are identified and applied for decisions about health system improvement. Methods This study will employ a prospective multiple case study design, involving participants from Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. In each province, data will be collected via document analysis and key informant interviews. Documents will include policy briefs, reports, meeting minutes, media releases, and correspondence. Interviews will be conducted in person with senior administrative leaders, government officials, <b>screening</b> <b>experts,</b> and high-level cancer system stakeholders. Discussion The proposed study comprises the third and final phase of an Emerging Team grant to address the challenges of health-policy {{decision making}} and colorectal cancer screening decisions in Canada. This study will contribute a unique prospective look at how policy makers address new, emerging scientific evidence in several different policy environments and at different stages of program planning and implementation. Findings will provide important insight into the various approaches that are or should be used to monitor emerging evidence, the relative importance of scientific versus contextual evidence for decision making, and the tools and processes that may be important to support challenging health-policy decisions. </p...|$|R
