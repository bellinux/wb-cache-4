2500|$|The {{creators of}} the Centering Prayer {{movement}} trace its roots to the contemplative prayer of the Desert Fathers of early Christian monasticism, to the Lectio Divina tradition of Benedictine monasticism, and to works like The Cloud of Unknowing and the writings of St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross. Advocates of Centering Prayer <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not replace other prayer but encourages silence and deeper connection to God. [...] Also advocates of Centering Prayer say it helps people be more present and open to God. [...] Father Thomas Keating has promoted both Lectio Divina and Centering Prayer.|$|E
2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I {{am not going}} to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not know what to <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{issue with}} the consumer's {{relationship}} with CSR {{is that it is}} much more complex than it first appears. In their paper on the consumer and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme [...] looked into a phenomenon that they termed the [...] "CSR-Consumer Paradox". This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. For instance, a survey by Cohn & Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies. However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, so that {{when it comes down to}} their actual purchase behaviour, CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Internet {{has been}} {{extensively}} used by patient groups to obtain and disseminate information on CCSVI. People with MS often read extensively about the CCSVI theory and its development on Internet sites, and a search for [...] "liberation procedure" [...] in Google as of August 2010 yielded more than 2.5 million hits. The Internet has also been used to advertise places where stenting for CCSVI is performed, and to more generally disseminate all the information on CCSVI. Social media have served patient groups {{in their attempt to}} pressure official bodies to make decisions favoring funding of clinical trials, or the public coverage of stenting and venoplasty as treatments of MS. Likewise, social media have been accused of creating a division between CCSVI supporters and those who <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not work. Indeed, they have been repeatedly used by advocates of the CCSVI theory to attack those who were more critical or cautious, most commonly with accusations of being tainted due to commercial relationships with pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
