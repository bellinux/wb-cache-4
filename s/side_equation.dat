The following results were obtained: RGR, was found to be related to SFR from their positions in the equation, and this might support the suggestion by Masuda (1985) about the close relation of RGR, to SFR. SFR might substantially relate the equation by Masuda (1985) and the equation by Shimojo et al. (1995).

In the year of 2003, the area of severe drought is the smallest. In 2001, the drought is the most serious. The results showed that, the distribution of drought was different in different year.

40|$|Function: LIML computes {{the limited}} {{information}} maximum likelihood estimator {{for a single}} equation linear structural model. To estimate a single equation nonlinear model via LIML, use FIML with unrestricted reduced-form equations for the included endogenous variables (those which appear on the right hand side of the primary equation). Usage: LIML’s form {{is identical to the}} 2 SLS/INST/IV/TSLS command [...] specify a list of instruments and the variables in the equation. LIML determines the list of endogenous variables, included exogenous variables, and excluded exogenous variables by comparing the instrument list with the variables in the equation. If there are no endogenous variables, OLSQ is used and a warning is printed. If the right hand <b>side</b> <b>equation</b> is exactly identified (number of endogenous variables equals number of excluded exogenous variables), LIML is equivalent to 2 SLS, so 2 SLS is used, and a warning is printed. If the equation is underidentified, an error message is printed (just like 2 SLS). Options: FULLER = value used to weight eigenvalue towards zero. The formula used is K = LAMBDA- FULLER/(T-NZ), where K is the K-class constant, LAMBDA is the LIML eigenvalue, T is the number of observations, and NZ is the number of instruments.
