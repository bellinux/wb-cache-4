5000|$|A secondary, non-military {{result of}} the {{neutralization}} of the Six Nations Iroquois in this region was that it created [...] "new" [...] lands to allot to Colonial soldiers after the war in partial payment or reward for their service.

In 1790, the area was divided into 600 acre (2.4 km²) military lots and distributed among Revolutionary War veterans as payment for their services. These early settlers cleared the land for production of hay and small grains such as buckwheat. As New York City grew, a strong market for these products developed, encouraging more intensive agriculture. The farmers prospered until the mid-19th century, when a series of unfortunate events occurred - the popularity of motorized transportation in urban centers (reducing the number of horses to be fed), gradual depletion of the <b>soil</b> <b>resource,</b> and competition from the midwest.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the digital}} era, soil maps come in various digital vector and raster formats {{and are used}} for various {{applications}} in geosciences and environmental sciences. In this context, soil maps are only visualizations of the <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> inventories commonly stored in a Soil Information System (SIS), of which the major part is a Soil Geographical Database. A Soil Information System is basically a systematic collection of complete (values of the target soil variables available for the whole area of interest) and consistent gridded or vector soil property and/or class maps with an attached report, user manual and/or metadata. A SIS is in the most cases, a combination of polygon and point maps linked with attribute tables for profile observations, soil mapping units and soil classes. Different elements of an SIS can be manipulated and then visualized against the spatial reference (grids or polygons). For example, soil profiles {{can be used to}} make spatial prediction of different chemical and physical soil properties. In the case of pedometric mapping, both predictions and simulations (2D or 3D — geographic location plus soil depth) of values are visualized and used for GIS modeling.|$|E

40|$|Rising {{atmospheric}} [CO 2] has {{the potential}} to alter soil carbon (C) cycling by increasing the content of recalcitrant constituents in plant litter, thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because fine root turnover constitutes a large fraction of annual NPP, changes in fine root decomposition are especially important. These responses will likely be affected by <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability and the life history characteristics of the dominant tree species. We evaluated the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO 2] and <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability on the production and chemistry, mycorrhizal colonization, and decomposition of fine roots in an early- and late-successional tree species that are economically and ecologically important in north temperate forests. Open-top chambers were used to expose young trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) trees to ambient (36  Pa) and elevated (56  Pa) atmospheric CO 2. <b>Soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability was composed of two treatments that bracketed the range found in the Upper Lake States, USA. After 2. 5  years of growth, sugar maple had greater fine root standing crop due to relatively greater allocation to fine roots (30 % of total root biomass) relative to aspen (7 % total root biomass). Relative to the low soil resources treatment, aspen fine root biomass increased 76 % with increased <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability, but only under elevated [CO 2]. Sugar maple fine root biomass increased 26 % with increased <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability (relative to the low soil resources treatment), and showed little response to elevated [CO 2]. Concentrations of N and soluble phenolics, and C/N ratio in roots were similar for the two species, but aspen had slightly higher lignin and lower condensed tannins contents compared to sugar maple. As predicted by source-sink models of carbon allocation, pooled constituents (C/N ratio, soluble phenolics) increased in response to increased relative carbon availability (elevated [CO 2]/low <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability), however, biosynthetically distinct compounds (lignin, starch, condensed tannins) did not always respond as predicted. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots was not strongly affected by atmospheric [CO 2] or <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability, as indicated by root ergosterol contents. Overall, absolute changes in root chemical composition in response to increases in C and <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> availability were small and had no effect on soil fungal biomass or specific rates of fine root decomposition. We conclude that root contributions to soil carbon cycling will mainly be influenced by fine root production and turnover responses to rising atmospheric [CO 2], rather than changes in substrate chemistry. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies on}} the effect of {{vegetation}} on soil resources have compared the patterns of soil resources in different land environments. Few studies have compared the spatial pattern of soil resources in different secondary succession stages. Although various studies have evaluated the heterogeneous soil resources patterns caused by vegetation, few have provided high-resolution analyses of heterogeneous <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> patterns on a fine scale, with the exception of trees and shrubs. This study has been performed on four abandoned farms (abandoned for 4, 12, 22, and 50 years) to evaluate the dynamic effect of vegetation on <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> patterns at the scale of herbaceous plants. It was found that dominant species in a vegetation family at a given succession stage will play a primary role in the formation of resource islands. Resource islands developed during vegetative succession and subsequently change the patterns of soil resources. There are different <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> patch sizes and soil parameter patterns on farms abandoned for different periods. A method was developed for this study called the Integration of Geostatistics, Point pattern analysis and Spatial comparison to provide an effective method to research the effect of vegetation on <b>soil</b> <b>resource</b> patterns at a fine scale.
