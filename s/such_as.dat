5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms <b>such</b> <b>as</b> yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs <b>such</b> <b>as</b> antibiotics or industrial chemicals <b>such</b> <b>as</b> 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites <b>such</b> <b>as</b> glutathione and enzymes <b>such</b> <b>as</b> catalases and peroxidases.|$|E

Jazz has been popularized by artists <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E

5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage.

Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
