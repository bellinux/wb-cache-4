25|$|As the new king, Wiglaf gives Beowulf a Norse funeral. Grendel's mother appears {{and gives}} Beowulf a final kiss before his burning ship sinks into the sea. Wiglaf sees the golden horn washed by {{the waves of}} the sea in the sand while Grendel's mother floats in the sea, looking at him seductively. The movie ends ambiguously with Wiglaf holding the horn and <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her, leaving his fate unknown.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Susan {{developed}} retrograde amnesia. The storyline saw Susan slip on some spilt {{milk and}} sustain a minor head injury. After {{she goes to}} sleep, she wakes up and has lost three decades of her life. Woodburne told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison that Susan believes the year is 1972 and the night before was her sixteenth birthday, where she drank too much champagne. She does not recognise her house and thinks she passed out and ended up somewhere else. Susan's family {{take her to the}} hospital, where she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Karl becomes determined to tell her the truth about her condition, while her nephew, Darcy (Mark Raffety), insists they treat her [...] "with kid gloves." [...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's going to be allowed home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up in the bathroom and she sees herself in the mirror {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the evening, the {{disguised}} Loki and Thor {{meet with}} Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her" [...] until catching the terrifying eyes <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because [...] "Freyja" [...] had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.|$|E
60|$|Evan {{was still}} <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> curiously <b>at</b> the beaming and bearded {{creature}} behind him.|$|R

6000|$|... "But," [...] said Flambeau, as {{the priest}} put his cigar {{in his mouth}} again and leaned <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the roof, [...] "suppose {{somebody}} else did use the scissors. Why should somebody else, cutting pieces off his sermon paper, make Quinton commit suicide?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The Bene Gesserit {{become the}} {{consumers}} of Idaho gholas in Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse Dune (1985). [...] However, the gholas are repeatedly assassinated after several years, and the Sisterhood suspect the Tleilaxu. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho will serve, the Bene Gesserit {{believe that the}} Tleilaxu are using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose {{in addition to their}} own. [...] The current ghola survives such an attempt and Miles Teg is able to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho to the ghola, but Duncan can feel that the Tleilaxu planted something else in his mind. When Murbella, an Honored Matre, tries to sexually bond Idaho, he entraps and enslaves her, revealing the Tleilaxu purpose: To conquer the Honored Matres by using a better version of their own sexual techniques. When Murbella tries to bond Duncan, the Tleilaxu's plan comes to fruition, and he becomes aware of the memories of all the other Idaho gholas, though he is also imprinted to her. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from almost all of the Idaho gholas to make this one. Idaho and Murbella are confined to a no-ship on Chapterhouse. [...] There, Idaho trains young men {{to go out into the}} universe and enslave Honored Matres. [...] Duncan also inherits an awkward prescient vision, wherein he sees an old man and woman <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him. Duncan restores the memories of the Miles Teg ghola, and escapes in the no-ship, evading the trap set for him by the strange couple.|$|E
60|$|She gave {{an audible}} gasp, {{and looked at}} me so fearfully that I fell silent, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him over her spectacles. He was <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her, unswerving. She met his eyes for a moment, then took off her glasses. He was white. The male was up in him, dominant. She {{did not want to see}} him too clearly.|$|E
60|$|Some seconds he {{remained}} on his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the whitewashed ceiling {{and listening to}} the patter of the rain against his window. Then, as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection, he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly, {{as you do}} the picture-book. Well, there I was lying, Miss Baker, with {{my little}} eyes wide open. It is {{astonishing}} how much babies see, though people never calculate on their having eyes at all. I was lying on my <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the mantelpiece, on which my mother had left her key-basket." ...|$|R
60|$|The exhibit {{was lying}} on his <b>back</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the roof of the}} berth. By lying {{absolutely}} still and forcing himself to think of purely inland scenes and objects he had contrived to reduce the green in his complexion to a mere tinge. But it would be paltering with the truth to say that he felt debonair. He received Sam with a wan austerity.|$|R
60|$|All {{the hope}} {{remaining}} {{in her life}} was in that question, was in {{her face as she}} searched mine with a terrible scrutiny. And never had I known such an ordeal. It seemed as if I could not answer, and as I stood <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her a smile was forced to her lips.|$|E
60|$|But {{the prince}} saw the {{reflections}} {{of all the}} others, and then made the discovery that the forms of the Ki and the High Ki had become invisible. No one except himself appeared to be standing in the great hall of the Red Rogue's castle! Yet grouped within the glass were the likenesses of all his friends, {{as well as those}} of Lady Seseley and her companions; and all were <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him earnestly, as if imploring him to save them.|$|E
60|$|Godwin gave {{a sigh of}} relief. If Masouda had {{appointed}} to meet her uncle the Arab, at least she must be safe. So it was no voice of hers which seemed to whisper {{his name in the}} darkness of the night when terror had ahold of him--terror, born perhaps of all that he had endured and the shadow of death through which he had so lately passed. Then he looked up, to find Wulf <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the woman behind him, and reproved him, saying that he must keep to the spirit of the bargain as well as to the letter, and that if he might not speak he must not look either.|$|E
60|$|And so we {{will leave}} them. In about half an hour, when the short {{twilight}} was becoming dusk, Mrs. Woodward returned, and found Norman standing alone on the hearthrug before the fireplace. Gertrude was away, and he {{was leaning against the}} mantelpiece, with his hands behind his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> vacancy; but oh! with such an aspect of dull, speechless agony in his face.|$|R
60|$|So Peter scampered over to {{the tall}} pine in which was Blacky's old nest. As he sat with his head tipped <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> it, it struck him that that nest didn't look so old, after all. In fact, {{it looked as if}} it had {{recently}} been fixed up quite like new. He was wondering about this and trying to guess what it meant, when Blacky himself alighted close to the edge of it.|$|R
60|$|It was Obergatz; {{the curse}} {{had told her}} that. From below came no further sound. Had she, then, killed him? She prayed so--with all her heart she prayed it. To be freed from the menace of this loathsome {{creature}} were relief indeed. During all {{the balance of the}} night she lay there awake, listening. Below her, she imagined, she could see the dead man with his hideous face bathed in the cold light of the moon--lying there upon his <b>back</b> <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Syme stood <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the stiff}} face like {{parchment}} and the blank, blue eyes. His {{first thought was}} that the Professor had gone mad, but his second thought was more frightful. After all, what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend? What did he know, except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside Gogol! Was this man's silence a sensational way of declaring war? Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor, who had turned for the last time? He stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence. He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside.|$|E
60|$|I am {{now going}} back to {{my first visit to}} this green retreat; it was in the course of one of those Easter walks I have spoken of, and the way was through Reading and by Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield. On this {{occasion}} I conceived a dislike to Reading which I have never quite got over, for it seemed an unconscionably big place for two slow pedestrians to leave behind. Worse still, when we did leave it we found that Reading would not leave us. It was like a stupendous octopus in red brick which threw out red tentacles, miles and miles long in various directions--little rows and single and double cottages and villas, all in red, red brick and its weary accompaniment, the everlasting hard slate roof. These square red brick boxes with sloping slate tops are built {{as close as possible to}} the public road, so that the passer-by looking in at the windows may see the whole interior--wall-papers, pictures, furniture, and oftentimes the dull expressionless face of the woman of the house, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> you out of her shallow blue eyes. The weather too was against us; a grey hard sky, like the slate roofs, and a cold strong east wind to make the road dusty all day long.|$|E
60|$|During {{the whole}} of our long ride I found the worthy {{sergeant}} a true follower of the excellent Colonel Mackay, for he {{proved to be a}} man of more than ordinary intelligence, and of serious and thoughtful habit. As to the two troopers, they rode on either side of me as silent as statues; for the common dragoons of those days could but talk of wine and women, and were helpless and speechless when aught else was to the fore. When we at last rode into the little village of Gommatch, which overlooks the plain of Sedgemoor, it was with regret on each side that I bade my guardian adieu. As a parting favour I begged him to take charge of Covenant for me, promising to pay a certain sum by the month for his keep, and commissioning him to retain the horse for his own use should I fail to claim him within the year. It was a load off my mind when I saw my trusty companion led away, <b>staring</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me with questioning eyes, as though unable to understand the separation. Come what might, I knew now that, he was in the keeping of a good man who would see that no harm befell him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Follow!" [...] I cried, and at {{the head}} of them groped my way back up the hall, seeking for Quilla. I {{stumbled}} over the dead body of Larico and felt a path round the table. Then suddenly a door <b>at</b> the <b>back</b> of the hall was thrown open and by the grey light which came through the doorway I perceived the last of the ravishers departing. We scrambled across the dais where the golden chair was overthrown and the embalmed Upanqui lay, a stiff and huddled heap upon his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me with jewelled eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face <b>staring</b> straight <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|Such a yell as {{the poor}} wretch uttered ears never heard before. Over he rolled upon {{his back and}} there lay staring with wide eyes, and away scampered the jackass, kicking up his heels and braying so that {{the leaves of the}} trees trembled and shook. For no sooner had he lifted the lid than out leaped a great hideous Genie, as black as a coal, with one fiery-red eye {{in the middle of his}} {{forehead}} that glared and rolled most horribly, and with his hands and feet set with claws, sharp and hooked like the talons of a hawk. Poor Abdallah the fagot-maker lay upon his <b>back</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the monster with a face as white as wax.|$|R

A group of three young women with similar, darkly-colored bathing suits talk at center, ignoring the camera and standing calf-deep in the surf. Farther back, {{a group of young}} men appear to be posing for the camera, while a young boy to the left stands with his hands folded behind his <b>back,</b> <b>staring</b> directly <b>at</b> the viewer. On the sand still farther left, a man in a suit strikes a similar pose, {{standing in front of a}} beached flatboat which bears the title "Venetian".
