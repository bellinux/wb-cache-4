25|$|Asian seiners – In Asia, {{the seine}} netter usually has the {{wheelhouse}} forward {{and the working}} deck aft, {{in the manner of}} a <b>stern</b> <b>trawler.</b> However, in regions where the fishing effort is a labour-intensive, low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail.|$|E
25|$|The first {{purpose built}} <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was {{much larger than}} any other {{trawlers}} then in operation and inaugurated {{the era of the}} 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. Lord Nelson followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a {{circular}} device that was set {{to the side of}} the boat and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose built <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland.

25|$|Capable of {{conducting}} multidisciplinary oceanographic operations {{in support of}} biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Oscar Dyson was commissioned as {{the first of a}} class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to collect data on ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20km/hr).|$|E

Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, <b>stern</b> <b>trawlers,</b> purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|R
2500|$|Side {{trawlers}} {{have the}} trawl deployed {{over the side}} with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, Ross Tiger is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used {{for a longer period}} than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by <b>stern</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums.|$|R

Forester, which had been fishing inside the 12 nmi km limit, was shelled and {{captured}} by the Icelandic gunboat V/s Þór after a 100 nmi km pursuit. C. S. Forester was shelled with non-explosive ammunition after repeated warnings. The trawler was hit by at least two rounds, which damaged the engine room and a water tank. She was later boarded and towed to Iceland. Skipper Richard Taylor was condemned to 30 days of imprisonment and fined £5,000. He was released on bail after the owners paid £2,232. The trawler was also allowed to depart with a catch of 200 tons of fish. Her owners paid a total of £26,300 for the release of the ship.|$|R
5000|$|MS American Monarch is {{a factory}} <b>stern</b> fishing <b>trawler.</b> At over 6,000 GRT, the ship can process 1,200 tons of fish a day. British {{historian}} David Edgerton has noted that: [...] "since the total global catch is 100 million {{tons per annum}} ... 300 of these ships could catch all the fish now caught worldwide".|$|R
40|$|Trawl net is a bag-shaped gear towed through water, {{the mouth}} of which is kept open either by a frame or beam or otter boards and floats or kites and sinkers or weight. Sometimes the opening is {{effected}} by dragging the net with two boats. According to the habitation of fish in sea, trawl net is operated either at the bottom or in the midwater. For fish living in the bottom, bottom trawls are operated. Shrimps, flatfish, sciaenids, ribbonfish, carangids, perches etc. are caught by bottom trawls. For catching pelagic fish such as sardine, silver belly, anchovies, ribbonfish, shallow water mix etc. midwater trawls can be used. In India there are 35, 000 mechanised boats most of which operate bottom trawl. Besides mechanised boats, there are 180 large vessels operated as outrigger trawlers for shrimp and <b>stern</b> <b>trawlers</b> for cuttle fish beyond territorial waters and offshore seas...|$|R

40|$|Even {{though the}} rich and {{variegated}} pelagic fishery resources of our west coast are well known much {{has to be done}} for a judicial and systematic exploitation on a commercial scale. To fill up this lacuna the present paper describes in detail a new design of 10. 5 m four-equal panel mid-water trawl, its rigging and operation from a medium size vessel. Comprehensive comparative efficiency studies of this gear with a 10. 5 m unequal panel mid-water trawl established the superiority of the new gear. From the results based on the mouth opening, resistance and the catch it is opined that this new gear can not only be used on a commercial scale in harvesting the seasonal pelagic fishery, but also as a secondary supporting gear in shrimp fishery in places like Veraval, where there is a commercially exploitable yield of quality fishes like hilsa, pomfret, seer etc., without much modification from conventional <b>stern</b> <b>trawlers...</b>|$|R
