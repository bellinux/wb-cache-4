On 6 April 2009, Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> {{announced that the}} Department of Defense intended to acquire 31 F/A-18s in FY2010. Congress requested the DoD study a further multi-year contract so that a projected fighter shortfall could be averted; in 2006, the Navy was 60 fighters below its validated aircraft requirement. The FY2010 budget bill authorized a multiyear purchase agreement for additional Super Hornets. A multi-year contract was finalized on 28 September 2010, reported as saving $600million over individual yearly contracts, for 66 Super Hornets and 58 Growlers to mitigate a four-year delay in the F-35 program.|$|E

500|$|Russian and Chinese fighter {{developments}} have fueled concern, and in 2009, General John Corley, head of Air Combat Command, stated that {{a fleet of}} 187 F-22s would be inadequate, but <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> dismissed this concern. In 2011, Gates explained that Chinese fifth-generation fighter developments had been accounted for {{when the number of}} F-22s was set, and that the U.S. would have a considerable advantage in stealth aircraft in 2025, even with F-35 delays. In December 2011, the 195th and final F-22 was completed out of 8 test ("EMD" [...] - Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) and 187 operational aircraft produced; the aircraft was delivered to the USAF on 2 May 2012.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the cost of}} a new procurement program, industry officials stated that to merely extend the operating life of the current fleet is a risky choice because it is both less secure and costly to maintain.

[...] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated [...] "I do not believe that the story of VH-71 is over... <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> has not made a convincing case for terminating the program, and there is no alternative helicopter that can satisfy range and payload requirements while still landing on the White House lawn." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's {{shift in}} favor of {{military}} intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates,</b> security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called [...] "convening power" [...] to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state, and {{the wisdom of the}} intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{announced}} in August 2010 that Gates {{was trying to find}} $100 billion in Defense savings through to 2015, in order to in-still a [...] "culture of savings and restraint" [...] in the military. <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> said that [...] "It is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense,". Gates said [...] "As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot expect America's elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job, indeed everything possible, to make every dollar count". [...] These cuts included the closing of the Joint Forces Command, the redundancy of fifty general and admirals, and the removal of 150 senior civilian positions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first test}} flight {{coincided with a}} visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was {{initially}} interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting U.S. delegation.

2500|$|On 16 September 2009, <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> {{announced}} a renewed effort for the KC-X program. [...] The selection {{process will be}} under the Air Force with a [...] "robust oversight role" [...] by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to prevent a repeated failure. [...] On 25 September 2009 the USAF issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) seeking comments for the official tanker replacement RFP. [...] The RFP for a fixed-price contract specified 373 requirements for the new plane, and stated {{that the price of}} each tanker would be adjusted to reflect how much it would cost to operate over 40 years and how well it would meet various war-fighting needs. [...] The initial contract would be for 179 aircraft for $35 billion. [...] Northrop Grumman/EADS team claimed the requirement was advantaging Boeing and threatened to withdraw from the competition on 1 December 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, Defense <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> {{announced}} {{a delay in}} the new generation bomber project that would push it past the 2018 date. This was caused not only by budget considerations, but also by nuclear arms treaty considerations. On 19 May 2009, Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz said that the USAF's focus in the 2010 budget was on [...] "Long-range strike, not next-generation bomber" [...] and will push for this in the QDR. In June 2009, the two teams working on NGB proposals were told to [...] "close up shop". On 1 March 2010, Boeing said that the joint project with Lockheed Martin had been suspended and on 24 June 2010, Lieutenant General Philip M. Breedlove said that the term [...] "next-generation bomber" [...] was dead and that the Air Force {{was working on a}} long-range strike [...] "family" [...] that would draw on the capabilities of systems like the F-35 and F-22 to help a more affordable and versatile bomber complete its missions.|$|E
2500|$|Boeing {{submitted}} {{the final version}} of its proposal on 3 January 2008. On 29 February 2008, the DoD chose the Northrop Grumman/EADS KC-30, over the KC-767. The KC-30 was subsequently designated KC-45A by the Air Force. Boeing submitted a protest to the United States Government Accountability Office on 11 March 2008 and began waging a public relations campaign in support of their protest. On 18 June, following a series of admissions by the Air Force on the flaws in the bidding process, the GAO upheld Boeing's protest and recommended the contract be rebid. On 9 July 2008, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that the Air Force would reopen bidding on the tanker contract. <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> put the contract for the KC-45 into an [...] "expedited recompetition" [...] with Defense Undersecretary John Young in charge of the selection process instead of the Air Force. A draft of the revised RFP was provided to the contractors on 6 August 2008 for comments. By mid-August the revised RFP was to be finalized. However, on 10 September 2008, the U.S. Defense Department canceled the KC-X solicitation.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout early 2011, the CIA {{thought there}} was a good chance it had {{discovered}} the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, and the White House held a final high-level discussion on April 28 about whether to go ahead with a raid to get him, and if so, what kind of mission to undertake. Clinton supported the option to send Navy SEALs in, believing that the U.S. could not afford to ignore this chance and that getting bin Laden was so important that it outweighed any risks. Following the successful May 1–2, 2011, U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden at his hideout compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and the resulting criticism from various Americans that Pakistan had not found, or had let, bin Laden hide in near plain sight, Clinton made a point of praising Pakistan's past record of helping the U.S. hunt down terrorists: [...] "Our counter-terrorism cooperation {{over a number of years}} now, with Pakistan, has contributed greatly to our efforts to dismantle al-Qaeda. And in fact, cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding. Going forward, we are absolutely committed to continuing that cooperation." [...] Clinton then played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead bin Laden, reporting that U.S. allies in the Middle East did not favor the release and agreeing with <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> that such a release might cause an anti-U.S. backlash overseas.|$|E
2500|$|McNamara took {{other steps}} to {{increase}} U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised {{the proportion of}} Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission [...] "to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace {{in any part of}} the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations." [...] McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. After reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by <b>Secretary</b> <b>Gates</b> in 1960), having both report to the secretary of defense through the JCS. The end effect was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it {{under the control of the}} Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense Supply Agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.|$|E
