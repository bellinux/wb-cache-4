40|$|The role of {{vascular}} disorders in {{the pathogenesis of}} dementia has been controversial. Recent studies suggest that <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (Binswanger’s disease), a disorder of white-matter demyelination associated with narrowing of penetrating medullary arteries and arterioles may affect more than 5 % of the population over age 65 years.

40|$|<b>Subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) is {{a common}} though {{infrequently}} recognized dementia of the elderly. The unique vascular anatomy of the subcortical white matter and central brain stem probably predisposes those regions to chronic ischemia and incomplete infarction {{in the presence of}} various cardiovascular and hemodynamic insults. Recent studies have begun to define the risk factors for SAE, and others have shown it to be a condition frequently comorbid with the dementias of Alzheimer’s disease, the multi-infarct state, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Recent research into the etiologies of these disorders suggest certain pathogenetic links between them, strongly implying that they are not neatly distinct disease entities, as is commonly believed, and accounting for some of the overlap between these dementing illnesses seen clinically.

40|$|SUMMARY A 51 -year-old {{man with}} {{moderate}} intermittent hyper-tension had a rapidly progressive, profound dementia {{in the absence}} of significant localizing neurological signs. Postmortem examination disclosed the vascular alterations and diffuse white matter degenera-tion which characterize <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) or Binswanger's disease. The case underscores the need to consider vascular disease as an etiology of dementia — even {{in the absence of}} focal neurological deficit. BEDSIDE CONSIDERATION of cerebrovascular disease as an etiology of dementia has been deemphasized somewhat in recent years in favor of disorders such as Alzheimer's dis-ease, slow virus infections, and normal pressure hydro-cephalus. Cerebrovascular disease, nevertheless, is common and may be responsible for clinical conditions in which dementia is a leading aspect. Vascular dementias are usually engendered by extensive cortical softenings, 1 ' * but on occa-sion are derived from the diffuse white matter degeneration of <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) or Binswanger's disease. 3 " 12 This report documents the clinical and pathological features of a patient with this unusual cerebrovascular disorder, and emphasizes that vascular dis-ease must be included in the differential diagnosis of demen-tia, {{even in the absence of}} localizing neurological signs...|$|E

Areas of diffuse MRI abnormality corresponded with areas of axonal and myelin loss with gliosis, and small "lacune"-like lesions corresponded with lacunar infarcts histologically.

40|$|Plasma {{hyperviscosity}} is {{a striking}} abnormality in patients suffering from <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) and is thought to perpetuate the chronic ischaemic demyelinating process of the periventricular white matter.

This was paralleled by a significant improvement of the initially abnormal retinal arteriovenous passage time, as well as a significant augmentation of the CO 2 -induced cerebral vasomotor response. This did not lead, however, to any clinical improvement with respect to performance of neuropsychological tests, recurrences of strokes during a 6 month observation period or improvement of various audiological parameters.

40|$|A 49 -year-old {{normotensive}} {{man died}} {{after a series}} of strokes, slowly evolving dementia and personality change occurring over a period of 23 years. CT scan showed large infarcts involving the cortex and white matter of the temporo-occipital areas, small subcortical infarcts and low attenuation in the white matter of the frontal and parietal lobes. Neuropathological examination revealed large cortical and small subcortical infarcts corresponding to the radiological findings as well as degeneration/demyelination of central white matter corresponding to the areas of low attenuation seen on CT. The basic underlying pathological process was hyaline arteriosclerosis and atheroma which diffusely affected the small intracerebral arteries {{and to a lesser extent}} the arteries of the circle of Willis.

METHODS [...] Thirty one patients fulfilling the criteria for IAHS (according to history and clinical and neuroradiological examination) were studied. Quantified gait measurements, psychometric testing, and rCBF before and after removal of CSF were obtained. Pressure of CSF and CSF outflow conductance were investigated with a constant pressure infusion method. Brain MRI was used to quantify the severity of white matter lesions and periventricular hyperintensities. In IAHS a widespread rCBF hypoperfusion pattern was depicted, with a caudal frontal and temporal grey matter and subcortical white matter reduction of rCBF as the dominant feature. Removal of CSF was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in rCBF. Significant white matter lesions were detected only in a minority of patients by MRI. An altered CSF hydrodynamic state with a higher CSF pressure and lower conductance was confirmed. IAHS is characterised by an abnormal CSF hydrodynamic state, associated with a widespread rCBF reduction with preference for subcortical white matter and frontal-temporal cortical regions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{examine the}} CSF {{concentrations}} of molecules reflecting demyelination, neuronal and axonal degeneration, gliosis, monoaminergic neuronal function, and aminergic and peptidergic neurotransmission {{in a large}} series of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) or <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE), to elucidate pathogenic, diagnostic, and prognostic features.  METHODS—CSF concentrations of glycosphingolipid (sulfatide), proteins (neurofilament triplet protein (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), 4 -aminobutyric acid (GABA)), and monoamines (homovanillic acid (HVA), 5 -hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA), 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylglycol (HMPG)) were analysed in 43 patients with NPH and 19 patients with SAE. The diagnoses of NPH and SAE were based on strict criteria and patients with NPH were subsequently operated on. Twelve clinical variables, psychometric tests measuring perceptual speed, accuracy, learning, and memory and a psychiatric evaluation were performed in all patients and before and after a shunt operation in patients with NPH.  RESULTS—The CSF sulfatide concentration was markedly increased in patients with SAE (mean 766, range 300 - 3800 nmol/l) compared with patients with NPH (mean 206, range 50 - 400 nmol/l) (p< 0. 001). 5 -HIAA, GABA, and VIP in CSF were higher in patients with SAE than in patients with NPH. The patients with NPH with cerebrovascular aetiology had higher sulfatide concentrations and a poorer outcome after shunt surgery than patients with NPH with other aetiologies.  CONCLUSIONS—The pathogenesis of the white matter changes in NPH and SAE is different and ischaemic white matter changes can {{be a part of}} the NPH state. The markedly increased CSF sulfatide concentrations in patients with SAE indicate ongoing demyelination as an important pathophysiological feature of SAE. The CSF sulfatide concentration distinguished between patients with SAE and those with NPH with a sensitivity of 74 % and a specificity of 94 %, making it an important diagnostic marker. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKROUND: Pathological {{tau protein}} {{concentrations}} in CSF {{are found in}} both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but studies on brain tissue {{have suggested that the}} tau pathology in AD differs from that in FTD and that the difference {{may be related to the}} degree of phosphorylation. As CSF tau protein is increased after stroke, tau may also be implicated in the pathophysiology of vascular dementia, of which <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) is a putative subtype. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nature of tau protein in CSF and the involvement of total CSF tau and phosphorylated CSF tau (phosphotau) in various types of dementia. METHODS: Using ELISAs for total tau and tau phosphorylated at Thr 181 (phosphotau), the CSF concentrations of total tau and phosphotau were determined in patients with probable and possible AD (n= 41 and 19, respectively), FTD (n= 18), SAE (n= 17), and Parkinson's disease (PD; n= 15) and in age matched controls (n= 17). All the antibodies stained the lower molecular weight bands, whereas only the antibodies that recognise phosphorylated tau stained the higher molecular bands. RESULTS: Both CSF tau and CSF phosphotau were increased in probable AD compared with FTD (p< 0. 001), SAE (p< 0. 001), PD (p< 0. 001), and controls (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Aim <b>Subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) {{as well as}} infarctions in the {{cerebrum}} {{can affect}} the nigrostriatal system and presumably cause vascular parkinsonism (VPS). However, in patients with SAE or with infarcts the differentiation of VPS from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPS) is challenging. The aim {{was to examine the}} striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) density in patients with parkinsonism and SAE as well as DAT SPECT and D 2 receptor SPECT in patients with cerebral infarctions. Methods The first study compared 15 consecutive patients with parkinsonian symptoms and SAE with 15 retrospectively chosen, matched patients with diagnosis of IPS without any abnormalities in MRI. The second study was focused on results of DAT and D 2 receptor SPECT in patients with parkinsonism and cerebral infarcts with involvement of the nigrostriatal system. Results In the first study we observed a DAT deficit in 9 / 15 patients of the SAE-group. In contrast, all patients from the IPS-group showed a reduced DAT binding. Binding ratios (BR) of putamen contralateral {{to the side of the}} more affected limb were significantly higher in patients with SAE vs. patients in the IPS-group. BR for putaminal asymmetry and asymmetry caudate-to-putamen as well as contralateral caudate-to-putamen BR were significantly higher in the IPS group. In the second study we have found a bi- or unilateral DAT deficit in 11 / 12 patients in the infarction-group; six of those eleven patients (five with striatal infarcts) had a significant D 2 receptor deficit on the side of the infarction. Conclusion DAT deficit was less pronounced in patients with SAE and parkinsonism than in patients with IPS without any abnormalities in the MRI. Our results suggest that at least a part of the patients with parkinsonism and SAE have no nigrostriatal degeneration und suffer from a VPS. D 2 receptor SPECT and DAT SPECT in patients with cerebral infarctions provides important information in differentiation between an IPS and a VPS. In the diagnosis of VPS vascular risk factors should be considered more intensively. According to a syndrome-oriented therapy, medication management should be changed (antihypertensive/rheological agents rather than L-dopa). A potential role of DAT and D 2 receptor SPECT in the differential diagnosis of VPS and IPS requires more assessments within prospective studies...|$|E
40|$|Normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (NPH) and <b>subcortical</b> <b>arteriosclerotic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (SAE) {{are common}} causes of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence in the elderly. In {{spite of a}} primarily different pathogenesis with a potentially reversible CSF dynamic disturbance in NPH and an irreversible microangiopathy in SAE, patients with NPH and SAE can present with similar symptoms and exhibit white matter changes {{that are difficult to}} distinguish, constituting a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the diagnostic, predictive and pathophysiological significance of white matter pathology in NPH and SAE by analysis of MR images and biochemical CSF markers reflecting white matter alterations. We analysed CSF markers reflecting demyelination, axonal degeneration, gliosis and neurotransmission. MR images were analysed by two separate methods; 1) A novel visual rating protocol registering the location, the extension and the shape of periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH), the number of subcortical and cortical infarctions, the flow void sign and the width of the ventricular system; 2) An objective, rule-based, semiautomatic segmentation method for quantification of PVH and DWMH. Neurological signs and symptoms and psychometric test score were quantified in all patients and in the NPH patients also three months after shunt surgery. Clinical variables were standardised and used for calculating the outcome of treatment. 	We included 124 patients with NPH and 19 patients with SAE. Eighty-three percent of the NPH patients improved after shunt surgery. 	In spite of the refined quantification of white matter changes, only minor differences were found between NPH and SAE patients. They also shared the major part of the quantified symptoms. CSF Sulfatide, a demyelination marker, was increased in all SAE patients, distinguishing between SAE and NPH patients with a sensitivity of 74 % and a specificity of 94 %, making it a potential diagnostic marker. Abundant PVH and DWMH preoperatively correlated with clinical improvement after shunt surgery, as did postoperative reduction in PVH, supporting the prognostic value of MRI in NPH. High CSF levels of neurofilament protein (NFL), a marker of neuronal degeneration, correlated with the severity of symptoms and with a favourable outcome after surgery which may imply that the symptoms in NPH are related to periventricular white matter changes. CSF sulfatide correlated with the amount of DWMH and NFL with both PVH and DWMH, suggesting that DWMH might relate to demyelination and PVH to neuronal axonal dysfunction. Our results of similarities in symptomatology and white matter MRI changes in NPH and SAE consequently indicate some common pathophysiological mechanism. The difference in sulfatide levels, however, suggests abundant demyelination in SAE but not in NPH. Thus, NPH and SAE, probably initiated by different pathogenic mechanisms, may in later stages comprise a common pathophysiological pathway of white matter degeneration that could further enhance the subcortical white matter pathology. The results of this study will probably improve the medical car...|$|E
40|$|The {{symptoms}} in Idiopathic Adult Hydrocephalus Syndrome (IAHS) – gait disturbance, incontinence, and cognitive deficit – correlate anatomically to neuronal dysfunction in periventricular white matter. The pathophysiology {{is considered to}} include a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamic disturbance, including pressure oscillations (“B waves”), in combination with cerebrovascular disease. IAHS and <b>Subcortical</b> <b>Arteriosclerotic</b> <b>Encephalopathy</b> (SAE) show clinical similarities, which constitutes a diagnostic problem. The aim of this thesis was to investigate biochemical markers in CSF, possibly related to the pathophysiology, and their usefulness in diagnosis, to investigate the effect of ICP changes on glucose supply and metabolism in periventricular deep white matter, and to present criteria for objective, computerised methods for evaluating the content of B waves in an intracranial pressure (ICP) registration. CSF samples from 62 IAHS patients, 26 SAE patients, and 23 controls were analysed for sulfatide, total-tau (T-tau) hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau), neurofilament protein light (NFL), and beta-amyloid- 42 (Aß 42). In ten IAHS patients, recordings of ICP, brain tissue oxygen tension (PtiO 2), and samplings of brain extracellular fluid from periventricular white matter by way of microdialysis were performed, at rest and during a CSF infusion and tap test. Microdialysis samples were analysed for glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, glycerol, and urea. Patterns before and after spinal tap were analysed and changes from increasing ICP during the infusion test were described. The long term ICP registration {{was used to evaluate}} two computerised methods according to optimal amplitude threshold, monitoring time, and correlation to the manual visual method. In CSF, NFL was elevated in both IAHS and SAE patients, reflecting the axonal damage. In a multinominal logistic regression model, the combined pattern of high NFL, low P-tau and low Aß 42 in CSF was shown to be highly predictive in distinguishing between IAHS, SAE and controls. Analysis of microdialysis samples for glucose, lactate, and pyruvate showed, in combination with PtiO 2, a pattern of low-grade ischemia. After the spinal tap of CSF, the pattern changed, indicating increased glucose metabolic rate. During the infusion test, there were prompt decreases in the microdialysis values of glucose, lactate and pyruvate during ICP increase, but no sign of hypoxia. The values normalised immediately when ICP was lowered, indicating that the infusion test is not causing damage. One of the computerised methods, with an amplitude threshold set to 1 mm Hg, was shown robust in evaluating B wave content in an ICP registration. At least 5 hours registration time was needed. The highly predictive pattern of biochemical markers in CSF indicates a possibility of identifying simple tests in diagnosing and selecting patients for surgical treatment. The results of microdialysis and PtiO 2 indicate low-grade ischemia in the periventricular white matter, which is ameliorated from CSF removal, and that glucose supply and metabolism are sensitive to short-term ICP elevations, thus proposing a link between ICP oscillations and symptoms from neuronal disturbance. A computerised method for evaluation of B waves is a prerequisite for evaluating the impact of pressure oscillations in the pathophysiology of IAHS...|$|E
