5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes <b>short-term</b> <b>and</b> long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are <b>short-term</b> <b>and</b> are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for <b>short-term</b> <b>and</b> long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both <b>short-term</b> <b>and</b> long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of cognitive and language skills as predictors of early literacy skills in children with Specific Language Impairment. A range of cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed {{in a sample of}} 137 eight-year-old children with SLI {{at the beginning of the}} school year, and 6 months later on word decoding and reading comprehension. The cognitive and linguistic measures revealed four factors that were called language, speech, <b>short-term</b> memory, <b>and</b> phonological awareness. Structural equation modeling showed word decoding to be predicted by speech, <b>short-term</b> memory, <b>and</b> phonological awareness, whereas reading comprehension was predicted by word decoding skills <b>and</b> <b>short-term</b> memory. It can be concluded that in children with SLI variations in early word decoding are mostly determined by speech abilities <b>and</b> <b>short-term</b> memory, <b>and</b> to a lesser extent by phonological awareness. Moreover, reading comprehension turns out to be highly dependent on word decoding <b>and</b> <b>short-term</b> memory...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge and {{behavior}} patterns are connected, {{and the results}} of learning can be measured through behavior. This study compares the behavior patterns of college students in the field of business in Ljubljana and Pula. Although no significant differences were expected, the study showed that Ljubljana students have a characteristic cognitive orientation and prefer using ideas rather than written rules in their work. Their decision-making is oriented toward long-term efficiency and long-term effectiveness, rather than <b>short-term</b> efficiency <b>and</b> <b>short-term</b> effectiveness, <b>and</b> their communication is indecisive and unreliable. Their behavior pattern is somewhat unstable, changing over time. In contrast, the Pula students’ cognitive patterns are oriented toward ideas that they shape themselves. Their behavior inclines toward rules and their conscientious application, and their work is oriented toward <b>short-term</b> efficiency <b>and</b> long-term effectiveness, rather than <b>short-term</b> effectiveness <b>and</b> long-term efficiency. Their communication is reliable and they check statements in advance. The average behavior pattern of Pula students is very stable, with no particular variations between the sexes or years. The differences may be due to social circumstances, education styles, and perhaps tradition...|$|R

In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which also points to the general role of memory in executive functioning.|$|E
