The {{objective of this}} study is to describe patients' decisions to continue or discontinue <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> their <b>embryos</b> after a minimum <b>storage</b> period <b>of</b> 2 years. METHODS: Female patients who had embryos stored at the Infertility Centre of the Ghent University Hospital (Belgium) were sent a mail questionnaire to be completed anonymously. RESULTS: The questionnaire had a response rate of 79 % (326 / 412). After an <b>embryo</b> <b>storage</b> period <b>of</b> at least 2 years, 40 % of the couples who were still together wished to continue <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> their <b>embryos.</b> Half <b>of</b> these had no concrete plans for a transfer and wanted to postpone the decision or keep all options open. For those who decided to discontinue storage (60 %), the main reason was the completion of their families. Despite the fact that the patients' child wish was the main factor in their storage decision, two groups of patients with distinct profiles made decisions that were inconsistent with their child wish: those who wanted to continue storage while not wanting a(nother) child (7 % of those with no child wish), and those who wanted a(nother) child but decided to discontinue <b>storage</b> (25 % <b>of</b> those with a child wish).

40|$|Vitrification is a {{cryopreservation}} strategy where {{cells are}} {{converted into a}} glass-like amorphous solid which is free of any crystalline structure.

Chilled <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> might be a step towards developing successful cryopreservation, but no methods to date have worked. In the present study, we applied a novel strategy to improve the chilling tolerance of zebrafish embryos by introducing a preconditioning hydrostatic pressure treatment to the embryos. In our experiments, 26 -somites and Prim- 5 stage zebrafish embryos were chilled at 0 °C for 24 hours after preconditioning. Embryo survival rate, ability to reach maturation and fertilizing capacity were tested. Our results indicate that applied preconditioning technology {{made it possible for}} the chilled embryos to develop normally until maturity, and to produce healthy offspring as normal, thus passing on their genetic material successfully. Treated embryos had a significantly higher survival and better developmental rate, moreover the treated group had a higher ratio of normal morphology during continued development. While all controls from chilled embryos died by 30 day-post-fertilization, the treated group reached maturity (~ 90 - 120 days) and were able to reproduce, resulting in offspring in expected quantity and quality. Based on our results, we conclude that the preconditioning technology represents a significant improvement in zebrafish embryo chilling tolerance, thus enabling a long-time survival.

40|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Dutch Embryo Act, {{institutions}} that perform in vitro fertilisation must work in accordance with a legally prescribed procedure. A model protocol has been drawn up {{under the auspices of the}} Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement that can serve as a guideline and that may be amplified in details with regard to local circumstances. In vitro fertilisation is reserved to licensed centres with expert and experienced personnel. These centres must fulfil specific standards for both the clinical part and the laboratory part of the treatment. The decision in favour of ovarian stimulation depends on the wish to be able to select from multiple embryos and must be weighed against the burden on the patient, her age and the risk of developing an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Placing more than two embryos at a time is discouraged. In the contract between the depositors and the depository concerning the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> (cryopreservation), the points of departure are that the parties involved must agree on the use of the embryos and that each involved person may withdraw his or her permission at any time. In the Netherlands, oocyte donation is performed predominantly in women with premature ovarian failure. The maximum age of the acceptor is 45 years. Legally, the minimum age of a donor is 18 years, but the Committee recommends caution with donors under the age of 30 years; from the point of view of treatment efficacy, the maximum age is 40 years. For each individual oocyte donation procedure, permission is required from the medical-ethical assessment committee of the hospital in question. Often, a written report to the committee from the treating gynaecologist and a psychosocial counsellor will suffice. Because of the increased risk of pregnancy complications after oocyte donation, control and delivery in hospital are recommended.

40|$|Although somatic <b>embryos</b> <b>of</b> alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) had {{acquired}} some tolerance to desiccation at the cotyledonary {{stage of development}} (22 d after plating), additional culturing in 20 ?M abscisic acid (ABA) for 8 d induced greater desiccation tolerance, as determined by increased germination. Compared with fast drying, slow drying <b>of</b> the ABA-treated <b>embryos</b> improved desiccation tolerance. However, slow drying <b>of</b> non-ABA-treated <b>embryos</b> led to {{the complete loss of}} germination capacity, while some fast-dried embryos survived. An electron paramagnetic resonance spin probe technique and in vivo Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy revealed that cellular membrane integrity and -helical protein secondary structure were maintained during drying in embryos cultured in media enriched with 20 ?M ABA, but not in embryos cultured in the absence of ABA. Slow-dried, non-ABA-treated embryos had low oligosaccharide to sucrose ratios, an increased proportion of ß-sheet protein secondary structures and broad membrane phase transitions extending over a temperature range of more than 60 °C, suggestive of irreversible phase separations.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of LutonCryopreservation <b>of</b> fish <b>embryos</b> was studied using zebrafish embryo as a model system. Cryoprotectant toxicity, chilling sensitivity and embryo membrane permeability were investigated {{with a view to}} developing optimum protocols for cryopreservation <b>of</b> the <b>embryos</b> using controlled slow cooling, non-freezing storage and vitrification. Methanol was found to be the most effective cryoprotectant for controlled slow cooling and non-freezing <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> zebrafish <b>embryos</b> with 11 %heart beat stage embryos surviving after controlled slow cooling to - 25 °C. Zebrafish embryos were found to be very chilling sensitive with early developmental stages being the most sensitive to chilling injury. Embryo developmental stages after closure of the blastopore (> 12 -h), especially post heart beat stages were much more resistant to cryoprotectant toxicity and chilling injury. Heart beat stage (27 -h) embryos proved to be the best embryo developmental stage for controlled slow cooling and non-freezing storage. Dechorionated embryos are more sensitive to cryoprotectant toxicity and chilling injury. The sensitivity to chilling injury <b>of</b> zebrafish <b>embryos</b> limited the use of controlled slow cooling and non-freezing storage for long term cryopreservation. The attempts at cryopreservation <b>of</b> zebrafish <b>embryos</b> using vitrification produced no embryo survival, although up to 32 % embryos remained morphologically intact immediately after vitrification. Poor cryoprotectant permeation, dehydration and consequently ice formation within the egg are probably the main factors on effecting embryo survival.

To this end a spin probe technique, Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, and electron microscopy were used. The in situ Tm of hydrated membranes was between 10 °C and 15 °C, coinciding with the critical minimum temperature for germination. During <b>storage,</b> viability <b>of</b> fresh <b>embryos</b> was lost within two weeks at 5 °C, but remained high at 25 °C. The loss of viability coincided with an increased leakage of K from the embryos upon imbibition and with an increased proportion of cells with injured plasma membranes. Freeze–fracture replicas of plasma membranes from chilled, hydrated axes showed lateral phase separation and signs of the inverted hexagonal phase. Dehydrated embryos were sensitive to soaking in water, particularly at low temperatures, but fresh embryos were not. After soaking dry embryos at 5 °C (4 h) plus 1 d of further incubation at 25 °C, the axis cells were structurally disorganized and did not become turgid. In contrast, cells had a healthy appearance and were turgid after soaking at 35 °C. Imbibitional stress {{was associated with the}} loss of plasma membrane integrity in a limited number of cells, which expanded during further incubation <b>of</b> the <b>embryos</b> at 25 °C. It is suggested that the injuries brought about by storage or imbibition at sub-optimal temperatures in tropical seeds whose membranes have a high intrinsic Tm (10 – 15 °C), are caused by gel phase formation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were two-fold: (1) to examine possible seed and cone characteristics and their usefulness as seed maturity indices, and (2) {{to examine the effects}} of artificial ripening on seed maturation and germination. Cone fresh weight, cone length, cone specific gravity, cone color, seed fresh weight, seed development, seed wing color and embryo/embryo cavity ratio were studied to determine their usefulness as maturity indices. The artificial ripening treatments incLuded: (1) detached cones stored outdoors in the shade, and (2) detached cones stored outdoors in the shade with their basal end setting in moist perlite. With maturity, grand fir seed germination increased linearly without any leveling off prior to seed dispersal. Due to the erratic nature of noble fir seed germination no definitive pattern was observed. Artificial ripening techniques were beneficial for both species, increasing germination above that of the control and also increasing the rate of germination. Seedling vigor, as measured by oven dry weight, was also improved by artificially ripening the immature cones. Dry outdoor <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> cones produced more total sound seed that moist outdoor <b>storage.</b> The ratio <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> length to the length <b>of</b> the <b>embryo</b> cavity was the single most useful index of seed maturity found. Seed wing color and degree of seed wing attachment also appear to be useful in assessing seed maturity. Cone color and cone specific gravity were beneficial cone characteristics found for determining seed maturity. The most marked changes in biochemical constituents of ripening seed were the steady accumulation of reserves, i. e crude fat and protein nitrogen, and structural components. Soluble sugar, amino acid and starch contents decreased with maturity, while crude fat and nitrogenous compounds increased. During artificial ripening an even more significant increase in crude fat and nitrogenous compounds occurred, thus reflecting a conversion from mobile to storage forms. The decrease in organic materials of cone scales also was associated with mobilization of these materials by maturing seeds. An even more significant decrease in these materials occurred after the cones had been picked and stored outdoors, suggesting translocation of substances from cone scales to ripening seeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of delaying the germination <b>of</b> mature coconut <b>embryos</b> in vitro for medium-term conservation of coconut was investigated. <b>Embryos</b> <b>of</b> coconut was stored in sugar free, full-strength and half-strength MS media for 3 months with minimal lo ss in viability. Germinability <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> decreased with prolonged storage. At the end <b>of</b> 9 -month <b>storage</b> period, embryos kept in full-strength media were all non-germinable, while those stored in half-stre ngth media still gave 15 % germination. Addition of mannitol up to 0. 3 M did show any {{significant effect on}} germination <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> stored for 3 months.

The presence of mannitol in the storage medium also induced morphological abnormalities in seedlings derived subsequently from the stored embryos. Mannitol at 0. 4 M was totally deleterious to the <b>embryo.</b> Significance <b>of</b> these findings on coconut gene tic resources conservation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{study to}} {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> pre-incubation <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> the eggs of the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) was conducted during the cool harmattan season in the north-east arid region (Sahel) of Nigeria. Eggs were collected daily from six-months-old quail and stored at room temperature (25 - 29 C) for 0 to 20 days before incubation in an electric incubator. Eggs that failed to hatch were opened foro determination of fertility and estimation of time <b>of</b> death <b>of</b> <b>embryos.</b> A total <b>of</b> 196 (29. 3 %) eggs out of 668 incubated hatched successfully. The length <b>of</b> pre-incubation <b>storage</b> was negatively correlated (r =- 0. 91; P < 0. 0001) with hatchability. The highest hatchability (72. 3 %) was obtained from eggs that were not stored (Day 0 <b>of</b> <b>storage).</b> Hatchability dropped sharply after storage for 9 days. No egg hatched following pre-incubation <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> over 11 days. Among the unhatched eggs, there were significantly more apparently infertile than fertile eggs (P < 0. 0002). There was no relationship between pre-incubation length <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> that died in early, middle or late incubation period. However, the proportion of the apparently infertile eggs increased with increasing length <b>of</b> pre-incubation <b>storage</b> (r = 0. 95; P < 0. 0001). No egg stored for 18 days or more was found to be apparently fertile. It was concluded that the length <b>of</b> pre-incubation <b>storage</b> has detrimental effect on hatchability of quail eggs in the Sahel area and that quail eggs for incubation should not be stored at room temperature for more than 9 days, even in the coolest season...|$|R

40|$|Drying, {{widely used}} for storing {{orthodox}} seeds for prolonged periods, cannot {{be applied to}} recalcitrant seeds, which are sensitive to desiccation. Thus, inclusion of species with recalcitrant seeds, like inga, in reforestation programs or even for commercial use has been hindered by the lack of technology that would allow <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> these seeds. The remaining option, cryopreservation, is a method of high cost that requires a high level of technology. Knowledge of the processes involved in sensitivity to desiccation continues to be a great challenge for the seed sector. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the effects of osmotic treatments on tolerance to desiccation and <b>storage</b> capacity <b>of</b> recalcitrant seeds <b>of</b> inga. <b>Embryos</b> were subjected to osmotic stresses with PEG solution and subjected to progressive drying processes.
