5|$|Spain {{supported}} a Jacobite-led invasion of Scotland in 1719, but stormy seas allowed only about three hundred Spanish troops {{to arrive in}} Scotland. A base was established at Eilean Donan Castle on the west Scottish coast in April, only {{for it to be}} destroyed by British ships a month later. Attempts by the Jacobites to recruit Scottish clansmen yielded a fighting force of only about a thousand men. The Jacobites were poorly equipped, and were easily defeated by British artillery at the Battle of Glen <b>Shiel.</b> The clansmen dispersed into the Highlands, and the Spaniards surrendered. The invasion never posed any serious threat to George's government. With the French this time fighting against him in the War, Philip's armies fared poorly. As a result, the Spanish and French thrones remained separate. Simultaneously, Hanover gained from the resolution of the Great Northern War which had been caused by rivalry between Sweden and Russia for control of the Baltic. The Swedish territories of Bremen and Verden were ceded to Hanover in 1719, with Hanover paying Sweden monetary compensation for the loss of territory.|$|E

The Hogwarts Lake was filmed from Loch <b>Shiel,</b> Loch Eilt and Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands.

On 28 October 2012, <b>Shiels</b> led Kilmarnock to a historic win at Celtic Park against Celtic.

25|$|In the interim, {{however, the}} Brigade found itself briefly opposed to its Spanish {{counterpart}} in the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1718–20, as France was allied to the Jacobites' British Hanoverian rivals. As a result, it was Spain who assisted the Highland Jacobites in their rising {{that ended in}} the Battle of Glen <b>Shiel</b> in 1719. The 1716 Anglo-French alliance had effectively secured the Hanoverian succession in Ireland and Britain. Despite the alliance France continued to recognize James III as legitimate, and therefore individual Jacobites amongst the Irish regiments in France continued to hope for decades that their cause would eventually succeed. After its early years however the Brigade increasingly became a professional force made up of Irish soldiers who enlisted for reasons of family tradition or in search of opportunities denied them at home, rather than for directly political motives.|$|E
500|$|A cult film is any {{film that}} has a cult following, {{although}} the term is not easily defined and {{can be applied to}} a wide variety of films. The definition is occasionally expanded to exclude films that have been released by major studios or have big budgets, try specifically to become cult films, or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics. Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as by their content. This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized audience participation, film festivals, or cosplay. Over time, the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier, stricter views. [...] Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy, as cinephiles argue that the term has become meaningless or [...] "elastic, a catchall for anything slightly maverick or strange". [...] Academic Mark <b>Shiel</b> has criticized the term itself as being a weak concept, reliant on subjectivity; different groups can interpret films in their own terms. [...] According to feminist scholar Joanne Hollows, this subjectivity causes films with large female cult followings to be perceived as too mainstream and not transgressive enough to qualify as a cult film. Academic Mike Chopra‑Gant says that cult films become decontextualized when studied as a group, and <b>Shiel</b> criticizes this recontextualization as cultural commodification.|$|E

500|$|Jacobitism was revived by the unpopularity of the union. In 1708 James Francis Edward Stuart, {{the son of}} James VII, {{who became}} known as [...] "The Old Pretender", {{attempted}} an invasion with a French fleet carrying 6,000 men, but the Royal Navy prevented it from landing troops. A more serious attempt occurred in 1715, soon {{after the death of}} Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian king, the eldest son of Sophie, as George I of Great Britain. This rising (known as The 'Fifteen) envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales, Devon, and Scotland. However, government arrests forestalled the southern ventures. In Scotland, John Erskine, Earl of Mar, nicknamed Bobbin' John, raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier. Mar captured Perth, but let a smaller government force under the Duke of Argyll hold the Stirling plain. Part of Mar's army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the Battle of Preston, surrendering on 14 November 1715. The day before, Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. At this point, James belatedly landed in Scotland, but was advised that the cause was hopeless. He fled back to France. An attempted Jacobite invasion with Spanish assistance in 1719 met with little support from the clans and ended in defeat at the Battle of Glen <b>Shiel.</b>|$|E
