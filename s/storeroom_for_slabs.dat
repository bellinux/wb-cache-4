50|$|Rough rock is {{excellent}} <b>for</b> <b>slab</b> climbing. Sandstone and granite are both excellent <b>for</b> <b>slab</b> climbing, because the rock {{has lots of}} friction, making smearing easier. Limestone slab climbs are more difficult, due to the smoothness of the rock, and quartzite slab climbs are even rarer due to the polished nature of the rock.|$|R

Lately, due to diminishing funds, already existing shelters have increasingly been converted into shelters {{for the protection of}} cultural property.|$|R

50|$|The {{reasons for}} {{discarding}} the windmill technology for cane juice extraction was {{the introduction of}} steam. Consequent to this change, the machinery in the windmill was shifted to the boiling house complex and reinstalled next to the new steam engines. The buildings, however, became <b>storerooms</b> <b>for</b> scrap iron and other debris. As result, the Antiguan economy is no more sugar centric but is now more dependent on tourism, and Betty's Hope now remains {{a part of this}} economy.|$|R
50|$|With Dover {{becoming}} a garrison town, {{there was a}} need <b>for</b> barracks and <b>storerooms</b> <b>for</b> the additional troops and their equipment. The solution adopted by Twiss and the Royal Engineers was to create a complex of barracks tunnels about 15 metres below the cliff top and the first troops were accommodated in 1803. At the height of the Napoleonic Wars, the tunnels housed more than 2,000 men and to date are the only underground barracks ever built in Britain.|$|R
