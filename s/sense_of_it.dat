In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in a song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is {{about being able to}} leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
25|$|On the no-ship, {{an attempt}} by rebel Bene Gesserits to murder the Leto II ghola is foiled by the child himself, {{seemingly}} able to change into a sandworm at will. The Paul ghola wants to remember his past; {{with the help of}} the Chani ghola, he steals and consumes an overdose of spice. This fails to awaken his past memories, but instead he has a vision in which he has been stabbed by another, evil Paul Atreides. After being discovered by the Bene Gesserit, he concludes that it is prescience. Sheanna’s own visions bring a warning from the legendary Reverend Mother Ramallo of Arrakis about the use of the gholas. She stops the ghola program from continuing until she can make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all.|$|E
25|$|If {{someone were}} {{to behave as}} if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. later said of the song, [...] "It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It only became a truly great song through playing live.

500|$|The Rules of the Game {{is remembered}} as a {{commentary}} on the moral callousness of the European upper class and their servants just {{before the beginning of}} World War II. While making the film, Renoir knew a new world war was coming; he later said there was a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in film, and wrote [...] "it is a war film and yet there is no reference to the war." [...] This sense of doom began just before shooting started in January when Barcelona fell to Franco and throughout the production when Prime Minister of France Édouard Daladier recognized Francoist Spain, Italy annexed Albania and Adolf Hitler prepared his Polish invasion. Renoir articulated this unmentioned theme of the film by saying: ...|$|E

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E

500|$|Richard Corliss of TIME {{commented on}} the film's {{standing}} among other Marvel films, {{saying that it is}} [...] "an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy." [...] He also said that [...] "superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all." [...] James Mullinger of GQ also {{commented on the}} structure of the story in saying that the [...] "film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James , AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X-Men saga. In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was generally more favorable towards Origins, stating [...] "Fortunately, Jackman is well-matched with Schreiber, who can sneer {{with the best of them}} and wears fangs well. The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor." [...] Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackman's performance, saying that [...] "Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song-and-dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie [...] "well-acted, with spectacular action and witty one-liners".|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{was only}} 21 {{years old when}} he wrote one of his most complex songs, [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", often {{referred}} to as [...] "Hard Rain". Dylan is said to have premiered [...] "Hard Rain" [...] at the Gaslight Cafe, where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: [...] "He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Every line kept building and bursting". Dylan performed [...] "Hard Rain" [...] days later at Carnegie Hall on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by Pete Seeger. The song gained added resonance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, just one month after Dylan's first performance of [...] "Hard Rain", when U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba, [...] Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to nuclear fallout, but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with Studs Terkel in 1963, Dylan said, [...] "No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen … In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E

500|$|Jumpers was {{scheduled}} to appear at the National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play [...] "unintelligible" [...] before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: [...] "Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all." [...] In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. [...] He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called [...] "unbelievable, {{one of the highlights of}} my career". [...] The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had [...] "laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill".|$|E
500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
