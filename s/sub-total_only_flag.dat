30|$|In {{addition}} to the error estimation, quality flags are attributed to all the detected sources. Their values range from 0 (no detection), through 1 (source not confirmed), 2 (detection confirmed, flux not reliable) to 3 (source confirmed and flux reliable). In practice, <b>only</b> <b>flags</b> 1 and 3 dominate. It would seem reasonable to narrow down the analysis <b>only</b> to the <b>flag</b> 3 sources; however, {{the total number of}} such sources is small and as a result the statistics becomes poor. For that reason, for the subsequent analysis we decided to use all the detected sources, with due attention. However, we use the safe measurements with flag 3 for a quality check of our results.|$|R
