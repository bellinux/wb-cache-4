5|$|A similar {{depiction}} of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West's novel The Day of the Locust (1939), which many critics see {{as an important}} precursor to Barton Fink. Set in a run-down apartment complex, the book describes a painter reduced to decorating movie <b>sets.</b> <b>It</b> portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West's novel and Barton Fink, protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial machine of the movie studio.|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock {{were formed}} in the Australian pop-music scene of the early 1970s, which {{included}} artists {{in a number of}} genres: mainstream pop (Zoot and Liv Maessen), blues rock (Chain), heavy rock (Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs), and boogie (Carson). Bands such as Blackfeather and Madder Lake combined mainstream and progressive rock. Most pop and rock listeners had never heard jazz fusion; when Ayers Rock incorporated the music into their <b>sets,</b> <b>it</b> was rarely performed by fellow Australian artists.|$|E
5|$|For {{a period}} of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo {{material}} live. In 1998, {{after the release of}} Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate <b>sets.</b> <b>It</b> was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.|$|E

5|$|Harvie Krumpet {{was filmed}} in Melbourne over 15 months between October 2001 and January 2003. The film {{was shot in}} {{sequence}} in three-month blocks, interspersed with three-month blocks of building sets and models. Production began in Elliott's garage and subsequently took place in three separate studios, moving three times {{in order to accommodate}} the growing size of the <b>sets.</b> <b>It</b> was shot on Super 16 mm film using a Bolex camera. Each individual frame was animated, meaning that an average of 3–5 seconds' worth of film was produced in each full day of filming.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{its members}} were {{directly}} elected {{for the first}} time. This <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> apart from similar institutions {{such as those of}} the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its President. Veil was also the first female President of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} tournament, Raonic reached his first final {{of the year}} at the Washington Open, facing Pospisil in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history.

5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E
5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc <b>sets.</b> <b>It</b> shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{finished}} {{the year in}} strong form, winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss Indoors, and the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which brought his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal for his fifth title at the event. He showed much of his old form, beating all contenders except Nadal in straight <b>sets.</b> <b>It</b> remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 34–4. Federer {{finished in the top}} two for the eighth consecutive season.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an alternative trade {{route to the}} Euphrates, which was cut {{because of the war}} with Persia; This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia's ambition. The date of the campaign is uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius' death, which <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> in the summer of 270. Watson, emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus' account, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius' death). According to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius' death in August). The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt's eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was fractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|While in the {{car with}} Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an {{attacker}} at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E
5|$|Zoe arrives {{as a new}} {{student at}} the college, {{studying}} Film Studies. She eventually grows closer to her ex-boyfriend Joe. Zoe, Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), Joe and Olivia Johnson (Rochelle Gadd) are in The Dog in the Pond bar when Sam Owen (Louis Tamone) <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> on fire. Zoe escapes but Joe and Olivia die. Zoe has a one-night stand with Zak Ramsey. After rejecting the advances of Will and entering a relationship with Will, Zoe is abused and manipulated by him. He stops Zoe from leaving to study in New York City, resorting to stealing her passport and breaking her hand. He spies on her via web-cam, and drugs her, making {{it look like a}} suicide attempt. When Zoe discovers that Will has been spying on her, he ties her up on the college roof and confesses his love for her. Will eventually lets Zoe go and is arrested.

5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Corona Borealis {{was linked}} to the legend of Theseus and the minotaur. It was {{generally}} considered to represent a crown given by Dionysus to Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince Theseus. When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus, he placed it in the heavens to commemorate their wedding. An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne, who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the minotaur that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed. The hero uses the crown's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing of the creature, and Dionysus later <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> in the heavens. The Latin author Hyginus linked it to a crown or wreath worn by Bacchus (Dionysus) to disguise his appearance when first approaching Mount Olympus and revealing himself to the gods, having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter's trysts with a mortal, in this case Semele. Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the Almagest of classical astronomer Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Brazil, it was once {{considered}} probable that the Portuguese navigator Duarte Pacheco Pereira had made a voyage to the Brazilian coast in 1498. This belief has since been dismissed, however, {{and it is now}} thought that he voyaged to North America instead. There is more certain evidence that two Spaniards, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Diego de Lepe, traveled along the northern coast of Brazil between January and March 1500. Pinzón went from what is today Fortaleza (capital of the Brazilian state of Ceará) to the mouth of the Amazon River. There he encountered another Spanish expedition led by Lepe, which would reach as far as the Oyapock River in March. The reason Cabral is credited with having discovered Brazil, rather than the Spanish explorers, is because the visits by Pinzón and Lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact. Historians Capistrano de Abreu, Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Mário Barata and Hélio Vianna concur that the Spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas—with a unique history, culture and society which <b>sets</b> <b>it</b> apart from the Hispanic-American societies which dominate the rest of the continent.|$|E
