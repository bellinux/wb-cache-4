40|$|Abstract — Vortices can be {{produced}} and ingested into the intake of a jet engine during high power operation {{in the vicinity of}} <b>solid</b> surfaces causing <b>Foreign</b> <b>Object</b> Damage (FOD) or compressor stall and engine surge problems. This can occur when the engine is mounted on the wing of a plane during take-off and engine ground runs or when the engine is placed inside a test cell for testing after an engine overhaul and prior to reinstallation onto the aircraft. Procedures have been put in placed to prevent such damage from occurring on the runway. However to prevent such vortices from forming, especially in the test cells, it is necessary to be able to predict the onset of the vortex or at least to understand the factors affecting the formation of such vortices. Vortex formation in an enclosed cell is different from vortex formation over a solid plane (runway scenario). Ho and Jerm...|$|R

40|$|Flow-induced {{vibrations}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> {{were studied}} experimentally at University of Waterloo’s water flume facility. The main {{objective of this}} study was to understand the three-dimensional dynamic response of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> inside normal triangle tube bundle and estimate semi-empirically the amount of time taken by these objects to cause critical wear damage to the tube bundle tubes. Based on the information obtained from previous <b>Foreign</b> <b>Objects</b> Search and Retrieval (FOSAR) activities, the dynamic response of wire and plate samples each with non-dimensional length L/D = 2. 8, 3. 4, 4. 0 and 4. 6 were studied at ReD = 36, 257 and 42, 682, and Tu = 2. 0 % and 7. 5 %, respectively. They were placed inside tube bundle in the shape of a hook, which allowed pitching motion, yawing motion and Z-direction translation motion. Using Archard’s semi-empirical wear equation and available wear coefficients, wear was estimated for tubes made from I 600 and I 690 material, due to vibration of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> made from S 409, S 403 and S 304 material. Experimentally recorded three-dimensional dynamic response of the <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> showed that these objects are undergoing stationary random vibration. The Z amplitude response is significantly higher than the response in X and Y direction. For all the <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> with measurable vibration response, the contribution of yaw component to the overall motion is negligible, meaning that <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> are exhibiting planar response. As a result, the dynamic interaction between <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> and tube bundle tube surface will only be of sliding type. Additionally, it was observed that the planar response has a significant contribution from both pitching and Z translation motion component. The parametric study showed that the geometry of the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> affects its RMS amplitude, with wire samples having larger RMS amplitude than plate samples. The non-dimensional length (L/D) affects the response of the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> depending on its geometry. The RMS amplitude of wire samples did not show any significant change with the change in L/D, whereas only plate samples of L/D = 3. 4 and 4. 0 showed measurable vibration response. Moreover, both wire and plate samples are more likely to vibrate in high Reynolds number flow environment, and the amplitude of vibration decrease with increase in turbulence intensity for all <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> samples studied. Comparing current results with the results from previous studies showed that even small changes in the <b>foreign</b> <b>object’s</b> geometry could result in significant variation in RMS amplitude. Wear analysis showed that both wire and plate samples had a potential to do critical wear damage (i. e. wear out 40 % of tube wall thickness) within four year period as the flow velocity is increased. Influence of material combination on <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> related wear is more significant in low flow velocity environment. Geometry of the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> also affects the critical wear time with wear due to plate samples being more aggressive than wire samples. Additionally, it was shown that <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> vibrating in high turbulence intensity environment had higher critical wear time. Similar to material combination, effect of geometry and turbulence intensity becomes progressively more significant as the velocity decreases. Based on the results obtained in this study, during FOSAR activities, priority should be given to <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> found in high flow velocity and low turbulence intensity environment, since these objects are more likely to vibrate and cause critical wear damage within four year time period...|$|R

40|$|Detection {{of objects}} of {{interest}} is a fundamental problem in computer vision. <b>Foreign</b> <b>object</b> detection (FOD) is to detect the objects that {{are not expected to}} be appear in certain area. For this task, we need to first detect the position of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects,</b> and then compute the distance to the <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> to judge whether the objects are within the dangerous zone or not. The three principle sources of difficulty in performing this task are: a) the huge number of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> categories, b) the calculation of distance using camera(s), and c) the real-time system running performance. Most state-of-art detectors focus on one type or one class of objects. To the best of our knowledge, there is no single solution that focuses on a set of multiple <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> detection in an integrated manner. In some cases, multiple detectors can operate simultaneously to detect objects of interest in a given input. This is not efficient. The goal of our research is to focus on detection of a set of <b>objects</b> identified as <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> in an integrated and efficient manner. We design a multi-class detector. Our approach is to use a coarse-tofine strategy in which we divide the complicated space into finer and finer sub-spaces. For this purpose, data-driven clustering algorithm is implemented to gather similar <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> samples, and then an extended vector boosting algorithm is developed to train our multi-class classifier. The purpose of the extended vector boosting algorithm is to separate all <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> from background. For the task of estimation of the distance to the <b>foreign</b> <b>objects,</b> we design a look-up table which is based on the area of the detected <b>foreign</b> <b>objects.</b> Furthermore, we design a FOD framework. Our approach is to use stereo matching algorithm to get the disparity information based on intensity images from stereo cameras, and then using the camera model to retrieve the distance information. The distance calculated using disparity is more accurate than using the distance look-up table. We calculate the initial distance map when no objects are in the scene. Block of interest (BOI) is the area where distance is smaller than the corresponding area in the initial distance map. For the purpose of detecting <b>foreign</b> <b>objects,</b> we use flood fill method along with noise suppression method to combine adjacent BOI with higher confidence level. The <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> detection prototype system has been implemented and evaluated on a number of test sets under real working scenarios. The experimental results show that our algorithm and framework are efficient and robust...|$|R
