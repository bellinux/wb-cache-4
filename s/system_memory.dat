5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading <b>system</b> <b>memory</b> was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10â€¯Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access <b>system</b> <b>memory</b> at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a vector processor accessing vectors {{is strongly dependent on}} the conflicts produced in the memory subsystem. These conflicts delay the work of the functional units. The concurrent memory access of several vector streams causes inter-conflicts between the references of the different vector streams. In a <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> where several <b>memory</b> modules are mapped in every bus (complex <b>memory</b> <b>system)</b> the number of conflicts increases because the bus must be shared by vector streams.

5|$|The {{album was}} his first for Starbucks' Hear Music record label, after {{previously}} having a 45-year-old relationship with Capitol/EMI. The recording contract with Capitol/EMI ended a few {{months prior to the}} release of the album, after McCartney had found out that EMI were planning to take six months to set up a promotional plan for the album. McCartney was the first artist to sign to Hear Music. The album was released on 4 June 2007 in the UK, and a day later on the 5th in the US, and with a vinyl edition later in the month on 25 June. In the US, Memory Almost Full debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with about 161,000 copies sold within the first week, making it McCartney's highest-charting album there since 1997's Flaming Pie. 47% of the album sales from the opening week were from Starbucks coffee shops, which were the best sales for any album in the history of Starbucks. While it was announced that copies of the album sold in the Starbucks coffee shops in the UK would not be counted by the Official UK Charts, because they are not registered in the copies counting <b>system,</b> <b>Memory</b> Almost Full, however, still managed to hit number 5 on the UK Album Charts. The album was also peaked at number 1 on Billboard Internet Sales Chart, and number 3 on Billboard Top Internet Albums Downloads.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of <b>system</b> <b>memory</b> and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E
5|$|The yearlong {{conversion}} began October 9, 2011. Between October and December, 96 of Jaguar's 200 cabinets, each containing 24 XT5 blades (two 6-core CPUs per node, four nodes per blade), were {{upgraded to}} XK7 blades (one 16-core CPU per node, four nodes per blade) while {{the remainder of}} the machine remained in use. In December, computation was moved to the 96 XK7 cabinets while the remaining 104 cabinets were upgraded to XK7 blades. ORNL's external ESnet connection was upgraded from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s and the system interconnect (the network over which CPUs communicate with each other) was updated. The Seastar design used in Jaguar was upgraded to the Gemini interconnect used in Titan which connects the nodes into a direct 3D torus interconnect network. Gemini uses wormhole flow control internally. The <b>system</b> <b>memory</b> was doubled to 584 TiB. 960 of the XK7 nodes (10 cabinets) were fitted with a Fermi based GPU as Kepler GPUs were not then available; these 960 nodes were referred to as TitanDev and used to test code. This first phase of the upgrade increased the peak performance of Jaguar to 3.3 petaFLOPS. Beginning on September 13, 2012, Nvidia K20X GPUs were fitted to all of Jaguar's XK7 compute blades, including the 960 TitanDev nodes. In October, the task was completed and the computer was finally christened Titan.|$|E
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} brain {{newly acquired}} memories {{are dependent on}} the hippocampus for maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are {{taken over by the}} neocortex through a process called <b>systems</b> <b>memory</b> consolidation. Thus, whereas recent memories are likely to be disrupted in the event of hippocampal damage, older memories are less vulnerable. However, if a consolidated memory is reactivated by a reminder, it can temporarily return to a hippocampus-dependent state from which it normally recovers through a process known as <b>systems</b> <b>memory</b> reconsolidation. Here, we present an artificial neural-network model that captures <b>systems</b> <b>memory</b> consolidation and reconsolidation, as well as aspects of the related phenomena of memory extinction, spontaneous recovery and trace dominance (the competition between temporary destabilization and extinction).

40|$|Background: How {{do people}} sustain a visual {{representation}} of the environment? Currently, many researchers argue that a single visual working <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> sustains non-spatial object information such as colors and shapes. However, previous studies tested visual working memory for two-dimensional objects only. In consequence, the nature of visual working memory for three-dimensional (3 D) object representation remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, I show that when sustaining information about 3 D objects, visual working memory clearly divides into two separate, specialized <b>memory</b> <b>systems,</b> rather than one system, as was previously thought. One <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> gradually accumulates sensory information, forming an increasingly precise view-dependent {{representation of the}} scene {{over the course of}} several seconds. A second <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> sustains view-invariant representations of 3 D objects. The view-dependent <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> has a storage capacity of 3 â€“ 4 representations and the view-invariant <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> has a storage capacity of 1 â€“ 2 representations. These systems can operate independently from one another and do not compete for working memory storage resources. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide evidence that visual working memory sustains object information in two separate, specialized <b>memory</b> <b>systems.</b> One <b>memory</b> <b>system</b> sustains view-dependent representations of the scene, akin to the view-specific representations that guide place recognition during navigation in humans, rodents and insects.
