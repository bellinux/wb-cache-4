50|$|Trifolium repens, {{white or}} Dutch clover, is a {{perennial}} abundant in meadows and good pastures. The flowers are white or pinkish, becoming brown and deflexed as the corolla fades. Trifolium hybridum, alsike or <b>Swedish</b> <b>clover,</b> is a perennial which was introduced {{early in the}} 19th century and has now become naturalized in Britain. The flowers are white or rosy, and resemble those of the last species. Trifolium medium, meadow or zigzag clover, a perennial with straggling flexuous stems and rose-purple flowers, has potential for interbreeding with T. pratense to produce perennial crop plants.|$|E
40|$|The {{causes of}} poor {{fertility}} and female infertility of <b>Swedish</b> <b>clover</b> plants with reduced leaves were investigated. Embryological analyses demonstrated {{that in these}} plants deviations are more frequent in megasporoand megagametogenesis than in plants with normal leaves. The ovaries of plants with reduced leaves are frequently not coalesced and the ovules hang out beyond the ovary on tong funiculus. It is supposed that the hanging out of ovules on the long funiculus often makes fertilization difficult or impossible. Therefore, plants with reduced leaves exhibit low fertility or are sterile...|$|E

40|$|The species {{richness}} of flower-visiting insects has declined in past decades, raising {{concerns that the}} ecosystem service they provide by pollinating crops and wild plants is threatened. The relative commonness of different species with shared ecological traits can play a pervasive role in determining ecosystem functioning, but information on changes in abundances of pollinators over time is lacking. We gathered data on relative abundances of bumble-bee species in <b>Swedish</b> red <b>clover</b> fields during three periods in the last 70 years (1940 s, 1960 s and present), and on clover seed yields since 1921. We found drastic decreases in bumble-bee community evenness, with potential consequences for level and stability of red clover seed yield. The relative abundances of two short-tongued bumble-bees have increased from 40 per cent in the 1940 s to entirely dominate present communities with 89 per cent. Average seed yield declined {{in recent years and}} variation in yield doubled, suggesting that the current dependence on few species for pollination has been especially detrimental to stability in seed yield. Our results suggest a need to develop management schemes that promote not only species-rich but also more evenly composed communities of service-providing organisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of {{integrated pest management}} is hampered by lack of information on how insect pest abundances relate to yield losses, and how pests are affected by control measures. In this study, we develop integrated pest management tactics for Apion spp. weevils (Coleoptera: Brentidae) in seed production of red clover, Trifolium pratense L. We tested a method to forecast pest damage, quantified the relationship between pest abundance and yield, and evaluated chemical and biological pest control in 29 <b>Swedish</b> red <b>clover</b> fields in 2008 and 2011. Pest inflorescence abundance, which had a highly negative effect on yield, could be predicted with pan trap catches of adult pests. In 2008, chemical control with typically one application of pyrethroids was ineffective both in decreasing pest abundances and in increasing yields. In 2011, when chemical control included applications of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, pest abundances decreased and yields increased considerably in treated field zones. A post hoc analysis indicated that using pyrethroids in addition to thiacloprid was largely redundant. Infestation rates by parasitoids was higher and reached average levels of around 40 % in insecticide treated field zones in 2011, which is a level of interest for biological pest control. Based on the data presented, an economic threshold for chemical control is developed, and guidelines are provided on minimum effective chemical pest control...|$|R
