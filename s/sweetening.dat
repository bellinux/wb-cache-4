5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} maple sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by <b>sweetening</b> foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of <b>sweetening</b> the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Breaking the day's fasting {{traditionally}} {{begins with}} the brief consumption of dates and a chilled beverage. Palestinians make a variety of fruit-based beverages, including the flavors, tamar Hindi or tamarind, sous or licorice, kharroub or carob and Qamar Eddine. Tamar Hindi is made by soaking tamarinds in water for many hours, then straining, <b>sweetening</b> and mixing it with rose water and lemon juice. Kharroub is made similarly except instead of tamarind, carob is used. Qamar Eddine is made of dried apricots boiled into a liquid and chilled.|$|E

5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for <b>sweetening</b> {{in most parts of}} the world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane was a native of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.|$|E
25|$|The second Canadian <b>sweetening</b> plant {{followed}} {{a year later}} in Turner Valley, and used the same process. The first gas found at Turner Valley had been sweet but the Royalite #4 discovery of 1924, from a deeper horizon, was sour. Royalite built the Turner Valley <b>sweetening</b> plant in order to sell its gas to Canadian Western Natural Gas for distribution.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates a discrepancy surrounding {{the linkage between}} sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverage consumption and obesity, as determined by body mass index (BMI). The present study {{examined the relationship between}} BMI and sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverage consumption among college students. Ninety-two subjects (68 females and 24 males) aged 19 - 24 years old completed a food frequency questionnaire to determine the frequency and amount of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages (soda, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and tea or coffee drinks) that were consumed. Height and weight measurements were used to calculate BMI and determine BMIfor-age percentiles. Results indicated no significant differences between frequency of beverage intakes and BMI. The average ounces of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages consumed and body mass index were also unrelated. Males consumed sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages significantly (p <. 05) more frequently than females. Significant differences (p <. 05) were also observed between types 3 of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages consumed by the sample. Although this study was unable to establish a relationship between sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverage consumption and body weight, findings suggest a further need to generate a larger body of research to understand the connections of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages and body weight. ...|$|R

25|$|Such {{a special}} role of sucrose in the {{formation}} of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable <b>sweetening</b> agent. Widespread replacement of sucrose by high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet, such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.|$|E

50|$|The {{consumption}} of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages has {{increased over the}} years; this includes caffeinated and un-caffeinated drinks. The rise in {{consumption of}} soft drinks {{is due to the}} current convenience, availability, and accessibility of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages today. Over these years an increase in concern and action towards the accessibility of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages have been taken through policy. Government officials and doctors alike have responded to the increase in sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages and its health effects. Internists have further discussed adding extreme sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages consumption to the list of usual questions about alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs that lead to hypokalemia. Although low potassium levels are tolerated in healthy adults, as cola consumption increases things like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes can be developed from hypokalemia.|$|R

25|$|Other popular {{additives}} to tea by the tea-brewer or drinker include sugar, liquid honey or a solid Honey Drop, agave nectar, fruit jams, and mint. In China, <b>sweetening</b> tea was traditionally {{regarded as}} a feminine practice. In colder regions, such as Mongolia, Tibet and Nepal, butter is added to provide necessary calories. Tibetan butter tea contains rock salt and dre, a butter made from yak milk, which is churned vigorously in a cylindrical vessel closely resembling a butter churn. The same may be said for salt tea, which is popular in the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|While {{the process}} has long been {{associated}} with French wine, the first recorded mention of adding sugar to must in French literature was the 1765 edition of L'Encyclopedie, which advocated the use of sugar for <b>sweetening</b> wine over the previously accepted practice of using lead acetate. In 1777, the French chemist Pierre Macquer discovered that the actual chemical benefit of adding sugar to must {{was an increase in}} alcohol to balance the high acidity of underripe grapes rather than any perceived increase in sweetness. In 1801, while in the services of Napoleon, Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal began advocating the technique as a means of strengthening and preserving wine.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, a new {{gas plant}} at Taylor, near Fort St. John, British Columbia, began {{supplying}} Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. This plant's practices differed from {{those used in}} Alberta {{in a number of}} ways. For example, although it generally required dehydration, <b>sweetening</b> and processing for liquid hydrocarbons, companies transported the natural gas from northeastern British Columbia long distances before processing it further. Consequently, while planning the Westcoast pipeline, the field operators agreed to process all the gas at a single facility, rather than have individual gas plants in every major production area. At 10 million cubic metres per day, the Taylor plant had the capacity to process as much natural gas as all eleven of the other gas plants operating in Canada combined. The plant was also by far Canada's most northerly. Heavily insulated buildings protected the processing facilities and allowed them to function at temperatures typical of more southerly climes.|$|E
