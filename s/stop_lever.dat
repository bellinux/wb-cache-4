50|$|These marks {{are used}} to set the {{corresponding}} cylinder to its maximum number, ready to be re-zeroed. To do so, the operator inserts the stylus in between these two spokes and turns the wheel {{all the way to}} the <b>stopping</b> <b>lever.</b> This works because each wheel is directly linked to its corresponding display cylinder (it automatically turns by one during a carry operation). To mark the spokes during manufacturing, one can move the cylinder so that its highest number is displayed and then mark the spoke under the <b>stopping</b> <b>lever</b> and the one to the right of it.|$|R

50|$|The KTM class 82 three-car {{formation}} {{consists of}} two motor cabs {{at either end of}} the set and a single trailer car in between, the trailer car in between is equipped with a double-arm Z shaped pantograph for 25 kV AC electric pick up. Narrow gangways integrate the three-car sets, allowing full walking from cab to cab. Each car features two double-leaf electric plug doors at either side. Printed route maps are displayed each doors, along with emergency <b>stop</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Glock 34 is a {{competition}} {{version of the}} Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a [...] longer barrel and slide. It has an extended magazine release, extended slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever,</b> [...] trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides {{at the front of}} the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall design}} is {{slightly}} different from earlier SIG Sauer pistols such as P220 or P226, {{as there is}} no separate disassembly lever on the frame and the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> looks quite different.|$|E
50|$|For a 10-digit wheel (N), {{the fixed}} outside wheel is {{numbered}} from 0 to 9 (N-1). The numbers are inscribed in a decreasing manner clockwise {{going from the}} bottom left to the bottom right of the <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> To add a 5, one must insert a stylus between the spokes that surround the number 5 and rotate the wheel clockwise {{all the way to}} the <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> The number displayed on the corresponding display register will be increased by 5 and, if a carry transfer takes place, the display register to the left of it will be increased by 1. To add 50, use the tens input wheel (second dial from the right on a decimal machine), to add 500, use the hundreds input wheel, etc...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2017, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fifth generation" [...] or [...] "Gen5". The revisions centered on ergonomics and improving reliability. Many parts of fifth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The two fifth-generation models announced were the Glock 17 and Glock 19, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum. Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide <b>stop</b> <b>levers,</b> nDLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring conventional land-and-groove rifling (called the “Glock Marksman Barrel” by Glock) rather than the polygonal rifling used in earlier models, a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The locking block pin located above the trigger pin that was introduced in the third-generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.|$|R
50|$|Walther {{modified}} the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> and an accompanying spring on the PPS pistols to improve reliability. Early PPS pistols {{can be modified}} but need an enlargement of {{a hole in the}} pistol gripframe before the new style slide stop and spring can be installed. For this the pistol has to be sent in to the Walther customer service.|$|E
50|$|The M98 bolt {{group can}} be easily removed from the {{receiver}} simply by rotating the safety lever to the 12 o'clock position and pulling out the bolt <b>stop</b> <b>lever,</b> located at the rear left wall of the receiver, and then operate the action and continue rearward bolt travel past the bolt stop. The metal disc inlay in the stock functions as a bolt disassembly tool.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the very}} early GSPs were missing the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> which wasn't {{incorporated}} until the 1970s. The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch {{on the left side}} of the frame. This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol. Also throughout the years, the design of the ergonomic grips underwent several changes.|$|E
50|$|The slide <b>stop</b> release <b>lever</b> {{is located}} {{on the left side of}} the frame {{directly}} beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the shooting hand for right handed shooters. When a cartridge is present in the chamber the pistol can be fired without the need of having a magazine inserted in the weapon. Walther does however offer a magazine disconnect as an optional safety on some PPS pistols that will prevent discharging the pistol without a magazine present in the pistol.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, the FTb {{design was}} revised slightly. The camera {{was given a}} plastic tipped film advance <b>lever.</b> The <b>stop</b> down <b>lever</b> was changed to the same style as that found on the F-1. The PC sync socket was given a {{spring-loaded}} plastic cover. The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter speed display was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|R
40|$|Before World War II, most composers notated {{relatively}} few pedal indications, usually to create unsuspected effects. Mutations (Veranderungen) {{on the early}} pianos and the uses of hand <b>stops,</b> knee <b>levers,</b> and pedals are discussed based on information from extant instruments, composers 2 ̆ 7 autographs, and comments in tutors by such teachers as Johann Milchmeyer and Louis Adam. Pedaling techniques and uses of the damper, una corda, and sostenuto pedals on the changing instruments of the 19 th and 20 th c. are described, with particular attention to compositions of Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Brahms, Debussy, Villa-Lobos, Boulez, Cage, and Stockhausen...|$|R
5000|$|The Px4 Storm Compact {{is sized}} between the Full Size and the Subcompact models. It adopts the {{rotating}} barrel {{design of the}} full size pistols, but with a shorter and proportioned slide and grip. This model also introduces an ambidextrous slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> A high magazine capacity is maintained, with 15 rounds in 9 mm and 12 rounds in [...]40 S&W. The Px4 Storm Compact models accept the full size magazines as well, increasing capacity to 17 or 20 rounds in 9 mm and 14 or 17 rounds in [...]40 S&W.|$|E
50|$|The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} pistol. Barrel/slide locking is {{a simplified}} Colt-Browning design, {{similar to that}} found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking grooves within the slide, near the ejection port. The slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with safety catches on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear slide grooves, and directly behind the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right-handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The back sight is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, single feed magazine. Magazines with an 18 round capacity were produced after 2004.|$|E
50|$|Four of {{the known}} {{machines}} have inner wheels of complements, which were used to enter the first operand in a subtraction. They are mounted {{at the center of}} each spoked metal wheel and turn with it. The wheel displayed in the picture above has an inner wheel of complements but the numbers written on it are barely visible. On a decimal machine, the digits 0 through 9 are carved clockwise, with each digit positioned between two spokes so that the operator can directly inscribe its value in the window of complements by positioning his stylus in between them and turning the wheel clockwise {{all the way to the}} <b>stop</b> <b>lever.</b> The marks on two adjacent spokes flank the digit 0 inscribed on this wheel.|$|E
50|$|The woodies had {{a three-part}} zeroing mechanism: a <b>lever,</b> a <b>lever</b> <b>stop,</b> and a knob. In order to reset the machine, first push the <b>lever</b> toward the <b>stop,</b> start {{rotating}} the knob and release the lever {{as soon as}} the result numbers start to move. Continue rotating the knob until all the result numbers are reset.|$|R
50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever’s</b> axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|R
25|$|The Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or {{double stack}} {{magazines}} {{that have a}} 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 33-round high-capacity magazines. For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide <b>stop</b> release <b>lever</b> {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|R

50|$|The APS is a straight-blowback, select-fire, magazine-fed machine pistol. The {{weapon is}} fed through 20-round double-stack double-feed {{detachable}} steel box magazines. The APS shares common features with the Makarov service pistol, {{such as a}} heel-mounted magazine release, slide-mounted safety lever, and field-strip procedure. The rear sight is adjustable from 25, 50, 100 to 200 meters through an eccentric rotating drum/dial. The serrated front sight may be drifted for windage. The slide featured a textured strip on top to reduce aim-disturbing glare. The chrome-lined barrel serves as the recoil spring guide. The slide <b>stop</b> <b>lever</b> also acts as an ejector blade. The trigger guard pivots down for stripping and detents in position through a spring-loaded plunger. The checkered or serrated grips panels are made from wood (early models), reddish-brown bakelite or black plastic.|$|E

50|$|Noticed by the {{abnormal}} {{situation on}} the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of Electric Magnetic Lock Systems and Mechanical Power <b>Lever</b> <b>Stop</b> Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} electric magnetic lock system (Power Lever lock) was on open position. With power lever lock on open position, the solenoid of the electric magnetic lock system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power <b>lever</b> <b>stop</b> slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|R
5000|$|All {{variations}} of the pistols (save some law enforcement models that are decock only) include ambidextrous safety/decocking levers, magazine releases, and slide <b>stop</b> release <b>levers.</b> [...] All variations also include a Picatinny rail, tritium night sights, and a loaded chamber indicator on the right side. [...] New models are sold in a plastic hard case with three magazines, and two interchangeable backstraps. [...] As of 2012, new models include 4 interchangeable backstraps rather than two. One is shipped on the handgun and three extra are in the case. The backstraps are two different thicknesses and two different patterns (a cross-hatch pattern similar {{to the sides of}} the grip, and horizontal lines similar {{to the front of the}} grip).|$|R
5000|$|Walther {{presented}} a redesigned second generation P99 in 2004, incorporating a modified trigger guard that eliminated the [...] "ski hump", which is clearly {{visible in the}} accompanying first generation images. This was done to address user comfort concerns regarding the previous style.The first generation P99 pistols had a slide release at {{the left side of}} the frame while second generation guns may have optional ambidextrous slide <b>stop</b> release <b>levers.</b> Walther also took the opportunity to redesign the slide so the user could grip it more easily, and notably, change the proprietary accessory rail to a Weaver type.Some models built in 2005 and all later models received one more design change, an elongated magazine release.|$|R
