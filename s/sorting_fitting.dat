60|$|I {{had taken}} notice, in Captain Carton's boat, {{that there was}} a curious and quite new <b>sort</b> of <b>fitting</b> on board. It was a kind of a little bower made of flowers, and it was set up behind the captain, and betwixt him and the rudder. Not only was this arbour, so to call it, neatly made of flowers, but it was ornamented in a {{singular}} way. Some of the men had taken the ribbons and buckles off their hats, and hung them among the flowers; others had made festoons and streamers of their handkerchiefs, and hung them there; others had intermixed such trifles as bits of glass and shining fragments of lockets and tobacco-boxes with the flowers; so that altogether it was a very bright and lively object in the sunshine. But why there, or what for, I did not understand.|$|R
60|$|In {{any case}} {{it is clear that}} a change had begun to pass over {{scientific}} inquiry, of which we have seen the culmination in our own day. There had begun that easy automatic habit, of science as an oiled and smooth-running machine, that habit of treating things as obviously unquestionable, when, indeed, they are obviously questionable. This began with vaccination in the Early Victorian Age; it extended to the early licence of vivisection in its later age; it has found a <b>sort</b> of <b>fitting</b> foolscap, or crown of crime and folly, in the thing called Eugenics. In all three cases the point was not so much that the pioneers had not proved their case; it was rather that, by an unexpressed rule of respectability, they were not required to prove it. This rather abrupt twist of the rationalistic mind in the direction of arbitrary power, certainly weakened the Liberal movement from within. And meanwhile it was being weakened by heavy blows from without.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{existing}} extensive database on the isothermal and thermomechan-ical fatigue behaviour of high-temperature {{titanium alloy}} IMI 834 and dispersoid-strengthened aluminum alloy X 8019 in SiC particle-reinforced {{as well as}} unrein-forced conditions {{was used to evaluate}} both the adaptability of fracture mechanics approaches to TMF and the resulting predictive capabilities of determining mate-rial life by crack propagation consideration. Selection of the correct microstructural concepts was emphasised and these concepts were, then adjusted by using data from independent experiments in order to avoid any <b>sort</b> of <b>fitting.</b> It is shown that the cyclic J-integral (1 Jeff concept) is suitable to predict the cyclic lifetime for conditions where the total crack propagation rate is approximately identical to pure fatigue crack growth velocity. In the case that crack propagation is strongly affected by creep, the creep–fatigue damage parameter 1 CF introduced by Riedel can be successfully applied. If environmental effects are very pronounced, the accelerat-ing influence of corrosion on fatigue crack propagation can no longer implicitly be taken into account in the fatigue crack growth law. Instead, a linear combination of the crack growth rate contributions from plain fatigue (determined in vacuum) and from environmental attack is assumed and found to yield a satisfactory prediction, if the relevant corrosion process is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} and kinetics of {{the extraction of}} iron ions from crocidolite asbestos have been investigated {{over long periods of}} time (30 days). Various chelators (endogenous, analytical reagents and iron sequestering drugs) have been employed. The various chelators extracted iron to different extents. Their potency was unrelated to the thermodynamic stability constant but appears linked to a <b>sort</b> of <b>fitting</b> of the molecule at the particle surface. The mechanism of extraction reveals a fast release of surface iron followed by slow ion diffusion, whereby iron flows out of the fibres. Substitution of iron by other ions present in the solution causes struc-tural instability and collapse of the silica framework, confirmed by a parallel release of silicon into the supernatant at the end of the process. The surface shrinks and partly loses its original reactivity, however, new layers are progressively brought to the solid–liquid interface. Conversely, when the original fibres were in contact with iron bound to a weak chelator, such as Fe–NTA, the surface acts as a chelating agent and withdraws iron from the complex. This suggests that in vivo iron cycling may continuously take place at the particle surface. Modifica-tions of the redox state of iron, following incubation in deferoxamine, are evident from cyclic voltammetry. Although deprived of iron, the deferoxamine-treated fibres exhibited a higher amount of redox cycling iron ions than the original ones...|$|R
60|$|After the {{preparation}} was complete the body {{passed from the}} hands of the embalmers into those of another class, who enveloped it in its coverings. These were linen bandages, which {{in the case of the}} rich were sometimes a thousand yards in length. It was then inclosed in a <b>sort</b> of case <b>fitting</b> closely to the mummied body. This case was richly painted, covered in front with a network of beads and bugles arranged in a tasteful form, the face being overlaid with thick gold leaf and the eyes made of enamel. This again was placed in other cases, sometimes three or four in number, all similarly ornamented with painting and gilding, and the whole inclosed in a sarcophagus or coffin of wood or stone, profusely decorated with painting and sculpture. It was then handed over to the family of the deceased, and afterward taken in solemn procession across the sacred lake, followed by the mourning relatives throwing dust upon their heads.|$|R
30|$|The {{variation}} of the porosity {{is related to the}} sedimentation and diagenesis: the sedimentation mainly affects the initial value of the pore space, and the diagenesis has a more obvious transformation to the pore space. The sorting coefficients are mainly obtained by <b>fitting</b> <b>sorting</b> coefficients of core data in lab. The main component in Elec 1, Elec 2, and Elec 3 is volcanic rock with no concept of sorting coefficients. However, some researchers used the data of mercury injection to study the microstructure of volcanic rocks using the parameter to characterize the arrangement of volcanic particles (Qu et al. 2007). For exploratory research and result comparison, the sorting coefficient of the three electrofacies is set as two based on regional experience (Wang et al. 2018 a, b, c). Figure  11 shows the relationship between porosity and permeability, and {{it is obvious that the}} permeability becomes smaller as the value of porosity changes.|$|R

The Red Rose itself has been symbolic for various {{countries around the world}} but in Northern England the imagery is steeped in history with a series of civil wars called Wars of the Roses dealing with two branches of noble power who wanted the English throne for themselves, the house of Lancashire represented by the red rose and the house of York represented by the white rose.

6000|$|I {{would come}} back through the January mire or fog from Vincent Square {{to the door of}} 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish {{appreciation}} of the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its fine brass furnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey and discover Margaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a partially opened packing-case, fatigued but happy, or go up to have tea with her out of the right tea things, [...] "come at last," [...] or be told to notice what was fresh there. It wasn't simply that I had never had a house before, but I had really never been, except in the most transitory way, in any house that was nearly so delightful as mine promised to be. Everything was fresh and bright, and softly and harmoniously toned. Downstairs we had a green dining-room with gleaming silver, dark oak, and English colour-prints; above was a large drawing-room that could be made still larger by throwing open folding doors, and it was all carefully done in greys and blues, for the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by Sheraton so skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as to be indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above this and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially thick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead and a big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and window, and another desk specially made for me by that expert if I chose to stand and write, and open bookshelves and bookcases and every <b>sort</b> of convenient <b>fitting.</b> There were electric heaters beside the open fire, and everything was put for me to make tea at any time--electric kettle, infuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so that I could get up and work at any hour of the day or night. I could do no work in this apartment for a long time, I was so interested in the perfection of its arrangements. And when I brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret seized upon all the really shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a fine official-looking leather.|$|R
40|$|As {{with any}} {{language}} or dialect, Australian English {{has its share}} of idiomatic expressions in which simple-seeming words come together to produce a meaning inexplicable without cultural translation and therefore destined to mystify newcomers to the language. It might even be the reason such expressions exist in the first place. They are the linguistic equivalents of handshakes in Masonic temples, of passwords whispered to guards at fortress gates. The ones I remember being particularly baffled by – we arrived, my mum, dad and me, in Australia in 1990; my sister stayed in Europe – are “it’s my shout” (oh the stories I could tell you…) and “bring a plate” (likewise), though perhaps most puzzling of them all was a single word, unhyphenated and modestly prefixed: “overqualified”. Where we were from, you couldn’t be too educated or too experienced for a professional, skilled job. Not so in Australia, it turned out, not for new arrivals anyway. My father’s periodic removal from his résumé of his Ukrainian/Soviet PhD in hydraulics – a bizarre ritual of self-administered shrinkage, necessary, he was told, to get a “foot in the door” – has been replicated across decades by migrants to this country. Particularly by migrants from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe: the non-West guild. Melbourne writer Ralph Johnstone has told of two Somali men, Abdulkadir Shire and Ali-nur Duale, who in the course of 17 years of “downskilling” crossed out any hint of their respective Masters in petrochemical engineering and PhD in applied entomology from 300 -plus job applications. Still no joy. Because who could be less employable than an overqualified alien? Ridiculous business, this practically standing on your head not to appear too smart to prospective employers. As a migrant you are already up against it, what with the language barrier and the close-to-zero social capital and the sometimes not actually owning a pair of employment-ready pants to wear to a job interview. And then, crazily, you are compelled to hide your goods. Most people routinely inflate their capabilities in CVs (“selling themselves”, it’s called) whereas these PhDed migrants – my father, once upon a time – have been doing what, precisely? As far as I can tell they have been doing the Great Australian Undersell. The smaller you make yourself, the bigger the chance of the square peg that is (<b>sort</b> of) you <b>fitting</b> the round hole that is Australia’s jobs market. So there’s logic to it. But it is a pretty brick-like logic. Read the full article>...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} current state of law and economics, {{standard}} and behavioral, and proposes an additional element to the basic belief-desire apparatus of economic theory {{in order to create a}} more unified theory of behavior. The first part of the paper assesses the current status of standard economic theory. While standard models have had their successes, a large and growing body of empirical evidence reveals that people often fail to live up its rational-actor ideal. In response, economists usually stick with standard consumer theory and attempt to explain the anomalous results by referring to some overlooked input (e. g., some new belief) or by applying the old models in new ways (e. g., multiple-selves accounts). But there are some cases that standard approaches just can 2 ̆ 7 t explain, and they don 2 ̆ 7 t seem to have the resources needed to expand their explanatory reach. Behavioral economics, the focus of the second part of the paper, is not without problems of its own. Chief among these is that it has not coalesced into a unified theory of behavior. This is problematic because there are inconsistent (and irreconcilable) behavioral explanations for particular bits of behavior; it is also difficult to figure out how behavioral and standard accounts fit together. The root of the problem, though, is not that behavioral models are under-theorized, but that they are under-motivated. Behavioral economists often fail to draw a distinction between empirical evidence and what it is evidence for. This <b>sort</b> of curve <b>fitting</b> approach explains why behavioral explanations are less than satisfying, and also helps explain why behavioral economics has not coalesced into a unified theory. The usual methods for accommodating the empirical evidence regarding economic theory share the following feature: they take the basic economic account as canonical. Accept, reject, or tinker with the functional forms, most economists, standard and behavioral, confine themselves to thinking about the particular elements of common sense (namely, desires and beliefs) that originally inspired economic models. There is, however, another approach. Economic theory (and its successors) might be too distilled - after all, there is much more to our common-sense theory of behavior than the claim that people act to get what they want. Recognizing this possibility allows us to see that we can look for additional resources in common sense to enhance economic models in a top down instead of bottom up way. The third and final part of the paper discusses one such approach based on Frederic Schick 2 ̆ 7 s work on understandings. Drawn from the well of common-sense psychology, the concept of understandings presents an additional element to the basic belief-desire apparatus that underlies economic theory. The idea, in a nutshell, is that people normally consider their circumstances from a particular perspective and, as a result, they act on proper subsets of their beliefs and desires that reflect their take on their situations. This approach can be readily integrated into standard economic theory and is capable of shedding crucial light on many of the situations that give standard accounts trouble (and give rise to behavioral alternatives). As such, it is a step in the direction of a more unified theory of human behavior...|$|R
