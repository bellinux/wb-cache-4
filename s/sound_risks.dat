Ethylene concentrations in air are largely determined by natural sources.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Risk is a {{function}} of exposure and hazard, and both aspects must be incorporated into <b>sound</b> <b>risk</b> assessment efforts. However, risk assessment for sites contaminated with petro-leum products is complicated by a general lack of information relevant to exposure to and toxicity of petroleum mixtures (especially total petroleum hydrocarbons, or TPH). Specifically, there is often inadequate information about the components of the TPH present at the site and the physical and chemical properties and toxicities of these components. Such information is crucial to developing a strong conceptual model of exposure to and risk from petroleum hydrocarbons at contaminated sites. This article presents information that can be incorporated into risk assessments for sites contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.
