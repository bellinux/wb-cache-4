5|$|The 2/3rd Battalion's final {{involvement}} in the campaign came as the 16th Brigade advanced towards Sanananda in November. They left the Wairopi area on 16 November, with the battalion second in order of march. Tired and drained from the exertions {{of the last two}} months, the advance across the swamps of the coastal plain proved heavy work. On the first day they made , but after heavy rains the following day and failures in the resupply effort, a large number of men fell behind due to exhaustion. On 19 November, the 2/3rd spearheaded the brigade's advance to the coast. Several Japanese stragglers were taken prisoner and a number of minor contacts followed, but the Japanese defenders withdrew before the Australians could <b>shake</b> <b>out</b> to conduct an assault.|$|E

They also race three times but instead of the winners going to the Main they face their first group counterparts (who also went through the three-moto <b>shake</b> <b>out)</b> in the semi finals called the Semi-Main. Then the qualifiers face off in the Main. The same for races large enough for quarterfinals or Quarter-Mains, 1/8s and even 1/16s.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} now once again without a drummer and {{were forced to}} hold open auditions. The last to audition, Chad Smith, was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, {{according}} to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". Kiedis later said the audition with Smith left [...] " [...] {{in a state of}} frenzied laughter that we couldn't <b>shake</b> <b>out</b> of for a half an hour". Smith came from such a different background than his other three bandmates. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were more into the punk rock scene while Smith was into classic rock and heavy metal. Smith was officially hired in December 1988 and played a handful of shows with the band to finish out the year.|$|E
2500|$|According to Chris Thomas, who was present, the 9 September {{session was}} {{especially}} spirited: [...] "While Paul {{was doing his}} vocal, George Harrison had set fire to an ashtray and was running around the studio with it above his head, doing an Arthur Brown." [...] Starr's recollection is less detailed, but agrees in spirit: [...] "'Helter Skelter' was a track we did in total madness and hysterics in the studio. Sometimes {{you just had to}} <b>shake</b> <b>out</b> the jams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Politician and {{minister}} Jesse Jackson, {{a friend}} of Michael Jackson's family, said that the family was concerned about Murray's role. [...] "They {{have good reason to}} be [...] he left the scene." [...] Over the next few weeks, law enforcement grew increasingly concerned about the doctor, and on July 22 detectives searched Murray's medical office and storage unit in Houston, removing items such as a computer and two hard drives, contact lists and a hospital suspension notice. On the 27th, an anonymous source reported that Murray had administered propofol within 24 hours of Jackson's death. Murray's lawyers refused to comment on what they called [...] "rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources." [...] The following day it was reported that investigators had searched Murray's home and office in Las Vegas, and that Murray had become the primary focus of the investigation. On August 11, a Las Vegas pharmacy was searched by investigators looking for evidence regarding Murray, according to an anonymous police source. Murray's lawyer advised patience until the toxicology results arrived, noting that [...] "things tend to <b>shake</b> <b>out</b> when all the facts are made known". [...] On February 8, 2010, Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter by prosecutors in Los Angeles. Murray pleaded not guilty and was released after posting $75,000 (USD) bail. Shortly after, the California Medical Board issued an order preventing Murray from administering heavy sedatives.|$|E

2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{were again}} without a drummer and {{were forced to}} hold open auditions. Denise Zoom, {{a friend of the}} band, {{suggested}} Chad Smith, claiming he was the best drummer she had ever seen. The band agreed to audition Smith, but he was late and the last drummer to audition. Kiedis recalled {{the first time he saw}} Smith by saying, [...] "I spied this big lummox walking down the street with a really bad Guns N' Roses hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly found chemistry. Smith was a hard-hitting musician with whom the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship. Kiedis said the audition with Smith [...] "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't <b>shake</b> <b>out</b> of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by punk rock, whereas Smith's taste in heavy metal music and his biker appearance contrasted with their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition: as an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long hair. He refused, though Kiedis was not about to argue with the much larger Smith. Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.|$|E
