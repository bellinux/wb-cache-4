Previous works 1, 2, 3 have shown experimentally that the magnetic response (measured by Magneto-Optics) of small magnetic elements stacked into arrays depends on array parameters and that below a interaction threshold even the individual element magnetization reversal mechanism might change.

50|$|While {{a single}} {{magnetosome}} chain {{would appear to}} be ideal for magneto-aerotaxis, a number of magnetotactic bacteria have magnetosomes or magnetosome arrangements that depart from the ideal. One reported example includes large (up to 200 nm) magnetosomes found in coccoid cells in Brazil. These cells have enough magnetosomes so that the calculated magnetic dipole moment of the cell is about 250 times larger than that of a typical cell of Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. There are also examples of magnetotactic bacteria that contain hundreds of magnetosomes, many more than required for orientation. One large, rod-shaped organism, Magnetobacterium bavaricum, contains up to 1000 bulletshaped magnetosomes arranged in several chains traversing the cell. Some bacteria have magnetosomes that are not arranged in chains, but are clustered {{on one side of the}} cell. In such an arrangement, the <b>shape</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of each crystal provides the stability against remagnetization, rather than the overall <b>shape</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in the magnetosome chain arrangement.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effect of film {{thickness}} and rapid thermal annealing on the spin reorientations in Tb-Fe films grown on flexible polyimide substrates. Magnetization studies indicated that the spins reorient from in-plane to out-of-plane direction with increase in film thicknesses. This was confirmed by magnetic force microscopy studies which showed weak featureless contrast for films deposited with lower thickness and a strong out-of-plane contrast for films grown with higher thicknesses. On subsequent rapid thermal annealing all the Tb-Fe films exhibited in-plane magnetic anisotropy.

50|$|Although the {{exchange}} interaction keeps spins aligned, {{it does not}} align them in a particular direction. Without magnetic anisotropy, the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to thermal fluctuations and the magnet is superparamagnetic. There are several kinds of magnetic anisotropy, {{the most common of}} which is magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystallographic lattice. Another common source of anisotropy, inverse magnetostriction, is induced by internal strains. Single-domain magnets also can have a <b>shape</b> <b>anisotropy</b> due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape. As the temperature of a magnet increases, the anisotropy tends to decrease, and there is often a blocking temperature at which a transition to superparamagnetism occurs.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic torque {{magnetometry}} can be {{even more}} sensitive than SQUID magnetometry. However, magnetic torque magnetometry doesn’t measure magnetism directly as all the previously mentioned methods do.

In other cases, the magnetic torque measurement is used to detect magnetic phase transitions or quantum oscillations. The most common way to measure magnetic torque is to mount the sample on a cantilever and measure the displacement via capacitance measurement between the cantilever and nearby fixed object, or by measuring the piezoelectricity of the cantilever, or by optical interferometry off the surface of the cantilever.|$|E

The studied systems include the mouse embryo, Drosophila epithelium, Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers [...] and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).The {{mechanism}} of the 'long axis rule' relies on interphase cell long axis sensing. However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on {{the orientation of the}} cell division is made by the spindle apparatus. The spindle apparatus then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the interphase cell long axis. The cell then divides along the spindle apparatus orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ) participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about interphase cell <b>shape</b> <b>anisotropy</b> to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in Drosophila melanogaster and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.|$|E

The obtained equation is used for the investigation of the gas-liquid-nematic phase behavior of a molecular system depending on the <b>anisotropy</b> of molecule <b>shapes,</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of attractive intermolecular interactions, and porosity of a porous medium. It is shown that the anisotropic phase is formed by the anisotropy of attractive intermolecular interactions and by the <b>anisotropy</b> of molecular <b>shapes.</b> The <b>anisotropy</b> of molecular <b>shapes</b> shifts the phase diagram to lower densities and higher temperatures. The anisotropy of attractive interactions widens significantly the coexistence region between the isotropic and anisotropic phases and shifts it to the region of lower densities and higher temperatures.

For all the considered cases, the decrease of the porosity shifts the phase diagram to the region of lower densities and lower temperatures. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
