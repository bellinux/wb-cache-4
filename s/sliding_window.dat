5|$|On 12 January, one of {{the most}} unusual aerial battles of the Vietnam War took place. Two Soviet-built An-2 Colt biplanes of the North Vietnamese Air Force {{attacked}} Lima Site 85 atop a craggy peak known as Phou Pha Thi. An Air America Bell 205 helicopter, which had taken off to avoid air-dropped 120mm mortar rounds, then began chasing {{one of the}} Colts which had already been struck by ground fire. The aircraft crashed while making evasive maneuvers. The Bell then went after the other Colt, and the helicopter's crew chief fired an AK-47 through a <b>sliding</b> <b>window,</b> shooting the biplane down.|$|E

40|$|In the {{streaming}} model, elements arrive sequentially and can {{be observed}} only once. Maintaining statistics and aggregates is an important and non-trivial task in the model. This becomes even more challenging in the <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> model, where statistics must be maintained only over the most recent n elements. In their pioneering paper, Datar, Gionis, Indyk and Motwani [15] presented exponential histograms, an effective method for estimating statistics on <b>sliding</b> <b>windows.</b> In this paper we present a new smooth histograms method that improves the approximation error rate obtained via exponential histograms. Furthermore, our smooth histograms method not only captures and improves multiple previous results on <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> but also extends the class functions that can be approximated on <b>sliding</b> <b>windows.</b> In particular, we provide the first approximation algorithms for the following functions: Lp norms for p / ∈ [1, 2], frequency moments, length of increasing subsequence and geometric mean...|$|R

Genes can generate duplicates of themselves which are incorporated in their neighborhood. These duplicates can either became a functional part of the pathway of their parent gene, or (because {{they are no longer}} favored by natural selection) gain deleterious mutations and turn into pseudogenes. Because these duplicates are false positives in the search for gene clusters they have to be excluded. Lercher excluded neighboring genes with high resemblance to each other, after that he searched with a <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> for regions with 15 neighboring genes.|$|E

Signs saying [...] "Men Under 21 Keep Out" [...] were commonplace, {{and in the next}} census, prostitution had completely disappeared as a declared profession in Butte. The Dumas, however, remained in operation. In 1925 Anne Vallet began overseeing the Dumas for the Nadeau family, and in the 1930s, operations had passed to Madam Rose Davis. In 1940 Lillian Walden and her husband Dick began running the brothel, raising the price of sex at the brothel to $2. Three years later, the US government ordered all brothels shut down {{to prevent the spread of}} venereal diseases among soldiers in World War II. In response, the Dumas began operating even more furtively, now under the guise of being a boardinghouse. The [...] "window-shopping" [...] was abandoned completely and a heavy steel door was installed at the back of the Dumas with a small sliding window; customers would only gain entrance after the <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> was opened and their identity was acknowledged.

40|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> {{model is}} an {{important}} case of the streaming model, where only the most “recent ” elements remain active and the rest are discarded in a stream. The <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> model is important for many applications (see, e. g., Babcock, Babu, Datar, Motwani and Widom (PODS 02); and Datar, Gionis, Indyk and Motwani (SODA 02)). There are two equally important types of the <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> model – windows with fixed size, (e. g., where items arrive one at a time, and only the most recent n items remain active for some fixed parameter n), and bursty windows (e. g., where many items can arrive in “bursts ” at a single step and where only items from the last t steps remain active, again for some fixed parameter t). Random sampling is a fundamental tool for data streams, as numerous algorithms operate on the sampled data {{instead of on the}} entire stream. Effective sampling from <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> is a nontrivial problem, as elements eventually expire. In fact, the deletions are implicit; i. e., {{it is not possible to}} identify deleted elements without storing the entire window. The implicit nature of deletions on <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> does not allow the existing methods (even those that support explicit deletions, e. g., Cormode, Muthukrishnan and Rozenbaum (VLDB 05); Frahling, Indyk and Sohler (SOCG 05)) to be directly “translated ” to the <b>sliding</b> <b>windows</b> model. One trivial approach to overcoming the problem of implicit deletions is that of over-sampling. When k samples are required, the over-sampling method maintains k ′> k samples in the hope that at least k samples are not expired. The obvious disadvantages of this method are twofold: (a) It introduces additional costs and thus decreases th...|$|R

2500|$|Colloquial {{usage of}} the term 'PSK31' in amateur radio usually implies {{the use of the}} most {{commonly}} used variant of PSK31: binary phase shift keying (BPSK). [...] BPSK uses no error control, but an allied mode, QPSK31 quadrature phase shift keying, uses four phases instead of two, to provide a degree of forward error correction. [...] It is simple to switch from BPSK to QPSK if difficulties arise during a contact. [...] When QPSK is used; after encoding into varicode, the binary signal is further transformed into a quaternary set of phase shifts. [...] A <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> of five bits is used to select one of the four possible phase shifts, providing a means of error correction by spreading each bit of data across adjacent bits. [...] Successful decoding of an input bit requires a large number of phase shift sequences to be received, causing a 20-bit, 640-millisecond latency (delay) in the output of the decoder.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista and its successors added {{minor changes}} to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu {{consisted}} of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a Search box that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu search box replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support Jump lists through cascade buttons on their right. Unlike prior versions, the ability to revert to the [...] "Classic" [...] Start menu design is no longer available.|$|E
