40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of salbutamol and its <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> metabolite {{were investigated}} after intravenous and steady-state oral administration of salbutamol to 10 healthy volunteers. With intravenous administration, total plasma clearance was 480 +/- 123 ml min- 1, elimination half-life was 3. 86 +/- 0. 83 h and apparent volume of distribution was 156 +/- 381. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> were 64. 2 +/- 7. 1 % and 12. 0 +/- 3. 1 % of the dose, respectively. With oral administration, systemic availability was 0. 50 +/- 0. 04, and urinary excretion of unchanged drug and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> were 31. 8 +/- 1. 9 % and 48. 2 +/- 7. 3 % of the dose, respectively. The drug eliminated on the first-pass could {{be accounted for}} entirely as <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> formed, presumably, in the intestinal wall. Renal clearance of salbutamol was 291 +/- 70 ml min- 1 after intravenous and 272 +/- 38 ml min- 1 after oral administration, while the renal clearance of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> was 98. 5 +/- 23. 5 ml min- 1 after oral administration.

The fractional urinary excretion of unchanged paracetamol and its conjugates was independent of the route of administration at both dose levels, suggesting that the gastrointestinal tract is not an important site for paracetamol metabolism. The percentage of the dose excreted as the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> was significantly higher after 5 than after 20 mg/kg (37. 7 % and 33. 3 % respectively) and {{this is consistent with}} saturation of sulphate conjugation. No significant effect of paracetamol dose upon the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corrected for dose, was found for the sulphate or glucuronide conjugates. The total plasma clearance of paracetamol and the renal clearance of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> were significantly higher after the 5 than the 20 mg/kg dose (331 +/- 42 ml/min and 295 +/- 48 ml/min; 273 +/- 74 ml/min and 205 +/- 46 ml/min respectively).

The glucuronide conjugates had a half-life of 0. 4 h in raw sewage, yielding 40 - 60 % of their free estrogens. Field observations suggested complete transformation of the glucuronide conjugates in the sewer. In river water glucuronide conjugate half-lives extended to over two days yielding 60 - 100 % of their free parent estrogens. Transformation of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> in raw sewage and river water was slow with little formation of the parent estrogens. <b>Sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> could readily be detected in sewage influent in the field studies. In activated sludge the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> had half lives of 0. 2 h with the transient formation of 10 - 55 % of the free parent estrogens. Field studies indicated transformation of <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> across the sewage treatment, although a proportion escaped into the effluent. These results broadly {{support the view that}} glucuronide conjugates will be entirely transformed within the sewer largely to their parent estrogens.

Mucosal biotransformation has been well documented in the small and large intestine of animals and humans but whether the gastric mucosa plays a role in detoxifying ingested compounds remains largely unknown. The conjugation of the model phenolic compounds, 1 -naphthol, by human gastric epithelial cells was assessed in vitro. Freshly isolated and cultured epithelial cells were prepared from surgical specimens obtained from patients undergoing total gastrectomy for cancer. Cell preparations were incubated with 1 - 14 C-naphthol over 1 hour and the glucuronide and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> formed were separated by thin-layer chromatography. Conjugation of 1 -naphthol was observed with both freshly isolated and cultured cells. In freshly isolated cells, the 1 hour turnover of 1 microM 1 -naphthol to its glucuronide and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> averaged 19 % and 10 % respectively. At higher 1 -naphthol concentrations, both types of conjugate were formed at about the same rate, up to saturation (apparent Vmax = 0. 07 nmol/mg protein/minute, and apparent Km = 40 microM). In cultured cells, the 1 hour turnover of 1 microM 1 -naphthol to its glucuronide and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> averaged 35 % and 8 % respectively.

40|$|To gather more {{information}} on stereochemical factors in the hepatic disposition of organic cations, mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography {{was used to determine}} the identity of the metabolites excreted in bile after isolated rat liver perfusions with the quaternary ammonium derivatives of the enantiomeric drugs dextrorphan and levorphanol. Ionspray mass spectrometry was chosen for its soft ionization and absence of thermal degradation of labile compounds. The drugs were labelled with a stable (H- 2) isotope and mixed with unlabelled drugs to create an artificial isotope pattern in the mass spectrum and facilitate the recognition of unknown metabolites. In mass spectra that were recorded under normal conditions, fragmentation was absent and metabolites of N-methyl dextrorphan and N-methyl levorphanol were visible as parent-ion 'doublets'. Collision-induced fragmentation studies were performed to support the identification of the metabolites. For N-methyl dextrorphan the glucuronide, the glutathione conjugate and the glucuronide of the N-demethylated metabolite were found in bile. For N-methyl levorphanol the glucuronide, the glutathione conjugate, the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> and the glucuronide of a hydroxylated N-methyl levorphanol were excreted in bile. Thus a remarkable stereoselectivity occurs in the metabolism of these quaternary ammonium compounds in the rat liver...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of diflunisal, a {{salicylate derivative}} that undergoes phenolic and acyl glucuronidation {{as well as}} sulphate conjugation, has been studied after a single oral dose (250 mg) in patients with cirrhosis (n = 5) and in healthy controls (n = 5). The plasma clearance of total (bound + unbound) diflunisal was 10. 2 ml. min- 1 in the control subjects {{and it was not}} affected by cirrhosis (10. 9 ml. min- 1). The plasma protein binding of diflunisal was significantly reduced in cirrhosis; the percentage of unbound diflunisal in plasma was 0. 089 in the controls and 0. 147 in the patients with cirrhosis. Plasma clearance of unbound diflunisal was significantly impaired in cirrhosis: 11. 51. min- 1 in control subjects vs 7. 41. min- 1 in cirrhotics. In cirrhotic patients, the unbound partial clearances to the phenolic and acyl glucuronides were both significantly reduced, by approximately 38 %. The unbound partial clearance to the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> was not significantly affected by cirrhosis.

The bile acids were subjected to a group separation and identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The techniques were developed to allow identification of the minor components of the bile acid mixture. Four bile acids that have not previously been described in human urine and plasma were detected, namely 3 beta, 7 alpha-dihydroxy- 5 beta-cholan- 24 -oic acid, 3 alpha, 6 alpha-dihydroxy- 5 beta-cholan- 24 -oic acid (hyodeoxycholic acid), 3 alpha, 6 alpha, 7 alpha-trihydroxy- 5 beta-cholan- 24 -oic acid (hyocholic acid) and 3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha-trihydroxy- 5 beta-cholan- 24 -oic acid. In addition three C 27 steroids were found; 26 -hydroxycholesterol and a trihydroxy cholestane, probably 5 beta-cholestane- 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 26 -triol {{were found in the}} sulphate fraction of plasma and urine. In the plasma sample, a <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> of 24 -hydroxycholesterol was found.

40|$|For {{years it}} has been {{suspected}} that natural hormones are illegally used as growth promoters in cattle in the European Union. Unfortunately {{there is a lack}} of methods and criteria that can be used to detect the abuse of natural hormones and distinguish treated from non-treated animals. Pattern recognition of steroid profiles is a promising approach for tracing/detecting the abuse of natural hormones administered to cattle. Traditionally steroids are analysed in urine as free steroid after deconjugation of the glucuronide (and <b>sulphate)</b> <b>conjugates.</b> The disadvantage of this deconjugation is that valuable information about the steroid profile in the sample is lost. In this study we develop a method to analyse steroids at very low concentration levels (ng l- 1) for the free steroid, glucuronide and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> in urine samples. This method was used to determine concentrations of natural (pro) hormones in a large population (n¿=¿ 620) of samples from male and female bovine animals and from bovine animals treated with testosterone-cypionate, estradiol-benzoate, dihydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone.

In UASB septic tank effluent a (natural) total concentration of 4. 02 mg/L E 1 and 18. 69 mg/L E 2, comprising the sum of conjugated (> 70 % for E 1 and > 80 % for E 2) and unconjugated forms, was measured. During post-treatment the unconjugated oestrogens were removed to below 1 mg/L. A percentage of 77 % of the measured unconjugated E 1 and 82 % of E 2 was associated with particles > 1. 2 mm in the final effluent implying high sorption affinity of both compounds. When spiking the UASB septic tank effluent with E 1, E 2, EE 2 and the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> of E 2, removal in the micro-aerobic post-treatment was > 99 % for both E 2 and EE 2 and 83 % for E 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to elucidate stereoselective mechanisms of propranolol metabolism in man. Five normal subjects were given single 80 mg oral doses of deuterium-labeled pseudoracemates of propranolol, and the stereochemical composition of propranolol and its major metabolites in urine was determined by GC/MS. The (-) /(+) -enantiomer ratios for unchanged propranolol, 1. 50 +/- 0. 10 (mean +/- s. e. mean), and propranolol glucuronide, 1. 76 +/- 0. 10, were similar to previous findings in plasma. All products of side-chain oxidation also consisted mainly of the (-) -enantiomer, with an overall (-) /(+) ratio of 1. 61 +/- 0. 11. A (-) /(+) ratio of 1. 04 +/- 0. 17 for 4 -hydroxypropranolol did not indicate stereoselectivity in ring oxidation. However, the ratio for its glucuronic acid conjugate of 1. 78 +/- 0. 19 and for its <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate</b> of 0. 27 +/- 0. 03 suggested stereoselectivity in either the glucuronidation or sulphation of 4 -hydroxypropranolol, or both. When the stereoselectivity in these secondary pathways was taken into consideration, the overall ring oxidation strongly favoured (+) -propranolol with a (-) /(+) -enantiomer ratio of 0. 59 +/- 0. 09. The composite observations of the stereochemistry of propranolol metabolism in man are consistent with stereoselective ring oxidation of (+) -propranolol, leading to a greater bioavailability of the pharmacologically more active (-) -propranolol and subsequent preferential side-chain oxidation and glucuronidation of this enantiomer...|$|E

Steady state plasma concentrations of the sulphate and glucuronide conjugates of diflunisal were 2. 5 - to 3. 1 -fold higher during probenecid co-administration, due to a significant reduction in the renal clearance of the three diflunisal conjugates.

Tissue viability was routinely assessed by measurement of the transmural potential difference. The percentage of steroid in the serosal chamber, 2 h after addition of EE 2 (2 microCi; 80 ng) to the mucosal chamber was 2. 3 +/- 0. 8 % (mean +/- s. d.) which comprised unconjugated drug (0. 4 +/- 0. 3 %), <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> (0. 7 +/- 0. 5 %) and glucuronides (0. 9 +/- 0. 8 %).

40|$|Background. Uraemic toxins are {{considered}} to be emerging mortality risk factors in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. p-Cresol (a prototype protein-bound uraemic retention solute) has been shown to exert toxic effects in vitro. Recently, it has been demonstrated that p-cresol is present in plasma as its <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugate,</b> p-cresylsulphate. The present study evaluated the distribution of free and total p-cresylsulphate and sought to determine whether these parameters were associated with vascular calcification, arterial stiffness and mortality risk in a cohort of CKD patients. Methods. One hundred and thirty-nine patients (mean SD age: 67 +/- 12; males: 60 %) at different stages of CKD (8 % at Stage 2, 26. 5 % at Stage 3, 26. 5 % at Stage 4, 7 % at Stage 5 and 32 % at Stage 5 D) were enrolled in this study. Results. Baseline total and free p-cresylsulphate presented an inverse relationship with renal function and were significantly associated with vascular calcification. During the study period (mean follow-up period: 779 +/- 185 days), 38 patients died [including 22 from cardiovascular (CV) causes]. In crude survival analyses, free (but not total) p-cresylsulphate was shown to be a predictor of overall and CV death. Higher free p-cresylsulphate levels (> 0. 051 mg/ 100 mL; median) were associated with mortality independently of well-known predictors of survival such as age, vascular calcification, anaemia and inflammation. Conclusions. Serum levels of free and total p-cresylsulphate (the main in vivo circulating metabolites of p-cresol) were elevated in later CKD stages. However, only free p-cresylsulphate seems to be a predictor of survival in CKD...|$|E

E 3040 sulphate inhibited Tx synthase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 = 0. 013 [*]μM), whereas it induced little effects on 5 -LOX and cyclo-oxygenase activities (IC 50 > 100 [*]μM) with the cell-free enzyme assay. With isolated rat colonic mucosa, E 3040 sulphate in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 = 1. 8 [*]μM) inhibited the Cl− secretion induced by 10 [*]μM PAF. On the other hand, E 3040 sulphate (30 [*]μM) induced no effect on the prostaglandin E 2 (0. 5 [*]μM) - and leukotriene D 4 (1 [*]μM) -induced Cl− secretion in the colon. PAF (10 [*]μM) increased a release of TxB 2, a stable metabolite of TxA 2, from the colonic mucosa. This increase was significantly inhibited by subsequent addition of E 3040 sulphate (30 [*]μM). Probenecid (100 [*]μM), an inhibitor of organic anion transporter, abolished the inhibitory effect of E 3040 sulphate on the PAF-induced Cl− secretion. Another inhibitor, sulphobromophthalein (30 [*]μM) partially but significantly attenuated the effect of E 3040 sulphate. p-Aminohippuric acid (1 [*]mM) had no effect.

The estrone- 3 -sulphate, estradiol- 3 -sulphate and estriol- 3 -sulphate concentrations (up to 20 ng/L) were typically fivefold that of their respective free estrogen concentrations in the effluents. This represents a substantial additional ‘potential’ estrogen load arriving in the receiving waters. Estrone- 3 -glucuronide was found at 9. 3 ng/L, estradiol- 3 -glucuronide at 7. 0 ng/L, and estriol- 3 -glucuronide at 32. 2 ng/L in sewage influent. Except on one occasion, no glucuronide conjugates could be found in the effluent [...] The results suggest in most cases glucuronide conjugates will be completely transformed in sewage treatment whilst <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> will only be partially removed...|$|R
40|$|Soy isoflavones {{are thought}} to have a cardioprotective effect that is partly {{mediated}} by an inhibitory influence on the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL). However, the aglycone forms investigated in many previous studies do not circulate in appreciable quantities because they are metabolised in the gut and liver. We investigated effects of various isoflavone metabolites, including {{for the first time the}} <b>sulphated</b> <b>conjugates</b> formed in the liver and the mucosa of the small intestine, on copper-induced LDL oxidation. The parent aglycones inhibited oxidation, although only 5 % as well as quercetin. Metabolism increased or decreased their effectiveness. Equol inhibited 2. 65 -fold better than its parent compound daidzein and 8 -hydroxydaidzein, not previously assessed, was 12. 5 -fold better than daidzein. However, monosulphated conjugates of genistein, daidzein and equol were much less effective and disulphates completely ineffective. Since almost all isoflavones circulate as conjugates, these data suggest that despite the increased potency produced by some metabolic changes, isoflavones may not be effective antioxidants in vivo unless they are deconjugated again...|$|R
40|$|In a {{comparative}} study, {{a relatively simple}} and high sensitivity method was developed for analysis of testosterone-equivalent(s) in the faeces of different bird species. To determine the recovery of extractions and purifications, tritium-labelled testosterone {{was added to the}} wet samples. Then the samples were treated with sodium dodecil sulphate (SDS), an emulsificator to “open-up” the complex, lipid-coated particles of faecal samples. This emulsification resulted in the decrease of the quantity of interfering substances after diethyl-ether extraction and the linearity of the measured testosterone equivalents from aliquots in the range of 2 and 10 mg of faeces. In the RIA, we applied a group specific polyclonal testosterone antibody which cross-reacted with reduced metabolites and at a certain level with <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> as well. The use of Helix enzymes did not modified significantly the results of the analysis relating to a low level of conjugated androgens in the faecal extracts. The biological validity of the method was tested on domestic cockerels, where between the plasma and faecal testosterone values a four hours phase shift was observed, with a correlation of 0. 6355. This method is suitable for “non invasive”, behavioural-ethological studies...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{in vitro}} and in animal models of {{colorectal}} and hepatocellular cancers suggest that curcumin {{is an effective}} chemopreventive agent. In this pilot trial, we investigated whether oral administration of curcumin results in concentrations of the agent in normal and malignant human liver tissue, which are sufficient to elicit pharmacological activity. In total, 12 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer received 450 - 3600 mg of curcumin daily, for 1 week prior to surgery. Levels of curcumin and its metabolites were measured by HPLC in portal and peripheral blood, bile and liver tissue. Curcumin was poorly available, following oral administration, with low nanomolar levels of the parent compound and its glucuronide and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> found in the peripheral or portal circulation. While curcumin was not found in liver tissue, trace levels of products of its metabolic reduction were detected. In patients who had received curcumin, levels of malondialdehyde-DNA (M(1) G) adduct, which reflect oxidative DNA changes, were not decreased in post-treatment normal and malignant liver tissue when compared to pretreatment samples. The results suggest that doses of curcumin required to furnish hepatic levels sufficient to exert pharmacological activity are probably not feasible in humans. 1730...|$|R

40|$|Toxicity of halobenzenes {{has been}} {{ascribed}} mainly to their epoxides, but recent studies with bromobenzene {{have shown that}} secondary quinone metabolites are also involved in the alkylation of hepatic proteins. However, the relative contribution of the quinones and the epoxides to the toxicity of halobenzenes is still unclear. In order to investigate the relation between metabolism and toxicity of 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (1, 2 -DCB), the biotransformation, tissue distribution, blood kinetics, and excretion at three different oral dose levels (5, 50 and 250 mg/kg) of the radiolabelled compound were investigated in the male Wistar rat. A toxic dose level (250 mg/kg, as demonstrated by Allis et al. 1992) was included. The major route of elimination (75 - 85 %) was renal excretion. Excretion via the faeces ranged from 19 % for the low dose to 7 % for the high-dose level. Excretion was nearly complete within 24 h for the low and mid-dose level, and within 48 h for the highdose level. Pretreatment with phenobarbital resulted in a more rapid excretion for the highdose level and an overall higher urinary excretion. Biliary excretion was 50 - 60 %, indicating a considerable enterohepatic circulation. Highest concentrations of radioactivity after a low dose were found in fat, liver and kidney at 6 h after administration, and then declined rapidly. The maximum concentration of radioactivity in blood was reached at 6 - 8 h for the low and mid-dose level, and at 24 h for the high-dose level. The concentration of parent chemical was essentially constant during 3 and 6 h for the mid- and high-dose level respectively, and then declined. 1, 2 -DCB could only be detected in blood in the first 2 h after administration of the 5 -mg/kg dose. The major route of biotransformation was via the glutathione pathway and 60 % of the urinary metabolites were mercapturic acids. In addition, the major metabolites in bile were conjugates of glutathione. Other major metabolites in urine were the <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> of 2, 3 - and 3, 4 -dichlorophenol (DCP). No significant differences in metabolic profiles were observed between the different doses. Induction with phenobarbital resulted in the increased excretion of <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> (30 % in the induced rat, 20 % in the control rat), mainly the conjugate of 3, 4 -DCP. The mercapturic acids in urine and glutathione conjugates in bile were epoxide-derived, whereas no quinone- or hydroquinone-derived metabolites were observed. Therefore the hepatotoxicity of 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene {{is assumed to be}} related, at least partly, to the presence of the intermediate arene oxide. A high dose of 1, 2 -DCB will result in depletion of GSH, followed by oxidative stress and possible binding to macromolecules.

40|$|The {{amount and}} form of dietary casein {{have been shown}} to affect energy {{metabolism}} and lipid accumulation in mice, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We in-vestigated 48 hrs urinary metabolome, hepatic lipid composition and gene expression in male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice fed Western diets with 16 or 32 energy % protein in the form of exten-sively hydrolyzed or intact casein. LC-MS based metabolomics revealed a very strong impact of casein form on the urinary metabolome. Evaluation of the discriminatory metabolites using tandemmass spectrometry indicated that intake of extensively hydrolyzed casein modulated Phase II metabolism associated with an elevated urinary excretion of glucuronic acid- and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugated</b> molecules, whereas glycine conjugated molecules were more abundant in urine frommice fed the intact casein diets. Despite the differences in the urinary metabo-lome, we observed no differences in hepatic expression of genes involved in Phase II metab-olism, but it was observed that expression of Abcc 3 encoding ATP binding cassette c 3 (transporter of glucuronic acid conjugates) was increased in livers of mice fed hydrolyzed ca-sein. As glucuronic acid is derived from glucose and sulphate is derived from cysteine, our metabolomic data provided evidence for changes in carbohydrate and amino acid metabo-lism and we propose that this modulation of metabolism was associated with the reduced glu-cose and lipid levels observed in mice fed the extensively hydrolyzed casein diets...|$|R
40|$|Insight {{into the}} {{mechanisms}} of intestinal transport and metabolism of aspalathin will provide important information for dose optimisation, in particular for studies using mouse models. Aspalathin transportation across the intestinal barrier (Caco- 2 monolayer) tested at 1 – 150 µM had an apparent rate of permeability (Papp) typical of poorly absorbed compounds (1. 73 × 10 − 6 cm/s). Major glucose transporters, sodium glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT 1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2), and efflux protein (P-glycoprotein, PgP) (1. 84 × 10 − 6 cm/s; efflux ratio: 1. 1) were excluded as primary transporters, since the Papp of aspalathin was not affected {{by the presence of}} specific inhibitors. The Papp of aspalathin was also not affected by constituents of aspalathin-enriched rooibos extracts, but was affected by high glucose concentration (20. 5 mM), which decreased the Papp value to 2. 9 × 10 − 7 cm/s. Aspalathin metabolites (sulphated, glucuronidated and methylated) were found in mouse urine, but not in blood, following an oral dose of 50 mg/kg body weight of the pure compound. Sulphates were the predominant metabolites. These findings suggest that aspalathin is absorbed and metabolised in mice to mostly <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> detected in urine. Mechanistically, we showed that aspalathin is not actively transported by the glucose transporters, but presumably passes the monolayer paracellularly...|$|R
5000|$|Altogether, the {{metabolic}} fate of triazofos in dogs {{was similar to}} that in rats [...] The urine consisted of the same three metabolites as in rats. However, there was one other metabolite found only in the dog’s urine representing 11% of the administered dose. It was considered to be another <b>sulphate</b> ester <b>conjugate</b> of the 1-phenyl-3-hydroxy-(1H)-1,2,4-triazole metabolite. There was no unchanged triazofos found in the urine of the dogs. The faeces contained low concentrations of triazofos and the free 1-phenyl-3-hydroxy-(1H)-1,2,4-triazole metabolite as well as five unidentified metabolites at about 0.7, 0.3 and 7.3% of the administered dose, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the glucuronide and <b>sulphate</b> <b>conjugates</b> of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol {{was demonstrated}} in vitro {{by using the}} high-speed supernatant and microsomal fractions of liver respectively. These two conjugates were also produced simultaneously by using the post-mitochondrial fraction of rat, rabbit or guinea-pig liver. In contrast only the glucuronide was synthesized by human liver and only the sulphate by mouse and cat livers. Neither of these conjugates was formed by the kidney or the small or large intestine of the rat. A high sulphate-conjugating activity was observed in mouse kidney; the rate of sulphation of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol with kidney homogenate and high-speed supernatant preparations was 1. 8 times greater than with liver preparations. The sulpho-conjugates of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy-phenylglycol were also formed by enzyme preparations of rabbit adrenal and rat brain; the glycol was the better substrate in the latter system. Mouse brain did not possess any sulphotransferase activity. For the conjugation of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol by rabbit liver, the Km for UDP-glucuronic acid was 0. 22 mM and that for Na 2 SO 4 was 3. 45 mM. The sulphotransferase has a greater affinity for 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl-ethanol than has glucuronyltransferase, as indicated by their respective Km values of 0. 036 and 1. 3 mM. It was concluded that sulphate conjugation of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenylethanol predominates in most species of animals...|$|R
