5000|$|The Dun at Wallstale (NS774909) {{was partly}} {{excavated}} in June 1965.. A trench was {{cut across the}} line of the wall and into the interior, revealing that the wall was about 11 feet thick and exposing other interesting constructional features. A few minor artifacts were found, including fragments of rotary and <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> quern stones, a piece of slag and a stone with a groove, possibly for sharpening needles.|$|E
50|$|The Arabian and Morgan breeds produce horses {{specially}} bred for {{the western}} disciplines and offer western pleasure classes that draw large numbers of competitors. Breeds such as the American Saddlebred or Friesian have smaller numbers competing in western competition than other events, but classes are available. Most gaited horses fall into the <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> category in terms of desired frame and style, though judging criteria for their gaits differs significantly from that of non-gaited breeds.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{endurance}} saddle {{manufacturers have}} been innovative in methods to lighten weight and provide additional comfort for the horse, {{and several of}} these techniques {{have gone on to}} influence other <b>saddle</b> <b>types.</b> The panels are stuffed with different types of material, all designed to spread pressure evenly and disperse sweat. Most endurance saddles may have extended panels (called [...] "fans" [...] or [...] "blazers"), which increase bearing area. Others may have [...] "floating" [...] panels, which are particularly useful since endurance riders often ride with their seat out of the saddle (releasing pressure from the back, but increasing the amount felt on the stirrup bars where they attach near the point of the tree).|$|R

There are two acceptable types of Coffin Bay ponies, the lighter <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> and a slightly stronger type with clean legs, for both driving and riding.|$|E
5000|$|The Latvian Horse ('Latvijas šķirne', [...] "Latvian breed") is a purpose-bred warmblood horse breed from Latvia. Breeding {{began in}} Latvia {{in the early}} twentieth century, and a herd book was {{established}} in 1927. The breed was officially recognised in 1952. There are two types, sometimes called the Latvian Harness Horse and the Latvian Riding Horse. The harness type was predominant until about 1960, when demand for sport horses increased and more of the <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> were bred.|$|E

Its construction was featured in a NOVA documentary entitled Super Bridge, which highlighted the challenges of building the bridge, especially during the Great Flood of 1993. Designed by Hanson Engineers under contract to Illinois Department of Transportation (DOT), the Clark Bridge was the first in the United States in which [...] "such a light steel-framed cable-stayed design was combined with a cable <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> of pylon." [...] The bridge used 8,100 tons of structural steel; 44,100 cubic yards of concrete; and more than 160 miles of cable wrapped with four acres of yellow plastic piping.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of diaphragm valves: one type seals over a [...] "weir" [...] (saddle) and the other (sometimes called a [...] "full bore or straight-way" [...] valve) seals over a seat. The weir or <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> {{is the most common}} in process applications and the seat-type is more commonly used in slurry applications to reduce blocking issues but exists also as a process valve. While diaphragm valves usually come in two-port forms (2/2-way diaphragm valve), they can also come with three ports (3/2-way diaphragm valves also called T-valves) and more (so called block-valves). When more than three ports are included, they generally require more than one diaphragm seat; however, special dual actuators can handle more ports with one membrane.|$|E
5000|$|Though riding {{an upright}} bicycle {{improves}} the cardiovascular system and can therefore actually improve the erectile function among men, riding a bicycle for prolonged {{periods of time}} with an unhealthy cycling technique can still cause problems {{for both men and}} women due to a reduced blood flow in the crotch area. Some male riders — recent survey data indicates around 5% — may ultimately get erectile dysfunction problems if a poor cycling technique is used with prolonged pressure on the perineum. Both men and women may also get reduced sensitivity in the crotch. A sign of these problems can sometimes be a tingling sensation in the area when stepping off the bicycle after a ride, as blood flow surges back into the area again. This issue is more related to the cycling technique than the <b>saddle</b> <b>type,</b> although there are special, more anatomically correct, designs to relieve crotch pressure as well. Examples of such designs include the cutaway saddles and noseless saddles. Cutaway saddles resemble regular saddles in their design, but with the middle part cut out to reduce pressure on the perineum among men. Noseless saddles are basically two separate saddles next to each other, with one smaller [...] "saddle" [...] per buttock. Such saddles achieve a similar relief of pressure by using a different design.|$|E

Multiple demi-sang types, including the Charolais, were merged to create a new national breed called the Selle Français, or French Saddle Horse.

The Thames Branch railway line opened in 1898, and Price won a tender to make locomotives for NZR in 1903 and 1906 (Wright page 106). Later in the 1950s and 1960s they manufactured a number of diesel shunting locomotives for the NZR, the TR class, and some for private users.|$|R

We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} a preconditioning technique for solving linear systems of <b>saddle</b> point <b>type</b> arising from the application of an inexact Gauss–Newton scheme to PDE-constrained optimization problems with a hyperbolic constraint.

The peak of the density of states due to this combined effect of the pf mixing and the pd mixing enhances {{the stability of the}} double layer structure. The same combined effect also causes the <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> singular points in the joint density of states of the optical transition. The peak structure of the magneto-optical spectra which has been observed in experiments is explained by the present model. Comment: 9 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
