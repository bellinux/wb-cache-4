5|$|The Red Sox {{finished}} 95-67 {{and with}} the same record as the New York Yankees, but since the Yankees had won the season series between the two teams, they won the American League East and the Red Sox had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> the American League Wild Card.|$|E
5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and laid down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and laid down in 188182.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} to Seattle, United had a two-match homestand against 2005 {{expansion}} teams, Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake. Against Chivas USA, United went up 2–0 before conceding twice to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 2–2 draw. Against Real Salt Lake, Dwayne De Rosario netted a hat trick in the match {{within the first}} 31 minutes, scoring the fastest hat trick in MLS history, earning him Player of the Week honors. In addition to De Rosario's three goals, he assisted to Andy Najar, and the club won 4–1 over Salt Lake.|$|E

Casimir recognised Ruthenian control of Red Ruthenia and returned 800 Ruthenian prisoners {{who had been}} in Polish custody since being captured two decades before by Boleslaw. Peace was secured by two marriages. Casimir was married to Yaroslav's sister, while Casimir gave his own sister Gertruda to Yaroslav's son, Izyaslav.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{conflicts}} arose {{within the}} anti-Swedish alliance between Habsburg and Poland-Lithuania when Habsburg demanded ever more contributions while not showing the war efforts Poland-Lithuania had expected. With the Russo-Polish War ongoing, most Polish–Lithuanian forces were bound in Ukraine. England, France and the Dutch Republic had {{agreed on a}} petition in the First Concert of the Hague, urging Sweden to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> peace with Denmark on the terms of Roskilde, and peace talks mediated by France were taking place throughout 1659.|$|E

5|$|The first {{event at}} the 2009 World Championships in August was the 100m. After two sub-10 clockings in the {{preliminary}} rounds, Gay reached the final, along with Jamaicans Bolt and Powell. He ran a new US record of 9.71seconds in the race, the third-fastest time in history, but even so had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> second place, losing his 100m world title to Bolt, who knocked 0.11seconds off the world record with a run of 9.58seconds.|$|E
5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense. The play turned {{the momentum of the}} game in favor of Wake Forest, who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though Wake Forest was forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until {{he was assigned to}} flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E

5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> anything less.|$|E
5|$|Getzlaf {{made his}} first {{appearance}} with the senior team at the 2008 World Championship. He led the tournament with 11 assists and his 14 points was second overall to teammate Dany Heatley's 20. Canada reached the championship game, but were forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> the silver medal after Russia overcame a two-goal third period deficit and won the championship 5–4 in overtime. Getzlaf {{was named to the}} Canadian roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, however a sprained ankle suffered during the NHL season left his participation in doubt until just before Canada was required to confirm its roster. He had recovered enough to play and recorded seven points in seven games, including the game-winning goal in Canada's 3–2 semi-final victory over Slovakia. Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 overtime victory over the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Chris Turner hit Darrius Heyward-Bey {{for a short}} bubble screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, and Heyward-Bey ran it 63yards for the score. During the next series, the Terrapins were held three-and-out, but the punt was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Maryland on the Hokies 11-yard line. However, the Terrapins were again forced to <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a field goal, which made it a one-possession lead for VT at 20–13with 2:29left in the third quarter. In the final quarter, the Hokies managed another field goal and held onto the lead for a final result of 23–13.|$|E
