5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>physics.</b> Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMolecular {{complexes}} and clusters provide bridges between molecular and <b>solid</b> <b>states</b> <b>physics.</b> Containing tens to few {{thousands of}} atoms, such systems {{can hardly be}} approached via traditional ab initio wavefunction based methods at the moment. Density functional theory (DFT) and density functional based tight binding methods (DFTB) have strongly developed with respect to computational efficiency to cover this size range. However both DFT and currently implemented DFTB face difficulties to describe realistically and accurately the typical interactions met in molecular clusters, in particular long range interactions such as Coulomb interactions between distant charge fluctuations, charge resonance in ionic clusters, and van der Waals interactions. The present article aims at providing an overview of how extensions of DFTB can circumvent some of the above deficiencies and {{turn out to be}} realistic and efficient tools to investigate the properties of molecular clusters and complexes, focusing on structural, electronic, energetic, and spectroscopic properties...|$|R

40|$|A nanomechanical on-chip test {{platform}} {{has recently}} been developed to deform {{under a variety of}} loading conditions freestanding thin films, ribbons and nanowires involving submicron dimensions. The lab-on-chip involves thousands of elementary test structures from which the elastic modulus, strength, strain hardening, fracture, creep properties can be extracted. The technique is amenable to in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations to unravel the fundamental underlying deformation and fracture mechanisms that often lead to size-dependent effects in small-scale samples. The method allows addressing electrical and magnetic couplings as well in order to evaluate the impact of large mechanical stress levels on different solid-state physics phenomena. We had the chance to present this technique in details to Jacques Friedel in 2012 who, unsurprisingly, made a series of critical and very relevant suggestions.

40|$|Abstract. Beryllium, {{tungsten}} {{and carbon}} are planned as wall {{materials for the}} future international tokamak (ITER). Be and W will be the dominant components and therefore the formation of binary Be-W alloys under plasma action {{is one of the}} most important issues in plasma-wall interaction processes at the first wall. The formation of alloys and their reactivity under physical sputtering and chemical erosion constitute a new challenge for <b>solid</b> <b>states</b> <b>physics</b> and chemical reactivity. This article proposes a theoretical study of the first stages of the formation of these alloys based on the first principles DFT method. The tungsten adsorption energy on the basal (0001) beryllium surface is first calculated, and then the barrier to retention into the bulk. For each calculation the electronic structure of the formed compound is analyzed through density of states (DOS) calculation. The results are discussed with respect to experimental observations during the formation of a Be 12 W alloy layer and changes in the electronic structure of Be during alloying, observed in shifts of the Be 1 s core levels. 1...|$|R
