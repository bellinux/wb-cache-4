A 234 -t steel ingot was dissected to check the internal quality, and a central <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> band of 1, 400 mm in height and 120 mm in width, was found {{at a distance of}} 450 mm under the riser bottom line. Then, thermo-mechanical simulation using an elasto-viscoplastic finite-element model was conducted to analyze the stress-strain evolution during ingot solidification. A new criterion considering mush mechanical property in the brittle temperature range as well as shrinkage porosity was used to identify the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> potential, where the degree of shrinkage porosity is regarded as a probability factor using a modified sigmoid function. Different casting processes, such as pouring speed, mould preheating and riser insulation, were optimized with the simulation model.

Silica fume was used as a partial replacement by weight of cement from 0 % to 30 %. The compressive strength and drying shrinkage were also examined.

40|$|Hydration and {{restrained}} <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> behaviours {{of different}} concrete grades were independently monitored using a non-contact electrical resistivity apparatus and a novel plastic ring mould respectively. The electrical resistivity curve trend is similar {{for all the}} concrete samples, in which the lowest concrete grade has the highest resistivity until reaching acceleration point which was then overtaken by the highest concrete grade. Four different hydration periods were identified upon which the hydration process can be based; these periods are classified into dissolution, induction, acceleration and deceleration periods. Also, initial and final setting times for the samples were examined, which confirmed that the decreasing rate of resistivity development for the lower concrete grade corresponds to its initial setting time range. Restrained <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> result shows that the highest concrete grade propagated cracks earlier than the lowest concrete grade and thereby the higher cracking potential of higher strength mixture was confirmed. Linear fitting was then developed to estimate concrete crack potential based on its electrical resistivity. Hence, both electrical resistivity measurement and novel plastic mould (which is very cheap, user-friendly and fast filled) are hereby proposed as a convenient alternative means of assessing concrete cracking potential...|$|E

The dynamics of the pattern formation process and the geometric properties of the isotropic crack patterns are similar to what is expected from recent models, assuming weak disorder. There is some evidence for a gradual increase in disorder as the drying layer become thinner, but no sudden transition, in contrast to what has been seen in previous experiments. The morphology of the crack patterns is influenced by drying gradients and front propagation effects, with sharp gradients having a strong orienting and ordering effect.

Methods for measuring these properties are recommended. The research approach consists of literature review, test procedure evaluation, and model development and calibration. Based on the test procedure evaluation, unconfined compressive strength, and indirect tensile strength and modulus tests are recommended. A suite of shrinkage-related tests is used to develop shrinkage cracking models; these tests include free drying shrinkage (including ultimate drying shrinkage), coefficient of thermal expansion, coefficient of friction, and restrained shrinkage cracking tests. Performance-related models are developed based on laboratory experiments, including strength and modulus growth models, and shrinkage cracking models. The strength growth models are developed based on extended testing at different curing times up to 360 days under standard curing conditions. Temperature and relative humidity {{are included in the}} growth models to assess indirect tensile strength and modulus values, which are critical to early-age shrinkage cracking and are sensitive to early-age curing conditions. Restrained shrinkage cracking tests are conducted on laboratory-scale beams. These results considering the effect of moisture gradient and drying shrinkage gradient along the depth of CSL are used to develop new mechanistic based <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> spacing and width models. It is found that neither the existing models nor the developed mechanistic based models can predict crack spacing and width in the field. Empirical <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> spacing and width models are developed based on dimensional analysis using field data.

The term shrinkage cracks, however, encompasses a broad suite of sedimentary structures having various origins. Shrinkage cracks can form {{not only at}} the sediment-air interface by desiccation processes but also at the sediment-water interface or substratally by synaeresis processes. Shrinkage cracks are induced in muddy sediments by variations in the salinity of the depositing medium, sediment compaction, and temperature in the case of some desiccation mudcracks. Crack morphology is influenced by the interplay of numerous factors, such as sedimem composition, bed thickness, and bed surface configuration. Factors controlling desiccation mudcracks also include the rate of initial drying, total exposure time, depth of the groundwater table, and direction of surface drainage.
