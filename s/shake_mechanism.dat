The biomass particles in hopper frequently become bridge or adhere to the wall, {{and it does not}} provide the required uniform and continuous flow of the feedstock materials. Therefore, an automatic <b>shake</b> <b>mechanism</b> is devised which is set in the hopper and driven by the rotating of the first screw. The experiments were done using the automatic <b>shake</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The results show that the biomass particles can deliver uniformly by screws without extra power consumption and increased the delivery capacity...|$|E

40|$|International audience—Machine {{to machine}} {{communication}} (M 2 M) or machine type communication (MTC) facilitates communication without any human intervention. These applications will support {{an enormous number}} of stations (STAs). To mitigate degradation of the throughput and delay performance in wireless local area networks (WLAN) that employ carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol with request to send and clear to send (RTS/CTS) mechanism, we propose to reduce the overhead introduced by the hand <b>shake</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The medium access control (MAC) overhead caused by the RTS and CTS messages is high comparing to the total duration of successful transmission. In order to reduce the MAC overhead we propose in this work a new strategy to serve many users successively. This strategy consists on sending many RTS in parallel by different stations on different frequency sub-bands. Once the RTS messages do not collide with each other, there will be no need to resend the RTS and wait for a CTS to gain the channel access. In this paper, this proposed strategy is investigated and we demonstrate that it reaches better saturation throughput and delay especially in loaded networks.

40|$|The recent rapid popularization {{of digital}} cameras {{allows people to}} capture {{a large number of}} digital {{photographs}} easily, and this situation makes automatic avoidance and correction of “failure” photographs important. While exposure and color issues have been mostly resolved by the improvement in automatic corrective functions of cameras, defocus, motion, and camera shake blur can be handled only in a limited fashion by current cameras. Camera shake blur can be alleviated by an anti-camera <b>shake</b> <b>mechanism</b> installed in most cameras; but for focus, although a particular scene depth can be focused with an auto-focus function, objects at different depths cannot be captured sharply at the same time. Moreover, defocused images can often result due to the failure of auto-focusing. In addition, blur caused by object motion, i. e., motion blur, is only avoided by increasing the shutter speed and sensor sensitivity when a camera detects motion in a scene. This dissertation proposes a method for removing defocus and motion blur for digital cameras. Since deblurring is generally an ill-posed problem, and hence an image processing approach alone has limitations, the proposed method includes modifications of camera optics. In this regard, this dissertation pursues low cost and compact implementation...|$|E

The rapid growth of internet leads to development of many innovative applications in the current environment.

SCTP is another transport layer protocol similar to TCP which provides end-end communication. It has some unique features like support for Multi-homing and multi-streaming.

40|$|To perform in-situ {{measurements}} on Mars or other planetary bodies many instruments require powder produced using some sampling technique (drilling/coring) or sample processing technique (core crushing) {{to be placed}} in measurement cells. This usually requires filling a small sample cell using an inlet funnel. In order to minimize cross contamination with future samples and ensure the sample is transferred from the funnel to the test cell with minimal residual powder the funnel is shaken. The shaking assists gravity by fluidizing the powder and restoring flow of the material. In order to counter cross contamination or potential clogging due to settling during autonomous handling a piezoelectric <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism</b> was designed for the deposition of sample fines in instrument inlet funnels. This device was designed to be lightweight, consume low power and demonstrated to be a resilient solid state actuator that can be mechanically and electrically tuned to shake the inlet funnel. In the final design configuration tested under nominal Mars Ambient conditions the funnel mechanism is driven by three symmetrically mounted piezoelectric flexure actuators that are out of the funnel support load path. The frequency of the actuation can be electrically controlled and monitored and mechanically tuned by the addition of tuning mass on the free end of the actuator. Unlike conventional electromagnetic motors these devices are solid state and can be designed with no macroscopically moving parts.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{purpose of}} this study, {{initiated}} early {{in the development of}} mechanical caneberry harvesting, was to provide timely information for early management decisions concerning mechanical harvesting. This was accomplished through an economic comparison of mechanical and hand harvesting of selected types and varieties of caneberries. Consideration was given to the economic effects of mechanical caneberry harvesting upon both growers and processors. Hand harvesting costs of red raspberries, black raspberries, Thornless Evergreen and Marion blackberries were estimated by use of grower group interviews in a number of counties in Oregon. Five types of mechanical harvesters were being operated in Oregon in 1963. Two of these were operated on a commercial basis while the other three were experimental. The two commercial machines were very similar with regard to their appearance, performance, and operating requirements. Because of a difference in <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> one was used most successfully on black raspberries and the other on Marion and Thornless Evergreen blackberries. Detailed economic engineering studies were conducted on all operations involving the one type of machine used on black raspberries. These studies involved the collection of data on speed and capacity of the machine, crew requirements, recovered yield per acre by picking, field loss, physical damage to berries and canes, turn-around times, loading and unloading times, and other pertinent factors. The study was designed so that relationships developed for this particular machine on black raspberries would have application to other machines and other berries. It is believed that a multi-berry <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism</b> or interchangeable <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism</b> will be developed which will not alter the operating requirements of the machine. Field studies were made during the 1963 harvest season for both hand and machine picking operations to determine the relative picking efficiency of each method. Samples were taken in various rows throughout machine and hand harvested fields, and the berries - dropped after each picking and those remaining on the canes after harvest were estimated. If picking costs only are considered, costs of mechanically harvesting black raspberries are 85. 63 per acre less than hand picking costs. When field loss or difference in recovered yield also is taken into account, this net economic advantage is reduced to only 25 per acre in favor of mechanical harvesting. It was estimated that from a total yield of 3, 000 pounds per acre, 2, 445 pounds would be recovered by the hand picking method and 2, 231 pounds by machine harvesting. Because the mechanical harvesters are {{in the early stages of}} development, synthetic costs for improved levels of performance were also analyzed and compared with hand harvesting. It was found that mechanical harvesting costs could be further reduced by: increasing acreage harvested during a season, increasing recovered yield per acre, reducing harvester replacement cost, and lengthening expected harvester life. Interviews with processors, although inconclusive, revealed both advantages and disadvantages of mechanically harvested caneberries for processing. Processors generally agreed that the principal advantage of machine picked berries over those that are hand picked is their somewhat higher soluble solids content. Although not quantitatively measurable, it appeared that there were increased processing costs resulting from the additional cleaning and sorting necessary because of the cull fruit and foreign material intermixed with the mechanically harvested berries when they arrived at the plant. In most cases mechanically harvested berries were utilized in products such as jam, jelly, puree, flavoring, and dye. For black raspberries these uses were not limiting, because this particular type of berry is not utilized to any extent in products requiring the whole berry form. For other berries used to a larger extent in whole berry form, this limitation would be more restrictive...|$|R

There is a need for detection protocols for B. anthracis in environmental matrices. However, identification of B. anthracis within a soil is a difficult task. Processing soil samples helps to remove debris, chemical components, and biological impurities that can interfere with microbiological detection. This study aimed to optimize a previously used indirect processing protocol, which included a series of washing and centrifugation steps. Optimization of the protocol included: identifying an ideal extraction diluent, variation in the number of wash steps, variation in the initial centrifugation speed, sonication and <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The optimized protocol was demonstrated at two laboratories in order to evaluate the recovery of spores from loamy and sandy soils. The new protocol demonstrated an improved limit of detection for loamy and sandy soils over the non-optimized protocol with an approximate matrix limit of detection at 14 spores/g of soil. There were no significant differences overall between the two laboratories for either soil type, suggesting that the processing protocol will be robust enough to use at multiple laboratories while achieving comparable recoveries...|$|R

This article reviews {{the origin of}} this link and casts serious doubt on the specificity of the pathophysiologic connection. The forces required to cause brain injury were derived from an experiment of high velocity impacts on monkeys, that generated forces far above those which might occur with a <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> These forces, if present, would invariably cause neck trauma, which is conspicuously absent in most babies allegedly injured by shaking. Subdural hematoma may also be the result of common birth trauma, complicated by prenatal vitamin D deficiency, which also contributes to the appearance of long bone fractures commonly associated with child abuse. Retinal hemorrhage is a non-specific finding that occurs with many causes of increased intracranial pressure, including infection and hypoxic brain injury. The evidence challenging these connections should prompt emergency physicians and others who care for children to consider a broad differential diagnosis before settling on occult shaking as the de-facto cause. While childhood non-accidental trauma is certainly a serious problem, the wide exposure of this information may have the potential to exonerate some innocent care-givers who have been convicted, or may be accused, of child abuse.

The direct combustion of biomass generates concern among environmentalists, as it is incomplete and inconsistent and may produce organic particulate matter, carbon monoxide and other organic gases. Biomass gasification has attracted the greatest interest as it offers a higher efficiency as compared to combustion and pyrolysis. Gasification is the process of conversion of solid carbonaceous fuel into combustible gas by partial combustion. Various groups of researchers have carried out experimental studies on downdraft biomass gasifier with different biomass materials such as wood, wood chips, hazelnut shell, agricultural wastes, saw dust, etc. It is reported that bridging is a normal occurrence in the gasifier. It occurs mainly in the pyrolysis zone of the downdraft biomass gasifier. In the present study, wood shavings of pine wood are used as biomass in a downdraft biomass gasifier.

40|$|Complexity of {{biological}} systems {{is one of}} the toughest problems for any experimental technique. Complex biochemical composition and a variety of biophysical interactions governing the evolution of a state of a biological system imply that the experimental response of the system would be superimposed of many different responses. To obtain a reliable characterization of such a system based on spin-label Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, multiple Hybrid Evolutionary Optimization (HEO) combined with spectral simulation can be applied. Implemented as the GHOST algorithm this approach is capable of handling the huge solution space and provides an insight into the "quasicontinuous© distribution of parameters that describe the biophysical properties of an experimental system. However, the analysis procedure requires several hundreds of runs of the evolutionary optimization routine making this algorithm extremely computationally demanding. As only the best parameter sets from each run are assumed to contribute into the final solution, this algorithm appears far from being optimized. The goal {{of this study is to}} modify the optimization routine in a way that 20 - 40 runs would be enough to obtain qualitatively the same characterization. However, to keep the solution diversity throughout the HEO run, fitness sharing and newly developed <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are applied and tested on various test EPR spectra.

In addition to the typical amphibian pleurokinetic articulation between skull roof and palatoquadrate associated structures, we found flexible connections between nasals and frontals (prokinesis), vomer and parasphenoid (palatokinesis), and between frontals and parietals (mesokinesis). This is the first description of mesokinesis in urodelans.

40|$|Viedma deracemization is the attrition-induced {{asymmetric}} amplification of a conglomerate crystal {{mixture of}} achiral or racemizing compounds. There are 13 reported crystalline systems that undergo Viedma deracemization {{that can be}} classified as having: (i) achirality in solution, (ii) a racemizing state in solution or (iii) a reversible racemizing reaction in solution. This phenomenon {{is based on an}} autocatalytic attrition-enhanced Ostwald ripening process with a requirement for an achiral, or rapidly racemizing state in solution. The concepts of ‘chiral amnesia’, where a molecule’s chiral memory is lost in solution, and ‘the common ancestor effect’, where the chirality of daughter crystals {{is the same as the}} mother crystal, can be used to rationalize the generation of a homochiral solid-state. The involvement of chiral clusters in the overall deracemization mechanism is critical. This research explores the generality of Viedma deracemization for an additional 5 achiral organic molecules: benzil, diphenyl disulfide, benzophenone, butylated hydroxytoluene and tetraphenylethylene. Stochastic chiral crystallization was observed for benzil, however chiral crystallization for butylated hydroxytoluene, diphenyl disulfide, tetraphenylethylene and benzophenone was non-stochastic, likely resulting from a cryptochiral environment. Under standard Veidma deracemization conditions, each system reached homochirality within 2 to 30 hours. A <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and liquid assisted grinding conditions were also examined and yielded homochiral benzil crystals as little as 10 minutes.

One of the causes of peripheral neuropathy is the shaking from the seats and steering wheels. Not only will the work comfort and fatigue of workers who are exposed to this shaking be disturbed but they can also be detrimental to peripheral neuropathic. The research was an analytic survey with cross sectional design. The data were analyzed by using univatriate analysis and bivatriate analysis with chi square test. The population was 40 drivers of urban transportation line 95 in Medan, and all of them were used as the samples, using total sampling technique. The result of the research showed that the variable of work period was p > 0. 05 which indicated that there was no correlation between the length of service and the incidence of peripheral neuropathic in the respondents, in 2015.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} with a flextensional piezoelectric actuator {{have led to}} the development of a sampler with a bit that is designed to produce and capture a full set of sample forms including volatiles, powdered cuttings, and core fragments. The flextensional piezoelectric actuator is a part of a series of devices used to amplify the generated strain from piezoelectric actuators. Other examples include stacks, bimorphs, benders, and cantilevers. These devices combine geometric and resonance amplifications to produce large stroke at high power density. The operation of this sampler/drill was demonstrated using a 3 x 2 x 1 -cm actuator weighing 12 g using power of about 10 -W and a preload of about 10 N. A limestone block was drilled to a depth of about 1 cm in five minutes to produce powdered cuttings. It is generally hard to collect volatiles from random surface profiles found in rocks and sediment, powdered cuttings, and core fragments. Toward the end of collecting volatiles, the actuator and the bit are covered with bellows-shaped shrouds to prevent fines and other debris from reaching the analyzer. A tube with a miniature bellows (to provide flexibility) is connected to the bit and directs the flow of the volatiles to the analyzer. Another modality was conceived where the hose is connected to the bellows wall directly to allow the capture of volatiles generated both inside and outside the bit. A wide variety of commercial bellows used in the vacuum and microwave industries can be used to design the volatiles capture mechanism. The piezoelectric drilling mechanism can potentially be operated in a broad temperature range from about- 200 to less than 450 C.

40|$|The planned Mars Science Laboratory mission {{requires}} inlet funnels for channeling unconsolidated powdered {{samples from}} the sampling and sieving mechanisms into instrument test cells, which are required to reduce cross-contamination of the samples and to minimize residue left in the funnels after each sample transport. To these ends, a solid-state <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been created that requires low power and is lightweight, but is sturdy enough to survive launch vibration. The funnel mechanism is driven by asymmetrically mounted, piezoelectric flexure actuators {{that are out of}} the load path so that they do not support the funnel mass. Each actuator is a titanium, flextensional piezoelectric device driven by a piezoelectric stack. The stack has Invar endcaps with a half-spherical recess. The Invar is used to counteract the change in stress as the actuators are cooled to Mars ambient temperatures. A ball screw is threaded through the actuator frame into the recess to apply pre-stress, and to trap the piezoelectric stack and endcaps in flexure. During the vibration cycle of the flextensional actuator frame, the compression in the piezoelectric stack may decrease {{to the point that it}} is unstressed; however, because the ball joint cannot pull, tension in the piezoelectric stack cannot be produced. The actuators are offset at 120. In this flight design, redundancy is required, so three actuators are used though only one is needed to assist in the movement. The funnel is supported at three contact points offset to the hexapod support contacts. The actuator surface that does not contact the ring is free to expand. Two other configurations can be used to mechanically tune the vibration. The free end can be designed to drive a fixed mass, or can be used to drive a free mass to excite impacts (see figure). Tests on this funnel mechanism show a high density of resonance modes between 1 and 20 kHz. A subset of these between 9 and 12 kHz was used to drive the CheMin actuators at 7 V peak to peak. These actuators could be driven by a single resonance, or swept through a frequency range to decrease the possibility that a portion of the funnel surface was not coincident with a nodal line (line of no displacement). The frequency of actuation can be electrically controlled and monitored and can also be mechanically tuned by the addition of tuning mass on the free end of the actuator. The devices are solid-state and can be designed with no macroscopically moving parts. This design has been tested in a vacuum at both Mars and Earth ambient temperatures ranging from 30 to 25...|$|R

The work is motivated by recent experiments on voltage driven transport of protein across nano-channel. In {{the first part of}} the thesis we describe a numerical analysis on the driven transport of Maltose binding protein (MBP) across a nano-pore in the framework of coarse-grained modeling. The protein is described by a native centric model on a C carbon backbone to study the influence of protein-like structural properties on the translocation process. In this transport mechanism of protein across a channel, the force-fields consists of stretching energy, bending energy and torsion energy. The non-bonded interaction energy is modeled by Lennard-Jones potential. We model the fluctuating nanopore through which the protein is confined by a step-like soft-core repulsive potential with cylindrical symmetry which is set parallel the x -axis of the frame of reference to used for translocation simulations In chapter 3 we investigate the translocation of MBP through a static pore. We characterized the translocation mechanism by studying the thermodynamical and kinetic properties of the process. In particular, we study the average of translocation time, the mobility, and the translocation probability as a function of pulling force F acting in the channel. The translocation process depend on the free-energy barrier that protein has to overcome in order to move along the channel. Such a free-energy barrier occurs due to the conflict of the unfolding energy and the entropy connected with the confinement effects of the pore. Umbrella sampling simulation is implemented to compute the free-energy landscape as a function of reaction coordinate. To compute the translocation free-energy profile from the umbrella sampling simulation, we introduce an artificial harmonic biasing potential, forcing the system dynamics to explore the set of unstable conformations. The effect of the umbrella potential is than deweighted from the Boltzmann weight by processing the data through appropriate debiasing algorithms. We used the free-energy profile to built up a phenomenological one - dimensional drift - diffusion model in the reaction coordinate based on the Smoluchowski stochastic differential equation. The results obtained from the mathematical model are then used in comparison with molecular dynamics simulation to explains and reproduces the behavior of the translocation observables. In chapter 4 and 5, we study the effect of fluctuating environment in protein transport dynamics. In particular, we investigate the translocation of a protein across a temporally modulated nano-pore. We allow the radius of the cylindrical pore to oscillate harmonically with certain frequency and amplitude about an average radius. The protein is imported inside the pore whose dynamics is influences by the fluctuating nature of the pore. We investigate the dynamic and thermodynamical properties of the translocation process by revealing the statistics of translocation time as a function of the pulling inward force acting along the axis of the pore, and the frequency of the time dependent radius of the channel. We also examine the distribution of translocation time in the intermediate frequency regime. We observe that the <b>shaking</b> <b>mechanism</b> of pore leads to accelerate the translocation process as compared to the static channel that has a radius equal to the mean radius of oscillating pore. Moreover, the translocation time shows a global maximum as a function of frequency of the oscillating radius, hence revealing a resonant activation phenomenon in the dynamics of protein translocatio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSackungs are {{the largest}} {{gravitational}} deformation observed in mountains. They are characterized by the long-term slowness of the movements, but their mechanism is still not well understood. Nowadays cosmic ray exposure (CRE) dating methods allow dating the morphologic structures involved in sackung and can contribute at the understanding of their origin. In the Alps, the 5. 3 km long Arcs sackung initiated during the activity of rock glaciers. Three samples from these faulted rock glaciers provide their first CRE ages and show that at 2000 m elevation these block accumulations moved during the Younger Dryas and stopped in early Holocene. Six 10 Be ages of fault scarps show that the Arcs sackung lasted {{only a few thousand}} years and stopped at about 8462 ± 432 10 Be yr. They also reveal that deformation migrated upslope in agreement with a mechanism of flexural toppling of vertical layers. This unique and long gravitational event, characterized by migration of the deformation, does not support earthquake <b>shaking</b> as triggering <b>mechanism</b> for individual faults. It shows that, in the upper Isère valley, slope deformation was delayed of several thousand years after glacial debuttressing, and is not anymore active despite its fresh morphology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of {{the motion of the}} center of mass (CoM) of linkages as being a stationary or invariant point at one of its links. This is of importance for the design of inherently <b>shaking</b> force balanced <b>mechanisms,</b> static balancing, and other branches of mechanical synthesis. For this purpose Fischer's mechanism is investigated as being a composition of pantographs. It can be shown that linkages that are composed of pantographs and of which all links have an arbitrary CoM can be inherently balanced for which Fischer's method is a useful tool. To calculate the principal dimensions for which linkages have their CoM at an invariant link point, an approach based on linear momentum is proposed. With this approach it is possible to investigate each degree-of-freedom individually. Equivalent Linear Momentum Systems are proposed to facilitate the calculations in order to use different convenient reference frames. The method is applied to planar linkages with revolute joints, however it also applies to linkages with other types of joints. As a practical example a shaking force and shaking moment balanced 2 -DoF grasper mechanism is derived. [...] -...|$|R
60|$|One of {{my first}} acts for the {{recovery}} even of my own composure, was to bid farewell to the sea. Its hateful splash renewed {{again and again to}} my sense the death of my sister; its roar was a dirge; in every dark hull that was tossed on its inconstant bosom, I imaged a bier, that would convey to death all who trusted to its treacherous smiles. Farewell to the sea! Come, my Clara, sit beside me in this aerial bark; quickly and gently it cleaves the azure serene, and with soft undulation glides upon the current of the air; or, if storm <b>shake</b> its fragile <b>mechanism,</b> the green earth is below; we can descend, and take shelter on the stable continent. Here aloft, the companions of the swift-winged birds, we skim through the unresisting element, fleetly and fearlessly. The light boat heaves not, nor is opposed by death-bearing waves; the ether opens before the prow, and the shadow of the globe that upholds it, shelters us from the noon-day sun. Beneath are the plains of Italy, or the vast undulations of the wave-like Apennines: fertility reposes in their many folds, and woods crown the summits. The free and happy peasant, unshackled by the Austrian, bears the double harvest to the garner; and the refined citizens rear without dread the long blighted tree of knowledge in this garden of the world. We were lifted above the Alpine peaks, and from their deep and brawling ravines entered the plain of fair France, and after an airy journey of six days, we landed at Dieppe, furled the feathered wings, and closed the silken globe of our little pinnace. A heavy rain made this mode of travelling now incommodious; so we embarked in a steam-packet, and after a short passage landed at Portsmouth.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{the aged}} {{population}} grows around the world, many medical instruments and devices {{have been developed}} recently. Among the devices, a drug delivery stent is a medical device which requires precision machining. Conventional drug delivery stent has problems of residual polymer and decoating because the drug is coated {{on the surface of}} stent with the polymer. If the drug is impregnated in the micro sized holes on the surface, the problems can be overcome because {{there is no need to}} use the polymer anymore. Micro sized holes are generally fabricated by laser machining; however, the fabricated holes do not have a high aspect ratio or a good surface finish. To overcome these problems, we propose a vibration-assisted machining mechanism with PZT (Piezoelectric Transducers) for the fabrication of micro sized holes. If the mechanism vibrates the eyepiece of the laser machining head, the laser spot on the workpiece will vibrate vertically because objective lens in the eyepiece <b>shakes</b> by the <b>mechanism's</b> vibration. According to the former researches, the vibrating frequency over 20 kHz and amplitude over 500 nm are preferable. The vibration mechanism has cylindrical guide, hollowed PZT and supports. In the cylinder, the eyepiece is mounted. The cylindrical guide has upper and low plates and side wall. The shape of plates and side wall are designed to have high resonating frequency and large amplitude of motion. The PZT is also selected to have high actuating force and high speed of motion. The support has symmetrical and rigid configuration. The mechanism secures linear motion of the eyepiece. This research includes sensitivity analysis and design of ultrasonic vibration mechanism. As a result of design, the requirements of high frequency and large amplitude are achieved...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement of soil {{enables a}} soil slope or wall to be {{retained}} at angles steeper than the soil material’s angle of repose. Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) systems enable shortened construction time, lower cost, increased seismic performance and potentially improve aesthetic benefits over their conventional retaining wall counterparts such as gravity and cantilever type retaining walls. Experience in previous earthquakes such as Northridge (1994), Kobe (1995), and Ji-Ji (1999) indicate good performance of reinforced soil retaining walls under high seismic loads. However, this good performance {{is not necessarily}} due to advanced understanding of their behaviour, rather this highlights the inherent stability of reinforced soil against high seismic loads and conservatism in static design practices. This is an experimental study {{on a series of}} seven reduced-scale GRS model walls with FHR facing under seismic excitation conducted using a shake-table. The models were 900 mm high, reinforced by five layers of stiff Microgrid reinforcement, and were founded on a rigid foundation. The soil deposit backfill was constructed of dry dense Albany sand, compacted by vibration (average Dr = 90 %). The influence of the L/H ratio and wall inclination on seismic performance was investigated by varying these important design parameters throughout the testing programme. The L/H ratio ranged from 0. 6 – 0. 9, and the walls were primarily vertical except for one test inclined at 70 o to the horizontal. During testing, facing displacements and accelerations within the backfill were recorded at varying levels of <b>shaking</b> intensity. <b>Mechanisms</b> of deformation, in particular, were of interest in this study. Global and local deformations within the backfill were investigated using two methods. The first utilised coloured horizontal and vertical sand markers placed within the backfill. The second utilised high-speed camera imaging for subsequent analysis using Geotechnical Particle Image Velocimetry (GeoPIV) software. GeoPIV enabled shear strains to be identified within the soil at far smaller strain levels than that rendered visible by eye using the coloured sand markers. The complementary methods allowed the complete spatial and temporal development of deformation within the backfill to be visualised. Failure was predominantly by overturning, with some small sliding component. All models displayed a characteristic bi-linear displacement-acceleration curve, with the existence of a critical acceleration, below which deformations were minor, and above which ultimate failure occurs. During failure, the rate of sliding increased significantly. An increase in the L/H ratio from 0. 6 to 0. 9 caused the displacement-acceleration curve to be shallower, and hence the wall to deform less at low levels of acceleration. Accelerations at failure also increased, from 0. 5 g to 0. 7 g, respectively. A similar trend of increased seismic performance was observed for the wall inclined at 70 o to the horizontal, when compared to the other vertical walls. Overturning was accompanied by the progressive development of multiple inclined shear surfaces from the wall crest {{to the back of the}} reinforced soil block. Failure of the models occurred when an inclined failure surface developed from the lowest layer of reinforcement to the wall crest. Deformations largely confirmed the two-wedge failure mechanism proposed by Horii et al. (2004). For all tests, the reinforced soil block was observed to demonstrate non-rigid behaviour, with simple shearing along horizontal planes as well as strain localisations at the reinforcement or within the back of the reinforced soil block. This observation is contrary to design, which assumes the reinforced soil block to behave rigidly...|$|R
40|$|Narcotic {{dependence}} {{was established}} by continuous intravenous infusion of gradually increasing doses of morphine. Several days at the terminal concentration of morphine (100 mg/kg/day) was allowed prior to withdrawal. Morphine withdrawal body shakes were reliably observed upon the termination of continuous morphine infusion. The administration of morphine, methadone or _fentanyl, potent narcotic drugs, reliably abolished the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes 8 hours after the termination of morphine infusion. The narcotic antagonist naloxone or pentazocine had no {{significant effect on the}} rate of occurrence of withdrawal body shakes; however, there was a slight trend towards an increase in the frequency of this withdrawal index. A wide variety of neuroleptics were investigated for their ability to reduce withdrawal. The order of potency for reduction of withdrawal body shakes on a mg/kg basis for those neuroleptics tested was spiperone, benperidol, butaclarriol, loxapine, oxiperomide, haloperidol, spiramide, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, pimozide and pipamperone. The dopaminergic agonists amphetamine, apomorphine and L-IX 3 ̆ePA were also found to dose dependently reduce withdrawal• body shakes. Azaperone, a butyrophenone possessing high alpha noradrenergic blocking potency, reduces withdrawal body shakes in a dose related manner, while the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine and the beta adrenergic blocker propronalol failed to reduce withdrawal shakes to any significant extent. Dose dependent decreases in morphine withdrawal body shakes were produced by clonidine and desmethylimipramine, adrenergic agonists. Reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine also reduced withdrawal shakes, but the effect was dose dependent for only reserpine. The serotoninergic agents fluoxetine, 5 -HTP and methysergide were without effect on the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes at the doses tested. A slight but non-significant increase in the rate of withdrawal shakes was observed after the administration of the anticholinergic drugs atropine, benztropine, dexetimide and scopolamine. Conversely, the cholinergic agonists physostigmine and pilocarpine, reduced withdrawal body shakes in a dose related fashion. Modification of gabaminergic system by the administration of bicuculline, depakene and picrotoxin had no significant effect. Chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital, sedativehypnotic agents, did not produce dose dependent effects on the occurrence of withdrawal shakes. However, the highest dose of each sedative hypnotic employed did reduce withdrawal body <b>shakes.</b> The exact <b>mechanism</b> by which neuroleptics reduce withdrawal is not known. Manipulation of each of the transmitters effect by neuroleptics indicates that dopamine and acetylcholine are involved in mediating the reduction in withdrawal body shakes. The fact that the antiwithdrawal activity of certain neuroleptics is reversed by the narcotic antagonist naloxone implicates opiate receptor mechanisms. However, not all neuroleptics were antagonized by naloxone, suggesting that neuroleptics may be working at more than one site to reduce withdrawal. Thus neuroleptics may be reducing withdrawal body shakes by several different mechanisms. The data gathered from these studies suggest a role for cholinergic, dopaminergic and narcotic mechanisms in the antiwithdrawal activity of neuroleptic drugs...|$|R
