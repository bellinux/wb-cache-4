5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E

5|$|Id had {{no clear}} {{expectations}} for Wolfensteins commercial reception, but hoped {{that it would}} make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. PC Zone quoted a shareware distributor as saying Wolfenstein 3D was the top shareware <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of Wolfenstein 3D as well as Spear of Destiny had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly {{by the end of the}} year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols. The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier Commander Keen series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart.|$|E

As of March 2007, the album has sold over 104,000 copies in the United States and Puerto Rico alone. It became her best-selling album until Sentimiento (2007). It was able to break Queen's peak at number twenty-four on the Billboard Latin Albums chart when it reached number ten. At the time, the album was among few noncompilations {{releases}} (aside from Daddy Yankee) that were able to chart on the Billboard Latin Albums chart since the summer of 2005.
