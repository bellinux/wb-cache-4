5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three <b>Studies</b> <b>for</b> a Crucifixion.

5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three <b>Studies</b> <b>for</b> a Crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; <b>studies</b> <b>for</b> the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E

The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had been rejected due to concerns of potential damage to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would have utilized Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely bypassed the reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E
