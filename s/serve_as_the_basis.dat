5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the highway.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink into the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time. The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner {{in his capacity as}} the book's illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|The 1910s were a {{productive}} time for Du Bois. In 1911 {{he attended the}} First Universal Races Congress in London and he published his first novel, The Quest of the Silver Fleece. Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, The Star of Ethiopia. In 1915, Du Bois published The Negro, a general history of black Africans, and {{the first of its}} kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. The Negro predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.|$|E

5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was never {{intended}} to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of a floatplane {{and had to be}} redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower powered engine, the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E
5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments {{is one of the most}} common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E
5|$|A common {{language}} {{may have been}} seen to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of a nation, but as contemporary historians of 19th-century Germany noted, {{it took more than}} linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The exigencies of Napoleon's campaigns in Poland (1806–07), the Iberian Peninsula, western Germany, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon's Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon's influence. The creation of student militias such as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency.|$|E

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E

25|$|Around 1900, the {{development}} of diamond saws and good jewelry lathes enabled {{the development}} of modern diamond cutting and diamond cuts, chief among them the round brilliant cut. In 1919, Marcel Tolkowsky analyzed this cut: his calculations took both brilliance (the amount of white light reflected) and fire into consideration, creating a delicate balance between the two. Tolkowsky's calculations would <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for all future brilliant cut modifications and standards.|$|E
25|$|More {{accurate}} {{methods for}} determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the screw extension from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for defining screw extension based on the fastener's thread pitch. Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a dial test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a strain gauge, or ultrasonic length measurement.|$|E
