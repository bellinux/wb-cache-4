Thefts, robberies, shootings and killings became more frequent. The rolling stock was very often graffiti-painted or vandalism-damaged both inside and outside. As the New York City Police Department was completely overwhelmed, the public reacted with unease, and the subway was deliberately avoided. Around 1980, the reliability of the vehicles was a tenth of their reliability in the 1960s, and 40 percent of the network required speed restrictions. Because there had been no further studies of the subway since 1975, one third of the fleet was out of use during rush hours due to <b>serious</b> <b>technical</b> <b>defects.</b> In addition, signs were fitted incorrectly, and spare parts were missing or were bought in too large quantities, could not be found, or could not be installed due to lack of repairmen.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveStenosis of the cephalad {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} (ICA) can present a challenge, {{making it difficult to}} obtain a technically satisfying distal end point during endarterectomy. Surgical revision of distal defects can be difficult and yield unsatisfactory results. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative carotid stenting as an adjunct to endarterectomy to salvage <b>technical</b> <b>defects</b> identified at the cephalad ICA endarterectomy site. MethodsBetween January 2001 and February 2008, 14 patients were found to have <b>technical</b> <b>defects</b> located at the cephalad ICA endarterectomy site on intraoperative completion arteriogram. All defects were treated with adjunctive carotid stenting. Patient age ranged from 53 to 84 years (mean, 69 years). Indications for surgery were asymptomatic stenosis (nine), amaurosis fugax (two), and cerebrovascular accident (three). Operative time ranged from 2 to 5 hours (mean, 2. 5 hours). Cervical block was used in all but two patients who received general anesthesia. ResultsTechnically satisfying results with stenting were achieved in all 14 patients. One patient suffered a perioperative transient ischemic attack; however, neurologic symptoms were noted before placement of the stent in this patient. There were no stent-related complications. All stents remained patent on duplex follow-up averaging 18 months. ConclusionIntraoperative salvage carotid stenting is an effective and safe adjunct to endarterectomy when unsatisfactory <b>technical</b> <b>defects</b> are identified at the cephalad ICA endarterectomy site...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Technical</b> <b>defects</b> are a {{potential}} cause of peri-operative strokes following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{by either the}} eversion technique or the standard method of longitudinal arteriotomy with or without patch closure. AIM: A non-randomised retrospective study was undertaken to assess the value of angioscopy for the identification of technical errors following CEA and to compare those detected following eversion and standard endarterectomy with patch closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intra-operative completion angioscopy was performed following 110 CEAs (56 eversion, 54 standard). Angioscopy was omitted in 5 patients because of technical problems (2) or extreme shunt dependency (3). RESULTS: Significant <b>technical</b> <b>defects</b> were identified and corrected in 10 cases (9 %) and were equally distributed between the eversion and standard procedures. There was no peri-operative stroke or death in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Significant residual defects may occur after CEA by either technique. Angioscopy allows their correction peri-operatively and {{has the potential to}} reduce peri-operative stroke...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intraoperative duplex {{examination}} can be {{used during}} carotid surgery to identify small <b>technical</b> <b>defects</b> (like anastomotic stenosis, intimal flaps or subintimal wall dissections) that cannot be easily found by palpatory manoeuvres. The objective of this clinical study is to correlate intraoperative duplex findings with early postoperative complications and with duplex data obtained during follow-up. METHODS: From January 1993 to January 1996 we compared early and late postoperative complications that occurred after carotid surgery in two groups of patients: a group of 120 patients undergone intraoperative duplex compared {{with a group of}} 100 patients not undergone intraoperative ultrasound. RESULTS: The percentages of early and late postoperative complications which occurred in the first group were respectively 7. 5 % and 4. 2 % contrary to 10 % and 7 % occurred in the control group.

Between August 1997 and December 1998, 138 consecutive patients undergoing 141 carotid endarterectomies were intra-operatively investigated with colour duplex scan and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography.

Fifteen (41. 6 %) minor defects were detected by both methods, thirteen (36. 1 %) minor defects were detected by colour duplex but ignored by angiography. Angiography detected four (11. 1 %) kinkings missed with the colour duplex. The overall sensitivity of both methods for major defect was 100 %.
