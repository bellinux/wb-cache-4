This requires knowing the “ancestry” of each cell type, that is, which cell type preceded it in the development process. This information can be deduced by observing in detail the distribution and placement of cells, by type, in the developing embryo, and by also observing, in cells growing in culture (“in vitro”) any differentiation events, should they occur for whatever reason, and by other means.|$|R

Clearly, {{the easiest way to}} decrease the incidence of CTE in athletes is to decrease the incidence of repetitive brain trauma at all levels of play. Nevertheless, in the US, approximately 1.7 million sports-and recreation-related TBIs occur each year. About 75 % of these cases are classified as mild TBIs or concussions (Daneshvar et al. 2011). In addition, players in collision sports such as American football may experience many more subconcussive impacts throughout a season and career.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Overuse injuries, {{defined as}} those without a <b>specific,</b> <b>identifiable</b> event {{responsible}} for their occurrence, may be a substantial problem in many sports. However, current surveillance methods in sports injury epidemiology studies, which rely heavily on time loss for injury definitions and severity measurement, may underestimate their true impact. This is because athletes often continue to participate in sport despite the existence of overuse injuries. The main aim of this dissertation {{was to develop a}} new method to record overuse injuries in sport, and to establish its validity by applying it {{in a number of different}} research settings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{concepts}} and methods used in commodity and financial futures markets are adapted to structure “idea” futures markets. Instead of trading on future prices for commodities or financial instruments, an idea futures market trades on {{the likelihood of}} realization of a <b>specific,</b> <b>identifiable,</b> operational proposition at some future point in time—an idea. Shares in an idea future are bought and sold using standard market methods. The price of a future reflects the aggregated information over all traders about the probability associated with the proposition. Prices rise or fall based upon changes in information perceived by market participants. Idea futures markets have strong applicability to strategic, tactical, and logistics decisions about the development, diffusion, and implementation of educational technology products. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} {{on the effects of}} chronic traumatization, {{research}} is reviewed regard-ing the association between chronicity of traumatization and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. The contribution of the broader traumatic con-text to PTSD symptomatology is also examined. This review focuses on three pop-ulations: combat veterans, child sexual abuse survivors, and survivors of domestic violence. The challenges of defining chronicity of a traumatic event and traumatic context are addressed. Finally, suggestions for future directions are provided. Key words: combat veterans, family violence, sexual abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder UNLIKE MOST OTHER DSM-IV diagnoses, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires a <b>specific,</b> <b>identifiable</b> event to occur to qualify for the diagnosis (American Psychiatric Associa-tion, 1994).

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the therapeutic relationship is important to therapeutic outcome. In recent years, there has been additional {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>specific,</b> <b>identifiable</b> moments of relational depth between client and therapist can also have a major positive impact on the progress and outcome of therapy; however, the question of how such moments occur remains largely unexplored. Are they solely initiated by the therapist, or does the client have a role too? This article explores clients' perceptions of the factors facilitating an experience of relational depth. Findings suggest that immediately prior to such an experience the clients themselves have reached a state of readiness, and as making a positive decision to bring their vulnerability to the fore in the therapeutic relationship, thereby facilitating a potential moment of change. Findings are discussed in relation to contemporary theory with implications for practice given...|$|R
40|$|Branch-and-price {{algorithms}} {{based on}} Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition have shown great success in solving mixed integer linear optimization problems (MILPs) with <b>specific</b> <b>identifiable</b> structure, such as vehicle routing and crew scheduling problems. For unstructured MILPs, {{the most frequently}} used methodology is branch-and-cut, which depends on generation of “generic” classes of valid inequalities to strengthen bounds. There has been little investigation into the development of a similar “generic“ version of branch-and-price, though this is possible in principle. One of the most important elements required for such a generic branch-and-price algorithm is an automatic method of decomposition. In this paper, we experiment with hypergraph partitioning as a means of performing such automatic decomposition. Computational results explore the potential for applying branch-and-price algorithms within generic solvers and provide insight into how to measure the quality of the decomposition and improve it...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of predictability in film language {{has been the}} focus of a number of recent papers by this author (Copenhagen, 2006; Innsbruck, 2006; Saarbrucken, 2007) and by others. This paper will continue to explore those <b>specific</b> <b>identifiable</b> characteristics of film language that distinguish it from genuine spontaneous discourse. It will then begin a search for predictability patterns within the film language genre both in terms of typology (westerns, love stories, historical dramas, etc.) and in terms of typical cinema scenes (breakfast table chat, courtroom sequences, telephone conversations, etc.). It is surmised that once predictability patterns can be observed in the repeated use of specific lexis or expressions in particular circumstances, reasonably confident predictions can be made about how language may be used should such circumstances re-occur. The {{question of}} predictability may prove to be useful for the translator of film texts...|$|R

40|$|With the popularisation of the Internet, the use {{of e-mails}} and {{computer-based}} chats (CBCs) has increased dramatically among university students. An interesting feature of such communication, however, is that a written medium is treated like speech (cf. Maynor, 1994). Conversations turn into notes where grammatical accuracy and conventional formalities take a backseat to instant communication. In the case of on-campus CBCs, informality and a certain disregard of the conventions of standard English are all the more manifest. It is commonly believed in Hong Kong that this general freedom to write ‘bad English’ has encouraged the habit of randomly incorporating Cantonese words into English e-mails. Yet an examination of students’ e-mails and icq (‘I Seek You’) communications reveals that far from ‘polluting’ their English by substituting Cantonese words haphazardly for English ones, or by applying Cantonese structures to their English writing, students tend to incorporate certain kinds of Cantonese words systematically into their texts for <b>specific</b> <b>identifiable</b> purposes...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the application and adaptation of body mapping {{as a tool for}} exploring sexual health and sexual decision making among young people aged 16 - 25. It argues that while body mapping engaged youth to discuss general health issues, young people were reluctant to engage with issues related to sexual health, due to feelings of shame and fear of stigma. Sexual health case scenarios were developed and used in conjunction with body-mapping exercises. The use of scenarios was an effective way to explore sensitive information, while protecting young people from revealing any <b>specific</b> <b>identifiable</b> information about themselves. In this article, we suggest that utilizing a combination of methodological approaches (the visual body maps and written case scenarios) in sexual health research with young people has the potential to enhance and enrich the quality of the data, and allow for a safe and enabling environment. This is particularly important where long-term fieldwork might be difficult or constrained...|$|R
