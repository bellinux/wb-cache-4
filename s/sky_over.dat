5|$|Even {{after the}} change in effects companies, Yuricich {{continued}} to provide many of the matte paintings used in the film, having previously worked on The Day the Earth Stood Still, Ben-Hur, North by Northwest and Logan's Run. The paintings were combined with live action after a selected area of the frame was matted out; the blue Earth <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> Yellowstone, for example was replaced with a red-hued Vulcan landscape. More than 100 such paintings were used.|$|E
5|$|Left {{to run its}} course, this tidal drag would {{continue}} until the spin of Earth and the orbital period of the Moon matched, creating mutual tidal locking between the two. As a result, the Moon would be suspended in the <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> one meridian, as is already currently the case with Pluto and its moon Charon. However, the Sun will become a red giant engulfing the Earth-Moon system long before this occurrence.|$|E

With the Germans having few anti-aircraft batteries and severely limited support from the Luftwaffe, Allied dominance of the <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> Aachen was near total.|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of a}} local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.|$|E

25|$|Paths - Pathways {{should never}} be straight. They should meander like a stream. This helps deepen the {{landscape}} by adding layers.

25|$|As {{they look}} at the burning night <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> the Underworld Storybrooke, Hades and Zelena are on a date, as he {{explained}} why he created the world for her, then tells Zelena that he wants to follow her back to the real Storybrooke, if he is able to restore his heart and become human again. However, he also tells Zelena that {{in order to do that}} he wants to leave the outsiders in the Underworld forever, then he asks her to be his partner in chaos (a modified version of a wedding proposal), leaving Zelena feeling awkward. Hades also tells her that he took the precaution of adding the remaining outsiders' names to more tombstones, after Mary Margaret had her name replaced by David's. Unfortunately for Zelena, Regina saw this through a magic mirror, and then confronts Zelena afterwards, as the latter thinks that Hades, like Robin Hood (or Regina), might not be a villain forever. Regina explain this to the rest of the outsiders, saying that Zelena was thinking irrationally and in danger, and telling them that the only way to solve this problem was to go to Cora, to break them up. Cora is working in the Underworld Mill, situated above the Lethe, the yellow-colored River of Forgetfulness, and supervised by two guards. She finds a hook hidden under the stalks on grain, cuts off the black anti-magic handcuff, and uses her magic to knock out the guards. Escaping, she bumps into Hook who retrieves his hook and brings her to Regina.|$|E
500|$|The {{definition}} of planet, since {{the word was}} coined by the ancient Greeks, has included within its scope {{a wide range of}} celestial bodies. Greek astronomers employed the term asteres planetai (ἀστέρες πλανῆται), [...] "wandering stars", for star-like objects which apparently moved over the <b>sky.</b> <b>Over</b> the millennia, the term has included a variety of different objects, from the Sun and the Moon to satellites and asteroids.|$|E
500|$|Several of the film's {{establishing}} {{shots of}} the 70s-era Bay Area were created by the Marin County effects house Matte World Digital. The [...] "helicopter shots" [...] of the fireworks-laden <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> Vallejo, the San Francisco waterfront, and the overhead shot of the cab driving through San Francisco were CG, as was the shot looking down at traffic from the tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. A time-lapse sequence of {{the building of the}} Transamerica Pyramid was a hybrid of 2D and 3D matte painting. The shot was initially created using reference photos of the Pyramid taken from the rooftop of Francis Ford Coppola's Sentinel Building. MWD's visual effects supervisor, Craig Barron, then researched the Pyramid's original construction techniques for accuracy in the animated sequence to imply the passage of time within the film's story.|$|E

500|$|Fears were {{as high as}} ever {{among the}} traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an {{outbreak}} of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. A light in the <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, [...] "with infinite pains and great difficulty" [...] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, {{and members of the}} court.|$|E
500|$|After the 1883 {{eruption}} of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped {{the effects on}} the <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> several years. They labelled the phenomenon the [...] "equatorial smoke stream". In the 1920s, a Japanese meteorologist, Wasaburo Oishi, detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji. [...] He tracked pilot balloons, also known as pibals (balloons used to determine upper level winds), as they rose into the atmosphere. Oishi's work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because {{it was published in}} Esperanto. American pilot Wiley Post, the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above [...] In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.|$|E
500|$|Knowledge of {{the events}} faded: in 1622 when the Danish diplomat Peder Galt asked for {{the meaning of the}} signs in the painting, he could get no replies {{anywhere}} in the city. He translated the Swedish text then accompanying the painting to Latin — [...] "Anno 1535 1 Aprilis hoc ordine sex cœlo soles in circulo visi Holmie a septima matutina usque ad mediam nonam antermeridianam" [...] — and concluded that the real sun represented Gustav Vasa and the other suns his successors, an assumption he thought confirmed by contemporary Swedish history. Even this confused report was soon forgotten and in 1632 the halo display in the painting was described in a German leaflet as three beautiful rainbows, a ball, and an eel hanging in the <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> the Swedish capital day and night for four weeks in 1520, furthermore interpreted as a prophecy announcing the forthcoming liberation of Protestant Germany by [...] "the Lion from the North" [...] (i.e. King Gustavus Adolphus).|$|E
