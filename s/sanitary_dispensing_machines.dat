40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{assess the}} impact of robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> in {{community}} pharmacies on staff efficiency and sales of over-the-counter drugs. Setting: The study was done on 253 community pharmacies in Germany that use a robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> manufactured by ROWA during 2008. Method: Data concerning the financial and economic impact of using a robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> in community pharmacies was gathered using a structured questionnaire and analysed in terms of its financial implications. Key findings: The response rate was 29 %. In most pharmacies (79 %) the robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> was retrofitted. In 59 % of the pharmacies additional space was gained for self-service and behind-the-counter display. As a result of using a robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine,</b> personnel costs were reduced by an average of 4. 6 % during the first 12 months after start-up. Over-the-counter sales increased in the same period by an average of 6. 8 %. Despite average initial costs of 118, 000 euros, total costs within the first 12 months fell in 50 % of cases and at least remained the same in 44 %. Conclusions: On average, robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> lead to modest savings in personnel costs and slight increases in sales of over-the-counter drugs. Substantial savings can be achieved only if the staffing level is adapted to the changed personnel requirements...|$|R

Otomatisation of outpatient pharmacy services decrease the incidence of dispensing error, as well as improving the efficiency of picking, packing and labeling process. Since August 2014 an automated <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> was installed in outpatient pharmascy Bethesda Hospital Yogyakarta, integrated with electronic prescribing and hospital information system. The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the impact of automated <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> on the <b>dispensing</b> error at outpatient pharmacy Services using before and after study method. The procentage of drugs deliver by automated <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> at the third and sixth month of implementation was 46 % and 59 %. Failure mode and effeect analysis of dispensing process done before the implementation, and the integration with electronic prescription and hospital information system, as well as the development of smart pack is the key of successed. The average of medications picked after the implementation of automated <b>dispensing</b> <b>machine</b> was (37, 915. 33 ± 3, 160. 12), higher than before implementation (36, 812. 67 ± 2, 890. 81), but not significant. The average of dispensing error after implementation (15, 67 ± 6, 28) was reduced significantly (p< 0, 05) than before (50. 33 ± 34. 47).

40|$|Reaching {{hard-to-reach}} and high-risk injecting {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{is one of}} the most important challenges for contemporary needle syringe programs (NSPs). The aim of this review is to examine, based upon the available international experience, the effectiveness of syringe vending machines and mobile van/bus based NSPs in making services more accessible to these hard-to-reach and high-risk groups of IDUs. A literature search revealed 40 papers/reports, of which 18 were on <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> (including vending and exchange machines) and 22 on mobile vans. The findings demonstrate that syringe <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> and mobile vans are promising modalities of NSPs, which can make services more accessible to the target group and in particular to the harder-to-reach and higher-risk groups of IDUs. Their anonymous and confidential approaches make services attractive, accessible and acceptable to these groups. These two outlets were found to be complementary to each other and to other modes of NSPs. Services through <b>dispensing</b> <b>machines</b> and mobile vans in strategically important sites are crucial elements in continuing efforts in reducing the spread of HIV and other blood borne viruses among IDUs...|$|R
