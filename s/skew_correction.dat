40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for <b>skew</b> <b>correction</b> of documents. <b>Skew</b> <b>correction</b> is modelled as an optimization problem, {{and for the first}} time, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to solve skew optimization. A new objective function based on local minima and maxima of projection profiles is defined, and PSO is utilized to find the best angle that maximizes differences between values of local minima and maxima. In our approach, local minima and maxima converge to the locations of lines and spaces between lines. Results of our <b>skew</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm are shown on documents written in different scripts such as Latin and Arabic related scripts (e. g. Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, [...] .). Experiments show that our algorithm can handle a wide range of skew angles, also it is robust to gray level and binary images of different scripts. 1...|$|E

In this paper, we prove the theoretical equivalence of different methods for slant and <b>skew</b> <b>corrections.</b> In particular, we show that correcting first for skew by rotation and then for slant by a shear transformation in the horizontal direction is equivalent to first correcting for slant by a shear transformation in the horizontal direction and then for skew by a shear transformation in the vertical direction. Our proof can be easily modified to prove equivalence of other methods for correcting the slant and skew.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{algorithms}} {{for accurate}} <b>skew</b> detection and <b>correction</b> of textual documents are presented. They depend on finding a horizontal RLSA {{image of the}} skewed document. The average skew of selected black connected components in the RLSA image is considered as the skew angle for the whole document which is finally rotated {{in the opposite direction}} by that amount to obtain the final corrected image. The first algorithm is a single-pass <b>skew</b> detection and <b>correction</b> algorithm, i. e., the input image is either not rotated or rotated only once.

Towards this end an integrated system for document image preprocessing is presented. This system consists of the following modules: skew angle estimation and correction, line and word segmentation, slope and slant <b>correction.</b> The <b>skew</b> angle <b>correction,</b> slope correction and slant removing algorithms {{are based on a}} novel method that is a combination of the projection profile technique and the Wigner–Ville distribution.

40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} pre-processing task in {{an automated}} document image processing system is detection of skew in the image. <b>Skew</b> detection and <b>correction</b> {{is the first}} step in the document analysis and understanding processing steps. <b>Correction</b> the <b>skewed</b> scanned document image is very important, because it has a direct effect on the reliability and efficiency of the segmentation and feature extraction stages.

The overall process of optical character recognition can be assured successful only when there is skew free document input considered at the time of pre-processing. The automatic <b>skew</b> detection and <b>correction</b> of document images is one of the important operation to be focused in this regard, since it increases the chances of obtaining overall accuracy of entire optical character recognition system. In this paper we have devised a <b>skew</b> detection and <b>correction</b> methodology using multiple projection profiles and skew angles. The document is subjected to computation of vertical profiles and difference is black pixel density is used as parameter to identify the tie points of a particular text block and skew angle.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{an intrinsic}} rule-based license plate localization (LPL) algorithm. It first selects candidate regions, and then filters negative regions with statistical constraints. Key contribution is assigning image inferred weights {{to the rules}} leading to adaptability in selecting saliency feature, which then overrules other features and the collective measure, decides the estimation. Saliency of rules is inherent to the frame under consideration hence all inevitable negative effects present in the frame are nullified, incorporating great deal of flexibility and more generalization. Situations considered for simulation, {{to claim that the}} algorithm is better generalized are, variations in illumination, skewness, aspect ratio and hence the LP font size, vehicle size, pose, partial occlusion of vehicles and presence of multiple plates. Proposed method allows parallel computation of rules, hence suitable for real time application. The mixed data set has 697 images of almost all varieties. We achieve a Miss Rate (MR) = 4 % and False Detection Rate (FDR) = 5. 95 % in average. Also we have implemented <b>skew</b> <b>correction</b> of the above detected LPs necessary for efficient character detection.

40|$|<b>Skew</b> <b>correction</b> {{of complex}} {{document}} images {{is a difficult}} task. We propose an edge-based connected component approach for robust <b>skew</b> <b>correction</b> of documents with complex layout and content. The algorithm essentially consists of two steps - an 'initialization' step to determine the image orientation from the centroids of the connected components and a 'search' step to find the actual skew of the image. During initialization, we choose two different sets of points regularly spaced across the the image, one from the left to right and the other from top to bottom. The image orientation is determined from the slope between the two succesive nearest neighbors {{of each of the}} points in the chosen set. The search step finds succesive nearest neighbors that satisfy the parameters obtained in the initialization step. The final skew is determined from the slopes obtained in the 'search' step. Unlike other connected component based methods, the proposed method does not require any binarization step that generally precedes connected component analysis. The method works well for scanned documents with complex layout of any skew with a precision of 0. 5 degrees...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} to observe {{document}} skew and frame artifacts while photocopying and scanning documents. The motivation of this work is to embed <b>skew</b> <b>correction</b> and frame removal in the copy pipeline of a device to achieve ‘one touch ’ cleanup. The two challenges that this poses are the need for: (a) substantially reducing computation and memory requirements and (b) minimizing the false positives. Peripheral document features, such as, page/content edges are low-complexity document skew predictors, and contentbased approaches are of relatively higher complexity skew predictors. But state-of-the-art page edge detection methods fail on low-contrast document images, or for similar scanbed/document background. To minimize false positives required in embedded implementations, we propose: (1) a robust page edge detection algorithm that is a multiplicative combination of gradients and line based page edge detectors, (2) a robust skew detection algorithm that is a linear combination of page/content edge and content based predictors, and (3) a pipeline for <b>skew</b> <b>correction</b> and frame removal that uses these algorithms and has near- 100 % accuracy {{over a wide range}} of document images.

Two Navy school ASVAB selector composites were used separately and together to simulate three selection situations for nine selection ratios (SRs). The selectors then were used as predictors. Composite validities (the ASVAB Mechanical Comprehension test was the criterion) were corrected using the univariate and the general multivariate formulas. In general, multivariate corrections were more accurate than univariate corrections, notably when the univariate explicit selection variable was negatively <b>skewed</b> and <b>correction</b> violations (linearity and homoscedasticity) did not offset each other. Multivariate correction accuracy was attributed to the inclusion of variables with adequate distributional properties, the compensatory effects of regression weights, and the related psychometric principle that differentially weighting {{a large number of}} correlated predictor variables has little impact on a multiple correlation.
