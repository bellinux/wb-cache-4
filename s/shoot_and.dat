5|$|Asteroids is an arcade space shooter {{released}} in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The {{object of the}} game is to <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.|$|E
5|$|The Monster saves a young shepherdess (Anne Darling) from drowning. Her screams {{upon seeing}} him alert two hunters, who <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> injure the creature. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, kills {{the guards and}} escapes into the woods.|$|E
5|$|Aayirathil Oruvan languished in {{development}} hell due to slow {{progress of the}} <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> the extensive pre- and post-production works, evading release dates ranging one year. Shooting began in July 2007, and took place in various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Jaisalmer, Rajasthan amongst other regions throughout India. Uncut, the film runs for over 220 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes. The film released coinciding with the festival of Thai Pongal on 14 January 2010, with a Telugu dubbing version, titled Yuganikki Okkadu, following six weeks later. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.|$|E

5|$|An urban legend {{surfaced}} in 2011 when a tumblr blog titled Dr. Dre Started Burning Man began proliferating {{the notion that}} the producer, rapper and entrepreneur had discovered Burning Man in 1995 during a music video <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> offered {{to cover the cost of}} the event's permit from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management under an agreement with the festival's organizers that he could institute an entrance fee system, which had not existed before his participation. This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the <b>shoot,</b> <b>and</b> not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} of {{the video}} game approach, in the media art field, Maurice Benayoun’s Virtual Reality artwork The Tunnel under the Atlantic (1995), often compared to video games, introduced a virtual film director, fully autonomous intelligent agent, to <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> edit in real time a full video from the digging performance in the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Museum of Contemporary art in Montreal. The full movie, Inside the Tunnel under the Atlantic, 21h long, was followed in 1997 by Inside the Paris New-Delhi Tunnel (13h long). Only short excerpts where presented to the public. The complex behavior of the Tunnel’s virtual director makes it a significant precursor of later application to video games based machinimas.|$|E

5|$|In the Demi's Birthday Suit August 1992 {{issue of}} Vanity Fair, Moore was {{shown on the}} cover in the body {{painting}} photo by Joanne Gair. The painting is a memorable example of modern body painting artwork. It made Gair an immediate pop culture star as the most prominent body paint artist, which prompted consideration for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign. The 1992 cover, which required a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists, was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. Leibovitz could not decide where to <b>shoot,</b> <b>and</b> reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Donen signed a non-exclusive, three-film deal with Columbia Pictures. His first film under this {{contract}} was Once More, with Feeling! in 1960. Adapted by Harry Kurnitz {{from his own}} stage play, the film was shot in Paris and starred Yul Brynner and Kay Kendall. Brynner plays a tyrannical orchestra conductor whose mistress (Kendall) grows tired of his tantrums and plots to marry him in order to quickly divorce him for his money. Kendall was terminally ill with leukemia during the <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> died before its release. The film was not successful financially or critically.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
40|$|Multiplication {{rate was}} always {{used as the}} sole {{parameter}} for assessment of the optimal treatment for in vitro shoot formation. However, beside {{its effect on the}} shoot formation, different treatments had different impact on the production cost. Separated <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> cluster of different sizes (1, 2, 3 <b>and</b> 4 <b>shoots</b> per cluster) of Smooth cayenne pineapple were cultured at density of 1, 2, 3 <b>and</b> 4 separated <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> 1 cluster on agar solidified full strength MS medium enriched with sucrose at 30 g L - 1 and BAP at 2. 25 mg L - 1 for 2 months to investigate the effect of explants density and explant types on shoot formation per explant, total per liter <b>and</b> cost per <b>shoot.</b> Density of one separated shoot per culture resulted in the highest shoot formations per shoot (11 shoots) but lowest total shoot per liter (550 <b>shoots)</b> <b>and</b> highest cost per shoot (13 cents), while density of 4 shoots per culture resulted in lowest rate (4 shoots) but higher total per liter (1400 <b>shoots)</b> <b>and</b> lowest cost per shoot (10 cents). Cluster of two shoots had higher rate (7 <b>shoots)</b> <b>and</b> lower cost (16 cents) than cluster of 4 <b>shoots</b> (4 <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> 20 cents) but both resulted in equal total shoot per liter (750 shoots). Separated shoot had higher shoot formation capacity, higher total per liter and lower cost per shoots than cluster of <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> using of total per liter instead of rate per explant was the best parameter for selection of treatment of lower cost <b>and</b> higher <b>shoots</b> production...|$|R
30|$|Since we {{measured}} several response variables {{from the same}} replicates, we first performed MANOVAs for the heavy metals found in the earthworms, in the composts, in the plant <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots and in the soil {{at the end of}} the experiment. Since we found no detectable quantities of Cd in the vermicompost <b>and</b> the <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots, and of Pb, Cr, Ni and Cd in the soil, these metals were excluded from the MANOVA analysis. Subsequently, individual heavy metals were compared among treatments with means tests. Weight of <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots was also analyzed combined with a MANOVA, followed by a means test procedure for <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots separately. We evaluated the homogeneity of variances and normality of residuals using Bartlett and Jarque–Bera tests. Analysis of variance was performed and the means tested by Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) at 5 % probability.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Betrayed was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. The Chicago Board of Censors cut {{an attack on a}} man, <b>shooting</b> <b>and</b> two rioting scenes in store, attack on driver, shooting man off horse, last part of love scene, <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> girl <b>and</b> <b>shooting</b> man.|$|R
5|$|The {{producers}} used a documentary-style filming technique. Three {{cameras were}} used for each <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> entire scenes were shot in one take. In contrast, most productions film a scene from each angle and typically repeat the scene several times while readjusting lighting to accommodate each shot. The first takes usually made the final cut. By filming a scene all at once, the producers tried {{to create an environment}} for the actors that was more organic and allowed for the best performances.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{information}} from Black, Mulder concentrates {{on trying to}} find Johnson, when Scully is attacked in the morgue by the dead deputy; Johnson saves her by shooting the deputy, before disappearing. The two agents put all their effort in to finding Johnson {{before it is too}} late. Mulder breaks into Johnson's house but is locked by Johnson in his basement, where he is attacked by the four corpses of the FBI agents; he manages to <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> kill one of them. Frank shows up; after tying up Johnson, Frank shoots two of the zombies in the head. As his gun runs out of bullets and death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month <b>shoot</b> <b>and,</b> at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E

5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E
5|$|Brodeur visits Speranza in his cell, {{and offers}} {{to have his}} death {{sentence}} commuted in exchange for stopping the murders. Speranza takes the offer. That night, Parmelly visits Danielle, who has become agitated since Mulder and Scully have begun staking out her house. The agents now suspect Parmelly to be behind the murders and leave to notify Brodeur, who asks that Parmelly be arrested. Soon afterward, Danielle wakes up to see Neech standing by her room door. She grabs her gun and confronts Parmelly, thinking he is Neech's resurrected form. The agents and a police task force arrive to see her <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> kill Parmelly. Meanwhile, Brodeurassuming that Charez and Parmelly were on the listthinks Speranza has reneged on their deal and has him taken to the showers. Before Brodeur kills him, Speranza claims that one person remains on the list.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique abilities as the game progresses, including abilities needed to solve some puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can smash dirt for banana coins, Chunky Kong can lift rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E
5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{left the}} failed mining {{operation}} in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required {{were that the}} recruit could ride and <b>shoot,</b> <b>and</b> Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and {{after two weeks of}} training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town after three weeks, and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.|$|E
