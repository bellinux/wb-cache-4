2500|$|Tom Richardson (11 August 1870 [...] 2 July 1912) was an English cricketer. A [...] fast bowler, Richardson relied to a {{great extent}} on the {{break-back}} (a fast ball moving from off to leg), a relatively long run-up and high arm which allowed him to gain sharp lift on fast pitches even from the full, <b>straight</b> <b>length</b> he always bowled. He played 358 first-class cricket matches and 14 Tests, taking a total of 2,104 wickets. In the four consecutive seasons from 1894 to 1897 he took 1,005 wickets, a figure surpassed over such a period only by the slow bowler A.P. Freeman. He took 290 wickets in 1895, again a figure only exceeded by Freeman (twice). In 1963 Neville Cardus selected him as one of his [...] "Six Giants of the Wisden Century".|$|E
60|$|The slight quiver {{agitating}} {{the whole}} {{fabric of the}} ship was more perceptible in the silent river, shaded and still like a forest path. The Sofala, gliding with an even motion, had passed beyond the coast-belt of mud and mangroves. The shores rose higher, in firm sloping banks, and the forest of big trees {{came down to the}} brink. Where the earth had been crumbled by the floods it showed a steep brown cut, denuding a mass of roots intertwined as if wrestling underground; and in the air, the interlaced boughs, bound and loaded with creepers, carried on the struggle for life, mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves, with here and there the shape of an enormous dark pillar soaring, or a ragged opening, as if torn by the flight of a cannonball, disclosing the impenetrable gloom within, the secular inviolable shade of the virgin forest. The thump of the engines reverberated regularly like the strokes of a metronome beating the measure of the vast silence, the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the river, and the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied down behind the ship, spread a thin dusky veil over the somber water, which, checked by the flood-tide, seemed to lie stagnant in the whole <b>straight</b> <b>length</b> of the reaches.|$|E

50|$|This is an eroded crater with {{an eastern}} rim {{that is almost}} {{completely}} overlain by smaller craters, including Lauritsen B along the northeast. There is {{a break in the}} rim to the north and a pair of small craters lies across the northwest rim.

50|$|The Starkhorn is a snow-clad peak {{that rose}} in the inner regions of the White Mountains. From its feet sprang the Snowbourn River, whose {{widening}} valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of Rohan.

5000|$|De Angelis' death {{also saw}} the end of Formula One using the full 5.81 km (3.61 mi) Paul Ricard Circuit. In what many saw as a knee-jerk {{reaction}} from FISA, F1 was forced to use the 3.812 km (2.369 mi) [...] "Club" [...] version of the circuit, bypassing the Verriere curves where the Brabham had crashed, and cutting {{the length of the}} Mistral Straight from 1.8 to 1 km in length. The move was unpopular with many of the drivers, although most did like the reduced <b>straight</b> <b>length</b> as it was easier on the engines.|$|E
50|$|An orifice {{gas meter}} {{consists}} of a <b>straight</b> <b>length</b> of pipe inside which a precisely known orifice plate creates a pressure drop, thereby affecting flow. Orifice meters are a type of differential meter, all of which infer the rate of gas flow by measuring the pressure difference across a deliberately designed and installed flow disturbance. The gas static pressure, density, viscosity, and temperature must be measured or known {{in addition to the}} differential pressure for the meter to accurately measure the fluid. Orifice meters often do not handle a large range of flow rates. They are however accepted and understood in industrial applications since they are easy to field-service and have no moving parts.|$|E
40|$|To {{measure a}} flow {{in a closed}} duct, one of the {{available}} methods is to explore the velocity field. With this method, {{the quality of the}} flow measurement is very dependent on the location of the velocity measurement points in the duct section. Recommendations about velocity schemes are proposed in international standards (ISO 3966, ISO 7145, EN 12599 …) for circular and rectangular ducts. These recommendations assume that a turbulent flow profile is established. This requires flow profiler and/or long <b>straight</b> <b>lengths</b> upstream and downstream the measurement section. On site, these recommendations are difficult to apply strictly because conditions of <b>straight</b> <b>lengths</b> are often not available. Secondly, the velocity measurement schemes proposed in standards are often time consuming and users prefer sometimes to simplify them. In this case, the estimation of the measurement error is not known. A numerical study has been carried out to investigate the influence of the velocity measurement scheme on the flow measurement when the distance between disturbances and the measurement section is small in the case of circular and rectangular ducts. The results are presented in term of measurement error according to the shape of the duct, velocity scheme, number of velocity measurements, distance between disturbances and measurement section...|$|R
25|$|Initially, {{the rails}} used were flat-bottomed, 80lb per yard (90lb {{in areas where}} heavy wear was expected), spiked {{directly}} on to the sleepers of creosoted Baltic pine. Only the sharp curve at Shepherdswell had the rails bent to shape; elsewhere, short <b>straight</b> <b>lengths</b> were used on curves. Colonel Stephens obtained various job lots of rails from the salvage dump at Richborough Port, and these included 60lb rails which {{were used for the}} Wingham extension and the Richborough Port branch. The ballast used was colliery waste and ash. There was a universal speed restriction of 25mph.|$|R
