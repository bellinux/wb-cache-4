40|$|In {{spite of}} its {{critical}} role in climate evolution, the Arctic Ocean is the only basin of the world ocean that has essentially not been sampled by the drilling vessels of the Deep-Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) or the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and its long-term environmental history and tectonic structure is therefore poorly known. Exceptions are the ODP Leg 151 and the more recent successful ACEX-expedition of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

Therefore, AURORA BOREALIS is currently projected as a new research icebreaker with drilling facilities to fulfil the needs of the IODP or its eventual successor as a Mission-Specific Platform, to drill in deep, permanently ice-covered ocean basins.

The construction of AURORA BOREALIS requires several new technical design efforts, such as advanced dynamic positioning and deep-sea drilling within closed sea-ice cover and two moon pools (7 x 7 m each), and will provide extended technical potential and knowledge for marine technology.

40|$|In future, new trucks <b>shall</b> {{most likely}} <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> a front {{under-run}} protection devices {{in order to}} prevent passenger cars from under-running. At the same time, the energy absorption by the car will be more adequate, because of the better geometrical compatibility with the truck front. As yet, this device <b>shall</b> not <b>be</b> designed with the objective to absorp energy in favour of the passenger car. From European accident analysis it is known that the average relative speed in a car-to-truck frontal collision is about 76 kph. Today, passenger cars are designed to provide protection to the occupants up to 56 kph in a frontal collision with a rigid wall. If a part of the impact energy could be absorbed by the truck, the injury severity to car occupants in a 75 kph collision would be reduced to survivable injuries observed in a 56 kph collision into a rigid wall. In order not to influence the payload of the truck, the energy absorbing front under-run protection system should be light and compact. Moreover, such a system should be cheap and easy to integrate into future truck design. Materials which could be considered are composites. It is known that composite crash cones have a very high specific energy absorption and are therefore exquisite for application in this field. In this paper, the design and development of an energy absorbing front under-run protection system with composite crash cones will be described and the performance will be demonstrated in a full-scale car-to-truck frontal collision. The results will be compared with the results of a test with identical vehicles, where the speed was 56 kph and the truck was provided with a rigid front under-run protection device...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedInstances of piracy have been increasing since 2006, {{and the international}} community can ignore this problem no more. Legal, socio-economic, and technological issues hinder multi-national efforts to combat piracy effectively. Response to events of piracy are oftentimes late, as reporting of incidents is also mired in legal issues; however, technology does exist that can notify companies that a ship is being attacked by pirates as the attack occurs or possibly prior to the attack if the attackers display intent. This technology is the Ship Security Alert System (SSAS), and The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated that all ships greater than 500 gross tons (United States Coast Guard, 2004) <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> an SSAS.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of ever higher source powers in EUV systems causes increased risks for contamination and degradation of EUV masks and pellicles. Appropriate testing {{can help to}} inventory and mitigate these risks. To this end, we propose EBL 2 : a laboratory EUV exposure system capable of operating at high EUV powers and intensities, and capable of exposing and analyzing EUV masks. The proposed system architecture {{is similar to the}} EBL system which has been operated jointly by TNO and Carl Zeiss SMT since 2005. EBL 2 contains an EUV Beam Line, in which samples can be exposed to EUV irradiation in a controlled environment. Attached to this Beam Line is an XPS system, which can be reached from the Beam Line via an in-vacuum transfer system. This enables surface analysis of exposed masks without breaking vacuum. Automated handling with dual pods is foreseen so that exposed EUV masks will still be usable in EUV lithography tools to assess the imaging impact of the exposure.
