5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of November 2, 2002, a female {{employee}} of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her car on a deserted road near the back gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to contact}} Kell, Hannay flicks through the notebook, finding it {{contains}} pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map {{in the back}} and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the notebook (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective Member of Parliament and a suffragette respectively (Patrick Kennedy and Lydia Leonard), who believe him to be a Liberal spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town (Culross) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle (David Haig), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With the notebook missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle (Dumbarton Castle), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher (Patrick Malahide). Sir George arrives as they are captured and inquires about them while they are held in another room. After he leaves they are bound and gagged and placed in the cellar. They escape and return to where they were captured to look for the notebook, which Victoria reveals <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> from Hannay's pocket and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of the notebook to Victoria.|$|E
25|$|James {{reports that}} Kent fought {{for almost two}} hours and that Rivington {{was killed by a}} shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kents {{armament}} consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiances armament consisted of 20-22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, she {{might have been able to}} use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 or so, she had some 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.|$|E

500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, but when I looked at the songs that I had when I was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really figure out {{that it was going to}} be the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> the songs for it; she said in an interview that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything. I felt that kind of speaks a lot for how truthful the EP is".|$|E
500|$|Stafford was {{admired by}} critics and the {{listening}} {{public for the}} purity of her voice, and {{was considered one of}} the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a coloratura soprano, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural falsetto. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. The music critic Terry Teachout described her as [...] "rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously 'jazzy' [...] ", while Rosemary Clooney said of her, [...] "The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too." [...] Writing for the New York Sun, Will Friedwald described her 1947 interpretation of [...] "Haunted Heart" [...] as [...] "effective because it's so subtle, because Stafford holds something back and doesn't shove her emotion in the listener's face." [...] Nancy Franklin described Stafford's version of the folk song [...] "He's Gone Away" [...] as [...] "wistful and tender, as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up a piece of clothing once worn by a loved one and begun singing." [...] Frank Sinatra said, [...] "It was a joy to sit on the bandstand and listen to her". The singer Judy Collins has cited Stafford's folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. The country singer Patsy Cline was also inspired by Stafford's work.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequently, {{adoption}} {{laws were}} made stricter, giving local authorities {{the power to}} police baby farms {{in the hope of}} stamping out abuse. Despite this and the scrutinising of newspaper personal ads, the trafficking and abuse of infants did not stop. Two years after Dyer's execution, railway workers inspecting carriages at Newton Abbot, Devon, found a parcel. Inside was a three-week-old girl, but, though cold and wet, she was alive. The daughter of a widow, Jane Hill, the baby had been given to a Mrs. Stewart, for £12. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up the baby at Plymouth—and apparently dumped her on the next train. It has been claimed that [...] "Mrs. Stewart" [...] was Polly, the daughter of Amelia Dyer.|$|E
2500|$|On many of Kanno's tracks, a {{woman named}} [...] "Gabriela Robin" [...] was {{credited}} as a lyricist and vocalist, but whenever these songs were performed in concert, either Maaya Sakamoto or Origa would perform them instead. In a 2009 written interview, Robin proclaimed that she would perform {{for the first time}} live at Kanno's 2009 Tanabata Sonic concert, {{but at the end of}} the concert, which featured Kanno directing the Warsaw Philharmonic, Kanno turned to the audience and sang [...] "Moon", a song previously attributed to Robin from the Turn A Gundam soundtrack, revealing that [...] "Gabriela Robin" [...] was simply a pseudonym Kanno used to write songs mixing English and Japanese freely. In a later interview, Kanno said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> the name because the first orchestral recording she had heard was the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and at the time Yitzhak Rabin served as Israel's Prime Minister.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the third}} convention, the city hall in Syracuse, New York was {{selected}} as the site. Because Syracuse was nearer to Seneca Falls (two days' travel by horse, several hours' journey by rail), more of the original signers of the Declaration of Sentiments were able to attend than the previous two conventions in Massachusetts. Lucretia Mott was named president; at one point she felt it necessary to silence a minister who offended the assembly by using biblical references to keep women subordinate to men. A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read and its resolutions voted on. At sessions taking place September 8–10, 1852, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage made their first public speeches on women's rights. Ernestine Rose spoke denouncing duties without rights, saying [...] "as a woman has to pay taxes to maintain government, she has a right to participate in the formation and administration of it." [...] Antoinette Brown called for more women to become ministers, claiming that the Bible did not forbid it. Ernestine Rose stood up in response, saying that the Bible should not be used as the authority for settling a dispute, especially as it contained much contradiction regarding women. Elizabeth Oakes Smith called for women to have their own journal so that they could become independent of the male-owned press, saying [...] "We should have a literature of our own, a printing press and a publishing house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as lectures and conventions; and yet I say this to a race of beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources." [...] Antoinette Brown lectured about how masculine law can never fully represent womankind. Lucy Stone wore a trousered dress often referred to as [...] "bloomers", a more practical style <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up during the summer after meeting Amelia Bloomer. She spoke to say [...] "The woman who first departs from the routine in which society allows her to move must suffer. Let us bravely bear ridicule and persecution {{for the sake of the}} good that will result, and when the world sees that we can accomplish what we undertake, it will acknowledge our right." [...] The Syracuse Weekly Chronicle was impressed less by her costume than by her electrifying address, printing [...] "Well, whether we like it or not, little woman, God made you an ORATOR!" ...|$|E
