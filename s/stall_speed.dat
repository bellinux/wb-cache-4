5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> by about 1.5%. A higher <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the <b>stall</b> <b>speed.</b> Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at <b>stall</b> <b>speed.</b> This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
50|$|Camber {{is usually}} {{designed}} into an aerofoil {{to increase the}} maximum lift coefficient. This minimizes the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of aircraft using the aerofoil.

25|$|The Archaeopteryx was {{conceived}} as a foot-launchable microlift sailplane, with the design goals of a light empty weight, low <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> with gentle stall characteristics, good maneuverability and good high speed performance. A further goal was a sailplane that could be foot-launched in zero wind conditions.|$|E
25|$|The wing is {{equipped}} with slotted Fowler flaps, which occupy 2/3 of the span. These deploy to 40 degrees and lower the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> by 9 knots to 51 knots (60mph). The flaps are always set to 20 degrees for takeoff. The ailerons are operated by control sticks and feature end-fences inboard and outboard for better slow speed and stall handling.|$|E

40|$|Description {{is given}} of flight tests {{conducted}} on gun fairings, designed {{to correct the}} detrimental effects of the projecting and submerged wing guns on an F 4 F- 3 fighter.

50|$|Modifications to {{the wing}} {{included}} endplates {{instead of the}} standard wingtips, the removal of wing root leading edge extensions and drooping the trailing edges. These modifications resulted in a lower <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of 38 kn at a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 2,300 lb compared to a 45 kn <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> at a 2,100 lb MTOW in the original aircraft. The Chipmunk's original de Havilland Gipsy Major engine was retained, but the original metal propeller was replaced with a lighter fine-pitch wooden propeller.|$|R
25|$|The PC-24 is a {{twin-engine}} business jet, {{a larger}} jet-powered follow-on {{to the earlier}} Pilatus PC-12. It {{is considered to be}} a short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft, being designed to operate from short and rough airstrips. It incorporates an advanced wing design, with a large double-slotted flap system to achieve the necessary performance, having a <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> of only 81 knots at the maximum landing weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ice on {{aircraft}} are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are {{an increase in}} <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form {{on the leading edge}} of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.|$|E
25|$|The ultra-light pilot permit is {{endorsed}} with {{a blanket}} type rating for all models of ultra-light aeroplanes. Transport Canada defines two general categories of ultra-light aeroplane. The operating and flight rules for basic ultra-light aeroplanes (BULA) does not allow any passenger carrying. The advanced ultra-light aeroplane (AULA) has stricter design requirements and includes passenger carrying if the pilot has an ultra-light pilot permit endorsed with the Passenger-carryingultra-light aeroplane rating. Holders of this permit may also fly certified or homebuilt aeroplanes that meet the weight and <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> requirements of an ultra-light aeroplane.|$|E
50|$|Slats, {{also known}} as leading edge devices, are {{extensions}} {{to the front of}} a wing for lift augmentation, and are intended to reduce the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> by altering the airflow over the wing. Slats may be fixed or retractable - fixed slats (e.g. as on the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch) give excellent slow speed and STOL capabilities, but compromise higher speed performance. Retractable slats, as seen on most airliners, provide reduced <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> for take-off and landing, but are retracted for cruising.|$|R

25|$|On 19 August 2011, it was {{reported}} that the first delivery of the ARJ21 would likely to be delayed by up to a year or more after problems surfaced during the flight testing programme. On 24 August 2011, it {{was reported}} that two components of the testing program had not been completed; icing tests were underway but delayed, and <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> tests had not yet begun. According to an anonymous source within the program, this could lead to delays in obtaining type certification, which could in turn lead to delays in delivery.|$|E
25|$|In July 1972, Air National Guard units began {{supporting}} Air Force tanker {{task forces}} overseas with second-line KC-97 Stratofreighter propeller-driven tankers and volunteer crews when needed. Triggered by a 1974 decision by Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger to save money, the Ohio Air National Guard's 145th Air Refueling Squadron acquired the ANG's first jet tanker in April 1975 {{when it began}} converting from KC-97Ls to KC-135A Stratotankers. Altogether, the Air Force transferred 128 older KC-135s to the air reserve components to retire the slow prop-driven tankers, which modern fighters had to reduce speed to nearly <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> in order to refuel from.|$|E
25|$|The SOCATA TBM is a single-engined turboprop-powered low-wing monoplane, {{capable of}} seating {{a maximum of}} seven people. It is {{composed}} mainly of aluminium and steel construction, but with the tail surfaces built of Nomex honeycomb. The wing features a very effective Fowler flap, comprising 80 per cent of the trailing edge's span, {{for the purpose of}} lowering the aircraft's <b>stall</b> <b>speed.</b> The TBM 700 is outfitted with a retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement, newer models feature stronger main landing gear wheels and tougher tyres. The TBM 900 model features automatic torque limiting for “set and forget” power management, which is of particularly use during takeoffs; according to Aviation Week, while this function does reduce the high workload associated with managing the PT6A engine, it is not as capable as a full FADEC arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|Horton, Inc of Wellington, Kansas offers STOL kits {{under the}} brand name Horton STOL-Craft, {{emphasizing}} that the modifications increase safety by allowing forced landings to occur at lower speeds and thus improve survivability. The Horton modifications include a drooped leading edge cuff, conical cambered wingtips, control surface gap seals and wing fences. The company says: [...] "On an average {{you can expect to}} get a 4-7 knot reduction in <b>stall</b> <b>speeds.</b> Flying at these lower <b>stall</b> <b>speeds</b> you can reduce the take-off and landing distances by 10%". Horton STOL kits are available for several Cessna and Piper PA-28 models.|$|R
5000|$|In the USA from 1945 until 1991,the one-engine-inoperative climb {{requirement}} for multi-engine airplanes {{with a maximum}} takeoff weight of 6000 lb or less was as follows: All multi-engine airplanes having a <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> [...] greater than 70 miles per hour shall have a steady rate of climb of at least [...] in feet per minute {{at an altitude of}} 5,000 feet with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines operating at not more than maximum continuous power, the inoperative propeller in the minimum drag position, landing gear retracted, wing flaps in the most favorable position … where [...] is the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> in the landing configuration in miles per hour.|$|R
25|$|Fitted with {{retractable}} auxiliary {{wing flaps}} enabling a wing loading of around 12.5lb per square foot, the Messenger featured triple fins and rudders {{in order to}} maintain sufficient controllability down to the exceptionally low <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of 25mph.|$|R
25|$|Early on, the TBM 700 was {{available}} in several different configurations and models. The introduction of the TBM 700C2, which increased the maximum takeoff weight from 6,578lb to 7,394lb, enabled operators to fly with both fully laden fuel tanks and maximum cabin occupancy instead of comprising between the two due to weight restrictions. The modifications made upon this model included {{the addition of a}} baggage compartment aft of the rear pressure bulkhead, the strengthening of the wing and landing gear, and seat crashworthiness certification for up to 20 G to accommodate for an elevated <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> at higher weights. Around the same time, SOCATA decided to re-design the interior of the aircraft, both in terms of the fittings and finish, along with the adoption of a new integrated environmental control system, to improve passenger comfort levels.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{modifications}} {{were required}} for the B-29 Superfortress to enable it to perform the special operations mission. All turrets, except the tail turret, {{were removed from the}} aircraft, leaving the aircraft unarmed and incapable of self-defense. A parachutist’s exit was made where the belly gun turret was originally located. Resupply bundles were mounted on bomb racks inside the bomb bay, thus allowing the bundles to be dropped like bombs over the drop zone. Aircraft were painted black, and a crude HTR-13 obstruction-warning radar was installed to warn the crew of approaching terrain. The major flaw in the B-29 employed in the special operations role, however, was that it had been designed for high-altitude precision bombing, not low-level airdrop. Over the drop zone at drop airspeed, the aircraft was near its <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> and was difficult to maneuver.|$|E
25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to {{tell the}} flight attendants to prepare for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to contact them through the intercom. He asked the captain for permission {{to go down to}} find out what was happening, and Cronin agreed. Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers. As he went down to the lower deck, the magnitude of the damage became apparent as he saw the large hole in the side of the cabin. Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door. He concluded that it was probably a bomb and that, considering the damage, it would be unwise to exceed the airplane's <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> by more than a small margin.|$|E
50|$|The {{radial turbine}} {{increases}} {{the velocity of}} the airflow over the wing's upper surface independently of the forward motion of the aircraft, so that the fan wing can achieve useful lift at forward speeds lower than the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> for a conventional wing.|$|R
