5|$|A spur {{was built}} near Rhosgoch to {{facilitate}} the building of an oil tank farm in the 1970s. This was built to receive oil from tankers moored offshore in the deep waters off Amlwch, before it was pumped to the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire. The site was decommissioned after a <b>short</b> <b>life,</b> but the short spur remains.|$|E

5|$|Despite its <b>short</b> <b>life,</b> {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their <b>short</b> <b>life</b> cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a <b>short</b> <b>life</b> and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a <b>short</b> <b>life.</b> Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tropical}} cyclone's <b>short</b> <b>life,</b> overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts {{did not anticipate}} Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models indicated the system would reach hurricane status within {{two to three days}} under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.|$|E
5|$|His decade-long reign {{over the}} Kievan Rus' {{was marked by}} rapid {{expansion}} into the Volga River valley, the Pontic steppe, and the Balkans. By {{the end of his}} <b>short</b> <b>life,</b> Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital in 969 from Kiev (modern-day Ukraine) to Pereyaslavets (identified as the modern village of Nufăru, Romania) on the Danube. In contrast with his mother's conversion to Christianity, Sviatoslav remained a staunch pagan all of his life. Due to his abrupt death in ambush, his conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a fratricidal feud among his three sons, resulting in two of them being killed.|$|E

5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their <b>short</b> <b>life</b> spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} <b>short</b> <b>life</b> expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} she entered some failed {{business}} ventures, including in 1988 a perfume named Woman (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon's—at 13/14 Upper St. Martin's Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu items such as Rubber Sole (a play on the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as Sgt. Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a <b>short</b> <b>life</b> as a business venture, as it {{was considered to be}} far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts on the men in her life encouraging her.|$|E

5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, <b>short</b> <b>life</b> span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are {{regarded as one of the}} most promising species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The <b>short</b> <b>life</b> of their lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, {{and the heat}} generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their <b>short</b> <b>life</b> cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
40|$|I {{argue that}} the reason the book-to-market effect is {{stronger}} in small stocks is because smaller stocks generally have <b>shorter</b> <b>life</b> expectancy and therefore shorter equity duration. I build a model in which the book-to-market effect is stronger in stocks with <b>shorter</b> <b>life</b> expectancy. Empirically, I use delisting probability as my proxy for life expectancy. The data support my model's central prediction and its additional implications for stock return and variance. My results provide a rational explanation for the heterogeneity of the book-to-market effect, evidence previously taken as support for behavioral explanations.

5|$|B.integrifolia flowers have {{an unusually}} <b>short</b> <b>life</b> span for Banksia species, {{producing}} nectar {{for only about}} four to twelve days after anthesis. Most nectar is produced during the night and early in the morning, with only small amounts produced during the day. Flowers are produced all through the year, {{but there is a}} strong peak in autumn. Little else flowers within its range at this time, so it is a seasonally important source of food for nectariferous animals. Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species, including a wide range of insects; many species of bird including Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird), Anthochaera chrysoptera (little wattlebird), Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill) and Trichoglossus haematodus (rainbow lorikeet); and mammals such as Petaurus norfolcensis (squirrel glider), Petaurus breviceps (sugar glider), Acrobates pygmaeus (feathertail glider) and Pteropus poliocephalus (grey-headed flying fox). In some areas such as at Bungawalbin National Park in northern New South Wales, B.integrifolia is the only source of nectar and pollen in the autumn (March–April) and late winter (July). The importance of non-flying mammals to pollination of B.integrifolia was demonstrated in 1989, with a study in Wilsons Promontory National Park showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them.|$|E
5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its <b>short</b> <b>life,</b> it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the radio}} {{broadcast}} of Meet Mrs. Beeton, a 1934 comedy in which Samuel was portrayed in an unflattering light, and Mrs Beeton, a 1937 documentary, Mayston Beeton worked with H. Montgomery Hyde {{to produce the}} biography Mr and Mrs Beeton, although completion and publication were delayed until 1951. In the meantime Nancy Spain published Mrs Beeton and her Husband in 1948, updated and retitled in 1956 to The Beeton Story. In the new edition Spain hinted at, but did not elucidate upon, on the possibility that Samuel contracted syphilis. Several other biographies followed, including from the historian Sarah Freeman, who wrote Isabella and Sam in 1977; Nown's Mrs Beeton: 150 Years of Cookery and Household Management, published on the 150th anniversary of Isabella's birthday, and Hughes's The <b>Short</b> <b>Life</b> and Long Times of Mrs Beeton, published in 2006. Isabella was ignored by the Dictionary of National Biography for many years: while Acton {{was included in the}} first published volume of 1885, Isabella did not have an entry until 1993.|$|E
