40|$|Construction of {{windmill}} parks {{has increased}} heavily in Europe and Sweden. The expansion has forced building companies {{to make their}} production more effective {{for this type of}} project. Previous studies have shown that introduction of industrialized methods for onsite production of concrete constructions can lead to more efficient project execution. The industrialized production methods studied in this report are <b>self</b> <b>compacted</b> <b>concrete</b> and rebar carpets mats applied on windmill foundations. To reach a higher buildability for cast onsite concrete constructions, good cooperation with the designer early in the project is needed to affect the design in support of more industrialized production method. Good communication between the client, the designer, the contractor and the subcontractors are also needed to achieve buildable design for efficient production. As a result, better working environment, a better choice for suitable production methods and economical savings for the entire project can be achieved. The purpose of this thesis is to study production methods such as reinforcement montage that can lead to higher production capacity for the construction of windmill foundations. The study includes the analysis of production methods used today and of methods that can lead to a better buildability and efficiency for the production process. First a literature survey was conducted to collect background information of the problem and identify suitable production methods and designs for gravity windmill foundations. An onsite study over reinforcement montage was made in Jädraås windmill park and in Solberg windmill park outside of Örnsköldsvik. The collected information has been analyzed and different production methods and design solutions have been compared. The result from the study shows that the industrialized methods of <b>self</b> <b>compacted</b> <b>concrete</b> and reinforced carpet mats leads to a higher buildabilty for windmill foundations. The introduction of <b>self</b> <b>compact</b> <b>concrete</b> will eliminate the heavy vibration moment from the casting operation. Hence, fewer workers will be needed during the casting operation, implying that the reinforcement of next windmill foundation can start earlier. <b>Self</b> <b>compacted</b> <b>concrete</b> is financially efficient for windmill parks when a large amount of windmill foundations shall be constructed and/or when the time for the project is tight. Rebar carpets mats can replace about 50 percent of the total reinforced amount used in foundation, which also leads to a decrease of 47 % of the working time for the reinforcement montage. However, the material cost will increase which has {{to be taken into account}} and compared with the decreasing amount of work. Windmill foundations have different designs. In this study a square shaped and an octagonal shaped foundation are compared to identify which of the designs that will be the most effective to produce. The foundations are not completely comparable since the foundations have different requirements for the different shapes. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that the square shaped foundation has a simpler design better buildability than the octagonal shaped foundation. However, the octangonal shaped foundation is more efficient regarding the use of material. Therefore, it is difficult in forehand to whether the higher material cost of the square shaped foundations is balanced by the decreasing amount of working hours. Thus, the design should consider the material costs and resources available when the project is launched. Communications between the actors of the project are accordingly important to reach a better buildability. The project needs good and clear communication with all the parts that are involved with the project. A good work environment, suitable production methods, standardizing of all the parts in the project as well as a visualization of working preparations with BIM-models are all important steps to prevent misunderstandings and make the project more efficient. Simplicity in the production will increase the efficiency in the project. Validerat; 20120615 (anonymous...|$|R

The binder/dry aggregate (b/agg) ratio by mass was 1 : 3. The following properties were analyzed: compressive strength, direct tensile strength, flexural tensile strength and splitting tensile strength. Granite presented the best mechanical performance. The replacement of natural sand by granite sand generated concretes with {{the same level of}} compressive strength and caused an increase in tensile strength values. The incorporation of silica fume into concrete with granite produced an increase of 17 % in compressive strength.

40|$|<b>Self</b> <b>Compacting</b> <b>Concretes</b> (SCC) are {{characterized}} by their high fluidity {{so they can be}} placed in sections with congested reinforcements and in restricted areas without vibration. Furthermore, SCC cement paste has to be viscous enough to avoid segregation and to maintain the stability of the suspension until the onset of hardening. To fulfil these rheological requirements, mix design engineers combine use of superplasticizers and viscosity agents. The mechanism of action of these chemical admixtures is very sensitive to their adsorption. The blending of these polymers generates a competitive adsorption on surface sites of cement particles, which influences their performances. For a better understanding of competitive adsorption, we measure here both the amount of adsorbed polymers and its consequences on the rheological behaviour of the system in terms of yield stress and plastic viscosity. Our results suggest that the competitive adsorption prevents some of the polymer molecules from adsorbing, thereby moderating the performances of adsorbing polymers and enhancing the effects of polymers potentially in solution on the rheological properties of cement paste...|$|R

In order to study effect of sustained elevated temperature on the compressive strength, flexural strength, tensile strength & impact strength of <b>self</b> <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> and ordinary concrete, the specimens of <b>Self</b> <b>Compacting</b> <b>Concrete</b> and ordinary conventional concrete were tasted in laboratory. For various tests 21 cubes(150 mmX 150 mmX 150 mm), 21 cylinders (100 mmdiaX 200 mmheight), 21 beams(100 mmx 100 mmX 500 mm) and 21 plates were cast and same for the ordinary concrete. The specimens were kept in oven at required temperature (280 C, 1000 C, 2000 C, 3000 C, 4000 C, 5000 C and 6000 C) for 5 hrs at constant temperatures. The results obtained were compared with the corresponding properties of normal concrete with the same water cement and air content...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- <b>Self</b> <b>compacting</b> <b>{{concrete}}</b> (SCC) is {{a concrete}} that flow {{under its own}} weight. It does not require vibration for placing and compaction. <b>Self</b> <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> is particularly useful in casting heavily reinforced sections, complicated formwork or in places where {{it is difficult to}} use vibrators. In this experiment cement was partially replaced by 20 % and 30 % of fly ash. Replacing cement by fly ash saves the amount of cement requirement, thus reduces the cost of concrete. Further Macro Synthetic fiber with different length and dosage were added. Workability and mechanical properties of this fiber reinforced concrete were studies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} different fibres on the residual compressive strength, the ultimate load and flexural toughness, the failure pattern and the fracture energy of <b>self</b> <b>compacting</b> high-performance <b>concrete</b> (SCHPC) after exposure to various high temperature. The micro polypropylene fiber (PP fiber) could mitigate the spalling of SCHPC member significantly, but did not show clear effect on the mechanic properties of concrete. The macro steel fiber (SF) reinforced SCHPC showed higher flexural toughness and ultimate load before and after high temperatures. The mechanical properties of hybrid fibre reinforced SCHPC (HFSCHPC) after heating were better than that of mono-fibre reinforced SCHPC. The failure mode changed from pull-out of steel fibers at lower temperature to broken down of steel fibers at higher temperature. The use of hybrid fibre can be effective in providing the residual strength and failure pattern and in improving the toughness and fracture energy of SCHPC after high temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT — Now a days {{using of}} {{industrial}} waste materials has more in construction sector for {{the making of}} concrete because it contributes to reducing the consumption of natural resources. <b>Self</b> – <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> (SCC) is a high performance concrete which can flow under its own weight and it fills the form work perfectly and self-consolidates without any additional vibration devices. This concrete can accelerate the placement and reduce the labour needs for compaction and finishing. Copper slag {{is one of the}} waste materials which can have a hopeful expectation in construction industry as partial or full alternative of fine aggregates. The objective of this work is to study the strength properties of self-compacted copper slag concrete. For this purpose M 25 grade concrete was used and test were conducted for various proportion of sand replaced by copper slag at 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, 100 % and silica fume were used as an admixture to the concrete...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{to identify the}} residual strength in the post-cracking regime has been developed at the Politecnico di Milano for thin-walled Fibre Cementitious Composite structures. The idea is that to spatially uncouple compressive stresses from tensile stresses in an indirect tensile test, close to Brazilian test, by introducing only a mode I crack opening. The uncoupling caused by a double notch allows the test procedure to identify the real toughness associated to fibre pull-out. The identification of in plane strength vs. crack opening for shear and diffusion stress states, especially for oriented cast flows favoured by <b>self</b> <b>compacting</b> mixes, suggests {{the use of this}} {{new technique}} that can be also easily coupled to bending tests. In this paper the main experimental details will be discussed, while in a companion paper the reliability of the identification procedure with reference to bending tests on <b>self</b> <b>compacting</b> fiber reinforced <b>concrete</b> for different casting procedures is investigated...|$|R
