Recently, microfluidic lab-on-a-chip offers a unique opportunity for various biomedical applications. Since different chip substrates have different advantages and limitations, hybrid devices can draw more benefits from different substrates. Therefore, we have developed three paper/polymer hybrid microfluidic biochips integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for high-sensitivity infectious disease diagnosis. ^ We {{for the first time}} developed a low-cost paper/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hybrid microfluidic biochip for rapid, sensitive and instrument-free detection of a main meningitis-causing bacterium, N. meningitidis. The hybrid microfluidic biochip with paper inside enabled stable testing results over a much longer period of time than a paper-free microfluidic biochip. Although no any specialized instruments were used, the limit of detection of 3 copies per LAMP zone for N. meningitidis was readily achieved, which was comparable to costly qPCR. We further demonstrated the broader application of our microfluidic approach with high sensitivity and specificity by testing the whooping cough-causing bacterium, B. pertussis, in 100 human clinical samples. On the basis of <b>singleplexed</b> pathogen detection, we developed another paper/PDMS hybrid microfluidic biochip for simultaneous detection of three pathogens, N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and Hib, which cause most of the bacterial meningitis.

40|$|Influenza A H 3 N 2, H 1 N 1, and {{influenza}} B viruses primarily cause winter {{illness in}} humans, leading to significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in {{the population of the}} very young, the elderly, and people with chronic disease. In addition to the regular seasonal epidemics of influenza, influenza pandemics associated with the emergence of new influenza A strains are threatening due to high levels of mortality, social disruption, and economic losses. These novel strains are not affected by the human immunity developed to older strains of influenza, therefore can spread readily and infect a vast number of people. The most recent flu pandemic outbreak was in 2009, in which pandemic swine influenza A H 1 N 1 was transmitted. Thus, an initiative to prevent human infections with new strains of influenza A virus with pandemic potential has been supported by the government and become a focus of many laboratories. The first step in any preventative measures is early detection. Therefore, it is essential to develop a detection platform that is capable of simultaneous multiplexing and exploitable for point-of-care (POC) analysis. Virus culture, nucleic acid testing, and immunoassays are primary detection approaches to confirm acute human influenza virus infection. Nucleic acid testing has great sensitivity and specificity to subtype influenza strains, and high capacity for multiplexed detection. However, it is time and labor intensive, and expensive. Virus isolation is slow, costly, and not feasible for routine diagnostic testing. Immunoassays, in contrast, are known for availability, low-cost, accuracy, and versatility, and therefore have become a centerpiece in diagnostics. Among a number of analytical detection techniques developed for immunoassays, SERS (surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy) biosensing utilizing antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (Ab-AuNPs) is a promising virus detection technique providing high sensitivity (down to single molecule detection) and multiplexing (distinction of different strains of a single virus type). Herein a simple, rapid, sensitive AuNP-based immunoassay was developed to quantitatively detect influenza A virus, utilizing dynamic light scattering (DLS) and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The assay platform was established based on the principle of homogeneous format. Antigen-specific antibodies (Abs) were attached to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), rendering the biospecificity for the detection. AuNPs serve as a signal generator or label. A biological sample containing targeted analytes was mixed with Ab-conjugated AuNPs (or AuNP probes); aggregation of nanoparticle was induced {{in the presence of the}} analyte(s). The antibody molecules on the particle surface recognized and bound to the analyte via the key-lock like mechanism, cross-linking AuNPs together to form aggregates. The quantification of antigen became the matter of detecting aggregation. The reaction happened in a timely fashion, oftentimes in a few minutes owing to the fast solution phase kinetics. No washing was required; therefore, time and labor were remarkably saved relative to heterogeneous assays. When utilizing this platform, alteration of different antigen-specific antibodies can perform detection of different antigen analytes individually (<b>singleplexing).</b> The combination of multiple types of AuNP probes in one assay allows simultaneously multiplexed detection. In order to ensure the robustness of the assay, optimization for each stage of the platform design was thoroughly studied. The optimal conditions for maintaining the stability of the gold nanoparticles coated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were investigated by varying pH, conjugation chemistry, mAbs concentrations, and blocking reagents. DLS is exploited to monitor the conjugation of the antibodies on AuNPs and verify the aggregate formation of the antigen-induced AuNP probes based on hydrodynamic diameter measurements. The DLS-based immunoassay has been demonstrated as an excellent rapid screening method to evaluate the specificity and affinity of antibody-antigen binding. Comparing to a conventional method for antibody screening (i. e. ELISA), a DLS assay requires only 30 min while it takes 24 h to perform an ELISA. To address the urgent need for multiplexed detection, we have slightly modified the DLS assay to develop a SERS-based homogeneous immunoassay. Namely, Raman reporters and antibody were co-immobilized on the AuNPs to construct ERLs (extrinsic Raman labels). Raman reporters provide distinctive and amplified signal for detection. In order to detect multiple analytes, multiple types of ERLs were separately prepared; each type was a unique combination of one antigen-specific antibody and one Raman reporter. The ERLs were then mixed together and added to the sample. Aggregation was induced upon the introduction of the antigen to the suspension of ERLs on the order of minutes. ERLs of the same type were cross-linked via the antigen specific to the antibody conjugated to the very type of ERLs. The nonspecific ERLs remained unreacted if their antigens were not present in the sample. Once aggregation occurred, the SERS signals provided by the Raman reporters on the reacted ERLs were turned on. AuNPs in the aggregating state were in proximity to each other and created small gaps between them. Raman reporters once trapped in those gaps generated signal for detection. In theory, SERS analysis can be performed in solution but in reality poor plasmonic coupling between antibody-modified AuNP limits the SERS enhancement. However, dehydration of the aggregates reduces interparticle spacing to yield higher SERS signals. Therefore, separation of aggregated ERLs on a well-defined nanoporous membrane was applied to intensify the signal. The conditions for optimal filtration process have been investigated. Preliminary data have shown progress made toward a fully developed configuration for a portable multiplexed, sensitive, and rapid POC detection platform...|$|R

In this study sensitive immunoassay detection of human cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 12 p 70 and TNFα is shown for <b>singleplex</b> and multiplex formats using a novel miniaturized ELISA platform. The platform uses a disposable plastic multi-syringe aspirator (MSA) integrating 8 disposable fluoropolymer microfluidic test strips, each containing {{an array of}} ten 200 μm mean i. d. microcapillaries coated {{with a set of}} monoclonal antibodies. Each MSA device thus performs 10 tests on 8 samples, delivering 80 measurements. Unprecedented levels of sensitivity were obtained with the novel fluoropolymer microfluidic material and simple colorimetric detection in a flatbed scanner. The limit of detection for <b>singleplex</b> detection ranged from 2. 0 to 15. 0 pg ml− 1, i. e. 35 and 713 femtomolar for <b>singleplex</b> cytokine detection, and the intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) remained within 10 %. In addition, a triplex immunoassay was developed for measuring IL- 1 β, IL- 12 p 70 and TNFα simultaneously from a given sample in the pg ml− 1 range. These assays permit high sensitivity measurement with rapid < 15 min assay or detection from undiluted blood serum. The portability, speed and low-cost of this system are highly suited to point-of-care testing and field diagnostics applications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{previously}} designed end-point multiplex PCR assay and <b>singleplex</b> assays used {{to detect}} β-lactamase genes were evaluated using rapid PCR amplification methodology. Amplification times were 16 – 18 minutes with an overall detection time of 1. 5 hours. Rapid PCR amplifications could decrease {{the time required to}} identify resistance mechanisms in Gram-negative organisms...|$|E
40|$|Telomere {{length is}} a {{potential}} biomarker of aging and risk for age-related diseases. For measurement of relative telomere repeat mass (TRM), qPCR is typically used primarily due to its low cost and low DNA input. But {{the position of the}} sample on a plate often impacts the qPCR-based TRM measurement. Recently we developed a novel, probe-based Luminex assay for TRM that requires ~ 50 ng DNA and involves no DNA amplification. Here we report, for the first time, a comparison among TRM measurements obtained from (a) two <b>singleplex</b> qPCR assays (using two different primer sets), (b) a multiplex qPCR assay, and (c) our novel Luminex assay. Our comparison is focused on characterizing the effects of sample positioning on TRM measurement. For qPCR, DNA samples from two individuals (K and F) were placed in 48 wells of a 96 -well plate. For each <b>singleplex</b> qPCR assay, we used two plates (one for Telomere and one for Reference gene). For the multiplex qPCR and the Luminex assay, the telomere and the reference genes were assayed from the same well. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the TRM for Luminex (7. 2 to 8. 4 %) was consistently lower than <b>singleplex</b> qPCR (11. 4 to 14. 9 %) and multiplex qPCR (19. 7 to 24. 3 %). In all three qPCR assays the DNA samples in the left- and right-most columns showed significantly lower TRM than the samples towards the center, which was not the case for the Luminex assay (p = 0. 83). For <b>singleplex</b> qPCR, 30. 5 % of the variation in TL was explained by column-to-column variation and 0. 82 to 27. 9 % was explained by sample-to-sample variation. In contrast, only 5. 8 % of the variation in TRM for the Luminex assay was explained by column-to column variation and 50. 4 % was explained by sample-to-sample variation. Our novel Luminex assay for TRM had good precision and did not show the well position effects of the sample that were seen in all three of the qPCR assays that were tested...|$|E

40|$|Drug {{development}} and investigation of protein function both require {{an understanding of}} protein subcellular localization. We developed a system, REALoc, that can predict the subcellular localization of <b>singleplex</b> and multiplex proteins in humans. This system, based on comprehensive strategy, consists of two heterogeneous systematic frameworks that integrate one-to-one and many-to-many machine learning methods and use sequence-based features, including amino acid composition, surface accessibility, weighted sign aa index, and sequence similarity profile, as well as gene ontology function-based features. REALoc {{can be used to}} predict localization to six subcellular compartments (cell membrane, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, mitochondrion, nucleus, and extracellular). REALoc yielded a 75. 3 % absolute true success rate during five-fold cross-validation and a 57. 1 % absolute true success rate in an independent database test, which was > 10 % higher than six other prediction systems. Lastly, we analyzed the effects of Vote and GANN models on <b>singleplex</b> and multiplex localization prediction efficacy. REALoc is freely available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Sporadically, HAdVs from species HAdV-C are {{detected}} in acute respiratory disease outbreaks. To rapidly type these viruses, we designed real-time PCR assays that detect and discriminate between adenovirus types HAdV-C 1, -C 2, -C 5, and -C 6. Sixteen clinical isolates from the California Department of Public Health {{were used to}} validate the new assays. Type-specific TaqMan real-time PCR assays were designed and used independently to successfully identify 16 representative specimens. The lower limit of detection for our LightCycler <b>singleplex</b> real-time PCR assays were calculated to be 100, 100, 100, and 50 genomic copies per reaction for HAdV-C 1, HAdV-C 2, HAdV-C 5 and HAdV-C 6, respectively. The results for the <b>singleplex</b> J. B. A. I. D. S. assays were similar. Our assays did not cross-react with other adenoviruses outside of species HAdV-C, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, or respiratory disease causing bacteria. These assays {{have the potential to}} be useful as diagnostic tools for species HAdV-C infection...|$|E
30|$|All {{specimens}} were analysed both in <b>singleplex</b> and in multiplex reactions. Multiplex PCR {{may lack}} sensitivity {{when compared to}} <b>singleplex</b> PCR (Mannonen et al. 2012), but here the carefully optimized multiplex PCR had identical sensitivity {{in comparison to the}} <b>singleplex</b> PCR (data not shown). The obtained LOD 2.9 cp/reaction for M. pneumoniae can be considered functional and is comparable to those reported by others (Dumke and Jacobs 2009, 2014; Welti et al. 2003; Schmitt et al. 2013). For the C. pneumoniae component of the multiplex PCR, the LOD of 0.13 IFU/PCR reaction was obtained. The sensitivities of previously published PCR assays are challenging to compare since no standard preparations for measuring analytical sensitivity are available (Dowell et al. 2001). Until international molecular standards become available, molecular EQA panels may {{be the best way to}} estimate sensitivity of a molecular test. Here we analysed a QCMD 2014 proficiency panel for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae with the developed multiplex PCR method. The multiplex PCR method identified all core samples correctly indicating acceptable level of proficiency. In addition, 3 / 6 educational samples were identified correctly. The remaining three educational samples which tested negative by the multiplex PCR and the reference methods, were infrequently detected by the proficiency panel participants, and only 20.6 and 43.7  % of the laboratories reported positive M. pneumoniae results and 58  % positive C. pneumoniae result for these samples indicating very low level of bacteria in these samples. Overall, the developed multiplex real-time PCR showed good specificity and sensitivity for detecting M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in clinical and simulated specimens. The performance of the multiplex PCR assay was comparable to that of the reference PCRs.|$|E
40|$|The TaqMan Array Card architecture, {{normally}} used for gene expression studies, was evaluated for {{its potential to}} detect multiple bacterial agents by real-time PCR. Ten PCR assays targeting five biological agents (Bacillus anthracis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis) were incorporated onto Array Cards. A comparison of PCR performance of each PCR in Array Card and <b>singleplex</b> format was conducted using DNA extracted from pure bacterial cultures. When 100 fg of agent DNA was added to Array Card channels the following levels of agent detection (where at least one agent PCR replicate returned a positive result) were observed: Y. pestis 100 %, B. mallei & F. tularensis 93 %; B. anthracis 71 %; B. pseudomallei 43 %. For B. mallei & pseudomallei detection the BPM 2 PCR, which detects both species, outperformed PCR assays specific to each organism indicating identification of the respective species would not be reproducible at the 100 fg level. Near 100 % levels of detection were observed when 100 fg of DNA was added to each PCR in <b>singleplex</b> format with <b>singleplex</b> PCRs also returning sporadic positives at the 10 fg per PCR level. Before evaluating the use of Array Cards for the testing of environmental and clinical sample types, with potential levels of background DNA and PCR inhibitors, users would therefore have to accept a 10 -fold reduction in sensitivity of PCR assays on the Array Card format, in order to benefit for the capacity to test multiple samples for multiple agents. A two PCR per agent strategy would allow the testing of 7 samples {{for the presence of}} 11 biological agents or 3 samples for 23 biological agents per card (with negative control channels) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Human {{parvovirus}} B 19 (B 19 V), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) {{may cause}} intrauterine infections with potentially severe consequences to the fetus. Current serodiagnosis of these infections {{is based on}} detection of antibodies most often by EIA and individually for each pathogen. We developed <b>singleplex</b> and multiplex microsphere-based Suspension Immuno Assays (SIAs) for the simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies against B 19 V, CMV and T. gondii. Methods We tested the performances of SIAs as compared to in-house and commercial reference assays using serum samples from well-characterized cohorts. Results The IgG SIAs for CMV and T. gondii showed good concordance with the corresponding Vidas serodiagnostics. The B 19 V IgG SIA detected IgG in all samples collected > 10  days after onset of symptoms and showed high concordance with EIAs (in-house and Biotrin). The serodiagnostics for these three pathogens performed well in multiplex format. Conclusions We developed <b>singleplex</b> and multiplex IgG SIAs {{for the detection of}} anti-B 19 V,-CMV and -T. gondii antibodies. The SIAs were highly sensitive and specific, and had a wide dynamic range. These components thus should be suitable for construction of a multiplex test for antibody screening during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{available}} assays for {{the simultaneous}} detection of multiple inflammatory and cardiac markers in porcine blood samples are currently lacking. Therefore, {{this study was}} aimed at developing a bead-based, multiplexed flow cytometric assay to simultaneously detect porcine cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha], chemokines (IL- 8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1), growth factors [basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor-bb], and injury markers (cardiac troponin-I) as well as complement activation markers (C 5 a and sC 5 b- 9). The method {{was based on the}} Luminex xMAP technology, resulting in the assembly of a 6 - and 11 -plex from the respective individual <b>singleplex</b> situation. The assay was evaluated for dynamic range, sensitivity, cross-reactivity, intra-assay and interassay variance, spike recovery, and correlation between multiplex and commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as the respective <b>singleplex.</b> The limit of detection ranged from 2. 5 to 30, 000 pg/ml for all analytes (6 - and 11 -plex assays), except for soluble C 5 b- 9 with a detection range of 2 - 10, 000 ng/ml (11 -plex). Typically, very low cross-reactivity (< 3 % and < 1. 4 % by 11 - and 6 -plex, respectively) between analytes was found. Intra-assay variances ranged from 4. 9 to 7. 4 % (6 -plex) and 5. 3 to 12. 9 % (11 -plex). Interassay variances for cytokines were between 8. 1 and 28. 8 % (6 -plex) and 10. 1 and 26. 4 % (11 -plex). Correlation coefficients with <b>singleplex</b> assays for 6 -plex as well as for 11 -plex were high, ranging from 0. 988 to 0. 997 and 0. 913 to 0. 999, respectively. In this study, a bead-based porcine 11 -plex and 6 -plex assay with a good assay sensitivity, broad dynamic range, and low intra-assay variance and cross-reactivity was established. These assays therefore represent a new, useful tool for the analysis of samples generated from experiments with pigs...|$|E

The narrow {{genetic base}} of soybean makes {{cultivar}} characterization based on morphological descriptors difficult; this characterization is mainly done for registration and protection.

40|$|A new {{multiplex}} assay platform {{was evaluated}} to detect Trypanosoma cruzi infection using the recombinant antigens CRA, FRA, CRAFRA fusion and parasite lysate. The antigens presented different {{sensitivity and specificity}} in a <b>singleplex</b> test when compared to a serial dilution of two pools comprising 10 positive serum samples and one pool of 10 negative samples. The recombinant protein CRA presented lower sensitivity (55 %) {{in contrast to the}} 100 % specificity and sensitivity of FRA, CRAFRA and T. cruzi lysate. These antigens also showed good results in a duplex test and the duplex test with CRAFRA/T. cruzi lysate showed better performance with 100 % specificity and sensitivity, as well as a lower cut-off value in comparison to the other duplex test, FRA/T. cruzi lysate. Hence, when the antigens were used in duplex format, both tests showed decreased cut-off values and no interference between different bead sets, resulting in increasing sensitivity and specificity. The results of these multiplex tests show that they could be an alternative to <b>singleplex</b> detection for Chagas disease, and also indicate the necessity of using multiplex diagnostic tools to increase the sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic tests. Emerging data from the T. cruzi genome and from its ORFeome project will also allow the identification of new antigens for this disease detection application...|$|E
