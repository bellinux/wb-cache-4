500|$|It {{was said}} that they learned that those {{who had gone to}} treat with the King would have been fallen upon by armed men and slain... but that Nicholas Exton, the Mayor of London, having refused to countenance the evil, a deep and wicked plot was spread about and the scandal {{gradually}} uncovered.This event must, then, have occurred [...] "within days" [...] of Exton's election as Mayor. It was important, though, for the King to gain the backing of the City of London, and Exton, on his behalf, attempted to achieve this in October 1387 by requesting, unsuccessfully, that all the craft guilds would take an oath of loyalty to Richard. On the other hand, Knighton's Chronical suggests that although the King attempted to force the City to raise an army for royal use, Exton informed him that the inhabitants [...] "were in the main craftsmen and merchants, with no great military experience" [...] and that the only reason they could ever be raised in arms was to defend the city itself. Nevertheless, the King despatched a warrant for the arrest of the rebel lords, and it was the responsibility of Exton to execute it; however, <b>says</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Sumption, Exton [...] "quailed before such a task [...] resolved that the city had no business executing a warrant of this kind." [...] In December that year he authorised the opening of the city gates to the Lords Appellant (although only [...] "once their victory [...] had become certain"). Indeed, he may have actually greeted the lords outside the city gates and accompanied them back into London. Favent reports that the Duke of Gloucester, a leading Appellant, on hearing Exton's pledges of the city's loyalty, remarked [...] "Now I know in truth that liars tell nothing but lies, nor can anyone prevent them from being told." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{say that}} Ghostery, Inc. plays a dual {{role in the}} online {{advertising}} industry. Ghostery blocks sites from gathering personal information. But it does have an opt-in feature GhostRank that can be checked to [...] "support" [...] them. GhostRank takes note of ads encountered and blocked, and sends that information back to advertisers so they can better formulate their ads to avoid being blocked. Though Ghostery claims that the data are anonymized, patterns of web page visits cannot truly be anonymized. Thus not everyone sees Evidon's business model as conflict-free.

5000|$|The FDA, {{agreeing with}} the need to insure a vouchered and taxonomically {{validated}} reference is used, maintains the requirement that only validly authenticated standards be used to make regulatory decisions. In order to help the industry comply with labeling requirements, FDA has worked with the international research effort The Fish Barcode of Life campaign [...] "FISH-BOL" [...] to catalog the world's fish and make the sequences publicly available. The FDA states, [...] "Once completed, the FISH-BOL database will enable a fast, accurate, and cost-effective system for molecular identification of the world's icthyofauna." [...] But, as of today, because FISH-BOL [...] "is not currently searchable against only vouchered species with authoritative taxonomic identifications" [...] this database cannot currently be used for regulatory compliance testing because [...] "FDA will only make regulatory decisions based on identifications using adequately authenticated standards." [...] The BOL project a great research tool, but BOL is not designed to be a regulatory database. [...] "Anyone can put sequences in the BOL," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Deeds, FDA research biologist and project head. [...] "Most are good, but there are also a small number of guesses." [...] Thus, because Genbank and Fish Barcode of Life databases do not exclusively include only taxonomically validated references, they cannot be relied on for regulatory compliance testing in the US.|$|E

50|$|The MAD Institute at Yale University, {{will be a}} new {{educational}} {{institute for}} chefs.

The goal of the program is to equip chefs with the tools they need to take actions that can impact their communities, cities, countries {{and the rest of the}} world. The MAD Institute will lead conversations on topics like kitchen culture, sustainability, inclusiveness, and respect. The educational program will reflect the realities of a changing profession and a changing world, offering new ideas on how to overcome its obstacles as well as ways in which we can harness its potential.“Yale is excited to partner with MAD to inspire a new era of leadership in food,” <b>says</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Holloway, dean of Yale College. “Participants will leave the program armed with a compassionate understanding of the socio-economic, environmental, and health challenges facing food systems around the world, and inspired to bring lasting change.”The MAD Institute at Yale will begin with a pilot program in 2016: a group of six to eight top chefs and food leaders that will trial and build the curriculum in an intensive weeklong summit. In 2017 the program will be extended to two weeks and expand to host 15 to 18 participants chosen through an application process.|$|E
5000|$|Nicholas Rowe's {{edition of}} Shakespeare, in six volumes, was {{published}} early in 1709 by Tonson, {{who had previously}} advertised for materials. Richard Steele dined at Tonson's in 1708-1709, sometimes to get a bill discounted, sometimes to hear manuscripts read and advise upon them. There is a tradition that in earlier days Steele had had a daughter by a daughter of Tonson's; if this is true, it must apparently have been a daughter of Richard Tonson, Jacob's brother. In the autumn of 1710 Tonson moved to the Shakespeare's Head, opposite Catherine Street in the Strand; his former shop at Gray's Inn Gate was announced {{for sale in the}} Tatler for 14 October (No. 237); and it seems to have been taken by Thomas Osborne, stationer, the father of the afterwards well-known publisher, Thomas Osborne (died 1767). On 26 July 1711, after a long interval, Swift met Addison and Steele [...] "at young Jacob Tonson's". [...] "The two Jacobs", <b>says</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Swift to Esther Johnson, [...] "think it I who have made the secretary take from them the printing of the Gazette, which they are going to lose.... Jacob came to me t'other day to make his court; but I told him it was too late, and that it was not my doing." [...] Accounts furnished to Steele by Tonson of the sale of the collective editions of the Tatler and Spectator have been preserved; from October 1712 Tonson's name was joined with Samuel Buckley's as publisher of the Spectator. In November 1712 Addison and Steele sold all their right and title in one half of the copies of the first seven volumes of the Spectator to Tonson the younger, for £575, and all rights in the other half for a similar sum to Buckley. Buckley in October 1714 reassigned his half-share in the Spectator to Tonson junior for £500.|$|E
5000|$|The Degenerate Art Exhibition {{included}} {{works by}} some of the great international names—Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Wassily Kandinsky—along with famous German artists of the time such Max Beckmann, Emil Nolde, and Georg Grosz. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to [...] "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included [...] "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Petropoulos, professor of European History at Claremont McKenna College and {{author of several books on}} art and politics in the Third Reich. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician—but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favor of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying [...] "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and Bolsheviks, although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category—art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticized German soldiers, art that offended the honor of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled [...] "the insanity room". The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticize the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors—three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition.|$|E
