5|$|Until this point, all {{the printed}} {{material}} (mostly just charts {{of the alphabet}} and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E

5|$|A smaller player {{than his}} peers – St. Louis was listed at five feet nine inches tall in college – he often {{struggled}} to gain recognition for his ability. He was {{passed over for}} a provincial team at a midget age tournament despite leading his league in scoring, while major junior teams showed little interest in him. He was heavily recruited by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools to play for their programs, however. He played one season of junior A hockey with the Hawkesbury Hawks of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL) in 1992–93 where he scored 37 goals and 87 points in just 31 games. The University of Vermont Catamounts convinced <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> join their hockey program.

5|$|Hinde's first {{employment}} in river transportation {{was as a}} clerk on a boat that operated between St. Louis, Missouri, and St. Paul, Minnesota. After about a year, he joined the Galena, Dubuque and St. Paul Packet Company, which {{became one of the}} largest transportation companies {{in that part of the}} country. At one point during his employment there, he contracted cholera and almost died. Hinde made rapid advancement and was promoted to the position of captain in his mid-twenties, an unusually young age. In 1862, he went to Louisville, Kentucky, to take command of a steamer running from there to Memphis, Tennessee He returned to St. Louis in 1864 to serve as captain of the steamer Davenport, which ran from <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> St. Paul, before resigning that position to organize a branch of the Halliday Brothers Corporation in Cairo, Illinois, which was engaged in the river transportation and shipping businesses. He subsequently established his own business and became the shipping agent at the Cairo wharf for all the steamboat lines passing through Cairo, on both the Ohio River and Mississippi River and their tributaries. Hinde sold his interests in the business shortly after its creation and moved his family to Evansville, Indiana, where he became acquainted with E. S. Babcock and the Reid Brothers.|$|E

5|$|On January25, 1891, it was {{reported}} that he had re-signed with the Browns for the up-coming season. The season opened April8, and the Browns faced the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers at home. Stivetts was the team's opening day starting pitcher. The game ended in the bottom of ninth inning when the umpire, former player and St. Louis native Bill Gleason, determined that Cincinnati was intentionally allowing <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> score in an effort to delay the game. St. Louis was awarded the forfeit when Cincinnati refused to play. AA president, Louis Kramer, declared the forfeit illegal a short time later, and the game was re-played on April12. St. Louis won the re-match behind the pitching of Stivetts. This was Gleason's second and last career game as an umpire. Over the course of the season, Stivetts was the Browns' ace, pitching mostly every second or third game the team played. When not pitching, or when he occasionally played in right field, the Browns used Joe Neale, Willie McGill, and future Hall of Fame executive Clark Griffith as part of the starting rotation. On May30, Stivetts started both games of a doubleheader in a home series versus the Philadelphia Athletics. Due to large leads by the Browns, he was pulled from each game; lasting two innings in the first and six in the second.|$|E
5|$|The Bears visited Edward Jones Dome in <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> {{play the}} Rams, again without Jay Cutler. However, the Rams were also without {{starting}} quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive {{games against the}} Rams. Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded an average of 107.7 {{yards and three touchdowns}} in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; and receiver Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 drives in the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Rams had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, the Rams led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. The Rams also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall.|$|E
