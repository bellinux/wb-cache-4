No precise <b>solubility</b> <b>determinations</b> on l-proline and/-hydroxyproline appear to have been carried out previously. Due to the high solubility of l-proline and l-hydroxyproline, it was not feasible to carry out <b>solubility</b> <b>determinations</b> over as great a temperature range as in the previously reported studies. There is a tendency for these amino acids, especially hydroxyproline, to darken at higher temperatures. It was necessary to modify somewhat the previously reported technique for the determination of solubility and partial molal volumes. A micro pipette of about 100 c. mm. capacity was used. It possessed a uniform capillary stem whose diameter was about 0. 3 ram.; 1 ram. of the capillary corresponded to about 0. 07 c. mm. The volume of the pipette was calibrated with the aid of mercury. The amount of amino acid solution which was contained in the pipette was estimated by measuring the distance on the stem which was not filled with the solution. For the estimation of density, the pipette was filled to a certain point on the stem and the tip of the pipette was wiped with wet cotton.

These complexes basically consist of (NS) -chelate and amineplatinum complexes. Bidentate (NS) -donor ligands were used as non-leaving ligands in the syntheses of platinum(II) complexes with iodide, chloride, bromide and oxalate anions as leaving groups. These complexes were synthesized and studied since many questions regarding the interaction of sulfur donors and platinum still exists. These relate to thermodynamic and kinetic factors and their influence on anticancer action. In this dissertation the properties of novel platinum(II) complexes of a bidentate ligand having an aromatic nitrogen-donor atom in combination with a thioethereal sulfur atom capable of forming a five membered ring with platinum(II) were studied. The general structure of the (NS) -ligands used were N-alkyl- 2 -methylthioalkyl imidazole. Alkyl groups used were methyl, ethyl and propyl.

The method is based on the heat absorbed or released by dissolution of the solid in a solvent. The thermal effect observed is described with a model resulting from mass and enthalpy balances as already shown [1].

Fractionation and <b>solubility</b> <b>determinations</b> show that these preparations are not mixtures or solid solutions of the original pepsin with an inactive derivative. A compound which contains three or four acetyl groups and which has lost all of its original primary amino groups can be isolated after short acetylation. It has the same activity as the original pepsin. A second derivative containing six to eleven acetyl groups has also been isolated. It has about 60 per cent of the activity of the original pepsin. A third derivative having twenty to thirty acetyl groups and about 10 per cent of the activity of original pepsin can be isolated after prolonged acetylation. The 60 per cent active derivative on standing in strong acid solution loses some of its acetyl groups and at the same time regains the activity of the original pepsin. The compound obtained in this way is probably the same as the completely active three acetyl derivative obtained by mild acetylation. These results show that acetylation of three or four of the primary amino groups of pepsin causes no change in the specific activity of the enzyme but that the introduction of acetyl groups in other parts of the molecule results in a marked loss in activity. The solubilities, amino nitrogen content, acetyl content, isoelectric point, and the specific activity have been determined by a variety of methods and found to be different from the corresponding properties of crystalline pepsin.

In all cases but the manganese sulfates both the familiar tetragonal and orthorhombic forms were obtained, with unit cell dimensions close to those known for the "classic" sodium chloride crystallized forms. Manganese sulfate has only yielded orthorhombic crystals to date. All crystallizations were carried out using low (typically {{less than or equal}} to 6 M) salt and high (greater than approximately 90 mg/ml) protein concentrations. As with ammonium sulfate, the tetragonal - orthorhombic phase shift appears to be a function of both the temperature and the protein concentration, with higher temperatures and concentrations favoring the orthorhombic and lower the tetragonal form. The phase change range is somewhat reduced for the sulfate salts, depending upon conditions being typically between approximately 15 - 20 C. Both the magnesium and manganese sulfates gave crystals at salt concentrations over 0. 6 M as well, with magnesium sulfate giving a very slowly nucleating and growing hexagonal form. A triclinic crystal form, characterized by aggressively small crystals (typically 0. 1 mm in size) has been occasionally obtained from ammonium sulfate. Finally, preliminary spot <b>solubility</b> <b>determinations</b> have suggested that in some cases the solubility increases with increasing salt concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Solubility {{is one of}} the {{important}} parameters in designing a suitable dosage form for peptide drugs. The effects of solution environment on the solubility of short chain peptides are not clearly understood. The objective of this research is to develop a mathematical equation for solubility and activity coefficient prediction of a series of model peptides by using a combination of computational chemistry and a series of <b>solubility</b> <b>determinations.</b> ^ Molecular mechanic calculations were used to calculate minimized force field energy of glycine peptides with two to six amino acid residues. The results from the molecular surface area, the dipole moment and the radius of gyration calculations indicate that the minimized energy conformation of the peptides is folded. ^ The solubility and activity coefficient determinations reveal that when different salts are used to adjust the ionic strength, the solubility and activity coefficient of glycine peptides change. The results indicate that sodium chloride and potassium chloride have a similar effect on the activity coefficient of diglycine and tetraglycine. However they have a different effect on triglycine, pentaglycine and hexaglycine. In addition, instead of using the net charge of zero as the charge of the zwitterionic species of the peptide in the solution for the ionic strength and activity coefficient calculations, the charge assignment of two gives the best fit between the experimental data and the theoretical calculation for non-ideal solutions. ^ The commonly used equations to calculate activity coefficients of electrolytes, such as the Debye-Huckel limiting equation, the extended Debye-Huckel equation, and the Davies, Bromley or Kirkwood equations, fail to predict the activity coefficient of glycine peptides. A new mathematical model was successfully developed using the molecular characteristics from the computational chemistry calculations and the principles of modern electrochemistry. The results of this investigation provide a basis for further research for the development of activity coefficient predictions of other peptides. * ftn*Originally published in DAI Vol. 58, No. 2.

40|$|Aqueous {{solubility}} is {{an essential}} characteristic assessed during drug development to determine a compound’s drug-likeness since solubility plays an important pharmaceutical role. However, {{nearly half of the}} drug candidates discovered today display poor water solubility; therefore methods have to be applied to increase <b>solubility.</b> <b>Solubility</b> <b>determination</b> using the CheqSol method is a novel rapid solubility screening technique for ionisable compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine if the CheqSol method can be employed to determine solubility increases of four test drugs (ibuprofen, gliclazide, atenolol and propranolol) induced by non-ionising excipients such as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and poloxamers 407 and 188. CheqSol assays were performed for the drugs alone or in combination with varying solubiliser concentrations. The measured intrinsic solubility of all four drugs increased with all the excipients tested in an excipient concentration dependent manner providing results consistent with previous literature. The results demonstrate that it may be possible to use this method to determine the solubility increases induced by non-ionic solubilising excipients with results that are comparable to standard equilibrium based solubility techniques. Since the technique is automated and requires only small drug quantities it may serve as a useful solubility or formulation screening tool providing more detailed physicochemical information than multiwell plate or similar visual systems...|$|R
40|$|Uniform {{dispersion}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{has been one}} of the major impediments to the full development of the incredible suite of properties offered by CNTs, specifically single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). However, investigators at NASA Langley and the National Institute of Aerospace Research have recently obtained (SWNTs) that are soluble in select solvents, including THF, DM Ac, and ODCB. The SWNTs were exposed to reagents used in cited fullerene modification chemistry in an attempt to produce soluble SWNTs. Upon further examination, it was determined that the intended functionalization had not occurred, and some other phenomenon was responsible for the SWNTs <b>solubility.</b> <b>Determination</b> of what was imparting solubility to the SWNTs was the goal of this project. The two evolved gas analysis (EGA) techniques used during this project were thermogravi me try-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Samples were heated while the gasses evolved were monitored to determine their identities. The soluble SWNTs were less stable than the non-soluble SWNTS. In addition, they also had much more complicated degradation schemes as evidenced by the additional mass loss events seen in the TG-MS data. Based on the data, some form of methoxide or methanol is imparting solubility to the SWNTs...|$|R
40|$|The barrier {{properties}} of one treated paper packaging and one standard plastic film (bi-oriented polypropylene, biOPP) were assessed for ethyl hexanoate. Three methods based either on sorption (gravimetry and micro-atmosphere-derived method) or permeation kinetic determination {{were used in}} controlled conditions of aroma vapor concentration (107 Pa), temperature (25 degrees C) and relative humidity (about 0 %). Ethyl hexanoate solubility values {{were on the same}} range of magnitude for both packaging films in spite of their different nature and composition. Ethyl hexanoate affinity for both films was well predicted by their respective solubility parameters. Solubility values were different according to the experimental method used. The micro-atmosphere-derived method and the permeation method both presented experimental limitations for the <b>solubility</b> <b>determination.</b> Ethyl hexanoate diffusivity values were significantly different between the three methods used. Particularly, the values were 10 -folds higher by the permeation method than by the sorption methods for the treated paper. Whatever the method, ethyl hexanoate diffusivity was always higher through the treated paper than through the biOPP. Ethyl hexanoate permeability was controlled by diffusivity for both films and probably linked to the evolution of the film structure during transfer. Permeability could thus not be calculated from the product of diffusivity and solubility coefficient...|$|R
