The distribution of maize roots was cone shaped and gradually extended from 20 cm to 40 cm below the surface during the elongation stage. Under the different mulch tillage models, the effects on maize root growth were positive. The mulching measures significantly affected the control and support of the early and later stages of maize growth. The maize significantly differed in the root weight density (P= 0. 026 < 0. 05) and the root surface area (P = 0. 005 < 0. 01) with different mulching measures. No-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow was the only mulching model in which the growth of the roots and leaves of maize was limited.

In the spring, half of the 30 -in plots were in-row subsoiled and half of the 7. 5 -in plots were paratilled, and these were compared to no spring deep tillage. Soybeans were planted in early June in 1994 and 1995.

These soils have historically been managed under conventional tillage practices, but conservation tillage management practices are increasing. Although clay (< 2 �m) contents are low in these surface horizons (typically < 100 g kg− 1), the reactive nature of this fraction tends to play a dominant role in colloidal facilitated pollutant transport. Studies have suggested that enrichment of certain minerals occurs in transported sediments, thus, we evaluated sediment size and the mineralogical partitioning of clay minerals of soil versus runoff sediment under simulated rainfall. In addition, because water dispersible clay (WDC) {{has been shown to}} be correlated with soil erodibility, we evaluated WDC differences as a function of tillage practices. Plots were established at a site in the upper coastal plain of central Alabama, where soils classified as coarse-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudults and Typic Hapludults (FAO-Acrisols). <b>Surface</b> <b>tillage</b> treatments were established in 1988, and included conventional tillage (CT) versus no <b>surface</b> <b>tillage</b> (NT) treatments, with crop residue remaining or removed, and with or without paratilling (non-inversion subsoiling).

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the differences in soil bulk density and cone index resulting from the interactions of <b>surface</b> <b>tillage,</b> subsoiling, and controlled traffic in a long-term corn-soybean cropping system experiment in a Coastal Plain soil in the southeastern U. S. Traffic or no-traffic treatments were accomplished using an experimental wide-frame tractive vehicle (WFTV), which enabled operations without traffic on 6. 1 m wide growing zones. Subsoiling treatments included no subsoiling, annual in-row subsoiling, and initial one-time subsoiling on 25 cm centers to completely disrupt the soil to the 40 cm depth. <b>Surface</b> <b>tillage</b> treatments were no-tillage or disking and field cultivation.

Four significant conclusions from this study can be drawn: (1) vehicle traffic increased soil bulk density nearest the surface in all row positions, with the greatest increases occurring directly in the trafficked row position where equipment traffic was applied; (2) no-tillage caused significantly increased bulk density values near the soil surface in all three row positions; (3) annual in-row subsoiling effectively relieved soil compaction, while the initial complete disruption subsoiling treatment had similar bulk density and cone index values as the no-subsoiling treatment; and (4) in-row subsoiling also loosened th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{intensive}} transformation {{to which the}} sugar beet market in the European Union has been subject {{in recent years in}} order to meet the external obligations set by the WTO Panel, has had a severe impact on sugar beet production in Poland. Two major observations have been reported, namely a significant decrease of number of sugar beet farms and a reduction in those areas of <b>tillage</b> <b>surfaces</b> intended for sugar beet cultivation. It is worth mentioning that sugar beet is highly important to crop rotation and hardly any other plant in European agriculture can replace it. There is therefore both a strong need and a great opportunity for the further support and development of sugar beet production. As the interna-tional obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emission became effective, interest in biomass us-age as a viable alternative to fossil fuels increased. This study thus set out to perform an eco-nomic comparison in respect of the use of sugar beets for traditional purposes and for energy, and to conduct an economic analysis of the income obtained from the sale of electrical energy sale by a biogas facility where sugar beets were used for biogas production. The comparative analysis was carried out taking both incomes from sugar beet production for sugar and root and leaf production for biogas into consideration. The results are very promising and allow the postulation that the use of sugar beet for biogas production provides an excellent opportu-nity for reviving defunct sugar plants and increasing the <b>tillage</b> <b>surface</b> for sugar beet in Poland.

Neutral detergent fibre concentration was significantly higher with ST than with MT, and this led to a small reduction (2 g kg− 1 dry matter (DM)) in in vitro true DM digestibility (IVTDMD). N fertilisation significantly increased grain and protein yields as well as CP, non-protein nitrogen and TSP contents and CPD. IVTDMD was significantly lower with 0 kg N ha− 1 than with 50 and 100 kg Nha− 1. CONCLUSION: Reducing tillage intensity improved the CP content and CPD of triticale grain. The application of 50 kg N ha− 1 resulted in good grain quality parameters and grain and protein yields...|$|E
40|$|No-tillage (NT) is an {{alternative}} way of reducing costs and lessening the burden of working the land, but in essence it is a method of sustainable land use in dryland cropping systems. The physical quality of the soil is the fundamental factor that defines the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, and its evaluation can be obtained using both capacitive and dynamic indicators. The main objectives of this study were: i) to assess the physical quality of the soil in an almond orchard where long-term different soil tillage systems and weed control methods, such as NT with chemical control and <b>surface</b> <b>tillage</b> (ST), were used; and ii) to compare the indicators under consideration with the proposed reference values, using the information gathered to evaluate the effects of NT and ST. The following physical properties were determined: bulk density, air capacity, macroporosity, plant available water capacity, relative field capacity, Dexter’s index, field saturated hydraulic conductivity, {{as well as the}} location (modal, median, and mean pore diameter) and shape (standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) parameters which corresponded to the equivalent pore size distribution functions. Our results showed that the physical soil indicators adopted were sufficiently sensitive to identify tillage-induced changes and then to quantify the physical quality of rigid to moderately expansive agricultural soils. After thirty years of NT, a set of capacitive indicators, along with measurements of hydraulic conductivity, used in conjunction with an optimal pore volume distribution and the water release curve, unanimously classified the quality of the studied soil as optimal or near optimal...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the so-called conventional farming system calls for new farming practices reducing negative externalities. Emerging farming practices such as no-till and new inter-cropping management are promising tracks. The development of methods to characterize crop management across an entire region and to understand their spatial dimension offers opportunities to accompany the transition towards a more sustainable agriculture. This research {{takes advantage of the}} unmatched polarimetric and temporal resolutions of Sentinel- 1 SAR Cband to develop a method to identify farming practices at the parcel level. To this end, the detection of changes in backscattering due to <b>surface</b> roughness modification (<b>tillage,</b> inter-crop cover destruction [...] .) is used to detect the farming management. The final results are compared to a reference dataset collected through an intensive field campaign. Finally, the performances are discussed in the perspective of practices monitoring of cropping systems through remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|Tillage affects soil {{physical}} properties, e. g., porosity, {{and leads}} to different amounts of mulch on the soil <b>surface.</b> Consequently, <b>tillage</b> {{is related to the}} soil temperature and moisture regime. Soil cover, temperature and moisture were measured under corn (Zea mays) in the tenth year of five tillage systems (NT = no-tillage; CP = chisel plow and single secondary disking; CT = primary and double secondary disking; CTb = CT with crop residues burned; and CTr = CT with crop residues removed). The tillage systems were combined with five nutrient sources (C = control; MF = mineral fertilizer; PL = poultry litter; CS = cattle slurry; and SS = swine slurry). Soil cover after sowing was greatest in NT (88 %), medium in CP (38 %) and lowest in CT treatments (< 10 %), but differences decreased after corn emergence. Soil temperature was related with soil cover, and significant differences among tillage were observed {{at the beginning of the}} growing season and at corn maturity. Differences in soil temperature and moisture in the surface layer of the tilled treatments were greater during the corn cycle than in untilled treatments, due to differences in intensity of soil mobilization and mulch remaining after soil management. Nutrient sources affected soil temperature and moisture in the most intense part of the corn growth period, and were related to the variation of the corn leaf area index among treatment...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} no-till {{study was}} initiated in 1968 at the Lethbridge Research Centre. The study was initiated at the infancy of no-till management {{to better understand}} the long-term implications and the management problems that could arise with no-till. The crop rotations in this study included fallow-wheat or fallow-wheat-wheat/flax. Three tillage systems were selected for the study: (1) wide blade (cultivator) that leaves most of the crop residues on the <b>surface</b> after <b>tillage,</b> (2) heavy duty cultivator that buries more crop residues than the blade cultivator, and (3) no-till (chemical control of weeds during the fallow and crop year). The study provided industry with some early indications of the importance of crop residue management for no-till systems, and some specifications required for seeding equipment to ensure good seed placement. The study also showed that the soils would not become compacted over time, a concern of many early sceptics of no-till. Over the forty year period of the study, it was determined that no-till yields in a fallow-wheat rotation were lower than with tillage, but if a hoe opener was used at seeding the yield difference was less. In the three-year fallow-wheat-wheat/flax rotation, the no-till wheat yield after fallow was as high as with tillage, and the hoe opener resulted in higher total yield than a disc opener. There was no yield penalty for no-till in the past 10 years, an indication that no-till management of these systems has improved and changes to soil properties with no-till have been positive...|$|R
