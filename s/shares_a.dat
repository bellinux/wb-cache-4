40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyThis research provides empirical evidence on the readiness of the banking industry of Srilanka towards <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks. Drawing from a contingency theory, the research posits that the credibility of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network depends on the IT, marketing departments planning and operational department's operational procedures of respective banks. Study also reveals that the credibility of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network and its formulation process, in turn. determine {{the effectiveness of the}} implementation of the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network in achieving the desired performance. The causal relationships amongst these variables were then analyzed by structural equation model using LISREL 8. 80 program. ///The primary data for this study were collected through structured interviews with the mangers or higher positions of all 31 operating Srilankan banks. Study confirms the belief of the importance of an innovative culture in implementing strategic marketing planning and IT requirements of the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network. The study also identifies that all IT, marketing and operational departments play equally important roles in planning and implementing the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks between two banks. Top management support will also be a significant factor in moving to <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM networks as they are the decision makers. These findings not only support the view that it is inappropriate to separate <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM planning from its implementation aspects, but also corroborate the importance of the fit between shared ATM network and the factors supports the <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network operation. Finally, study reveals that, though resources and other factors are available within the Srilankan banks to <b>share</b> their <b>A</b> TM networks, lack of visionary leadership within the industry or within the country has delayed the emergence of <b>shared</b> <b>A</b> TM network...|$|R

5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum <b>shares</b> <b>a</b> common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus <b>shares</b> <b>a</b> close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
