2500|$|Post-war, {{women were}} {{returned}} {{to many of the}} mundane jobs they occupied before the war started. Where once the army represented an escape from domestic life and liberty, it now returned to the male-dominated field it was before the war. Women who served in the batteries as gunners and searchlight-operators became <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks.</b> [...] "Demob (demobilisation) was a big disappointment to a lot of us. It was an awful and wonderful war. I wouldn't have missed it for anything; some of the friends we made were forever” one female recounted after being dismissed from service to return to her normal job. Married women were released from service sooner {{at the end of the}} war, so they could return home before their husbands to ensure the home was ready when he returned from the front. Despite being largely unrecognised for their wartime efforts in the forces, the participation of women in World War II allowed for the founding of permanent women’s forces. Britain instituted these permanent forces in 1949, and the Women’s Voluntary Services are still a standing reserve force today.|$|E

60|$|The task we set {{ourselves}} was threefold. First, the weeding {{out from}} our circles {{of the secret}} agents of the Oligarchy. Second, the organizing of the Fighting Groups, and outside of them, of the general secret organization of the Revolution. And third, the introduction of our own secret agents into every branch of the Oligarchy--into the labor castes and especially among the telegraphers and <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks,</b> into the army, the agents-provocateurs, and the slave-drivers. It was slow work, and perilous, and often were our efforts rewarded with costly failures.|$|E

60|$|Then the Paragon {{was shown}} {{into the room}} and Mounser Green and the young men were delighted to see him. Colonial {{governors}} at their seats of government, and Ministers Plenipotentiary in their ambassadorial residences are very great persons indeed; and when met in society at home, with the stars and ribbons which are common among them now, they are less indeed, but still something. But at the colonial and foreign offices in London, among the assistant <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks,</b> they are hardly more than common men. All the gingerbread is gone there. His Excellency is no more than Jones, and the Representative or Alter Ego of Royalty mildly asks little favours of the junior clerks.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the plan}} was to build houses on the entire estate, {{creating}} a new housing estate, but due to slow sales and the need for drainage from the higher ground the land to the east of the new central road was instead acquired by the Lady Workers' Homes Limited to build blocks of rooms for single women moving to London in order to work as <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks</b> in the city on the Eastern side of the estate. The local Alderman and others involved in the project are commemorated in an inscription on the ornamental pond in the central garden area.|$|E

50|$|After the German Empire {{was founded}} in 1871, Wilhelmstraße found itself at the {{political}} center of a European superpower. As the government transitioned, existing Prussian offices, committees and authorities were transfigured and new ones were established, creating a sudden need for representative office buildings. The construction of living and office space for <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks</b> {{also contributed to the}} building boom on Wilhelmplatz. As a result, the surroundings took on a mundane, business-like air that left no room for local shops or restaurants. Wilhelmplatz would remain this way for some time, remaining one of the few central places in Berlin with no cafés well into the time of the national socialist regime.|$|E
50|$|Beneath the councilors {{were the}} secretaries, clerks, and {{accountants}} {{who ran the}} bureaucracy of the Duchy and adhered to a strict discipline and worked long hours. These men held no political power of their own, but often, this was the starting place for burghers looking to climb the ladder. <b>Secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks</b> (Schreiber) copied and filed important documents for the various branches of the government. The growth of the central government's bureaucracy also meant the number of clerks growing from 25 in 1520 to over 80 {{by the end of}} the century. Accountants too grew in number, as the amount of bookkeepers (Buchhalter), charged with maintaining a general ledger to recording and writing summaries of votes cast in privy council meetings, would be expanded greatly to fill the needs of the government. Other low-level positions included the keeper of the treasury (Gewöhlbeverwater), who curated the goods of the treasury vault such as government archives, and the message supervisor (Botenmeister), who managed the couriers of the Duchy.|$|E

40|$|From its {{beginnings}} in 1923, the BBC employed a sizeable female workforce. The majority were in support roles as typists, <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks</b> but, during the 1920 s and 1930 s, {{a significant number}} held important posts. As a modern industry, the BBC took a largely progressive approach towards the ‘career women’ on its staff, {{many of whom were}} in jobs that were developed specifically for the new medium of broadcasting. Women worked as drama producers, advertising representatives and Children’s Hour Organisers. They were talent spotters, press officers and documentary makers. Three women attained Director status while others held significant administrative positions. This article considers in what ways it was the modernity and novelty of broadcasting, combined with changing employment possibilities and attitudes towards women evident after the First World War, that combined to create the conditions in which they could excel...|$|E
40|$|I {{started work}} August 1 1953 {{as one of}} two law clerks for Justice Hugo L. Black of Alabama. The other clerk was David J. Vann, also from Alabama and now {{unfortunately}} deceased. I was from New York City, and I was startled to find that Washington, D. C. was a racially segregated city. I was even more {{surprised to see that}} the Supreme Court itself was 100 % segregated. All of the <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks</b> were white, all of the messengers were black and so forth. David and I soon learned that the Court was in disarray, unable to decide Brown v. Board of Education, and suffering also from internal rifts caused by Justice Jackson’s unseemly public criticism of Justices Black and Douglas, and by the Court’s hasty special session to authorize the execution of the Rosenbergs. The latter left Justice Black outraged at what he believed was an egregiously illegal and improper action by the Court. In fact, Justice Black regularly had lunch with us in the Court’s public cafeteria rather than going to the Justices’ private dining room to have lunch with “them. ...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{changes are}} {{transforming}} work through automation, globalisation, and more flexible work. Overview Work {{has long been}} important for the livelihood, dignity, and happiness of humankind. We intuitively and statistically know that work helps us meet our most basic and complex needs, providing a path towards financial security, mental and physical health, dignity and meaning. For at least the past century, {{the prospect of a}} good job that pays a fair wage has been part of Australia’s promise to our young people. By many measures, Australia has continued to deliver on its promise. We have enjoyed relatively strong economic growth, high wages and low levels of unemployment. But beneath the seemingly benign surface of Australia’s labour market, there is a quiet revolution occurring in the way we work. The old ‘blue collar’ part of workforce is barely recognisable today. As the factories in our urban manufacturing suburbs have been closed down or automated, the manual jobs they once provided have been decimated. Over the past 25 years, we have lost around 100, 000 machinery operator jobs, nearly 400, 000 labourers, and nearly 250, 000 jobs from the technicians and trades. Offsetting these losses, there has been an explosion of more than 400, 000 new jobs in community and personal services. The work revolution is no less visible in what we used to call ‘white collar’ jobs. Computers have swept through corporate towers and small business offices, displacing nearly 500, 000 <b>secretaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerks.</b> At the same time, the increasing complexity of business processes and financial markets has created 700, 000 new jobs across the professional and business services. While our unemployment rate may be low, our factory floor workers have not seamlessly switched their hard hats for a healthcare job. Instead, unskilled workers, especially men, have stepped out of the labour force on mass. Over the past 25 years, nearly one in ten unskilled men lost their jobs and did not return to the labour force. Today, more than one in four unskilled men don’t participate. Big economic shifts are not costless for everyone...|$|E
5000|$|Philip Dottin Souper became Colonial Secretary of Trinidad under Ralph James Woodford, Governor from 1813. Woodford used {{very young}} {{officials}} for administrative work, and kept {{them on a}} short leash. It was noted that an attempt to bribe Souper was rejected. An 1834 report on the drive to reduce sinecures shows Souper taking on the dual roles of <b>Secretary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Council. There were in fact three defined official roles, <b>Secretary,</b> <b>Clerk</b> <b>and</b> Register (or court intendant, often called escribando, a term inherited from the Spanish colonial time in Trinidad). In 1810, James Chapman, who held officially the three posts, had been listed as a sinecure holder using deputies for the functions.|$|R
