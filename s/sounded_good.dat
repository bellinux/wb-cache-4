5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all <b>sounded</b> <b>good,</b> but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

Jeremy Dunham of IGN, Manny LaMancha of GamePro and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy felt it difficult to fight one-on-one when a player can start a cat-and-mouse game, while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin and Brian Gee of Game Revolution found the features to cause [...] "chaos". Turner said it deprived the player of the ability [...] "to have a normal Guilty Gear X2-style match", and Dunham said the computer reacted faster. David Smith of 1UP.com called it an [...] "irrational control scheme".

500|$|The {{title track}} is noted {{as having an}} autobiographical aspect, as the {{character}} of Larry (as performed by Zappa himself) sings that the band plays the same song repeatedly because [...] "it <b>sounded</b> <b>good</b> to me". In real life, Zappa said he wrote and played music for himself, his sole intended audience. The song also takes lyrical inspiration from bands playing in bars like The Mothers of Invention once had, and shady record deals Zappa had experienced in the past. In [...] "Joe's Garage", Joe finds that the music industry is [...] "not everything it is cracked up to be". The song refers {{to a number of}} music fads, including new wave, heavy metal, disco and glitter rock, and is critical of the music industry of the late 1970s.|$|E
500|$|... "Burn Black" [...] and [...] "Dicknail" [...] also feature {{aggressive}} {{language and}} themes alluding to child molestation and incest. [...] "Beautiful Son", written and recorded in 1992, features a more mellow guitar riff, and its lyrics make references to crossdressing. Love said the songwriting process {{on the track}} {{was an attempt to}} [...] "be a little dumber. I was always trying to write a very complex song without ever having learned to write an easy Beatles song," [...] noted in a 1994 interview. [...] "It just had a riff. It wasn't super smart but it <b>sounded</b> <b>good</b> and that's when I started learning things don't have to have lots and lots of notes. That the best songs are carried by simple lines and simple melodies." [...] This illustrates the band's turning point from their noise rock beginnings to more mellow, accessible sounds.|$|E

In a scene in the episode, Astrid introduces the audience in an art club to Homer's art.

Because none of the recorded takes <b>sounded</b> <b>good,</b> the line was ultimately scrapped from the episode.|$|E

500|$|Noel Gallagher {{began working}} on [...] "Live Forever" [...] in 1991, while working for a {{building}} company {{in his hometown of}} Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he was listening to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it <b>sounded</b> <b>good</b> against one of the vocal melodies from the album: [...] "It was the bit from [...] "Shine a Light" [...] that goes , [...] "May the good Lord shine a light on you"", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to [...] "Maybe I don't really want to know". For a period afterwards, that was {{the only part of the}} song Gallagher had completed.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{reviewer}} Greg Pratt of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles {{was more}} sympathetic towards the album. Pratt, after briefly critiquing {{the lack of}} a thrashy sound, positively compared the record to Youthanasia (1994) and Countdown to Extinction (1992). Additionally, he commented that {{even in the absence of}} longtime members Nick Menza and Marty Friedman, that the band still <b>sounded</b> <b>good.</b> Pratt reacted positively to a number of the album's songs, but cited [...] "Recipe for Hate... Warhorse" [...] as being the album's [...] "most intense moment". Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic had mixed feelings about the music on the record. While Stagno noted that the album was advertised as a return towards the band's roots, he explained that those who were hoping for an album in the style of the band's first four records would be disappointed. Stagno ultimately defined the album as [...] "more of an all-out metal record".|$|E
500|$|Although he had {{intended}} to finish the version of [...] "Dark Horse" [...] taped at Friar Park with Voormann and Starr, Harrison decided to re-record the song with the tour band, live, on the sound stage at A Studios. The session took place on either 30 or 31 October, with Norm Kinney as engineer. Leng writes of this performance of [...] "Dark Horse": [...] "Anyone wondering what Harrison's voice sounded like on the Dark Horse Tour need look no further: this track was cut only days before the first date in Vancouver. Although the band <b>sounded</b> <b>good,</b> his voice was in shreds..." [...] Later, Harrison would admit he was [...] "knackered" [...] {{by the time he}} arrived in Los Angeles, having simply taken on too much over the previous year. He also claimed that his business manager, Denis O'Brien, had to force him out of the studio, to ensure he caught the plane for the opening show of the tour, on 2 November.|$|E

500|$|Melinda Newman of HitFix {{questioned}} if Carey {{could have}} achieve {{success with the}} song, describing it as [...] "breathless" [...] and too reliant on the singer's [...] "vocal pyrotechnics". She continued to write that the song would most probably not achieve any success on the Billboard Hot 100, but would find [...] "some love" [...] on the adult contemporary and R radio stations. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse compared {{the production of the}} song to Carey's previous singles [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1995) and [...] "Touch My Body" [...] (2008). He also wrote that the [...] "drawn-out whistle" [...] {{at the end of the}} song was [...] "impressive". Carolyn Menyes for Music Times felt that Songz overshadowed Carey with his vocals on the urban remix. Slant Magazine writer Alexa Camp thought that while Carey's voice <b>sounded</b> <b>good,</b> Darkchild's production was [...] "utterly trivial". She concluded by expressing that the remix featuring Songz was [...] "slightly more interesting".|$|E
500|$|Of seven {{children}} born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account [...] "the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they <b>sounded</b> <b>good</b> to him... When he {{was five years old}} he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down". A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable piano concerto, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.|$|E
500|$|They had {{problems}} during sequencing {{and had to}} repair the songs, taking some time. Pettibone had to keep things moving {{as fast as possible}} as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. At this point, as far as the music went, it was getting a little melancholy. However, as Pettibone explained, Madonna's stories directed the creative direction of the songs into deeply personal territory as they were more serious and intense. Madonna left the album's production to work on her next film Body of Evidence in Oregon. Shortly after, Pettibone started on a song called [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", which was not working. He further commented that he made a new bass line for the track. When Madonna went to record her vocals for [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", she started singing Little Willie John's song [...] "Fever" [...] instead of singing the original words. They decided to record it, as they felt it <b>sounded</b> <b>good.</b> As they did not know the words, Madonna called Seymour Stein from Sire Records, and within an hour, they had the Peggy Lee version, and the original version of the song. This song was the last to be recorded for the album, in August 1992, and it was finished within a month later.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked why}} they wear masks, Flaubert replied: The answer that makes me <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> is that we desired to {{circumvent}} the cult of personality that is inherent in rock music by choosing to remain anonymous. Unlike every other band in rock we chose to be anonymous. The answer that makes me <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> would probably also incorporate some lengthy discussion about Brechtian alienation techniques, about our post modernistgrasp of ever cooling universe, and a dehumanising society encapsulated in the somewhat paramilitary aspect of our clothing. All of those things would make me <b>sound</b> <b>good,</b> but actually weâ€™re really boring guys." [...] Humphrey B. Flaubert ...|$|R

500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost {{at the bottom of}} her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes <b>sounded</b> <b>good.</b> On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E
500|$|The second {{episode of}} the series {{was the first to}} feature {{predominantly}} original writing, as the [...] "Pilot" [...] contained many jokes from the British series pilot. During one of Michael's impersonations, a racial expletive spoken by Michael had to be censored by the producers for NBC. Daniels was terrified that the scene would leak unedited, so he personally oversaw the censoring of the master copy. The scene where Pam rests her head on Jim's shoulder after Dwight has stolen his sale and Jim smiles and says [...] "not a bad day after all" [...] came about when Greg Daniels spoke to the writers about wanting to have small, happy interactions between Jim and Pam and mentioned the head-on-shoulder idea, which B. J. Novak immediately wrote into his script. Paul Lieberstein did not want to appear in the episode and did so assuming it would be a one-time event, but Kevin Reilly was impressed by his work and said the show should use him more, leading to the expansion of Paul's work as Toby Flenderson. Two scenes that were cut involved Michael Scott responding to Mr. Brown's [...] "HERO" [...] acronym by creating one that <b>sounded</b> <b>good</b> until everyone noticed the words created the acronym of [...] "INCEST", and Michael responded to Mr. Brown's nixing of that idea by pointing out the links between incest and racism in some states, while another had Jim replacing Dwight's [...] "Asian" [...] headband with [...] "Dwight" [...] and then having the other co-workers complain to a clueless Dwight about how annoying his behavior was.|$|E
