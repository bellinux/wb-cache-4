5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is an {{imminent}} threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes {{he should be}} executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> able to convince the others to change their minds.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

25|$|In the lead-up to the 2008 presidential {{elections}} in Taiwan, the Kuomintang candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, pledged opening the Three Links at an accelerated rate <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> elected president. The ruling DPP {{has traditionally been}} reluctant to implement this, citing the PRC's refusal to negotiate unless the Taiwanese counterparty accepts the one-China principle under the 1992 consensus. In June 2007, DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh criticised Ma's plans {{as a reflection of}} his lack of experience in handling cross-strait affairs. He also stressed that while the direct links may benefit Taiwan economically, Taiwan's values must not be compromised as a result.|$|E

25|$|After these expeditions {{returned}} home, Brennus urged {{and persuaded}} them {{to mount a}} third united expedition against central Greece, led by himself and Acichorius. The reported strength of the army of 152,000 infantry and 24,400 cavalry is impossibly large. The actual number of horsemen has to be intended half as big: Pausanias describes how they used a tactic called trimarcisia, where each cavalryman was supported by two mounted servants, who could supply him with a spare horse should he have to be dismounted, or take {{his place in the}} battle, <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> killed or wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} {{recognizes the}} threat Jurel poses to their social standing and forces {{him to resign}} before his deposition. After harsh criticism from Lisa, {{as well as her}} streaking down the school hallway naked (an allusion to Jurel's earlier accusation that she was unable to walk down the school halls 'naked' and see its true troubles), he finally stands up to Burke and Rubell, reminding them that the school exists for the students and not for the administration and protecting their jobs. He also threatens to sue <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> fired. He proudly walks back into the school, with loud cheers from the school's students and Lisa looking on proudly.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{system of}} {{differentiation}} for the noble non-Royal families is {{unlike any other}} cadency system. It {{is true that the}} bruiser personalises the arms, however, since the Portuguese have an arbitrary choice of surnames, they may select any family name from the father's or mother's side of their genealogical table and a coat of arms, which does not have to coincide with it. Thus, the system of differencing only serves to show from which ancestral line the arms are derived. The head of the lineage uses the arms without a difference, but <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> the head of more than one family, the arms are combined by quartering. The heir apparent to the arms of the head of a lineage never uses a mark of difference.|$|E

25|$|From Natchez, Fremantle {{travelled}} to Jackson, {{which he}} reached on 18 May. As {{the city had}} been evacuated and attacked {{only a few days}} earlier, Fremantle was treated with some suspicion by soldiers and locals, who expressed scepticism that an English officer should be travelling alone through the South. One local, the gun-toting Mr Smythe, {{even went so far as}} to threaten the foreign visitor with execution <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> unable to prove his identity and credentials. Upon 'examination' by a mob in a hotel, Fremantle finally convinced a Confederate cavalry officer and an Irish doctor of his legitimacy, and was spirited away to meet General Joseph E. Johnston, who accepted the peculiar traveller into his company. Fremantle remained near Johnston for several days, learning of the death of General Jackson from his Chancellorsville wound.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 2015, {{the city}} {{announced}} {{that there was}} a video of a fatal police shooting that took place on October 12, 2014. Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's office investigated possible criminal charges against Officer George Hernandez (whose name was revealed on December 7), who shot Ronald Johnson III in the back during a foot chase. The officer opened fire seconds after arriving on the scene, when Johnson was moving away from police. Johnson was allegedly a known gang member and also allegedly armed; a gun was recovered at the scene. The attorney for Johnson's family contends police planted the weapon. The city fought to keep the video of the incident secret so as not to jeopardize the officer's right to a fair trial <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> indicted. As in the McDonald case, the video lacks audio. The city released the video on December 7 due to pressure for transparency prompted by the McDonald case. No charges have been filed against Hernandez.|$|E
25|$|Pitezel {{agreed to}} fake {{his own death}} so that his wife could collect on a $10,000 life {{insurance}} policy, which she was to split with Holmes and Jeptha Howe. The scheme, which was {{to take place in}} Philadelphia, called for Pitezel to set himself up as an inventor under the name B.F. Perry, and then be killed and disfigured in a lab explosion. Holmes was to find an appropriate cadaver {{to play the role of}} Pitezel. Instead, Holmes killed Pitezel by knocking him unconscious with chloroform and setting his body on fire with the use of benzene. In his confession, Holmes implied that Pitezel was still alive after he used the chloroform on him, prior to being set on fire. However, forensic evidence presented at Holmes' later trial showed that chloroform had been administered after Pitezel's death (a fact which the insurance company was unaware of), presumably to fake suicide to exonerate Holmes <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> charged with murder.|$|E
