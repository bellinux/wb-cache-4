5|$|Cooper Anderson (Matt Bomer), Blaine's (Darren Criss) {{older brother}} and an actor in {{television}} ads, visits McKinley High and is treated as a celebrity by Blaine's boyfriend Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Sue. Blaine is unhappy, though, when after he and Cooper do an impromptu mashup of two Duran Duran songs in the choir room, Cooper finds fault with Blaine's singing. Sue recruits Cooper to give an acting master class for the club, which contains <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> advice that Blaine is appalled. Worse, Cooper subsequently criticizes Blaine's acting in a class scene.|$|E
5|$|The castles {{guarding}} the northern border were in <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki, {{the capital of}} Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). Władysław {{arrived on the scene}} in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

5|$|His {{relations}} with Temenggong Daing Ibrahim remained strained; in 1860, Sultan Ali allowed a Bugis adventurer, Suliwatang, the chiefs of Rembau and Sungei Ujong {{to settle in}} Muar and prepare themselves for an attack on Johor. <b>Such</b> <b>bad</b> blood between the Sultan and Temenggong Daing Ibrahim passed down to the Temenggong's son, Abu Bakar, who succeeded his father after the former died in 1862. Shortly after Abu Bakar became the Temenggong of Johor, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali to reassert of Johor's sovereignty over Segamat. Continued disputes over the sovereignty of Segamat led to an outbreak of a war between the Temenggong's men with the Sultan's. Eleven years later in 1873, attempts made by Suliwatang to collect custom taxes from inhabitants at the Muar estuary led to further conflict with Abu Bakar's (who became Maharaja in 1868) men.|$|E
5|$|John's {{position}} in France was considerably {{strengthened by the}} victory at Mirebeau, but John's treatment of his new prisoners and of his ally, William de Roches, quickly undermined these gains. De Roches was a powerful Anjou noble, but John largely ignored him, causing considerable offence, whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> conditions that twenty-two of them died. At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship, and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable. William de Roches and other of John's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt. John's financial situation was tenuous: once {{factors such as the}} comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account, Philip enjoyed a considerable, although not overwhelming, advantage of resources over John.|$|E
5|$|Unit 64.07 was retired on 20 December 1982 after rust damage {{had been}} found on it. By 1984, the {{carriages}} were in <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> shape {{that they needed to}} be replaced. Trailers from Class 65 and Class 67 were taken into use, and for a short period a Class 91 trailer. On 28 August 1985, passenger traffic on the line was terminated and the two remaining trains were retired. Reasons for the termination included a lack of sufficient political support for financing new trains, and also that Class 64 was no longer suitable for use. The last two trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are stored at Garnes Station, part of the Old Voss Line.|$|E

5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt. Shut out {{of the end zone}} on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick what would be the winning field goal with 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E

25|$|Construction was {{organized}} by Einsatzgruppe Wiking, which was based in Mo i Rana and had clerks of works in Fauske and Tømmerneset. The work was performed {{through a number of}} German construction companies. Construction on the Polar Line started from January 1943. The first part of construction was for auxiliary facilities, such as barracks, quays and power supply. The workforce largely provided by Russian and Serbian prisoners of war (POW). Despite the enormous amount of labor-force, construction of the railway was notoriously inefficient and the part of the railway which were completed further south was of <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> quality that most of the permanent way had to be replaced. North of Tysfjorden, the only work was a tote road between Narvik and Bjørnfjell.|$|E
25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1965 both Ole Miss and Mississippi State University had been integratedthe former violently, the latter peacefully. University of Southern Mississippi leaders, such as President McCain, had {{come to realize that}} the battle to {{maintain}} segregation was lost. Therefore, they made extensive confidential plans for the admission and attendance of their first black students. A faculty guardian and tutor was secretly appointed for each. The same campus police department which six years before had attempted to railroad Kennard to prison when he attempted to enroll, now had very strict orders to prevent or quickly stop any incident involving the two black students. Student athletic, fraternity, and political leaders were recruited to keep the calm and protect the university from <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> publicity as Ole Miss had suffered from its reaction to James Meredith.|$|E

25|$|Goldman {{also claimed}} that when Lennon started making music again in 1980 {{following}} a long hibernation, {{he was not}} immune to Manhattan's cocaine-fueled disco scene. According to Goldman, on the day Lennon was murdered {{he was scheduled to}} undergo plastic surgery several days later to repair his nasal septum (due to snorting cocaine, which he supposedly did at the Hit Factory recording studio where he recorded his album Double Fantasy). Goldman did not cite a single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio. Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, but he was in <b>such</b> <b>bad</b> physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.|$|E
