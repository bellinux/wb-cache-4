Tourism activity is only allowed in selected areas of Corbett Tiger Reserve <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{get an opportunity to}} see its splendid landscape and the diverse wildlife. In recent years the number of people coming here has increased dramatically. Presently, every season more than 70,000 visitors come to the park.|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences. For example, in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure. The cash awards were distributed more evenly <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who went out earlier earned more money, while those who made it to the final table won less.|$|E

5|$|The {{crowd of}} people {{assembled}} below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers, merchants, craft persons, peasants, and women and sick children. As the balcony was set high, the king would stand on a platform <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable; even when the sovereign was ill. He {{felt that it was}} necessary to see them publicly {{at least once a day}} in order to maintain his control, and guard against immediate anarchy. It also had a symbolic purpose. During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar, or present him with petitions for some cause. Akbar, therefore, began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him. Sometimes, while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan, he would let out a thread down the jharokha <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice. It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process, which Badauni, a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan. Akbar's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{death was}} mourned nationwide. Over {{two million people}} joined the five-mile long funeral {{procession}} that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could {{catch a glimpse of}} his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E

5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{excavations}} {{that have}} been undertaken since 1998 are funded by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council and grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and have received news coverage. The site {{is used as a}} training excavation for students and a community dig to introduce people to ancient history, with the participation of Mellor Archaeological Trust. In 2002, students from Ridge Danyers Sixth Form College built a replica roundhouse that is still standing on the site. Many of the artefacts discovered at Mellor during the excavations are on permanent display at Stockport Museum. The site {{is open to the public}} annually, in the first week of September, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can view the work done over the past season of digging.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of quarantine was increased to forty days in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to quarantine {{changed with the}} news of the spread of plague to include all of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland (all regions of the Dutch Republic), although restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, commencing with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it {{had been one of the}} last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days quarantine.|$|E

5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and their DNA is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.|$|E
