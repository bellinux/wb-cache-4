5|$|In October 2013 Van Dijk {{announced}} that she signed a three-year contract with Boels Dolmans Cycling Team. She is a teammate of among others Lizzie Armitstead, Katarzyna Paw≈Çowska and Christine Majerus. The time trial at the 2016 Summer Olympics will be her big goal. She will keep her focus on time trials, world cup races and flat short stage races. Due to her focus on road cycling, she will not compete on the track. Van Dijk {{was not able to}} start in the Ladies Tour of Qatar because she did not recover in time from an illness after riding mountainbikerace Egmond-pier-Egmond. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> her shape during the first races and just missed the podium in the GP Le Samyn. At the first World Cup race of the season, the Ronde van Drenthe, Van Dijk helped teammate Lizzie Armitstead to victory by closing a massive gap in the final of the race.|$|E
25|$|Truth {{learned that}} her son Peter, then five years old, had been sold {{illegally}} by Dumont to an owner in Alabama. With {{the help of the}} Van Wagenens, she took the issue to court and in 1828, after months of legal proceedings, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> her son, who had been abused by those who were enslaving him. Truth {{became one of the first}} black women to go to court against a white man and win the case.|$|E
25|$|When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should {{create a new}} State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state}} for African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E

500|$|The {{damage control}} parties had great {{difficulty}} in controlling {{and reducing the}} flooding, as they could use only emergency hand pumps. Some forward and starboard voids were counter-flooded to reduce the list. In the meantime, engine room personnel were able to restart the starboard shafts and steering could be effected with the backup hand-steering gear. After <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> underway, {{she was able to}} slowly increase her speed to [...] using only her starboard shafts. While the Italian fleet was withdrawing, Formidable launched another air strike of nine Swordfish in an attempt to slow Vittorio Veneto down. But instead of hitting the Italian battleship, they struck the cruiser Pola, leaving her dead in the water. Vittorio Veneto returned to port while two cruisers and several destroyers were detached to protect Pola; all three cruisers and two destroyers were sunk in a furious night action at very close range with the battleships , , and [...] Vittorio Veneto meanwhile reached Taranto on 29 March, where repairs lasted until July. She was not fully operational again until August.|$|E
500|$|Naomi first storyline {{focused on}} her {{unexpected}} arrival in Erinsborough and her reconciliation with her mother Sheila (Mann), who she had not spoken to in five years. They fell out when Sheila discovered Naomi's affair with a married man and told his wife, which Naomi had never forgiven her for. Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later {{surprised to learn that}} she was Sheila's daughter. She then reunited with her mother and her nephew Kyle (Chris Milligan). While Sheila was pleased to see her daughter, she was suspicious of her motives and sudden urge to see her. Mann commented, [...] "Sheila has learned the hard way that there is always an agenda with Naomi. Nothing is ever as it seems." [...] When Sheila found a discarded SIM card, she hoped to find some clues as to why her daughter has reappeared in her life. After seeing a lot of number and messages stored on the card, Sheila believed Naomi was having another affair. She then accused Naomi of repeating her past mistakes and [...] "a fierce war of words" [...] erupted between the two, which resulted in Naomi deciding to leave. Sheila then promised not to interfere in her life and [...] "reluctantly" [...] offered Naomi a place to stay, until <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> on her feet.|$|E
