40|$|An immobilized enzymatic {{reaction}} cascade {{was designed}} and optimized for the deacidification of grass <b>silage</b> <b>press</b> juice (SPJ), thus facilitating the production of bio-based chemicals. The cascade involves a three-step process using four enzymes immobilized in a Ca-alginate gel and uses lactic acid to form acetoin, a value-added product. The reaction is performed with a continuous, pH-dependent substrate feed under oxygenation. With titrated lactic acid yields of up to 91 % and reaction times of ca. 6 h was achieved. Using SPJ as titrant yields of 49 % were obtained within 6 h. In this deacidification process, with acetoin one value-added bio-based chemical is produced while simultaneously the remaining press juice {{can be used in}} applications that require a higher pH. Such, this system can be applied in a multi-product biorefinery concept {{to take full advantage of}} nutrient-rich SPJ, which is a widely available and easily storable renewable resource...|$|E

40|$|Both {{fresh and}} ensiled sugar-beet pulp {{has a high}} feeding value and shows a {{positive}} dietetic effect on ruminal fermentation (Rohr et al., 1986; Formigoni et al., 1993). As far as the feeding value is con-cerned, this feed is comparable with feeding barley (Murphy, 1986), has a favourable energy concentra-tion and a relatively high content of fibre (Drennan, 1981). Boldt et al. (1990) compared production ef-ficiency of fresh, dried and ensiled pulp. However, fresh sugar-beet pulp is also a suitable medium for the propagation of epiphytic microorganisms, par-ticularly moulds, yeast and soil bacteria, which can cause a quick deterioration of this feedstuff. For a longer storage it is recommended to preserve this feed above all {{in the form of}} silage (Graf, 1981; Graf and Haluschan, 1981). Provided that the techno-logical conditions are maintained on an optimal level, the process of ensiling of pressed sugar-beet pulp usually runs without any marked problems. Haaksma (1991) concluded that already within the first two days after ensiling, the major part of su-crose was converted to monosaccharides and or-ganic acids, particularly lactic acid (LA) and acetic acid (AA) in amounts of 1. 2 – 1. 4 % and 0. 2 – 0. 4 %, resp., and that the pH-value decreased from 5. 5 to 3. 8. Such acidification preventively inhibited harm-ful bacteria, above all clostridia. Grajewski (1990) also analysed the quality of silages made of wet and pressed sugar-beet pulp. Mossakowska (1990) reported that <b>silages</b> made of <b>pressed</b> sugar-beet pulp containing 23 – 24 % of dry matter and a suf-ficient amount of sucrose contained 1. 18 – 3. 50 % of lactic acid and no butyric acid. On the other hand, Wyss (2002) observed that <b>silages</b> made of <b>pressed</b> sugar-beet pulp showed low levels of lactic acid. Although the pH value of silages made of sugar-beet pulp was low, differences between control and experimental silage samples were large...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a substituição da silagem de milho pela polpa cítrica úmida prensada (PCUP) sobre as características de carcaça e dos não-componentes da carcaça de cordeiros da raça Santa Inês. Vinte quatro cordeiros com idade média de 90 dias e peso vivo inicial médio de 18 kg foram confinados durante 67 dias, alimentados com dietas contendo níveis crescentes de PCUP em substituição à silagem de milho (0, 25, 50, 75 % da MS). Não foi verificada diferença (p> 0, 05) para peso vivo ao abate (32, 8 kg), rendimento de carcaça quente (44, 7 %), rendimento verdadeiro (50, 3 %) e não-componentes da carcaça. Em relação aos rendimentos dos cortes, apenas o rendimento de lombo foi afetado (p The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the replacement of corn <b>silage</b> by <b>pressed</b> citrus pulp (PCP) on carcass characteristics and non-carcass components of Santa Ines lambs. Twenty-four lambs with average age of 90 days and initial weight of 18 kg were maintained in feedlot for 67 days, fed with increasing levels of PCP replacing corn silage (0, 25, 50, 75 %, DM basis). There was no difference (p> 0. 05) for live weight at slaughter (32. 8 kg), hot carcass yield (44. 7 %), true yield (50. 3 %) and non-carcass components. In relation to cut yields, only loin yield was affected (p< 0. 05) by the diet, which showed quadratic response. For the carcass measurements, only the arm length was affected by the diet, showing quadratic behavior. The percentage of fat and muscle showed quadratic behavior according to replacement levels. The results suggest that pressed citrus pulp can substitute corn silage for lambs in feedlot without affecting the carcass characteristics and the non-carcass components...|$|R

Energetic {{conversion}} of European semi-natural grassland silages through the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass: Energy yields and {{the fate of}} organic compounds. Bioresource Technology, 154, 192 - 200 Twelve European habitat types were investigated to determine the influence of the IFBB technique (integrated generation of biogas and solid fuel from biomass) on the fate of organic compounds and energy yields of semi-natural grassland biomass. Concentration of organic compounds in <b>silage</b> and IFBB <b>press</b> cake (PC), mass flows within that system and methane yields of IFBB press fluids (PF) were determined. The gross energy yield of the IFBB technique was calculated in comparison to hay combustion (HC) and whole crop digestion (WCD). The IFBB treatment increased fibre and organic matter (OM) concentrations and lowered non-fibre carbohydrates and crude protein concentrations. The PF was highly digestible irrespective of habitat types, showing mean methane yields between 312. 1 and 405. 0 LN CH 4 kg? 1 VS. Gross energy yields for the IFBB system (9. 75 ? 30. 19 MWh ha? 1) were in the range of HC, outperformed WCD and were influenced by the habitat type. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Não houve diferença para ingestão de MS (IMS). Os valores médios de IMS em g, %PV e g/kgPV 0, 75 foram respectivamente, 1. 180, 4, 74 e 126. Houve redução linear na ingestão de FDN, em %PV e em g/kgPV 0, 75, com o aumento dos níveis de substituição. A ingestão de PB não foi afetada pela dieta. Verificou-se aumento linear para a ingestão de EE, em %PV e em g/kgPV 0, 75, e para a FDA, em %PV. A ingestão de carboidratos não-fibrosos (CNF) apresentou comportamento quadrático, em %PV e em g/kgPV 0, 75, e linear em g/animal. dia, à medida que houve a substituição da silagem de milho pela PCUP. A substituição da silagem de milho pela PCUP não afetou a conversão alimentar (4, 33 kg MS/ kg de ganho), no entanto, o ganho de peso médio apresentou comportamento quadrático em função do nível de substituição; o nível de substituição de 48 % promoveu o maior ganho médio diário. Os resultados sugerem que a PCUP pode substituir a silagem de milho em dietas para cordeiros em confinamento. This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the substitution of corn <b>silage</b> by fresh <b>pressed</b> citrus pulp (FPCP) {{on the performance of}} Santa Ines lambs. Twenty-four lambs, with average age of 90 days and initial average body weight of 18. 44 kg, were feedlot during 67 days and fed with increasing levels of FPCP in substitution of corn silage (0, 25, 50, and 75 % DM). There was no difference for DM intake (DMI). The average values for DMI in g, %BW and g/kgBW 0. 75 were, respectively, 1, 180, 4. 74 and 126. There was a linear decreased in NDF intake, in %BW and g/kgBW 0. 75, with the increase of the level of substitution. The CP intake was not affected by the diet. There was linear increase for EE intake, in %BW and g/kgBW 0. 75, and for ADF in %BW. The non fiber carbohydrate intake showed quadratic behavior, in %BW and g/kgBW 0. 75, and linear increase in g/an/day, as corn silage was substituted by FPCP. The substitution of corn silage by FPCP did not affect the feed conversion (4. 33 kg DM/kg of gain), however, the average weight gain showed a quadratic behavior in function of substitution level. The level of substitution of 48 % promoted the highest average daily gain. The results suggest that FPCP can substitute corn silage in the diets for lambs in feedlot confined...|$|R
