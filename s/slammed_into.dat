5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1995, {{a mortar}} shell <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> a Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory {{air strikes against}} the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} {{returned to the}} remaining guns, although most of their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through the rigging of Sybille while the British broadsides <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, exacerbated by the lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of the upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at point blank range.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E
5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the base, leveling {{most of the}} above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off {{an explosion in the}} main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E
5|$|While {{the force}} {{was in the}} Strait of Bonifacio, Dornier Do 217s of the German Luftwaffes {{specialist}} wing KG 100armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombssighted the force. The first attack failed, but the second dealt Italia (ex-Littorio) and Roma much damage. The hit on Roma caused water to flood two boiler rooms and the after engine room, leaving the ship to limp along with two propellers, reduced power, and arc-induced fires in {{the stern of the}} ship. Shortly thereafter, another bomb <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the ship which detonated within the forward engine room, causing catastrophic flooding and the explosion of the #2 main turret's magazines, throwing the turret itself into the sea. Sinking by the bow and listing to starboard, Roma capsized and broke in two, carrying 1,393 menincluding Bergaminidown with her.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the action began, with Pitot's stern chasers opening fire upon Constellation. In an effort to cut the American frigate's {{advantage}} in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations rigging. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having {{the advantage of the}} wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other {{for two and a half}} hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for the rigging, at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1983 a van {{carrying}} a 2,000 pound load of explosives, <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> the U.S. embassy in West Beirut, killing 63. In August 1983, Israel withdrew its Defense Forces from the Chouf District (southeast of Beirut), thus removing the buffer between the Druze and the Christian militias and triggering {{another round of}} brutal fighting. In August 1983 militiamen began to bombard United States Marines positions near Beirut International Airport with mortar and rocket fire as the Lebanese Army fought Druze and Shia forces in the southern suburbs of Beirut. On 29 August 1983, two Marines were killed and fourteen wounded, and in the ensuing months the Marines came under almost daily attack from artillery, mortar, rocket, and small-arms fire. After this attack the Marines began returning fire. The Reagan Administration decided to dispatch New Jersey, a decision the Marines cheered.|$|E
5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E

5|$|The hurricane's {{effects were}} severe {{in the city}} of Charleston, where the storm {{produced}} northeasterly winds and heavy rainfall. The bulwark of the fort at nearby James Island was destroyed, and the palisades of the fort at Castle Pinckney were wrecked at the mouth of Charleston's harbor. The hurricane also swept vessels aground into marshes and wharves between Gadsden's Wharf and South Bay along the Cooper River. Several wharves—Pritchard's, Cochran's, Beale's, Craft's, and William's—were struck by vessels and consequently severely damaged. The Montserrat, Mary, Birmingham Packet, Amazon, and Orange all endured some degree of damage. Three vessels and the Mary collided with Governor's Bridge, which was impaired as a result; two vessels and the Favorite <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> Faber's Wharf, while the Concord filled with water at Prioleau's Wharf, resulting in the loss of 50tierces of rice. A counting and scale house was separated from its foundation after being struck by the Lydia within the vicinity of Blake's Wharf, while the African slave boat Christopher capsized at Geyer's Wharf, with all aboard escaping safely. Four slaves drowned after a boat overturned in the Ashley River.|$|E
5|$|Spawned by {{a weather}} system that had {{originated}} in Kansas, an EF-4 tornado <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> Harrisburg {{early on the}} morning of February 29, 2012. The tornado touched down just north of Carrier Mills at 4:51a.m., destroyed a church and damaged houses along Town Park Road, and then traveled ENE through the Harrisburg Coal Field just north of Ledford, and then went through Liberty, where it damaged Harrisburg Middle School. The tornado then reached the south-western edge of the city at 4:56a.m., specifically Dorrisville, which suffered significant property damage, and then churned eastward to Gaskins City which was nearly leveled; 7 people were confirmed dead in that area, most killed in an apartment complex that was crushed by another residence, and 110 were injured overall. On June 3, another victim died in the hospital from their injuries, raising the death toll to 8. Harrisburg Medical Center was also significantly damaged in Gaskins City. Peak winds were estimated to have been about 180mph, and the width of the tornado path was 275 yards, traveling 26.5 miles. In Harrisburg, more than 200 houses, and about 25 businesses were destroyed or damaged heavily. At least 10 houses and other buildings were leveled completely, and several structures were displaced from their foundations. Early estimates indicated nearly 40% of the city was damaged or destroyed. The following night, a mandatory curfew was enforced in the effected areas, from 6 p.m. through 6 a.m. Counting the damage and death toll, it was reported to be the worst storm since the Joplin, Missouri tornado. Harrisburg Unit 3 schools were closed until March 5, 2012, and later they offered trauma counseling to students after reopening.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{one month}} later in Belgium. Jenson Button qualified on pole and broke away at the start while a four-car pile-up started behind him when Romain Grosjean made contact with Lewis Hamilton and they both <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez, eliminating all four on the spot and triggering the safety car. Kamui Kobayashi's car was also damaged, and Pastor Maldonado was spun around amidst the chaos. Grosjean was later given a one-race ban for causing the collision, becoming the first driver in eighteen years to be banned from racing. Maldonado retired shortly after the restart with a broken front wing after making contact with Timo Glock, while Narain Karthikeyan spun off at Stavelot mid-way through the race when his wheel came loose. Button controlled the race from the front and was unchallenged throughout, while Sebastian Vettel clawed {{his way up to}} second from tenth on the grid. Kimi Räikkönen started and finished third, let down by a conservative pit strategy that forced him to make a second stop late in the race in order to use both compounds of tyre as per the rules – even when it became apparent that Button and Vettel were racing on a one-stop strategy – and Nico Hülkenberg finished in a career-best fourth place. Button's win allowed him to regain precious ground on the championship fight, while Alonso's retirement from the race and Vettel's second place moved the reigning World Champion to within twenty-four points of the championship lead. Scuderia Toro Rosso scored their first points since the Malaysian Grand Prix, with Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo finishing eighth and ninth respectively. Further down the order, Caterham was summoned to the stewards on charges of an unsafe pit release when Heikki Kovalainen was released directly into the path of Karthikeyan and the team was given a €10,000 fine for the incident.|$|E

5|$|The first {{long-lived}} supercell, which {{spawned the}} tornado with the longest continuous track of any single tornado to occur during this outbreak, developed around 4:50 pm CST (2250 UTC) southeast of Centerville in Yell County, Arkansas. The tornado touched {{down to the}} southwest of New Neely, causing minor damage to two structures and downing trees at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado tracked into Pope County, rapidly intensifying to EF3 strength as it <b>slammed</b> <b>into</b> Lucky Landing, a marina at Lake Atkins where multiple vehicles, boats, and mobile homes were destroyed, and one woman was killed. Continuing northeast, the tornado struck the southern and eastern edge of Atkins, killing three people. 65 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, and 39 others were damaged {{to a lesser degree}} in the Atkins area. Several vehicles were blown off of Interstate 40, and six mobile homes were destroyed as well, with five others damaged. Northeast of Atkins, the tornado toppled metal truss towers, destroyed chicken houses, and heavily damaged a large church and gym. In the Happy Bend area, another fatality occurred as a man abandoned his mobile home and sought shelter in a large metal shipping container, which was tossed hundreds of yards into a wooded area. The tornado continued on and crossed into Conway County at EF3 intensity, passing near the town of Cleveland. 36 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 6 sustained major damage, and 8 sustained minor damage along this segment of the path. Several chicken houses were completely destroyed, killing 80,000 chickens, and an elderly couple was killed when their mobile home was swept completely away.|$|E
