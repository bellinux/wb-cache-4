5000|$|The Royal Navy {{captured}} {{a handful of}} the new French frigates during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as the leading naval power. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery</b> of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into fifth-rate ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery</b> of twenty-six 12-pounder guns, with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle. From around 1778, a larger [...] "heavy" [...] frigate was developed with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (again with the remaining ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle).|$|R
500|$|These ships {{had their}} main {{armament}} mounted in four barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at each corner of the battery, with the remaining guns on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck</b> below the barbettes. The original armament consisted of four [...] guns in the barbettes, and on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck,</b> four [...] and four [...] guns. This was upgraded in Océan to four [...] guns in the barbettes and eight [...] on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck</b> before she was commissioned. The two later ships, Marengo and Suffren, were armed with 274-millimeter guns in the barbettes, and four 240-millimeter guns and seven [...] on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Vétéran was a {{development}} from the Téméraire class 74-gun ship {{of the line}} of the French Navy, one of two ships of a sub-class of which the other vessel was the Cassard. The two ships, both built by Pierre Ozanne at Brest to the plans of Jacques-Noël Sané, were enlarged from the earlier class in order to carry an upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery</b> of 24-pounder long guns, instead of the 18-pounder long guns used on the regular units of the Téméraire class.|$|R

5000|$|... "Pallada" [...] was a three-masted frigate {{of wooden}} construction, with a {{transverse}} steel reinforcement skeleton in her hull. The {{length of the}} hull, {{at the height of}} the main <b>deck</b> <b>battery,</b> was 52.73 m (without bowsprit), the maximum interior width was 13.31 m. Her hull was sheathed in copper sheets, to prevent destruction of the wood by marine organisms [...] A novelty on the Russian ships at the time was the use of portholes for lighting crew spaces on the lower deck.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 Nivôse An V in the Action of 13 January 1797, off Penmarch, Droits de l'Homme met the British frigates [...] (44), under Sir Edward Pellew, and [...] (36), {{commanded}} by Robert C. Reynolds. The sea was rough, preventing Droits de l'Homme from using her lower <b>deck</b> <b>batteries</b> and from boarding the British. Lacrosse was wounded; he gave {{command of the}} ship to his second officer, Prévost de Lacroix, and had his crew swear not to strike their colours.|$|R

500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Audacious-class ships {{consisted of}} 10 RML [...] rifled muzzle-loading guns. Six {{of these were}} positioned on the main deck, three on each broadside, and the other four guns were mounted on {{the corners of the}} upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery.</b> The battery protruded over the sides of the ships to give the guns a certain amount of end-on fire. The shell of the nine-inch gun weighed [...] while the gun itself weighed [...] It had a muzzle velocity of [...] and was rated with the ability to penetrate [...] of wrought-iron armour at the muzzle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{armament}} of the Audacious-class ships {{consisted of}} 10 RML 9 in rifled muzzle-loading guns. Six {{of these were}} positioned on the main deck, three on each broadside, and the other four guns were mounted on {{the corners of the}} upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery.</b> The battery protruded over the sides of the ships to give the guns a certain amount of end-on fire. The shell of the nine-inch gun weighed 254 lb while the gun itself weighed 12 LT. It had a muzzle velocity of 1420 ft/s and was rated with the ability to penetrate 11.3 in of wrought-iron armour at the muzzle.|$|R
50|$|United States rotted away at Norfolk until 20 April 1861 {{when the}} navy yard was {{captured}} by Confederate troops. Before leaving the yard, Union fire crews failed to burn the vessel along with other abandoned ships, thinking it unnecessary to destroy the decayed relic. The Confederates, pressed for vessels in any condition, thought otherwise. They pumped her out and commissioned the frigate CSS United States (though they often called her Confederate States) on 29 April. On 15 June, she was fitted out as a receiving ship with a <b>deck</b> <b>battery</b> of 19 guns for harbor defense.|$|R
5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 {{guns were}} mounted in barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at the forward corner of the battery, with the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck</b> below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns were on the upper deck, fore and aft of the barbettes, and on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "No, massa," [...] {{said the}} negro steward, <b>stepping</b> on <b>deck</b> at that moment, [...] "we can't go to de bottom, cause we's dare a-ready!" ...|$|R
50|$|Two 9-inch muzzle-loading rifle (MLR) {{guns and}} {{fourteen}} 7-inch 90 cwt MLR guns formed the main armament, supplemented by six 64-pounder MLRs. The 9-inch guns were chase weapons, mounted at front and back. The fourteen 7-inch guns {{were the main}} <b>deck</b> broadside <b>battery.</b>|$|R
50|$|The flushed deck {{design was}} {{introduced}} with rice ships built in Bengal Subah, Mughal India (modern Bangladesh), resulting in hulls that were stronger and {{less prone to}} leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a <b>stepped</b> <b>deck</b> design. This was a key innovation in shipbuilding at the time. The British East India Company later duplicated the flushed deck design of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The Volvo B10B was a rear-engined <b>step</b> <b>deck</b> single-decker {{bus chassis}} {{manufactured}} by Volvo between 1992 and 2001. The first prototype {{were built in}} 1990, but the B10B wasn't launched until the 1992 Geneva Motor Show. It superseded the Leyland Lynx (by then a Volvo product) and Volvo B10R. For stage use it was gradually succeeded by the low-entry B10BLE, which was introduced only a year later, though not in all markets. For interurban use the B7R came as a gradual replacement in 1998, and ultimately for coach work, the B12B took over in 2001.|$|R
500|$|These ships {{had their}} main {{armament}} mounted in four barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at each corner of the battery, with the remaining guns on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck</b> below the barbettes. Suffrens armament was upgraded, before she commissioned, to four [...] guns in the barbettes, and on the <b>battery</b> <b>deck,</b> four [...] guns, six [...] guns and one [...] gun. By 1885, all of the 138-millimeter guns were replaced by six 120-millimeter guns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Light air, west-sou'-west," [...] muttered the Captain as he <b>stepped</b> on <b>deck,</b> cast {{a glance}} {{up at the}} vane on the mast-head, and then swept his eye round the (imaginary) horizon.|$|R

50|$|As powered ships {{came into}} use, {{the term was}} applied to the same {{approximate}} area of the ship (although the officers stations were moved to the bridge). It came to be applied to the area at the stern of the ship, sometimes a separate <b>stepped</b> <b>deck,</b> often used for secondary weapons and (on battleships) seaplane catapults. In modern designs the stern has been roofed over by the helicopter deck but a large space remains underneath which is typically used for sonar equipment and small boats and which is still referred to as the quarterdeck in Commonwealth navies.|$|R
40|$|Against the {{consensus}} that sailing ship technology was stagnant {{during the early}} Industrial Revolution, we find striking improvements in safety at sea. Between 1760 and 1825, {{the risk of being}} wrecked for Atlantic shipping fell by one third, and of foundering by two thirds, reflecting improvements in seaworthiness and navigation respectively. Seaworthiness improved through replacing the traditional <b>stepped</b> <b>deck</b> ship with stronger flushed decked ones derived from Indian designs, and the increasing use of iron reinforcement. Improved navigation owed little to precise longitude estimation and stemmed mostly from accurate charts and instruments, and accessible manuals of navigational technique...|$|R

6000|$|There was {{a murmur}} of deep {{satisfaction}} from the crew. As Bertha <b>stepped</b> on <b>deck</b> the men crowded round with low exclamations of [...] "God bless you, miss! This {{is a good}} day indeed for us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you dare}} to <b>step</b> on <b>deck,</b> captain!" [...] yelled down {{the voice of}} Shamhaven. [...] "Don't you dare to do it!" [...] And the sailor appeared, pistol in hand, {{at the top of}} the companionway.|$|R
50|$|Bengali {{shipbuilding}} was advanced {{compared to}} European shipbuilding at the time. Ship-repairing, for example, was very advanced in Bengal, where European shippers visited to repair vessels.

60|$|Moorshed ran his eye voluptuously {{over the}} upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery,</b> the huge beam, and the immaculate {{perspective}} of power. Captain Panke and Captain Malan {{stood on the}} well-browned flash-plates by the dazzling hatch. Precisely over the flagstaff I saw Two Six Seven astern, her black petticoat half hitched up, meekly floating on the still sea. She looked like the pious Abigail who has just spoken her mind, and, with folded hands, sits thanking Heaven among the pieces. I could almost have sworn that she wore black worsted gloves and had a little dry cough. But it was Captain Panke that coughed so austerely. He favoured us with a lecture on uniform, deportment, and the urgent necessity of answering signals from a senior ship. He {{told us that he}} disapproved of masquerading, that he loved discipline, and would be obliged by an explanation. And while he delivered himself deeper and more deeply into our hands, I saw Captain Malan wince. He was watching Moorshed's eye.|$|R
6000|$|... “That is good news,” {{the first}} {{lieutenant}} said, as Will <b>stepped</b> on <b>deck.</b> “The captain was afraid, {{after he had}} let you go, that he had sacrificed you, and that, going as you did in your uniform, you would be certain to be captured.” ...|$|R
