40|$|Over the years, it {{has become}} clear that {{increased}} nuchal translucency is a marker for chromosomal abnormalities, and it is also associated with a wide spectrum of <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies,</b> genetic syndromes, a higher risk of miscarriage, and intrauterine fetal death. These risks are all proportionally related to the degree of nuchal translucency enlargement. After the initial assessment of increased nuchal translucency, parents should be counselled by the fetal medicine specialist about the possible outcomes and the value of additional karyotyping and array comparative genomic hybridisation.

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decade, {{prenatal}} diagnosis has shifted rapidly {{from the second}} trimester into first trimester. The recent development of high frequency transvaginal ultrasound transducers has led to vastly improved ultrasound resolution and improved visualization of fetal anatomy earlier in gestation in 11 to 14 weeks of ultrasonographic scan. The early scan also provides reliable identification of chorionicity, which is the main determinant of outcome in multiple pregnancies. Objectives: This study was conducted for diagnose or suspect {{a wide range of}} <b>structural</b> and chromosomal <b>anomalies</b> of fetus; investigate the complication of early pregnancy; confirm viability; accurately date the pregnancy and diagnosis of multiple pregnancy & determination of chorionicity & amnionicity. Methods: Ultrasound screening transabdominally and transvaginally was performed at 11 &# 8211; 14 weeks in randomly selected cases of 150 pregnant women who attended our hospital from September 2007 to September 2009. In present study, ultrasound machine of high accuracy was used. Ultrasound examination was performed transabdominally and transvaginally Result: 45. 45 % <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> were detected in 11 to 14 weeks USG scan, 36. 36 % <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> were detected in 2 nd trimester (18 - 22 weeks) USG scan and 18. 18 % <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> were detected postnatally. Incidence rates of <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> detected in 11 to 14 weeks USG scan, 2 nd trimester USG scan and postnatally were 3. 3 %, 2. 6 % and 1. 4 % respectively with total incidence rate of 7. 3 %. Detection rate of <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> in 11 to 14 weeks USG scan & combined USG scan was 71. 42 % & 81. 8 % respectively. Highest number of structural abnormalities that is 34 %, detected in CNS; out of these, 100 % of them had NTDs. Conclusion: The concepts of first trimester scan solely to confirm viability or date of pregnancy should be abandoned and attempt should be made to visualize fetal anatomy in detail.

40|$|Context: The {{clinical}} {{spectrum of}} organogenetic anomalies associated with HNF 1 B mutations is heterogeneous. Besides cystic kidney disease, diabetes, {{and various other}} manifestations, odd cases of mainly neonatal and posttransplantation cholestasis have been described. The biliary phenotype is incompletely defined. Objective: To systematically characterize HNF 1 B-related anomalies in the bile ducts by imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Setting and Patients: Fourteen patients with HNF 1 B mutations in the catchment area of the Helsinki University Hospital were evaluated with upper abdominal MRI and MRCP. Blood samples and clinical history provided supplemental data on the individual phenotype. Main Outcome Measure(s) : <b>Structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the biliary system, medical history of cholestasis, other findings in abdominal organs, diabetes and antihyperglycemic treatment, hypomagnesemia, and hyperuricemia. Results: <b>Structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> of the bile ducts were found in seven of 14 patients (50 %). Six patients had choledochal cysts, which are generally considered premalignant. Conclusions: <b>Structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> of the biliary system were common in HNF 1 B mutation carriers.

50|$|CDON {{mutations}} {{are thought}} to diminish sonic hedgehog (SHH)-pathway activity {{which is important}} in stimulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development. CDON was shown {{to play a role}} in differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons through the interference with of Shh signaling pathway. Mutations in CDON gene has been associated with Holoprosencephaly which is <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly</b> of the brain, in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into right and left hemispheres. CDON mutations synergistically interact with prenatal alcohol exposure to increase susceptibility to Holoprosencephaly.|$|E
5000|$|Correct {{function}} of these proteins {{is critical for}} early development, and as such mutations of the genes encoding these proteins is known to result in various congenital defects. For example, mutation of ZIC2 is known to result in holoprosencephaly due to defect in the {{function of}} the organizer region (node), which leads to a defective anterior notochord (ANC). The ANC provides a maintenance signal to the Prechordal plate (PCP), thus a defective ANC results in degradation of the PCP, which is normally responsible for sending a shh signal to the developing forebrain resulting {{in the formation of the}} two hemispheres. [...] Holoprosencephaly is the most common <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly</b> of the human forebrain.|$|E
50|$|The hair {{is normal}} in {{quantity}} {{and is usually}} silvery-blond or straw-colored. It is disorderly, it stands out from the scalp, and cannot be combed flat. The underlying <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly</b> is longitudinal grooving of the hair shaft, which appears triangular in cross section.  This is caused by mutations {{in one of three}} possible genes; PADI3, TGM or TCHH3. The characteristic hair shaft anomaly can be demonstrated in asymptomatic family members by scanning electron microscopy. To be noticeable, 50% of hairs must be affected by the structural abnormality. Improvement often occurs in later childhood. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested though an autosomal recessive pattern with varying degrees of penetrance has also been noted. The stiffness of the uncombable hair has been reasoned to be due to the triangular form of the hair shaft in cross section. It has been suggested that the condition may result from premature keratinization of the inner root sheath.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. In a {{group of}} humans with strabismic amblyopia, the {{relationship}} was examined between the structure and function of different brain regions.

(2) Do <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the visual cortex correlate with the previously reported cortical functional losses? (3) Is there {{a link between the}} functional anomalies in the visual cortex and any <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the geniculate? Methods. The structure was compared by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the function by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results. The results showed that the geniculate is structurally abnormal in humans with strabismic amblyopia. Conclusions. These findings add further weight {{to the role of the}} LGN in the cortical deficits exhibited in human strabismic amblyopes...|$|R
30|$|Although {{there is}} <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly</b> found in {{tomography}} result, change in type of focal mechanism, and segmentation exist {{at this particular}} location, we still cannot reject {{the idea that the}} low seismicity may not be due to the <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly.</b> This is because there has been moderate background activity for over 10  years, which could not recognize a significant spatial anomaly in seismic density from surroundings before the mainshock.|$|E
3000|$|If {{the reason}} for the low-seismicity {{phenomenon}} is not due to the <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly,</b> large rupturing during the co-seismic period of the Kumamoto Earthquake at this area can be one of candidates for the cause of this low-seismicity region being significant only after the mainshock.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of using quantum walks on graphs to find <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies,</b> such as extra edges or loops, on a graph. We focus our attention on star graphs, whose edges are like spokes coming out of a central hub. If there are N spokes, we show that a quantum walk can find an extra edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in O(√(N)) steps. We initially find that if all of the spokes have loops except one, the walk will not find the spoke without a loop, but this can be fixed if we choose the phase with which the particle is reflected from the vertex without the loop. Consequently, quantum walks can, under some circumstances, be used to find <b>structural</b> <b>anomalies</b> in graphs...|$|R

40|$|Space-filling {{assemblies}} of athermal hydrophobic particles floating at an air-water interface, called particle rafts, {{are shown}} to undergo an unusual phase transition between two i. e., a low density `less-rigid {{and a high}} density `more-rigid' amorphous states {{as a function of}} particulate number density (Φ). The former is shown to be a capillary-bridged solid and the later a frictionally-coupled one. Simultaneous studies involving direct imaging as well as measuring its mechanical response to longitudinal and shear stresses show that the transition is marked by a subtle <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly</b> and a weakening of the shear response. The <b>structural</b> <b>anomaly</b> is identified from the variation of the mean coordination number, mean area of the Voronoi cells and the spatial profile of the displacement field with Φ.
