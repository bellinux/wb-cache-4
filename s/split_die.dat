40|$|In {{aluminium}} extrusion processes, friction inside the bearing channel {{is important for}} controlling the surface quality of the extrusion products. The contact materials show a large hardness difference, one being hot aluminium, and the other being hardened tool steel. Further, the contact pressure is high, which means that contact at the bearing–aluminium interface is fully plastic. A load dependent fully plastic friction model has been developed for such fully plastic contact conditions. This roughness based contact model is applied on the mesoscopic scale to calculate the length stick- and slip zones in the bearing–extrudate interface. Further, <b>split</b> <b>die</b> {{aluminium extrusion}} experiments have been performed to validate the model.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{technique}} called rubber pressure molding (RPM), {{has been developed}} to fabricate fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) products from glass fiber/polyester resin. The technique {{is based on the}} matching die set, where the die is made from mild steel and the punch from a flexible rubber-like material, i. e., butyl rubber, to apply hydrostatic pressure on the various surfaces of a complex shaped product. A split steel die and rubber punch are designed and fabricated to prepare the FRP product. The same <b>split</b> <b>die</b> is also used to cast the rubber punch. Using this {{new technique}}, an FRP product called a flanged cone is made from glass fiber. Burn test, coin test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mechanical tests like interlaminar fracture toughness, interlaminar shear test, tension test, etc. were carried out to ascertain the fiber content, void content, presence of delamination, bonding between fiber and resin, microstructure, and mechanical properties. These properties were also compared with FRP components made by the conventional technique to evaluate its performance in the structural applications. It is found that the interlaminar fracture toughness of the specimens made by RPM is 10 % higher than the specimens made by the conventional method. The tensile strength of the specimen made by RPM technique is 27 % more than the specimen made by the conventional method, whereas tensile modulus and Poisson’s ratio are in agreement. Furthermore, the interlaminar shear strength of the specimen made by RPM technique is 33 % higher than the specimens made by the conventional method.

40|$|Objectives - Powdered and {{granulated}} particulate materials make {{up most of}} {{the ingredients}} of pharmaceuticals and are often at risk of undergoing unwanted agglomeration, or caking, during transport or storage. This is particularly acute when bulk powders are exposed to extreme swings in temperature and relative humidity, which is now common as drugs are produced and administered in increasingly hostile climates and are stored {{for longer periods of time}} prior to use. This study explores the possibility of using a uniaxial unconfined compression test to compare the strength of caked agglomerates exposed to different temperatures and relative humidities. This is part of a longer-term study to construct a protocol to predict the caking tendency of a new bulk material from individual particle properties. The main challenge is to develop techniques that provide repeatable results yet are presented simply enough to be useful to a wide range of industries. Methods - Powdered sucrose, a major pharmaceutical ingredient, was poured into a <b>split</b> <b>die</b> and exposed to high and low relative humidity cycles at room temperature. The typical ranges were 20 – 30 % for the lower value and 70 – 80 % for the higher value. The outer die casing was then removed and the resultant agglomerate was subjected to an unconfined compression test using a plunger fitted to a Zwick compression tester. The force against displacement was logged so that the dynamics of failure as well as the failure load of the sample could be recorded. The experimental matrix included varying the number of cycles, the amount between the maximum and minimum relative humidity, the height and diameters of the samples, the number of cycles and the particle size. Results - Trends showed that the tensile strength of the agglomerates increased with the number of cycles and also with the more extreme swings in relative humidity. This agrees with previous work on alternative methods of measuring the tensile strength of sugar agglomerates formed from humidity cycling (Leaper et al 2003). Conclusions - The results show that at the very least the uniaxial tester is a good comparative tester to examine the caking tendency of powdered materials, with a simple arrangement and operation that are compatible with the requirements of industry. However, further work is required to continue to optimize the height/ diameter ratio during tests...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Cellulose {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} carbohydrate available from plant biomass. These biopolymers are therefore an important renewable source of food, fuels and chemicals. Cellulose is embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, lignin and pectin and is composed of repeating glucose units linked by p- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds. The individual molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds, forming largely crystalline fibres. The hemicellulose, which is a low molecular weight heteropolysaccharide, coats and binds the cellulose microfibrils, preventing the cellulose from becoming too crystalline. Three predominant types of hemicelluloses are recognised, namely 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -p-D-galactans, 1, 4 -p-D-mannans and 1, 4 -p-D-xylans, which are named according to the sugar type that forms the polymer backbone. Pectic substances contain rhamnogalacturonan backbones in which 1, 4 -linked a-D-galacturonan chains are interrupted at intervals with a-L-rhamnopyranosyl residues carrying neutral side chains. Two groups of enzymes, cellulases and pectinases, are required for the microbial utilisation of crystalline cellulose and pectin. Cellulases are multicomponent complexes that are often composed of endoglucanases, exoglucanases and cellobiases. Cellobiose is the major end product of concerted endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity. Cellobiose is then hydrolysed to glucose by p-glucosidases. The enzymatic breakdown of pectic polymers occurs by the deesterifying action of the saponifying enzymes, pectinesterase, releasing the methyl groups of the pectin molecule, and by hydrolase or lyase action of the depolymerases (pectin lyase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase), splitting the a- 1. 4 -glycosidic linkages in the polygalacturonate chain. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively in the alcoholic beverage industry for fermentations of wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages for many years. However, it is unable to produce extracellular depolymerising enzymes that can efficiently degrade polysaccharides, which are the main cause of clarification and filtration problems. Enzyme preparations have been used in the alcoholic beverage industries to degrade haze-forming polysaccharides, thereby improving the filterability and quality of products such as beer and wine. An alternative would be to develop S. cerevisiae strains that produce extracellular polysaccharidases, enabling the yeast to degrade polysaccharides without the addition of commercial enzyme preparations. These strains can also be very useful in improving the quality of wine, as well as cutting the costs of the winemaking process. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of two transformed S. cerevisiae strains on different wine grape varieties. The following genes have been cloned and characterised previously: the Aspergillus niger endo-p-xylanase gene (xynC), the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-| 3 - 1. 4 -glucanase gene (endl), the Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase gene (pelE) and the Erwinia carotovora polygalacturonase gene (p e h l). The yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I gene promoter (ADH 1 p), the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene terminator (ADH 2 j), the tryptophan synthase gene terminator (TRP 5 r) and the yeast mating-type pheromone a-factor secretion signal sequence (MFcrfs) were used to compile the following gene constructs: ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-end 1 -TRP 5 r (designated END 1), A DH 1 p-xyn C-A DH 2 T (designated XYN 4), ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-peh 1 -TRP 5 t (designated PEH 1) and ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-pelE-TRP 5 r (designated PELE). Two yeast integrating plasmids were constructed, one containing the END 1 and XYN 4 gene cassettes and the other containing the PEH 1 -PELE cassette. These two plasmids were then integrated into the URA 3 locus of two separate industrial wine yeast strains of S. cerevisiae. To facilitate selection of the industrial yeast transformants in the absence of auxotrophic markers, the integrating plasmid containing the END 1 and XYN 4 gene cassettes was issued with the dominant selectable Geneticin G 418 -resistance G f) marker. The integrating plasmid harbouring the PEH 1 -PELE gene cassette was issued with the dominant selectable sulphumetronmethyl resistance (SMR 1) marker. The introduction of these plasmids into commercial wine yeast strains directed the synthesis of END 1, XYN 4, PELE and PEFI 1 transcripts and the production of extracellular biologically active endo-P- 1, 4 - glucanase, endo-(3 -xylanase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase. These recombinant yeasts were capable of extracting more colour from grape skins of certain varieties, as well as leading to more freeflow wine as a result of the more effective degradation of glucans, xylans and pectins in the skins. They also led to decreased turbidity in the wine, making it more filterable. Future work will entail further investigation of the effects of these recombinant yeasts on different white and red wine grape varieties. Another objective of this study was to screen non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts for the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. The reason for this part of the thesis was to determine the types of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that are produced and to determine which genera produce which kinds of extracellular enzymes. A total of 237 yeast isolates, belonging to the genera Kloeckera, Candida, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora and Kluyveromyces, were screened for the production of extracellular pectinases, proteases, (3 -glucanases, lichenases, p-glucosidases, cellulases, xylanases, amylases and sulphite reductase activity. These yeasts were all isolated from grapes and clarified grape juice to ensure that they were yeasts found in must during the initial stages of fermentation. This information can be used to pave the way to pinpoint the specific effects in wine of these enzymes produced by the so-called wild yeasts associated with grape must. This information can also be used to transform Saccharomyces wine yeasts with some of the genes from these non-Saccharomyces yeasts for the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. However, future research will have to be done to determine the extent of the activity of these enzymes in wine fermentations and to obtain better knowledge of the physiological and metabolical features of non-Saccharomyces yeasts. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Sellulose is verreweg die volopste koolhidraat in plantbiomassa. Hierdie biopolimere is dus ‘n baie belangrike hernubare bron van voedsel, brandstof en chemikaliee. Sellulose is in 'n matriks van hemisellulose, lignien en pektien gebed en is uit herhaalde glukose eenhede, wat deur middel van (3 - 1, 4 -glukosidiese bindings geheg is, saamgestel. Die individuele molekules word deur waterstofbindings aan mekaar geheg, wat aanleiding gee tot die vorming van kristallyne vesels. Die hemisellulose, wat 'n lae molekulere gewig heteropolisakkaried is, bedek en bind die sellulose vesels en verhoed daarmee die vorming van vesels wat te kristallyn is. Drie predominante tipes hemisellulose word herken en sluit 1, 3 - en 1, 4 -p-D-galaktane, 1, 4 -p-D-mannane en 1, 4 -p-D-xylane in, wat vernoem word volgens die suikereenhede wat die polimeerruggraat vorm. Pektiene bestaan uit 'n rhamnogalakturonaanruggraat waarin 1, 4 -gekoppelde a-D-galakturonaankettings periodiek met a-L-rhamnopiranosiel residue, bevattende neutrale sykettings, onderbreek word. Twee groepe ensieme, nl. pektinase en sellulase, word deur mikrobes vir die benutting van kristallyne pektinase en sellulase vereis. Sellulase is multikomponent komplekse wat dikwels uit endoglukanase, ekso-glukanase en sellobiase saamgestel is. Sellobiose is die hoof eindproduk van die saamgestelde aktiwiteit tussen endoglukanase en ekso-glukanase en word verder gehidroliseer tot glukose deur | 3 -glukosidases. Die ensimatiese afbraak van pektien polimere vind deur die de-esterifiserings aksie van die versepings ensiem, pektienesterase, plaas. Dit lei tot die vrystelling van die metielgroepe van die pektienmolekuul. Deur die hidrolase of liase aksie van die depolimerase (pektien liase, pektaatliase en poligalakturonase), <b>split</b> <b>die</b> a- 1, 4 -glukosidiese verbindings in die poligalakturonaatketting. Die gis Saccharomyces cerevisiae word al vir jare ekstensief in die alkoholbedryf vir die fermentasie van verskeie produkte, veral druiwe, gebruik. S. cerevisiae besit egter nie die vermoe om ekstrasellulere depolimiserende ensieme wat vir die effektiewe degradasie van polisakkariede verantwoordelik is, te produseer nie, wat die hoof oorsaak van die verhelderings- en filtreringsprobleme in onder andere wyn en bier is. Dit veroorsaak ook dat S. cerevisiae nie oor die vermoe beskik om waasvormende polisakkariede in wyn te degradeer nie. Tans word ensiempreparate in die alkoholiese bedryf vir die degradasie van die probleem polisakkariede gebruik. Sodoende word die filtreerbaarheid en kwaliteit van wyn en bier verbeter. ‘n Goeie alternatief is die ontwikkeling van S. cerevisiae-rasse wat oor die vermoe beskik om ekstrasellulere polisakkarase te produseer en dus polisakkariede self sonder die byvoeging van eksterne kommersiele ensiempreparate te degradeer. Hierdie rasse sal baie voordelig wees vir die verbetering van wynkwaliteit, sowel as vir die vermindering van die kostes verbonde aan die wynmaakproses. Die objektief van hierdie studie is dus om die uitwerking van twee getransformeerde S. cerevisiae rasse, wat ekstrasellulere polisakkarases produseer, op verskillende wyndruifvarieteite na te vors. Die volgende gene is reeds voorheen gekloneer en gekarakteriseer: die endo-pxylanase- geen (xynC) van Aspergillus niger, die endo-p- 1, 4 -glukanase-geen (endl) van Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, die pektaatliase-geen (pe/E) van Erwinia chrysanthemi en die poligalakturonase-geen (p e h l) van Erwinia carotovora. Die alkoholdehidrogenase-geenpromotor (ADH 1 P), die alkoholdehidrogenase IIgeentermineerder (ADH 2 T), die gistriptofaansintase geen se termineerder (TRP 5 t) en die sekresiesein van die gisferomoon a-faktor (MFa 1 s) is gebruik om die volgende geenkonstrukte saam te stel: ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-end 1 -TRP 5 t (toekend as END 1), ADH 1 p-xynC-ADH 2 T (bekend as XYN 4), ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-peh 1 -TRP 5 T fbekend as PEH 1), and ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-pelE-TRP 5 T (bekend as PELE). Twee gisintegrerings plasmiede is gekonstrueer, een wat die END 1 - en XYN 4 - geenkassette bevat en die ander wat die PEH 1 -PELE-kasset besit. Hierdie twee plasmiede is daarna in twee aparte industriele wyngisrasse van S. cerevisiae by die URA 3 lokus geintegreer. Vir die seleksie van die industriele wyngistransformante in die afwesigheid van ouksotrofiese merkers, is die dominante selekteerbare Geneticin G 418 weerstandbiedende (G f) merker in die END 1 - en XYA/ 4 -geenkassetbevattende plasmied geintegreer. Die dominante selekteerbare sulfumetronmetielweerstandbiedende (SMR 1) merker is in die integreringsplasmied, wat die PEH 1 - PELE-geenkasset bevat, geintegreer vir seleksie. Transformasie van hierdie plasmiede in kommersiele wyngisrasse het tot die direkte sintese van die END 1 -, XYN 4 -, PELE- en PEH 1 -transkripte aanleiding gegee, sowel as tot die produksie van die biologies aktiewe ekstrasellulere endo-P- 1, 4 -glukanase, endo-P-xylanase, pektaatliase en poligalaturonase. Tydens die wynmaakproses het bogenoemde rekombinante giste aanleiding gegee tot verhoogde kleurekstraksie uit die druifdoppe van sekere varieteite, asook tot verhoogde vryvloei wyn. Dit is verkry deur die effektiewe degradasie van die glukane, xilane en pektiene in die doppe. Die rekombinante giste het ook verlaagde turbiditeit in die wyn tot gevolg gehad, wat die wyne makliker filtreerbaar maak. Hierdie werk was net die eerste stap. In die toekoms sal verdere navorsing gedoen moet word om die presiese effekte van hierdie rekombinante giste op verskillende rooi en wit druifvarieteite te bepaal. ‘n Ander fokus van hierdie tesis was om nie-Saccharomyces wyngiste vir die produksie van ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme te selekteer. Die rede hiervoor is om te bepaal watter tipes ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme geproduseer word, asook watter ensieme deur watter genera geproduseer word, ‘n Totaal van 237 gisisolate wat tot die generas Kloeckera, Candida, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora en Kluyveromyces behoort, is vir die produksie van ekstrasellulere pektinase, protease, p-glukanase, lichenase, p-glukosidase, sellulase, xilanase, amilase en sulfiet reduktase-aktiwiteit getoets. Hierdie giste is almal vanaf druiwe en druiwesap geVsoleer om te verseker dat dit wel giste is wat gedurende die beginfases van fermentasie in die mos teenwoordig is. Hierdie inligting kan nou verder gebruik word om die spesifieke effekte wat hierdie ensieme, wat deur die sogenaamde wilde giste geproduseer word, tydens die beginfases van fermentasies op die mos het, te bepaal. Hierdie inligting kan ook in die toekoms gebruik word om Saccharomyces-wyngiste met gene van die ri-Saccharomycesgiste te transformeer om ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme vir die degradasie van die problematiese polisakkariede in wyn te produseer. Daar sal egter in die toekoms baie navorsing gedoen moet word om die omvang van hierdie ensiemaktiwiteite in wynfermentasies te bepaal, asook om meer kennis te bekom oor die fisiologiese en metaboliese samestelling van nie-Saccfraromyces wyngiste...|$|E

In the next part of the thesis there are suggested various trends of innovation accomplished by means of both new technologies and modified or adapted solutions: - improvement on accuracy of free forging - automation of free forging - adjustable swages and liners - adjustable <b>split</b> <b>dies</b> These innovations are compared from the point of suitability for technical realisation, adaptability towards production program and other factorsAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R

He also became indoor champion in 1987.He {{is the actual}} Croatian high jump record holder (senior 228, junior 218cm and indoor senior 228cm) as he competed for Croatian AC Slavonija Osijek.His personal best jump was 2.28 metres, achieved in July 1985 in <b>Split.</b> He <b>died</b> in July 1993 in Knin as a soldier of the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina.|$|R
40|$|In drop forging, {{the main}} {{requirements}} consist {{in the production}} of workpieces with pronounced straight or curved main axis while simultaneously maintaining a large variety of forms. The main customer of these drop-forged pieces is the vehicle manufacturing industry with dynamically high-stressed parts used for drives and undercarriages. The optimization of processes and systems for continuous forging process sequences for oblong workpieces with high dimensional and weight accuracies is represented in the form of realized process solutions. Focus is placed on the possible linking of cross-rolling on round- and flat-jaw cross-rolling machines as preforming and finished forming during the production of drop-forged parts and in the optimization of tool technology for the processing steps of drop forging on hammers and presses. Selected application cases are the production of vehicle gear shafts by cross-rolling, the low-flash drop forging of accurately weighted connecting rods and the opt imization of intermediate forms for drop forging light metals by means of cross-rolling. In addition, control optimization of tool-forming machine-systems in the process step of finish forming, the use of prestressed <b>split</b> <b>dies</b> and the use of optimized system solutions for high speed tool changes all represent possibilities for increasing finished form accuracy of forged parts...|$|R

50|$|With {{no direct}} heir to succeed him, Stephen II (reigned 1089-1091) {{of the main}} Trpimirović line came to the throne at an old age. Stephen II {{was to be the}} last King of the House of Trpimirović. His rule was {{relatively}} ineffectual and lasted less than two years. He spent most of this time in the tranquility of the monastery of Sv. Stjepan pod Borovima (St. Stephen beneath the Pines) near <b>Split.</b> He <b>died</b> at the beginning of 1091, without leaving an heir. Since there was no living male member of the House of Trpimirović, civil war and unrest broke out shortly afterward.|$|R
