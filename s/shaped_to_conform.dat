25|$|With {{the firm}} {{guidance}} of 'ulema', the diverse native traditions were transformed to a uniform mold that crossed borders and customs. The original diverse traditions were consistently <b>shaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> to specific norms {{embedded in the}} Islamic law. One notable exception in the Turco-Persian tradition was the attitude to the women. The original attitude of respect to the mothers, and protection of the sisters and daughters overcame the tenets imposed by the new religion, and survived as an inherent component of the learned new society. The idea of slaughtering mothers and daughters, incessantly proclaimed from the pulpits, remained a call for action, but not the action in the majority sphere of the Turco-Persian tradition. While {{the best of the}} Turco-Persian literature is venerated and admired, the respect for the women and the old traditions of equality generally survived to the present times, except for the areas where the Arab Islamic tradition managed to entirely replace the original native traditions. The early Turkish Muslims accepted and embraced the pre-Islamic traditions and combined them with their own in a form of Sufi mysticism. Less prominent were the strict Islamic law (Sharia) and concept of waging violent external jihad against nonbelievers. Instead, as Islam was diffused into the Turkic world through Persian Sufi influences, it sought to establish a commonality of belief with the indigenous religious practices. Despite a myriad of attempts to curb it, Sufism has survived in the Turkic zone as an underlying institution of revival and alternative thinking throughout the centuries.|$|E

50|$|The {{blade of}} each forceps branch is the curved portion {{that is used}} to grasp the fetal head. The forceps should {{surround}} the fetal head firmly, but not tightly. The blade characteristically has two curves, the cephalic and the pelvic curves. The cephalic curve is <b>shaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> to the fetal head. The cephalic curve can be rounded or rather elongated depending on the shape of the fetal head. The pelvic curve is <b>shaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> to the birth canal and helps direct the force of the traction under the pubic bone. Forceps used for rotation of the fetal head should have almost no pelvic curve.|$|E
50|$|Isaac Babbitt {{was issued}} the first patent for an alloy that was {{excellent}} for making bearings. The word Babbitt {{has been applied}} to many alloys involving similar substituents. Babbitts easily change their <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> bearing shafts and will retain a lubricated surface film. Particulate matter not transported away by the lubricant is embedded harmlessly in the sub-surface. This is due to its hard/soft composition. Babbitts high in tin content, consist of a relatively soft, solid matrix of tin in which are distributed hard copper-tin and tin-antimony cuboids. Babbits are often employed as a thin surface coating to obtain the advantage of their good rubbing characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Types of thongs {{include the}} {{traditional}} thong, the G-string, and the C-string. There {{are a number}} of intermediate kinds of thongs between full rear coverage and a string rear. As designs become more risqué there are also types intended to expose genitals as much as they conceal them. Other styles include the Cheeky, V-string, and T-back. The naming of the intermediate styles of thong is debatable, different vendors use the words somewhat interchangeably. Thongs are available {{in a wide variety of}} materials, including silk, latex, cotton, microfiber, satin, nylon, and lycra/spandex. There are also novelty designs for both sexes, featuring <b>shapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the genitals or provide humorous visual effects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The “discriminative {{direction}} ” {{has been}} proven useful to reveal the subtle difference between two anatomical shape classes. When a shape moves along this direction, its deformation will best manifest the class difference detected by a kernel classifier. However, we observe that such a direction cannot maintain a shape’s “anatomical ” correctness, introducing spurious difference. To overcome this drawback, we develop a regularized discriminative direction by requiring a <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> its population distribution when it deforms along the discriminative direction. Instead of iterative optimization, an analytic solution is provided to directly work out this direction. Experimental study shows its superior performance in detecting and localizing the difference of hippocampal shapes for sex. The result is supported by other independent research in the same domain. ...|$|R

5000|$|Traditional mosaics have {{a history}} dating back to at least the fourth century BC, and employ a variety of methodologies to create their images. However, {{traditional}} mosaics share the common feature of employing small, uniformly colored materials (tesserae) to create a pattern or picture. Because the tiles can be cut into irregular <b>shapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the base pattern, mosaisists are able to create works of astonishing detail and color. [...] Alternatively, pixel tile mosaics, such as those found {{on the floor of}} the University of Toronto pool, employ standard sized tiles (generally 1 x 1 or 2 by 2 inch) in a variety of colors arranged in a uniform matrix. Each tile is a different color and represents a single 'pixel' in the final image. The resulting mosaic is typically coarse and of very low resolution.|$|R

5000|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a prototypical lens {{dating back to}} the early 1880s. Originally these lenses were {{designed}} by using a substance to take a mold of the eye. Lenses would then be <b>shaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> to the mould, initially using blown glass and then ground glass in the 1920s and polymethyl methacrylate in the 1940s.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{microstrip}} antenna is the patch antenna. Antennas using patches as constitutive elements in an array are also possible. A patch antenna is a narrowband, wide-beam antenna fabricated by etching the antenna element pattern in metal trace bonded to an insulating dielectric substrate, such as a printed circuit board, with a continuous metal layer bonded to {{the opposite side of the}} substrate which forms a ground plane. Common microstrip antenna shapes are square, rectangular, circular and elliptical, but any continuous shape is possible. Some patch antennas do not use a dielectric substrate and instead are made of a metal patch mounted above a ground plane using dielectric spacers; the resulting structure is less rugged but has a wider bandwidth. Because such antennas have a very low profile, are mechanically rugged and can be <b>shaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> to the curving skin of a vehicle, they are often mounted on the exterior of aircraft and spacecraft, or are incorporated into mobile radio communications devices.|$|E

[...] These were on the lower decks {{at either end of}} the ship. Single men were housed in the bow while single women were accommodated in the stern section, with families occupying larger cabins. Cabins were spacious by the standards of the time but often irregularly <b>shaped,</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> with the curvature of the ship's stern and bow sections. Third-Class cabins were very similar to Second-Class ones in price and appearance; the only major differences were the lack of a wardrobe and a different style of washbasin. They were paneled in white-painted pine with linoleum floors, furnished with plumbed-in washbasins, mattresses and White Star bed linens (the only exception was single men, who were provided with only straw-stuffed mattresses and a blanket). In contrast to First and Second-Class, there were only two baths to serve the more than 700 steerage passengers on board at any one time.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} two major trends in the {{changing}} status of pet dogs.

40|$|We {{present a}} deformation-driven {{approach}} to topology-varying 3 D shape correspondence. In this paradigm, the best correspondence between two shapes {{is the one}} that results in a minimal-energy, pos-sibly topology-varying, deformation that transforms one <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the other while respecting the correspondence. Our de-formation model, called GeoTopo transform, allows both geometric and topological operations such as part split, duplication, and merg-ing, leading to fine-grained and piecewise continuous correspon-dence results. The key ingredient of our correspondence scheme is a deformation energy that penalizes geometric distortion, en-courages structure preservation, and simultaneously allows topol-ogy changes. This is accomplished by connecting shape parts using structural rods, which behave similarly to virtual springs but simul-taneously allow the encoding of energies arising from geometric, structural, and topological shape variations. Driven by the com-bined deformation energy, an optimal shape correspondence is ob-tained via a pruned beam search. We demonstrate our deformation-driven correspondence scheme on extensive sets of man-made mod-els with rich geometric and topological variation and compare the results to state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R
5000|$|Water {{absorbing}} waterballs or technically [...] "waterbags", on {{the other}} hand, are designed for water and density exchange. Water freely permeates the whole ball, adding more weight and dynamic fluid density. The added weight makes this type of waterball skip and roll on water, rather than bounce. As a result, water absorbing high performance waterballs travel shorter distances than sealed waterballs but they are easier to control and play with both in long and short range.A waterbag exchanges its fluid density and transforms and conforms its shape and fluid contents on impact with a surface or plain. On impact with a surface such as water, the waterbag dissipates its energy dynamically as it interacts with the water surface exchanging fluid contents. This changes and balances the bag's density, mass and <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the water or surface it is performing on as it loses its velocity and comes to rest.|$|R

40|$|Identifying {{the shape}} {{difference}} between {{two groups of}} anatomical objects is important for medical image analysis and computer-aided diagnosis. A method called ldquodiscriminative directionrdquo in the literature has been proposed to solve this problem. In that method, the shape difference between groups is identified by deforming a shape along the discriminative direction. This paper conducts a thorough study about inferring this discriminative direction in an efficient and accurate way. First, finding the discriminative direction is reformulated as a preimage problem in kernel-based learning. This provides a complementary but conceptually simpler solution than the previous method. More importantly, we find that a shape deforming along the original discriminative direction cannot faithfully maintain its anatomical correctness. This unnecessarily introduces spurious shape differences and leads to inaccurate analysis. To overcome this problem, this paper further proposes a regularized discriminative direction by requiring a <b>shape</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> its underlying distribution when it deforms. Two different approaches are developed to impose the regularization, one {{from the perspective of}} probability distributions and the other from a geometric point of view, and their relationship is discussed. After verifying their superior performance through controlled experiments, we apply the proposed methods to detecting and localizing the hippocampal shape difference between sexes. We get results consistent with other independent research, providing a more compact representation of the shape difference compared with the established discriminative direction method...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} on the numerical analysis of electromagnetic fields with the finite difference method. Simple and fast approximative techniques are studied and developed for the estimation of the electromagnetic properties of various structures. Especially, techniques which preserve the simplicity of a structured lattice are explored. The emphasis in the thesis is put more into the rapid estimations than into the absolute accuracy of the studied parameters. Another goal is to give information about {{the characteristics of the}} studied structures: filters, dielectric mixtures and frequency selective surfaces. Filter structures are analysed with the finite-difference time-domain method. A simple trick is introduced to transform the curved shapes in a certain practical filter configuration into rectangular <b>shapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the finite-difference computation lattice. Procedures which use finite difference methods to analyse dielectric mixtures are introduced. They are applied to calculate effective permittivities of two-phase random mixtures. The results are compared with theoretical mixing models with a conclusion that none of them agrees with the numerical results in the whole range of volume fraction. Therefore, a new empirical mixing model is created based on the numerical results. Polarisation transformation properties of frequency selective surfaces are also studied and some wide-band polariser structures are presented. It is shown how one-dimensional array models can give a good starting point for a two-dimensional array design. reviewe...|$|R

This paper presents a method of designing the millimeter-wave microstrip antenna which could be use in government and commercial applications, such as mobile radio and wireless communications that have similar specifications. The designed antenna can achieve triple band performance to simultaneously cover the 1. 18 GHz, 2. 42 GHz and 4. 05 GHz frequency with return loss of- 12. 50 dB,- 12. 60 dB and- 15. 50 dB respectively. The simulation results of the designed triple band E-shaped Microstrip Patch Antenna were also presented. The antenna is of low profile, conformable to planar surfaces, simple and inexpensive to manufacture using modern printed-circuit technology. It was proved that the designed antenna is feasible and realizable.

Each sensing element and corresponding reflecting element are electrically driven in phase, and the capacitance between the sensing elements individually and the sensed object is determined using circuitry known to the art. The reflector may be shaped to shield the sensor and to shape its field of view, in effect providing an electrostatic lensing effect.
