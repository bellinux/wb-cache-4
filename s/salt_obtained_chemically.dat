40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for the intramitochondrial localization of various diphosphopyridine nucleotide and triphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenases in tissue sections. The cytochemical reactions studied involve the oxidation of the substrates by a specific pyridino-protein. The electron transfer of tetrazolium salt is {{mediated by the}} diaphorase system associated with the dehydrogenase. The final electron acceptor was either p-nitrophenyl substituted ditetrazole (nitro-BT) or N-thiazol- 2 -yl monotetrazole (MTT), the latter giving rise to metal formazan {{in the presence of}} cobaltous ions. Mitochondrial localization of the formazan precipitate could be achieved by using hypertonic incubating media containing high concentrations of substrate and co-enzyme. A fast reduction of tetrazolium <b>salt</b> was <b>obtained</b> by <b>chemically</b> blocking the respiratory chain enzymes beyond the flavoproteins. Although diaphorase systems are implicated in the reduction of tetrazolium salts, specific dehydrogenases are solely responsible for the distinct distribution pattern obtained in tissues with various substrates. The present findings in tissue sections are discussed in conjunction with existing biochemical evidence from differential centrifugation experiments...|$|R

The polymer {{obtained from the}} electrode surface was converted to PPV by the thermal elimination of diethyl sulde, HCl and ethyl sulde.

The doping eect on the conductivity of the PPV was investigated by using dierent agents such as H 2 SO 4, I 2 and metallic Na. It was concluded from the results of spectroscopical investigations that trans-vinylene units are formed on the backbones of polymers obtained by both chemical and electrochemical methods. Thermal analysis data conrmed that the thermal elimination of diethyl sulde from the polymers obtained by electrochemical and chemical methods are almost complete, and therefore, the resultant product is PPV. It was evident from the TGA results that the polymer <b>obtained</b> <b>chemically</b> had a thermal stability higher than the electrochemically prepared polymer.
