Cisco uses a metric like 108/bandwidth (the reference value, 108 by default, can be adjusted). So, a 100Mbit/s link will have a cost of 1, a 10Mbit/s a cost of 10 and so on. But for links faster than 100Mbit/s, the cost would be <1.|$|E

[...] It is, however, still perfectly possible for the low frequency impedance to actually be lower than the nominal impedance.

The encyclical, condemning the view that [...] "exalts race, or the people, or the State, or a particular form of State ... above their <b>standard</b> <b>value</b> and divinizes them to an idolatrous level", was written in German instead of Latin and read in German churches on Palm Sunday 1937.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{systems for}} the {{measurement}} of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the British Gravitational System (BG) proposed by Arthur Mason Worthington and the English Engineering System (EE). Both systems depend on the gravitational acceleration, and use the pound-force as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying Newton's laws of motion. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a base unit while the slug is a derived unit of inertia (rather than mass). On the other hand, the EE system uses a non-coherent approach and introduce the acceleration due to gravity (g) into its equations. [...] Both these approaches led to slight variations in {{the meaning of the}} pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) {{in different parts of the}} world. [...] Various countries published standard values that should be used for g and in 1901 the CGPM published a <b>standard</b> <b>value</b> for g that should be used in the [...] "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665m/s2 (32.174ft/s2) which is equal to the value of g at 45° latitude.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experimental}} determination {{has been made}} in vacuum. However, the vacuum we know is not the only possible vacuum which can exist. The vacuum has energy associated with it, called simply the vacuum energy, which could perhaps be altered in certain cases. When vacuum energy is lowered, light itself has been predicted to go faster than the <b>standard</b> <b>value</b> c. This is known as the Scharnhorst effect. Such a vacuum can be produced by bringing two perfectly smooth metal plates together at near atomic diameter spacing. It is called a Casimir vacuum. Calculations imply that light will go faster in such a vacuum by a minuscule amount: a photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 1036. Accordingly, there has as yet been no experimental verification of the prediction. A recent analysis argued that the Scharnhorst effect cannot be used to send information backwards in time with a single set of plates since the plates' rest frame would define a [...] "preferred frame" [...] for FTL signalling. However, with multiple pairs of plates in motion relative to one another the authors noted that they had no arguments that could [...] "guarantee the total absence of causality violations", and invoked Hawking's speculative chronology protection conjecture which suggests that feedback loops of virtual particles would create [...] "uncontrollable singularities in the renormalized quantum stress-energy" [...] on the boundary of any potential time machine, and thus would require a theory of quantum gravity to fully analyze. Other authors argue that Scharnhorst's original analysis, which seemed to show the possibility of faster-than-c signals, involved approximations which may be incorrect, so that {{it is not clear whether}} this effect could actually increase signal speed at all.|$|E

Recently, 235 U fission cross-section measurements have been performed at the CERN Neutron Time-of-Flight facility (TOF), known as n_TOF, in the energy range from 0. 7 [*]eV to 10 [*]keV. The data were normalized according to the recommended standard of the fission integral in the energy range 7. 8 [*]eV to 11 [*]eV. As a result, the n_TOF averaged fission cross sections above 100 [*]eV are in good agreement with the <b>standard</b> recommended <b>values.</b> The n_TOF data were included in the 235 U resonance analysis that was performed with the code SAMMY. In addition to the average <b>standard</b> <b>values</b> related to the fission cross section, <b>standard</b> thermal <b>values</b> for fission, capture, and elastic cross sections were also included in the evaluation.
