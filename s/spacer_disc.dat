40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} due to {{degenerative}} lumbar spine {{is one of}} the most common presenting complaints in out-patient and orthopaedic clinics. While most cases usually resolve in few weeks, 2 % of them develop radiculopathy and need further radiological investigations. Regardless of age and occupation of patients, back pain is a common cause of disability and gives a great personal and social impact to the individual and families, and economic burden to the society. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for investigation of degenerative disc disease for its superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar imaging capability and non-ionizing property. Changes of degenerative intervertebral discs are well-demonstrated. Disc herniations, thickened ligamentum flavum and osteophytosis cause narrowing of neuroforamina, and further compromise the spinal cord and exiting nerve roots. Therefore, MRI is valuable to determine the degree of stenosis and level of compression, and hence, used as a guide to aid plan of surgical decompression. Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) {{is one of the}} surgical technique of nerve root decompression using posterior approach. In PLIF procedure, incision is made at midline at the back. This is followed by laminectomy to gain access to the intervertebral disc space. Discectomy is then performed and disc materials are replaced with <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> to restore <b>disc</b> height. It was postulated that PLIF procedure is able to restore foraminal height and therefore relieved nerve root compression without foraminotomy. Objectives: To study the improvement of exit foramina and lateral recess stenosis in patients with back pain who underwent Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF), using MRI as diagnostic tool, to correlate the MRI findings with clinical symptoms and to determine whether <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height is a good predictor for improvement of lateral recess and exit foramina. Methodology: It is a cross-sectional, observational study of patients with back pain due to degenerative disc disease who underwent Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) in Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II from June 2007 till June 2010. Patients’ clinical symptoms were assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) pre- and postprocedure. MRI lumbosacral pre and post PLIF were analysed in axial and sagittal views. The depth of the lateral recess and exit foramina were measured at mid zone, exit zone and far lateral zone, and compared pre and post PLIF. The height of the <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> was measured at mid sagittal views. Mean difference of lateral recess and exit foramina size before and after procedure were analysed using paired t-test, and correlated with ODI score using Pearson’s correlation test. Correlation test was also used to determine whether <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height is a good predictor for improvement of lateral recess and exit foramina size. Results: From 39 patients underwent PLIF in Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II, 25 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria with 43 lumbar segments available for analysis. Increment of lateral recess and exit foramina measurements post PLIF were observed at all levels which was statistically significant (p 0. 05). It was also noted that the height of the <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> was not a predictor for increment of exit foramen (p> 0. 05) Conclusion: Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion is proven to restore depth of lateral recess and exit foramen. Patients underwent PLIF had significant good surgical outcome. The difference of <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height used in the procedure did not determine the increment of exit foramina. Therefore, current practice of using <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> height according to adjacent disc height is an acceptable method...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: According to {{anterior}} spine fusion intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> made of titanium or cobalt-chromium al-loys are {{of special}} interest. With regard to postoperative problems implant related artifacts {{can lead to}} a decreased MRI evaluation. The focus {{of this study was to}} compare the respective implant artifact artifact range dependend on different MRI sequences. To simplify artifact evaluation we introduced in this study a new developed 0 - 1 - 2 score. Material and Methods: We performed an MRI artifact evaluation of 2 different metallic intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> (cobalt-chromium and titanium alloy). A carcass porcine spine was employed. Considering 12 defined spinal regions of interest we evaluated the respective implant artifact properties independent from the total artifact volume by using a new developed 0 - 1 - 2 score. The artifact range was documented for 15 different MRI-sequences. Results: For the titanium spacer as well as the cobalt-chromium-spacer an MRI evaluation of the implant/disc space situation could not be carried out. In contrast to the cobalt chromium spacer the titanium spacer allowed a good differentiation of the spinal canal opposite to the implant. Optimal MRI imaging results for both metallic intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> could be achieved considering TSE sequences. Conclusion: A comparison of these two metallic spacers showed in all examined sequences clear advantages in favour of the titanium spacer. The best MRI representation of both tested implants by reducing implant related artifacts could be achieved with fast spin echo (TSE-) sequences. In spite of the use of TSE sequences a variability of susceptibility artifacts has to be included with regard to implant shape and material. With regard to the results of this study the easy use of a new developed artifact score represented a useful help to compare implant related MRI artifact properties independent from the actual implant related total artifact volume...|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between the two styles is that single disc couplings cannot accommodate parallel misalignment due to the complex bending that would be required of the lone disc. Double disc styles allow the two discs to bend in opposite directions to better manage parallel offset. The discs are fastened to the hubs (and center <b>spacer</b> on double <b>disc</b> styles) with tight fitting pins that do not allow any play or backlash between the disc and the hubs. The discs can be bent easily and as a result, disc couplings have some of the lowest bearing loads available in a motion control coupling.|$|R
40|$|A case of late {{dislocation}} of a <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> L 5 /S 1 with perforation of the {{sigmoid colon}} and transanal passage 4  years after implantation is reported. The {{objective is to}} describe an uncommon complication of anterior endoscopic spondylodesis L 5 /S 1. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report on this rare complication. A 39 -year-old patient suffering from a spondylolisthesis L 5 /S 1 (Meyerding grade 2) with bilateral lysis L 5 was operated with posterior instrumentation L 5 /S 1 and anterior endoscopic insertion of two <b>disc</b> <b>spacers.</b> 4  years after surgery the patient noticed one of the spacers in the toilet. Radiographic examination of the colon with contrast dye revealed a perforation at the distal sigmoid colon. At the lumbosacral junction there was a bony defect {{at the site of the}} absent spacer and an anterior dislocation of the second spacer. A partial resection of the colon at the perforation site with end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The second spacer was removed, and the defect was packed with autologous cancellous bone and local antibiotics. The further course was uneventful. 2  weeks postoperatively the patient was discharged without signs of infection. The radiographic examination after 6  months showed healing of the bone graft with bony fusion L 5 /S 1. In case of incomplete or absent bony fusion the dislocation of intradiscal spacers may arise even years after the primary surgery. In consequence periodical radiographic examinations of spinal instrumentations are recommended until complete bony fusion occurred. Unclear abdominal symptoms following anterior spine surgery require immediate examination...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. This is a retrospective, {{sequential}} {{cohort study}} of 34 patients treated by anterior instrumented fusion with single solid rod, single screw constructs {{with at least}} 2 -year follow-up. Sixteen of the patients received structural grafts as interbody <b>spacers</b> in <b>disc</b> levels below T 12, while the other 18 patients received only morselized rib autograft. Objective. To determine if structural interbody grafts preserve sagittal alignment better than morselized rib autograft. of Background Data. Some {{studies have shown that}} structural grafts are more effective in preserving sagittal alignment, while others have found them to be no more effective than morselized rib graft. Methods. Anterior-posterior radiographs were measured for primary, secondary, and fractional Cobb curves, and C 7 -sacrum plumb lines. Lateral radiographs were measured for: T 5 -HIV (highest instrumented vertebrae), instrumented levels, LIV (lowest instrumented vertebrae) -S 1, T 12 -LIV, and T 12 -S 1 angles, C 7 -sacrum plumb lines, and LID-A (lowest instrumented disc-angle). Results. The increase in kyphosis from preoperative to follow-up radiographs of the angle between T 12 -LIV was significantly more for the patients with morselized rib graft compared with those with structural grafts, 9 ° and 1 °, respectively (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. The structural grafts placed in disc spaces below T 12 were able to maintain sagittal alignment over this region, while the spines that received only morselized rib graft collapsed into kyphosis.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} acidic functional monomers with different hydrophilicity and spacer carbon chain length {{on the degree of}} conversion (DC), wettability (contact angle), water sorption (WS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of experimental one-step self-etch adhesives (1 -SEAs). MethodsA series of standard resin blends was prepared with each formulation containing 15 mol% of each acidic monomer. The structural variations of the acidic monomers were MEP (spacer chain with 2 carbons), MDP (10 -carbons), MDDP (12 -carbons), MTEP (more hydrophilic polyether spacer) and CAP-P (intermediate hydrophilicity ester <b>spacer).</b> Dumbbell-shaped and <b>disc</b> specimens were prepared and tested for UTS and WS, respectively. DC was assessed by FTIR, while the wettability of each 1 -SEA was evaluated on glass slides and flat dentine surfaces. Results were analysed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p 0. 05). ConclusionAt similar molar percentage, different acidic functional monomers induced similar degree of conversion and different UTS when included in a 1 -SEA. However, the inclusion of highly hydrophilic monomer may increase the wettability on dentine and the WS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system for modelling and digital fabrication of discrete and functionally graded multi-material objects for biomedical applications. The MMVP system {{consists of a}} DMMVP module, an FGMVP module, and a virtual reality (VR) simulation module. The DMMVP module is used to model discrete multi-material (DMM) objects, while the FGMVP module is for functionally graded multi-material (FGM) objects. The VR simulation module integrates these two modules to perform digital fabrication of multi-material objects, which can be subsequently visualized and analyzed in a virtual environment to optimize MMLM processes for fabrication of product prototypes. Using the MMVP system, two biomedical objects, including a DMM human spine and an FGM intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spacer</b> are modelled and digitally fabricated for visualization and analysis in a VR environment. These studies show the MMVP system is a practical tool for modelling, visualization, and subsequent fabrication of biomedical objects of discrete and functionally graded multi-materials for biomedical applications. The system may be adapted to control MMLM machines with appropriate hardware for physical fabrication of biomedical objects...|$|R
40|$|The ventral {{cervical}} disectomie and fusion with autologeus {{bone graft}} for degenerative {{disease of the}} cervical spine often shows complications and pain at the donor graft site. For this reason more and more alternative fusion materials so called intervertebral cages are used. At this time {{the choice of the}} most valuable fusion material is in discussion {{because of a lack of}} studies about the comparison of different implants. Between 2000 and 2003 55 Patientens with degenerative disease of the cervical spine were treated with four different intervertebral implants at the Clinic of Neurosurgery, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Charité-Universitätsmedizin. The aim of this study is a radiological and clinical comparison of the used implants approximately 29 months after surgery. The Cespace Cage and the ABC-Plate from Aesculap were used in 10 cases, in 18 cases the Titanium Cespace Cage, in 8 cases the Titanium Mini <b>disc</b> <b>Spacer</b> from Ulrich Medizinsysteme, in 11 cases the PEEK Solis Cage from Stryker Spine and in 8 cases Palacos from Heraeus medical. In this evaluation we could show that all materials are effective and secure for cervical fusion, there was no significant difference between the used materials...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the water}} {{chemistry}} surveillance program for Multi Purpose Research Reactor (MPR) G. A. Siwabessy 30 MW, the effects of primary water on homogeny, galvanic and crevice corrosion have been studied using various coupons {{in order to better}} control the corrosion in the reactor system. [4, 5] The main objectives are to establish standard procedures for corrosion monitoring and surveillance, and provide technical guidelines for continued wet storage of spent fuels. After having defined the current water chemistry profile, experiments were conducted using the coupons made of the same grade materials as used for the construction of the fuel cladding (aluminium) and reactor tank (aluminium), and fuel storage racks (stainless steel). The test coupons were made of a series of discs (φ 95 mm with φ 15 mm centre hole; 1 mm thick for stainless steel and 5. 5 mm thick for aluminium) put together as an assembly using a stainless steel centre pin and insulated with a ceramic bushing and 5 mm thick <b>spacers</b> between the <b>discs.</b> The coupons are also assembled in two orientations to allow vertical and horizontal installations in the pool. The first batch of six coupon assemblies were strategically positioned in the service pool in January 2007 and are due to be withdrawn in stages for inspection after 1, 2, and 3 years of exposure.

40|$|Interbody <b>disc</b> <b>spacers</b> for {{anterior}} spine fusion {{are made}} of different materials, such as titanium alloys or carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Implant-related susceptibility artifacts can decrease the quality of MRI scans. This cadaveric study aimed to demonstrate the extent that implant-related MRI artifacting affects the post fusion differentiation of the spinal canal (SC) and intervertebral disc space (IDS). In 6 cadaveric porcine spines, we evaluated the post-im- plantation MRI scans of a titanium and CFRP spacer that differed in shape and surface qualities. A spacer made of human cortical bone {{was used as a}} control. A defined evaluation unit was divided into regions of interest (ROI) to characterize the SC and IDS. Considering 15 different MRI sequences read independently by an interobserver-validated team of specialists artifact-affected image quality of the median MRI slice was rated on a modified score of 0 - 1 - 2 - 3. A maximum score of 15 points for the SC and 9 points for the IDS (100 %) was possible. Turbo spin echo sequences produced the best scores for both spacers and the control. Only the control achieved a score of 100 %. For the IDS the titanium and CFRP spacer maximally scored 0 % and 74 %, for the SC 80 % and 99 %, respectively. By using favored T 1 TSE sequences the CFRP-spacer represented clear advantages in post fusion spinal imaging. Independent of artifact dimensions the used scoring system allowed us to create an implant-related ranking of MRI scan quality in reference to the bone control...|$|R
