50|$|UniKey {{first came}} to the public's {{attention}} in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank. UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show, including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary. Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show. By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital. That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and {{one of the largest in}} the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential <b>smart</b> <b>lock</b> using UniKey's technology.|$|E
50|$|Launched in 2013, Kēvo is {{the first}} Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open <b>smart</b> <b>lock.</b> Kēvo {{has the ability to}} detect a user's {{compatible}} smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone. In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone. A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.|$|E

40|$|Bike sharing systems {{facilitate}} {{and promote}} biking {{as a public}} transportation alternative, providing benefits {{to the health and}} the environment. Contemporary bike sharing systems are automated and robust, but still have drawbacks. These are, for example, dependence on immovable stations with limited capacity and availability of service, only present in selected cities. Moreover, currently there are no solutions for automated bike sharing for private and corporate use. In this thesis, we introduce a bike sharing system designed as a service for company employees. This system allows using the bikes for short trips or commuting. The focus of the thesis is on creating a <b>smart</b> bike <b>lock,</b> which is a device that enables automated bike access management. Currently, there are no <b>smart</b> bike <b>locks</b> available commercially off-the-shelf. However with our bike management system, relying on a custom-made <b>smart</b> bike <b>lock,</b> the companies can offer their employees shared bikes with minimal management effort. The system has been tested in a controlled environment, and the device has been evaluated. The results are positive: the device fulfils the core requirements of the system and can be used as part of the service. The current <b>smart</b> bike <b>lock</b> is still a prototype. Further work is necessary to improve the design and add features such as short range wireless...|$|R

40|$|Physical keys {{made from}} metal or woods {{have been used}} for centuries to operate locks. The {{routines}} for operating a lock did not change significantly by the time. Keys have been carried, stored, lost, searched, lent, and copied. The main intent of locking is making sure that the belongings are kept safe. Hence, security has always been main consideration. Although mechanical Lock Access Control Systems are easy and cost effective to implement, they are insecure and expensive to maintain. Traditional Digital Lock Access Control systems may decrease the problems of mechanical lock access control systems. However, they are still vulnerable to attacks and the costs are usually high. <b>Smart</b> <b>Lock</b> Access Control Systems decrease the security risks and costs caused by fetching, storing, and carrying the physical keys. They also enable distribution of access rights and monitoring activities online. <b>Smart</b> <b>lock</b> solutions are cost effective to implement since they use existing wireless Internet structure (such as home WiFi) and electric locks. A typical <b>Smart</b> <b>Lock</b> Access Control System includes three components: a lock controller which is a microcontroller for operating the electric lock, cloud servers for granting access to the users and monitor activities, and finally a mobile phone which is used as a gateway between the cloud servers and lock controller.

40|$|The {{idea behind}} the project {{is to create an}} Android {{application}} that allows users to control the locking system of a <b>smart</b> <b>lock</b> from their phone. Users who have a <b>smart</b> <b>lock</b> installed in their home have the power to lock and unlock their home from anywhere in the world. It uses your devices Wi-Fi/ 4 G to connect to your home Wi-Fi system which will then connect to the <b>smart</b> <b>lock.</b> This means you don’t have to carry around a set of keys all the time and eliminates the chances of arriving home and being locked out of your house if you lost your keys. You can’t always be at home so opening the lock from anywhere for kids, relatives, friends or cleaners if they don’t have keys or access to the house is appealing for many people. Some other features the application includes is granting or revoking other users access at any time and timed locking/unlocking. This is useful for users who want the locks for their house to automatically lock late in the evening as a safety feature in case they forget to lock the house before going to bed. The application provides resent activity logs to show users who has been entering their home and at what time. This app will give users more freedom and control over their own home allowing them to plan their day more freely. The application initially will only be available on android devices as it is created using Android Studio and is written in Java...|$|E

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} of the Internet of Things (IoT) and is used in many areas, such as mobile payments, public transportation, <b>smart</b> <b>lock,</b> and environment protection. However, the performance of RFID equipment can be easily affected by the surrounding environment, such as electronic productions and metal appliances. These can impose an impact on the RF signal, which makes the collection of RFID data unreliable. Usually, the unreliability of RFID source data includes three aspects: false negatives, false positives, and dirty data. False negatives are the key problem, as the probability of false positives and dirty data occurrence is relatively small. This paper proposes a novel sliding window cleaning algorithm called VSMURF, which is based on the traditional SMURF algorithm which combines the dynamic change of tags and the value analysis of confidence. Experimental results show that VSMURF algorithm performs better in most conditions and when the tag’s speed is low or high. In particular, if the velocity parameter is set to 2 [*]m/epoch, our proposed VSMURF algorithm performs better than SMURF. The results also show that VSMURF algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in solving the problem of false negatives for RFID networks...|$|E
