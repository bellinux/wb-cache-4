40|$|The {{structural}} system of wooden house by two-by-four method is widely adopted in any countries, and a various type of vibration control system for building structures {{has been developed}} on country with frequent earthquake. In this study, a vibration control device called "Scaling Frame" (SF) is suggested, and which is applied to wooden two-by-four method structures. This paper performs the experimental study to investigate the restoring force characteristics of two-by-four with <b>SF</b> <b>device</b> installed. The seismic resistant performance is estimated experimentally, and also the applicability and effectiveness are discussing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Decompressive {{craniectomy}} (DC) is {{a procedure}} performed increasingly often in current neurosurgical practice. Significant perioperative morbidity {{may be associated}} to this procedure {{because of the large}} skull defect; also, later closure of the skull defect (cranioplasty) may be associated to post-operative morbidity as much as any other reconstructive operation. The authors present a newly conceived/developed device: The "Skull Flap" (SF). This system, placed {{at the time of the}} craniectomy, offers the possibility to provide cranial reconstruction sparing patients a second operation. In other words, DC and cranioplasty essentially take place at the same time and in addition, patients retain their own bone flap. The current study conducted on animal models, represents the logical continuation of a prior recent study, realized on cadaver specimens, to assess the efficacy and safety of this recently developed device. Materials and Methods: This is an experimental pilot study on dogs to assess both safety and efficacy of the <b>SF</b> <b>device.</b> Two groups of experimental raised intracranial pressure animal models underwent DC; in the first group of dogs, the bone flap was left in raised position above the skull defect using the SF device; on the second group the flap was discarded. All dogs underwent transcranial Doppler (TCD) to assess brain perfusion. Head computed tomography (CT) scan to determine flap position was also obtained in the group in which the <b>SF</b> <b>device</b> was placed. Results: SF has proved to be a strong fixation device that allows satisfactory brain decompression by keeping the bone flap elevated from the swollen brain; later on, the SF allows cranial reconstruction in a simple way without requiring a second staged operation. In addition, it is relevant to note that brain perfusion was measured and found to be better in the group receiving the SF (while the flap being in a raised as well as in its natural position) comparing to the other group. Conclusion: The <b>SF</b> <b>device</b> has proved to be very easy to place, well-adaptable to a different type of flaps and ultimately very effective in maintaining satisfactory brain decompression and later on, making easy bone flap repositioning after brain swelling has subsided...|$|E
40|$|Background: Decompressive {{craniectomy}} (DC) is {{a procedure}} that is currently performed with increasing frequency. The reason is that its indications have become much broader. This procedure {{may be associated with}} the relevant morbidity in the postoperative stage due {{to the creation of a}} large bone defect. On the other hand, cranioplasty is associated too with some of the common complications related to any reconstructive head surgery. The authors present a newly developed device: The "Skull Flap" (SF). This new device allows the surgeon to complete a DC, yet providing at the same time a cranial reconstruction that will not require the patient to undergo a second reconstructive procedure. Materials and Methods: Different size and location craniectomies were carried out on four human cadaveric heads; the bone flaps were then repositioned in a more elevated position with respect to the skull edges. The flaps were placed at a distance of 12 and 15 mm from the skull edges using the SF system. Crash tests were conducted on each flap while in open and closed positions to assess its reliability and efficacy. Results: SF was shown to be a strong fixation device that allows satisfactory brain decompression by keeping the original bone flap away from the swollen brain; at the same time, in a later stage, it allows cranial reconstruction in a simple way. Conclusion: The <b>SF</b> <b>device</b> was shown to be very easy to use, adaptable, and practical to apply; thus, allowing both satisfactory brain decompression as well as bone flap repositioning at a later time after the brain swelling has subsided...|$|E
40|$|As {{switching}} {{occurs in}} power systems under high voltage and critical environmental conditions, high temperatures of gas insulated systems (GIS) are unavoidable. The early determination of such hot spots {{may help to}} prevent failure of these GIS due to loss of some insulation properties of the gas used. A novel laser based photoacoustic spectrometer (PA) has been developed for in-situ detection of SF 6 leaks in very low low concentrations (pptv). This newly developed <b>SF</b> 6 detection <b>device</b> utilizes a high quality factor resonant photoacoustic cell and continuous wave (CW) line tunable CO 2 laser at 10. 55 m wavelength. The PA system {{is equipped with a}} sound alarm system. Whenever SF 6 is detected an acoustic signal is generated and no signal appears from ambient air if there is no leakage of SF 6. A highly sensitive electret microphone has been used for the detection of these acoustic signal...|$|R
40|$|A novel photoacoustic {{spectrometer}} (PA) {{has been}} developed for in-situ detection of SF 6 leaks in low concentrations. The developed system {{is equipped with a}} sound alarm system and has been tested in the laboratory for very minute SF 6 leaks. This newly developed <b>SF</b> 6 detection <b>device</b> utilizes a high quality factor resonant photoacoustic cell and continuous wave (CW) line tunable CO 2 laser at 10. 55 m wavelength. Whenever SF 6 is detected an acoustic signal is generated and no signal appears from ambient air if there is no leakage of SF 6. An electret microphone is used for the detection of these acoustic signals. The system is capable of detecting leaks of the order of 3. 5 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) concentration. This device has been proved to have significant applications to industrial organizations that have electric power gas insulated systems (GIS). It could be also applied for other applications such as monitoring of environmental pollutants with minimal adjustment...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel psychophysical method for {{evaluating}} ultrasonography based on Real-Time Tomographic Reflection (RTTR), {{in comparison to}} Conventional Ultrasound (CUS). The method measures the user 2 ̆ 7 s perception of the location of an ultrasound-imaged target independently from assessing the action employed to reach it. Three experiments were conducted with the Sonic Flashlight (<b>SF),</b> an RTTR <b>device,</b> and CUS. The first two experiments determined subjects 2 ̆ 7 perception of target location with a triangulation-by-pointing task. Depth perception with the SF was comparable to direct vision, while CUS caused considerable underestimation of target depth. Binocular depth information in the SF was shown to significantly contribute to its superiority. The third experiment tested subjects in an ultrasound-guided needle insertion task. Because the SF provides visualization of the target at its actual location, subjects performed insertions faster and more accurately by using the SF rather than CUS. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed that insertions with the SF generally {{went directly to the}} target along the desired path, while CUS often led to a large deviation from the correct path consistent with the observed underestimation of target depth. These findings lend great promise to the use of RTTR-based imaging in clinical practice and provide precise means of assessing efficacy...|$|R
