40|$|Purpose. Experimental {{research}} of technical state change in metal-metal sealing units of pneumatic valve with two-positioned polarized electromagnetic drive. Design/methodology/approach. It {{has been shown}} that the work peculiarity of pneumatic valves with two-positioned electromagnetic drive and with metal-metal sealing is shock loads during its closure and opening. Such loads lead to intensive wearing process and increasing of gas leakage through the sealing units of different design and made of different materials. It has been experimentally confirmed, that the effective way of wear intensiveness decreasing in metal-metal sealing units is the use of special damping units in the valve Findings. As a result of experimental research it was concluded that including in the valve design of special damping device reduces the stress in the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> elements, which occurs in the sealing units elements during the valve closing, and, as a result, the wear intensiveness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> decreases. Usage of less wear-resisting, comparatively to the stainless steel 08 ? 18 ? 10 ? materials leads to the increase of wear intensiveness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> contact surfaces. Originality/value. Comparative analysis of the obtained experimental dependencies shows, that including of the damping device decreases the intensiveness of gas leakage increase through the closed valve, which occurs with the increase of the operational cycles. Damping element provides the kinetic energy dissipation that decreases the wear speed of the sealing surfaces of the valve slide and the saddle. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ????????. ????????????, ??? ???????????? ???????????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ????????, ??? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????. ???????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????...|$|E

This study area for this research is characterised by a regional anticline plunging to the east-south-east with large-scale internal architecture comprising transgressive, retrogradationally stacked stratigraphy that dips gently landward and is unconformably truncated by overlying sealing units. The primary reservoir/aquifer targets for CO₂ injection are palaeo-shoreline parallel nearshore sandstone bodies characterised by high porosity and permeability and good interconnectivity. The key regional <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> is the Lakes Entrance Formation, which consists of mudstone and marl capable of sealing large columns of CO₂.

30|$|Because of {{the high}} {{nonlinearity}} and superelasticity of rubber material (great deformation is obtained under a very little force), {{it is difficult to}} obtain a reasonable structure of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> by a theoretical calculation when designing packer rubber. In the analysis and calculation of rubber components, there are many constitutive models to describe the relationship between the stress tensor and strain tensor of the rubber materials, such as Mooney–Rivlin model, Yeoh model and Gent model. Different rubber constitutive models are suitable for different rubber materials. The Yeoh model can use the uniaxial tensile test to simulate the mechanical behavior of rubber materials under a large deformation, but it is not suitable for moderate and small deformations. The Gent model can simulate the strain energy of the rubber materials under a large deformation which is mainly applied to thin-walled spheres, hollow rubber and thin-walled cylindrical tubular bodies subjected to an internal pressure, but it is also not suitable for small and moderate deformations. The Mooney–Rivlin model can fit the relationship between the stress and strain of the incompressible rubber materials in moderate deformation. Therefore, the Mooney–Rivlin constitutive model is selected in this study.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. At {{the initial}} {{stage of the}} {{development}} process, the designer has to choose compromise options of the valve {{which are based on}} the requirements of the technical specifications. To ease his task we gave the necessary calculation methods of the valve parameters for the valves with flat sealing surfaces and sealing type metal-metal Design/methodology/approach. The modern design process dictates {{that it is necessary to}} generate a large number of variants of the proposed element to determine the best theoretical solution. However, the results of the processing, even a very large number of alternatives based on traditional approaches, cannot give to the designer an idea of the design possibilities. A complicating factor is the fact that the task of valve developing has conflicting requirements, so it is difficult to choose a justified compromise. The above given method allows to choose on the initial electromagnetic valve with metal on metal sealing design phase the parameters of the valve, which are depending on the characteristics of the working environment and the requirements of sealing. Findings. It is found that there is necessity of taking into consideration the effect of sealing surfaces sliding against each other when calculating the parameters of the valve. Originality/value. The above given method requires to be added with more types of valves with sealing type metal-to-metal.

40|$|AbstractExisting pilot, {{demonstration}} and commercial storage projects {{have demonstrated that}} CO 2 geological storage is technically feasible. However, these projects do not operate at a scale {{that is necessary to}} make a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The infrastructure for injecting carbon dioxide will need to be an order of magnitude larger than current CCS projects, at comparable size of existing petroleum installations. In most cases, the CO 2 injection scheme will consist of multiple wells, potentially including wells for monitoring and pressure control. Despite the advanced understanding of subsurface flow processes and development of modelling tools, there are still conflicting results in the literature on the estimation of pressure build-up, the resulting number of injection wells required for large-scale CO 2 geological storage and storage efficiency. For these issues, there {{do not appear to be}} any adequate analogues. As a result, studies on the regional impacts of CO 2 storage and the role of hydraulic properties of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> have been limited to more or less generic numerical modelling exercises. Since there are typically large uncertainties in model parameters, such as relative permeability, conclusions drawn from generic studies will have limited applicability until they can be tested against field data. Uncertainties in predicting reservoir properties and therefore in predicting injectivity will clearly affect the design and economics of the injection system. Potential trade-offs with respect to costs for transport and reservoir stimulation need consideration. Also, strategies and contingencies will need to be incorporated in development plans to allow for unforeseen changes in injection conditions during project life. Continuously updating reservoir models when new data become available and adapting injection strategies will be essential for the success of large-scale CO 2 geological storage...|$|E
40|$|The Bass Basin forms {{part of the}} Southern Margin Rift System that {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the initial separation of Australia and Antarctica. The structural history of the Bass Basin differs from that of a classic extensional basin in that it was influenced by two major rifting events, one associated with the opening of the Southern Ocean (Southern Ocean Rifting) and the other with the opening of the Tasman Sea (Tasman Rifting). The structure and stratigraphy of the basin reflect the impact of both rifting events. A revised model for the structural development of the Bass Basin is proposed. Four important periods of structural development within the basin are: ○ possible Barremian extension associated with the closing phases of Southern Ocean Rifting; ○ Turonian to Campanian extension associated with Tasman Rifting; ○ Campanian to Early Eocene transtensional (wrenchrelated) reactivation of Tasman rift structures, and ○ Middle Tertiary reactivation. Current geothermal gradients within the Bass Basin are high, ranging from 33 °C/km (Pelican- 2) to 65 °C/km (Konkon- 1). Comparison of maturity profiles based on one dimensional thermal modelling with measured maturity profiles indicates that the Late Cretaceous to Recent sequence is experiencing maximum temperatures. Uplift relating to Oligocene to Miocene reactivation is restricted to the northern region of the basin (e. g. Cormorant Trough). Oligocene-Miocene deformation within central and southern regions was restricted to strike-slip reactivation of deep-seated basement involved structures. Assuming constant heat flow based on present-day values, source-rich horizons from the L. balmei to M. diversus intervals within the central depocentre regions of the Cormorant, Yolla and Pelican Troughs appear to have entered the oil expulsion window after deposition of the regional <b>sealing</b> <b>unit,</b> the Demons Bluff Formation. These source- rich horizons continued to pass through the oil expulsion window during and after Oligocene-Miocene reactivation events. An understanding of early rift geometries and subsequent changes in basin architecture and thermal conditions is central to defining new play concepts in this comparatively under-explored basin...|$|E

40|$|Both {{panes of}} factory-sealed double-glazing units are {{susceptible}} to thermal breakage. The outer pane experiences large thermally induced stresses when solar radiation falls on the <b>sealed</b> <b>unit</b> in cool weather. The breakage potential is even greater for units with heat-absorbing or heat- reflecting glass in the outer pane than for units with a clear outer pane. The inner pane experiences a high thermal stress when the outdoor air temperature is very low and the unit is subjected to localized heating. The breakage potential of the inner pane is greater for heat-reflecting units with a low U-value than for clear, heat-absorbing, or high-emissivity heat-reflecting units. Measured and calculated values of thermal stress for inner and outer panes of <b>sealed</b> glazing <b>units</b> indicate that thermal stress by itself should not cause glass breakage.

40|$|SUMMARY: Subsurface 3 D {{geological}} {{models of}} aquifer and seal rock systems from two contrasting analogue sites {{have been created}} {{as the first step}} in an investigation into methodologies for geological storage of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers. Development of the models illustrates the utility of an integrated approach using digital techniques and expert geological knowledge to further geological understanding. The models visualize a faulted, gently dipping Permo-Triassic succession in Lincolnshire and a complex faulted and folded Devono-Carboniferous succession in eastern Scotland. The Permo-Triassic is present in the Lincolnshire model to depths of 2 km OD, and includes the aquifers of the Sherwood Sandstone and Rotliegendes groups. Model-derived thickness maps test and refine Permian palaeogeography, such as the location of a carbonate reef and its associated seaward slope, and the identification of aeolian dunes. Analysis of borehole core samples established average 2 D porosity values for the Rotliegendes (16 %) and Sherwood Sandstone (20 %) groups, and the Zechstein (5 %) and Mercia Mudstone (< 10 %) groups, which are favourable for aquifer and <b>seal</b> <b>units</b> respectively. Core sample analysis has revealed a complex but well understood diagenetic history. Re-interpretation of newly reprocessed seismic data in eastern Scotland has significantly reduced interpretative uncertainty of aquifer and <b>seal</b> <b>units</b> at depths of up to 6 km OD in a complex faulted and folded Devonian-Carboniferous succession. Synthesis of diverse data in the 3 D geological model defines a set of growth folds and faults indicative of active Viséan to Westphalian dextral-strike slip, with no major changes in structural style throughout the Carboniferous, in contrast to some published tectonic models. Average 2 D porosity values are 14 - 17 % in aquifer units and < 2 % in the <b>seal</b> <b>unit,</b> with a ferroan dolomite cement occluding porosity at depth...|$|R
