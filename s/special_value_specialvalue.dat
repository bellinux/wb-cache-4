40|$|We {{compute the}} adjoint of the Serre {{derivative}} map {{with respect to}} the Petersson scalar product by using existing tools of nearly holomorphic modular forms. The Fourier coefficients of a cusp form of integer weight $k$, constructed using this method, involve <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of certain shifted Dirichlet series associated with a given cusp form $f$ of weight $k+ 2 $. As application, we get an asymptotic bound for the <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of these shifted Dirichlet series and also relate these <b>special</b> <b>values</b> with the Fourier coefficients of $f$. We also give a formula for the Ramanujan tau function in terms of the <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of the shifted Dirichlet series associated to the Ramanujan delta function.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{the theory of}} global {{distributions}} (i. e. distributions of global fields) {{and apply it to}} the study of <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of abelian L-functions of a number field and division points of rank one Drinfeld modules. We introduce the concept of &# 92;epsilon-distributions and give examples by &# 92;epsilon-partial zeta functions. We determine the ranks of level groups of various kinds of universal distributions of a global field k, such as universal &# 92;epsilon-, punctured, punctured even and odd distributions of k. We show the universality of several distributions derived from <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of the &# 92;epsilon-partial zeta functions by studying &# 92;mathbb{Q}-linear independence of some <b>special</b> <b>values.</b> We also propose a conjecture and a question about the universality of &# 92;epsilon-distributions of <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of &# 92;epsilon-partial zeta functions...|$|R

With an additional assumptions, we {{prove that the}} <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of partial zeta function at s= 0 behaves as quasi-polynomial. We apply this to obtain that the <b>special</b> <b>values</b> the Hecke's L-functions at s= 0 {{for a family of}} for a Dirichlet character χ behave as quasi-polynomial as well.

40|$|We study <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of zeta {{functions}} of singular varieties over finite fields. We give a new formula of <b>special</b> <b>values</b> by constructing a morphism of homology theories, {{which we call}} regulator, from higher Chow group to weight homology. Our regulator is defined by using the notion of weight complex for varieties over a perfect field, which was introduced by Gillet and Soule. The main idea of the proof of our formula of <b>special</b> <b>values</b> is to use weight spectral sequence of homology theories, whose E 1 terms are homology groups for smooth projective schemes. Also, to calculate <b>special</b> <b>values,</b> we prove that the weight complex for any variety over a perfect field is bounded.

40|$|The {{study of}} congruences between arithmetically {{interesting}} numbers {{has a long}} history and plays important roles in several areas of number theory. Examples of such congruences include the Kummer congruences between Bernoulli numbers and congruences between coefficients of modular forms. Many of these congruences could be interpreted as congruences between <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of L-functions of arithmetic objects (motives). In recent years general conjectures [B-K] have been formulated relating these <b>special</b> <b>values</b> to the Selmer groups and other arithmetic invariants of the associated motives. In view of these conjectures, congruences between <b>special</b> <b>values</b> should give certain congruences between the corresponding Selmer groups. In this paper, we take {{a different point of view}} by studying congruences between Selmer groups and deducing consequences of such congruences to the congruences of <b>special</b> <b>values.</b> Roughly speaking, given two Galois representations that are congruent on a finite level, i. e., that become isomorphic representations modulo a prime power, we consider the relation between the corresponding Selmer groups. Precise definitions will be given in later sections. We will focus on the Selmer groups defined by Bloch and Kato [B-K] and will provide congruences when the congruent Galois representations are from cyclotomic characters, Hecke characters from CM elliptic curves, and from adjoints of modular forms. We also display consequences of such congruences to the congruences of <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of L-functions, in particular, to <b>special</b> <b>values</b> of the Riemann zeta function. It is interesting to observe that the congruences of <b>special</b> <b>values</b> obtained this way are different from the classical congruences, such as the Kummer congruences. Methods used in this paper are mostly from Iwasawa theory, including the classical theory originated from Iwasawa [Iw] and the ”horizontal ” theory recently develope...|$|R
