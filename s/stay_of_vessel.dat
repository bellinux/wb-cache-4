The material was preserved in strong formalin which highly condensed the tissues of the parasites. Therefore {{the details of the}} anatomical structure in most of the specimens could not be recognized even by means of phase-contrasting equipment. So the description is confined almost exclusively to the chitinoid armature of the haptor and copulatory organ.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine Acacia senegal var. senegal {{variations}} in <b>vessel</b> characteristics <b>of</b> root due to seed sources, families and irrigation intervals. Seeds were collected from twelve seed sources from clay soils across the gum belt according to differences in rainfalls and geographic discontinuity. Seeds were collected from seven trees from each seed source and sown in clay soil in under three irrigation intervals in a split design with three replicates. Slides were prepared from the roots of each seedling and stereological counts were done. Significant variation was found between isohyets in the number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in clusters per mm 2, total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in clusters. Significant differences were found in shape factor <b>of</b> multiple <b>vessels.</b> Irrigation had significant effect on lumen diameter <b>of</b> solitary <b>vessels,</b> double cell wall thickness <b>of</b> multiple <b>vessels</b> and vessel length. Families had a significant effect on total number <b>of</b> solitary <b>vessels</b> per mm 2, average number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in one cluster, average number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in one multiple, total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in clusters per mm 2, total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in multiples per mm 2 and volume fraction <b>of</b> multiple <b>vessels.</b> The interaction between families and irrigation was significant for total number <b>of</b> solitary <b>vessels</b> per mm 2, average number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in one cluster, average number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in one multiple, total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in clusters per mm 2, total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in multiples per mm 2 and volume fraction <b>of</b> solitary <b>vessels.</b> The results indicate the importance of abiding by transforming the seeds from area to another...|$|R
