40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to optimise {{the position of}} an "on-the-go" <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> installed on a variable rate (VR) granular fertiliser application system. Optimisation {{was carried out by}} measuring the lag time between acquiring the information on soil phosphorus (P) from the <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> and changing the fertiliser rate on the fertilisation system. The sensing system consisted of a <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> coupled with a Ziess spectrophotometer (CORONA fibre VISNIR 1. 7). The applicator was a four-row planter- applicator from AMAZONE (ED 302). The overall lag time consisted of a series of sub lag times consisting of the times required to collect soil spectra, compile data, change the fertiliser rate and the travel time of granules from the fertiliser metering devices to furrow openers. The static and dynamic tests were carried out to measure these lag times. For the dynamic test, a hydraulic shaker (Four Poster Vibratory Stands) was used to simulate the working movement under field conditions. The results revealed that the important factor for positioning the <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> {{at the front of the}} "on-the-go" fertiliser application system is tractor speed. The results showed that the <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> should be installed at the front of the tractor and an extra time delay should be artificially included. (c) 2008 lAgrE.

Topsoil samples were analyzed for plant-available nutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S, B, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Fe), pH, total nitrogen (TN) and total carbon (TC), soil texture, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable aluminum (Al).

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} a {{strategy}} to calibrate process-based agro-hydrological models for water dynamics in the soil-crop system with <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> measurements was developed. An inverse problem was formulated to infer the root parameters {{based on the measured}} soil water potential at depths during crop growth. The root penetration down the soil profile is assumed to be driven by the accumulative daily mean air temperature, and root length density distribution in the soil profile is exponential. The forward agro-hydrological model for water dynamics in the soil- crop system was proposed by Yang et al. (J. Hydrol. 2009; 370 : 177 - 190). A micro-Genetic Algorithm was employed to infer the parameters. Results show that the predictions of soil water potential using the inferred values of root parameters agree fairly well with the measurements throughout the entire growing period, indicating that the deduced root parameters are credible and appropriate for the studied case.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of crop coefficients for evaporation and transpiration {{is of great}} importance in optimizing irrigation and modeling water and solute transfers in the soil-crop system. In this study we used inverse modeling techniques on <b>soil</b> <b>sensor</b> measurements at depths from the soil-crop system to estimate crop coefficients. An inverse model was rigorously formulated to infer the crop coefficients and the lengths of growth stages using the measured soil water potential at depths during crop growth. By applying a micro-genetic algorithm to the formulated inverse model, the optimum values of the crop coefficient and the corresponding length of growth stage were successfully deduced. It {{has been found that}} the lengths of both the initial and development growth stages of cabbage were 5 Â d shorter than those from the FAO 56 (Irrigation and Drainage Paper by the FAO). The deduced crop coefficient for transpiration at the initial growth stage was 0. 11; slightly smaller than 0. 15 recommended by the FAO 56, while at the mid-season growth stage, the deduced value of 0. 95 was identical with the recommended value. Results show that the predictions of soil water potential using the obtained values of crop coefficients agreed well with the measurements throughout the entire growing period, indicating that the deduced crop coefficients were credible and appropriate for cabbage grown under the specific conditions of location and climate.
