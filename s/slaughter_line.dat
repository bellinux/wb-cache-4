50|$|From December 2004 through February 2005, an {{undercover}} investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals {{claimed to have}} worked on the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> of a Tyson Foods chicken processing plant in Heflin, Alabama. Using a hidden camera, he allegedly documented {{the treatment of the}} more than 100,000 chickens killed every day in the plant. PETA alleges that workers were instructed to rip the heads off of birds who missed the throat-cutting machines. He claims he saw birds scalded alive in the feather removal tank, and he said that managers said that it was acceptable to scald 40 birds alive per shift. The investigator claims plant employees were also seen throwing around dead birds just for fun. PETA has asked Tyson to implement controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). For this reason, PETA is boycotting businesses that use Tyson as a supplier, such as KFC and distribution channels such as Sunset Strips. The video, taken by the investigator of the killings, was posted on YouTube.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to develop and evaluate prediction equations, based on measurements obtained on the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line,</b> for carcass classification according {{to the degree of}} exudation and the content of marbling. A total of 747 pig carcasses originated from 27 producers were randomly selected on the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> at two slaughterhouses, constituting representative samples from each one. Hot carcass weight, loin depth, back fat thickness, and pH and temperature 45 min after slaughter were used to generate the equations. The carcasses were classified as normal or exudative for drip loss of loin and ham, and as acceptable or undesirable for marbling content. For drip loss of loin and ham, respectively, the overall correct classification of the carcasses was 87. 3 and 76. 8 %, using the discriminant functions, for both categories. For marbling, the overall correct classification was 67. 2 %, and only 69 % of the carcasses were correctly classified as acceptable (marbling > 1).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the role of the slaughtering process in Salmonella carcass contamination by typing isolates recovered previously in a double study of the following: (1) a tracking survey from the farm to the slaughterhouse and (2) a survey of the slaughterhouse environment (i. e., lairage area, <b>slaughter</b> <b>line,</b> cutting plant and carcasses). The Salmonella serotypes identified on the carcasses of the 16 tracked batches were frequently linked to lairage, whereas the serotypes detected at the farm, transport or pig-related samples (i. e., caecum content and lymph nodes) were only occasionally detected at the carcass level. Multi-locus variable-number tandem repeats (MLVA) of 77 Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium isolates from seven of these batches confirmed the link between the isolates recovered from carcasses and holding pens. Only four of the 16 positive carcasses had profiles previously isolated from lymph nodes or caecal content. In the second part of the study, a total of 131 S. enterica ser. Typhimurium and 74 S. enterica ser. Derby isolates were further characterised by MLVA and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), respectively. The MLVA profiles identified in carcasses varied throughout the working day and were frequently linked to those identified in samples from the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> points collected close in time. PFGE and MLVA profiles identified at lairage were also detected in later processing facilities (i. e., <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> and cutting plant) as well as in carcasses. Finally, most of the profiles found at the cutting plants were previously identified in the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> or carcass samples. The results from this study show that Salmonella contamination in pigs entering the slaughterhouse can be attributed to several sources. Typing of isolates by MLVA and PFGE clarified the sources of carcass contamination and improved the accuracy of cross-contamination attributable values. Without obviating the relevant role of infected pigs entering the slaughterhouse, the present study highlights the lairage and slaughtering as important sources of carcass contamination. © 2012 Elsevier B.

The research has been concentrated mainly on the <b>slaughter</b> <b>lines</b> which use the technology of stunning the animals with electricity and concentrated CO 2. The research monitors the rate of PSE defect from the slaughter to the cutting of the pig (approximately 48 hours). For considering the difference in quality of the meat the basic identification indicators of both pH 1 and the draining of meat were created. Furthermore, we monitored pH 24 and pH 48, too. Analyzing of the above mentioned indicators shows that stunning with concentrated CO 2 is more suitable {{with regard to the}} quality of the meat.

40|$|Introduction: Even if a {{small number}} of poultry {{carcasses}} contaminate with pathogenic food bacteria, the chance of spreading the infection in the chillers of poultry slaughterhouse, resulting in contamination of other carcasses also have been observed. In this study, Coliform bacteria, Salmonella and the Psychrophiles in the two different poultry slaughterhouse of Yazd province have been investigated. Methods: Sampling from each line (slaughter and chiller) in two stages (before and after removal from the line) three times (the beginning, middle {{and the end of the}} slaughtering) was carried out. Five Chicken carcasses were randomly selected, numbered and sampled both before entering the line and after exiting the line while rinsed using peptone Water. A total of 120 samples were sent to the laboratory for culturing and microbial counting. Results: Significant differences were detected between chiller and <b>slaughter</b> <b>line.</b> The population of coliforms in the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> was significantly more than the chillers (p< 0. 01). In the case of salmonella the only difference was in the amount of bacteria between two slaughterhouse being significantly lower in slaughter house two (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results showed no significant differences among different treatments in respect to psychrophile bacteria. In general, it can be said that secondary contamination in the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line</b> along with gradual increase in temperature of the chiller can increase bacterial load of both coliforms and salmonella but it will not affect the amount of psychrophile bacteria. Due to some differences between the studied slaughterhouses, microbial load of coliform and salmonella can be acheived by improving the management and installation of appropriate aquipments in the evisceration line...|$|E
40|$|In biotracing systems, {{downstream}} chain {{information and}} model-based approaches {{are used to}} trace the sources of microbial contamination in a food chain.

A Bayesian belief network model was used in which information on the Salmonella level at different locations in the slaughterhouse were used in combination with prior knowledge about the dynamics of Salmonella throughout the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line.</b> Data collected in a Dutch slaughterhouse were used to specify prior beliefs about the model inputs and to iteratively refine the distributions of the parameters in the model to obtain an optimal description of that specific slaughterhouse. The primary purpose of the model is to trace the sources of contamination for individual Salmonella-positive carcasses {{at the end of the}} <b>slaughter</b> <b>line.</b> The model results indicated that house flora on or in the carcass splitter was the source of contamination for many carcasses, especially for those that carried contamination on the cutting side. The results also indicated that the parameter values of the model may be subject to temporal variation and can be used as a tool to provide estimates of such trends. This model illustrates the concept of biotracing, gives insight into the dynamics of Salmonella in the <b>slaughter</b> <b>line,</b> and indicates the sites in the line where data collection is most effective for biotracing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Broiler meat {{quality is}} one of the primary factors {{considered}} by the poultry industry. This study was conducted to estimate heritability and genetic correlation coefficients for meat quality traits in a single male broiler line. The meat ultimate pH (24 h after slaughter) and lightness presented the highest heritability estimates. Given the estimated genetic correlations, the pH measured at 15 min and 24 h after slaughtering, as well as lightness, were characterized by a close and negative genetic relationship with water holding capacity traits. In contrast, meat quality traits exhibited only non-significant genetic correlations with performance and carcass traits. Noticed exceptions were breast weight, which was genetically and favorably associated with the initial pH and thawing-cooking losses, and ultrasound record of pectoral muscle depth, which was genetically and unfavourably associated with the shear force of meat. Meat pH values at 24 h after slaughtering or lightness may be a favorable selection criterion for the poultry industry for improving meat quality, since these traits are associated with the water holding capacity of the meat. Out of the traits studied, lightness is most easily assessed on the industrial <b>slaughtering</b> <b>line.</b> The direct selection for breast weight could improve the initial pH and thawing-cooking losses of meat, even as selection for ultrasound records o...|$|R

In the process of opening carcasses, removal of organs, splitting of carcasses and final dressing, automatic systems are being installed now in order to save and secure labor. The most important factor of production in the slaughterhouse is labor. 2. It is important to take pigs to the slaughterhouse with clean skin and in a quiet condition. In addition, installation of automatic systems for pork is essential to minimize bacterial contamination. 3. However, financial support from the government and reinforcement of the collection of cargo power are needed, because the installation cost of the automatic systems is very high. Anyway, the presence or excellent managers is essential in order to realize the hygienic improvement and the productivity increase. 日本の食肉業界には数多くのと畜場がある。しかし，それらはおおむね旧式で，施設の改善を必要としている。 とくに衛生改善と生産性向上が重要である。本研究の目的は新しい処理機械が設置された時，衛生と技術の状態 がどの程度改善するかを明らかにすることである。ここで，われわれが想定する豚のと畜ラインの処理能力は時 間 300 頭処理， 1 日 7 時間操業である。その主要な結論は以下の通りである。 1 、と畜解体（皮はぎ，内臓摘出，背割り，仕上げなどを含む）の工程では，現在，労働の安全と節約を目的と して全自動システムが設置されている。と畜場における最も重要な生産要素は労働である。 2 ．皮膚の清潔な豚を静かな状態でと畜室に誘導することが重要である。加えて，微生物汚染を最小限に抑える ためには全自動システムの導入が必須となっている。 3 ．しかし，全自動システムの設置費用はきわめて高いので，政府の財政支援と集荷力の強化が要請されている。 いずれにせよ，衛生改善と生産性向上を実現するためには優れた経営者の出現が必要である...|$|R
