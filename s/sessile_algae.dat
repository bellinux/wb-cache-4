Similar to Lake Baikal or Lake Tanganyika, Lake Ohrid harbors endemic species covering the whole food-chain, from phytoplankton and <b>sessile</b> <b>algae</b> (20 species; e.g., Cyclotella fottii), over plant species (2 species; e.g., Chara ohridana), zooplankton (5 species; e.g., Cyclops ochridanus), cyprinid fish (8 species; e.g., Pachychilon pictus), to predatory fish (two trout species; the Ohrid trout complex Salmo letnica, and [...] "Belvica" [...] Salmo ohridanus) and finally its diverse endemic bottom fauna (176 species; e.g. Ochridagammarus solidus), with particularly large endemism among crustaceans, molluscs, sponges and planarians. There were recorded 68 species of freshwater snails from the Lake Ohrid basin. 73.5% (50 species) of the total freshwater gastropod fauna appear to be endemic to the Lake Ohrid basin. Whereas the endemic species list cited above is based on morphological and ecological characteristics, some recent applications of molecular genetic techniques underline the difference of the fauna from common European taxa, as well as the old age of the lake.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) for {{dissolved}} copper {{based on}} the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) of 24 marine single species tests was validated in marine mesocosms. To achieve this, the impact of actively maintained concentrations of dissolved copper on a marine benthic and planktonic community was studied in 18 outdoor 4. 6 m 3 mesocosms. Five treatment levels, ranging from 2. 9 to 31 μg dissolved Cu/L, were created in triplicate and maintained for 82 days.

In this study, the attachment of a typical biofouling microalgae Chlorella vulgaris on the surface of 316 L stainless steel was determined by a light microscopy. Its influence on the electrochemical behavior of this material was also evaluated by electrochemical techniques, including open circuit potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curves. The results showed that this algal species could attach to the surface of 316 L stainless steel without any extracellular polymeric substance. This action was not sensitive for the surface roughness but was influenced by the environmental pH value. The adhesion density reached a maximum at pH 9 value. Electrochemical results showed that this algal species had a corrosion inhibit efficiency for 316 L stainless steel during a short period of immersion (14 d). This was mostly because of the oxygen produced by the photosynthetic activity of planktonic algae. The <b>sessile</b> <b>algae</b> species couldn’t induce any influence on the electrochemical behavior of 316 L stainless steel.

These results suggest overharvesting of abalone results in a shift to benthic habitat poorly preferred by abalone.

40|$|Distinct {{patterns}} of benthic {{flora and fauna}} are produced when unstable rocky substrata are disturbed by water motion. This study investigated occurrence of disturbance-related patterns in benthic boulder habitats on the north-eastern Baltic coast. <b>Sessile</b> assemblages, mostly <b>algae</b> on tops of boulders and barnacles and bryozoans underneath, were found to differ between small (50 – 150 cm 2 upperside surface area) and large (200 – 800 cm 2) boulders.

These patterns {{may be due to}} small boulders being displaced by water motion more frequently than large ones. Most of the barnacle shells/tests were remnant empty ones, and the proportion of empty tests and living barnacles was similar underneath small and large boulders, suggesting that degradation/removal of empty tests was not influenced by disturbance associated with boulder size. There was no consistent evidence of algae being affected by boulder size, but the tops of boulders had less algae than the edges, a pattern that is typically associated with high rates of overturning. Confirmation of disturbance as having caused these patterns and thus being an important process for structuring benthic biota in this region could be achieved by further manipulative experimentation...|$|R

As the subjects of this study, 0 ^+ and 1 ^+ age fishes of less than about 150 mm in BL were mainly investigated. To clarify the life history of this species, as to the morphological characters, number of fin rays and gill rakers, relative growth of head length, body depth, caudul peduncle depth and intestine length to BL, and forms of stomach and intestines were examined. Furthermore, ecological characters such as habitat and food habits were examined. As a result, all specimens less than about 150 mm in BL were graduated with the characters mentioned above into the following five developmental stages. Postlarval stage (3. 7 - 15 mm BL) Body form is much more slender than that of adult. Each fin develops and fin rays attain their fixed number at about 15 mm in BL. Number of gill rakers increases rapidly. Stomach is straight and intestines are simple in a form. Living at the surface layer of coastal waters from May to mid-June, they feed on pelagic copepods and phyllopods. Prejuvenile stage (15 - 20 mm BL) Body form is still slender. Number of gill rakers increases as before. Stomach is L shaped, and forming bends, intestine increase in length. The habitat changes {{to the surface of}} rocky shores, and individuals feed on planktonic and benthonic copepods, phyllopods and amphipods. Postjuvenile stage (20 - 30 mm BL) Body depth becomes larger to some degree. Proportion of head length to BL attains maximum and that of caudal peduncle depth becomes constant at about 20 mm in BL. Scales cover most of the body at about 25 mm in BL Stomach is V shaped as in adults. Intestines enfold stomach passing under it from right to left and intestine length noticeably increases. Living in almost the same habitat as prejuvenile, they begin to peck at food organisms on the rocks, and sessile diatoms occur in their stomach contents as one of the main food organisms. Young stage (30 - 50 mm BL) Body form and coloration begin to resemble that adults. Number of gill rakers become nearly constant at about 30 mm in BL. Shifting their habitat from the surface layer to the middle and bottom layers on rocky shores gradually from late-June to late-July, they mainly feed on copepods, amphipods, schizopods, <b>sessile</b> diatoms and <b>algae.</b> Immature stage (50 mm BL -) Proportion of body depth to BL becomes constant at about 50 mm in BL and external appearance is almost {{the same as that of}} adults. Development of intestinal convolution finishes and proportion of intestine length to BL becomes constant at about 50 mm in BL.

40|$|Rock pools {{represent}} patches or {{islands of}} habitat {{different from the}} surrounding shore. They contain diverse assemblages of invertebrates and algae. The shape, size, height on the shore and exposure to waves are considered important influences on the abundances of organisms. In studies of natural pools, these factors are confounded because pools are rarely comparable; they differ in size, position on the shore and history of colonization. To solve this, experimental pools of different diameters (15, 30 and 50 cm) and depths (5, 15 and 30 cm) were drilled in sandstone rocky shores in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Replicate pools of each size were made in each of 24 randomly-chosen sites, six sites representing each combination of two heights (mid and low) on the shore and sheltered versus wave-exposed habitats. The influence of diameter of the pool is examined here, using data from a total of 360 experimental pools. Despite a 2 - 3 -fold increase in surface-area of pools with increased diameter, {{there was no difference}} in densities of most taxa examined (gastropods, a starfish, <b>sessile</b> invertebrates, <b>algae).</b> An exception was foliose algae, the cover of which was generally greater low on the shore and in 50 cm than 30 cm diameter pools. There were also consistently more species in any stratum (i. e., depth in a pool) in the wider pools. There were approximately 25 - 50 % more species in the widest than the narrowest pools, consistently from season to season and year to year. There were, however, significantly fewer species per unit area of a given stratum in Pools of 50 versus 30 versus 15 cm diameter. These results require further investigation in relation to different theories to explain species-area relationships. Multivariate analyses revealed no influence of diameter on the structure of assemblages of organisms in pools of different diameter. This was true for different strata in pools and at mid- or low-shore positions on exposed or sheltered shores. Diameter of pools thus had remarkably little influence on the organisms; those effects found were consistent. Experimental pools were shown to be effective for testing hypotheses about proposed influences on the ecology of inhabitants. The findings about diameter of pools greatly simplify analyses of influences of depth and physical features of the surrounding habitat...|$|R

This sustained perturbation has disrupted the intertidal community in several ways, but the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in local biodiversity remain poorly understood. Our main goal was to identify the species (lumped into trophic groups) belonging to the Chan˜aral intertidal community that, being directly affected by copper pollution, contributed primarily to the generation of the observed changes in community structure. These groups of species were called initiators. We applied a qualitative modelling approach based only on the sign and direction of effects among species, and present a formula for predicting changes in equilibrium abundances considering stress on multiple variables simultaneously. We then applied this technique retrospectively to identify the most likely set of initiators. Our analyses allowed identification of {{a unique set of}} four initiators in the studied intertidal system (a group of <b>algae,</b> <b>sessile</b> invertebrates, a group of herbivores and starfish), which were hypothesized to be the primary drivers of the observed changes in community structure. In addition, a hypothesis was derived about how the perturbation affected these initiators. The hypothesis is that pollution affected negatively the population growth rate of both <b>algae</b> and <b>sessile</b> invertebrates and suppressed the interaction between herbivores and starfish. Our analytic approach, focused on identifying initiators, constitutes an advance towards understanding the mechanisms underlying human-driven ecosystem disruption and permits identifying species that may serve as a focal point for community management and restoration.

40|$|Factors and {{processes}} affecting community structures operate at various {{spatial and temporal}} scales. We analyzed how similarities of rocky intertidal assemblages vary at different spatial scales using a nested, hierarchical sampling design. Intertidal assemblages consisting of <b>algae,</b> <b>sessile</b> animals, and mobile animals were censused on five rock walls at each of five shores chosen within each of six regions along the Pacific coast of Japan, encompassing 1, 800 km of coastlines. Based on this sampling design, similarities in assemblages were calculated using both qualitative (presence/absence) and quantitative (percent cover and density) data, and compared at three spatial levels: (1) rock level (the finest spatial scale, encompassing several to hundreds of meters), (2) shore level (the intermediate spatial scale, encompassing several to tens of kilometers), and (3) region level (the broadest spatial scale, encompassing hundreds to thousands of kilometers). Cluster analysis showed that assemblages were categorized into distinct regional groups except for the two southern regions, {{but they did not}} separate clearly from each shore. A nested analysis of similarities revealed significant variation in similarities among regions and among shores within each region, with the former showing greater variation. Similarity was negatively correlated with geographic distance at the regional level but not at the shore or the rock levels. At the regional level, similarity decreased more rapidly with distance for mobile animals than sessile organisms. The analyses highlighted the importance of broad-scale abiotic/biotic factors such as oceanic current conditions and biogeographic factors in determining observed patterns in similarity of rocky intertidal assemblages...|$|R

The Madeira Archipelago has ~ 260, 000 inhabitants and receives over six million visitor days annually. The Selvagens Islands Reserve {{is one of the}} oldest nature reserves in Portugal and comprises two islands and several islets, including the surrounding shelf to a depth of 200 m. Only reserve rangers and a small unit of the maritime police inhabit these islands. The benthic community around Selvagens was dominated by erect and turf algae, while the community at Madeira was comprised of crustose coralline and turf <b>algae,</b> <b>sessile</b> invertebrates, and sea urchin barrens. The sea urchin Diadema africanum was 65 % more abundant at Madeira than at Selvagens. Total fish biomass was 3. 2 times larger at Selvagens than at Madeira, and biomass of top predators was more than 10 times larger at Selvagens. Several commercially important species (e. g., groupers, jacks), which have been overfished throughout the region, were more common and of larger size at Selvagens than at Madeira. Important sea urchin predators (e. g., hogfishes, triggerfishes) were also in higher abundance at Selvagens compared to Madeira. The effects of fishing and other anthropogenic influences are evident around Madeira. This is in stark contrast to Selvagens, which harbors healthy benthic communities with diverse algal assemblages and high fish biomass, including an abundance of large commercially important species. The clear differences between these two island groups highlights the importance of expanding and strengthening the protection around Selvagens, which harbors one of the last intact marine ecosystems in the North Atlantic, and the need to increase management and protection around Madeira.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityA field test, {{designed}} {{to reveal the}} major aspects of the variations observed in marine littoral associations, was initiated in July, 1951, at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. This study consisted in the placing of wooden panels in the sea. Experiments based on two series of panels were outlined and so planned {{that the effects of}} tides, rhythmic reproduction, progressive variation, and cyclic variation could be segregated. One set of panels was floated vertically at a constant level and a second set was exposed so as to receive the full effects of the tides. Thus, both sets of panels were subjected to all the same features, operationally, except the tides. Panels were exposed in pairs each month and, of each pair exposed, one was left one month and the other was left two months. Thus, irregularities due to fortnightly reproduction were thought to be overcome. Other panels were exposed for varying periods of from three to twenty-four months. Panels removed for measurement and study were floated in a tray, photographed, and, when not returned to the sea, were dried out and saved. Each time a panel was removed, photographed, and measured, a collection of the biota present was made. The identity of these organisms was later confirmed in the laboratory. Observations were made {{at least once a week}} and sometimes more frequently; photographs were taken once a month. As a check on the effects, if any, of removing the experimental panels, as outlined above, control panels, left undisturbed for one year, were also set out. After exposure, panels were inspected frequently for evidence of settlement by marine organisms. Careful note was made of all variations. Irrespective of the time of exposure, the first visible change on wooden panels newly exposed to the sea at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, is the development of a scum. This scum, at first merely a thin coating imparting no more than a slickness to the surface, soon appears as a copious, thick, jelly-like mass. Although seemingly void of living organisms this material rapidly becomes associated with innumerable diatoms. Likewise, it is in this clear "gel" that the germlings of the Chlorophyceae, Rhodophyceae, and Phaeophyceae are first detected. Considering the data on all panels concerned, results show that there is a definite relationship between this incidence of microfouling and the subsequent successful invasion of macroscopic populants. The data also show the first macroscopic organisms to be species of the <b>algae.</b> <b>Sessile</b> animal forms do not become successful invaders, even when known to be breeding, until after a flourishing growth of algae has been established and an abundance of detritus is present. This investigation, continuing through August, 1954, further reveals: (1) variations in populants that are seasonal; (2) variations in populants that are annual; and (3) variations in populants that are neither seasonal nor annual and can be interpreted only in terms of a true succession. From the data it appears that much of the controversy, pertaining to the populating of newly exposed substrata, may be due to variation in the interpretation of experimental results, rather than converse data. Here we find support for the conclusions of earlier work that marine biota follow a definite sequence in populating intertidal transects and that variations in the biota do occur. However, it now seems probable that the simultaneous occurrence of variations in organisms due to seasonal progression and variations due to other causes, may have been instrumental in concealing the true nature of the complexities observed in marine littoral associations...|$|R
