500|$|Marx was {{considering}} an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians. Marx moved to Cologne in 1842, {{where he became}} a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper Rheinische Zeitung (Rhineland News), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive. The newspaper {{attracted the attention of}} the Prussian government censors, who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: [...] "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be <b>sniffed</b> <b>at,</b> and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear". After the Rheinische Zeitung published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar Nicholas I requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.|$|E

Simeon ben Halafta praised the ant's wisdom and praiseworthiness, inasmuch as the ant had not learned its ways from any other {{creature}} and had no judge or officer to guide it, as [...] says, the ant has [...] "no chief, overseer, or ruler." [...] How much more should people, who have judges and officers, hearken to them. Hence, [...] directs appointment of judges in all the Israelites' cities.|$|E

Here we investigated left and right nostril use in 12 show jumper horses freely sniffing different emotive stimuli.
