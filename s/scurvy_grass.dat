60|$|But in {{researches}} in {{this direction}} they will find puzzles enough. I will give them one which I shall be most thankful to hear they have solved within the next seven years--How {{is it that we}} find certain plants, namely, the thrift and the <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass,</b> abundant on the sea-shore and common on certain mountain-tops, but nowhere between the two? Answer me that. For I have looked at the fact for years--before, behind, sideways, upside down, and inside out--and I cannot understand it.|$|E
60|$|THE {{chief was}} as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully {{supplied}} with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. Besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass,</b> with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. The celery was a treat indeed, and the <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass</b> proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease. In a very short time we had not a single person on the sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. Shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds' eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before. Most of the men found it a palatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable. In return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange. We established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of Klock-klock had not led us to expect from the savages.|$|E
60|$|For {{several days}} after this fruitless search we were {{occupied}} in exploring {{every part of the}} summit of the hill, in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would afford us no food, {{with the exception of the}} unwholesome filberts, and a rank species of <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass,</b> which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more lamentable. {*5} On the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose. We also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to the main ravine. Here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket.|$|E

50|$|Scurvy-grass (Cochlearia species; {{also called}} <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass,</b> scurvygrass, or spoonwort) is a genus of about 30 species of annual and {{perennial}} herbs in the cabbage family Brassicaceae.

50|$|European {{history of}} the area is {{considered}} to start with Captain Cook's visit to the sounds in the 1770s, discovering a plant (Cook's <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass)</b> high in vitamin C which helped to cure scurvy amongst his crew.

50|$|Torry Bay is {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Intertidal mudflats are an important estuarine habitat for birds and thousands are attracted to the reserve every year. The apparent barrenness of the shore is deceiving. It {{has been estimated that}} one square metre of mud may contain up to 60,000 laver spire snails or thousands of ragworms. These invertebrates provide essential food for the birds that overwinter at Torry Bay. In the winter you can see large numbers of great crested grebe, shelduck, wigeon, curlew, redshank and dunlin. Others like sandwich tern, ringed plover, ruff and greenshank occur on migration during the autumn.Washed up on the beach, you can also find cockles, mussels, periwinkles and tellins. Rockpools often contain butterfish, gobies, sea anemones, shore crabs and shrimps.Pockets of saltmarsh contain colourful flowers such as sea aster, thrift and <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass.</b> One plant that grows in the soft mud is the uncommon eelgrass, an important food source for the wigeon.|$|E

40|$|Threatened {{plants in}} {{relation}} to other management objectives Threatened plant conservation is affected by several distinct restoration objectives on Mana Island. These include the restoration of Mana Island's indigenous biotic communities (and possibly several mainland communities as well), the continuing protection of threatened plants and animals that are relict on the island as a result of reductions in their former range, {{and the use of the}} island as a habitat for nationally or regionally threatened plants and animals not known to have been definitely present originally. Although there will be conflicts of interest between these objectives at times, it is important to recognise that all are legitimate aims in their own right, deserving of intensive efforts to reconcile with each other. The current situation- what has been achieved One relict species on Mana Island is a nationally threatened plant: Cook's <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass</b> (which is a native cress).

40|$|The cold-adapted genus Cochlearia L. (<b>scurvy</b> <b>grass),</b> a young {{polyploid}} complex {{within the}} Brassicaceae family (Cruciferae), displays {{a range of}} highly interesting cytogenetic and ecotypic characteristics and might serve as an excellent model system to study general evolutionary mechanisms such as polyploidization, hybridization, or cold and edaphic adaptation. The presented study provides, for the first time, comprehensive cytogenetic and highly-resolving phylogenomic analyses, and first metabolomic insights into the Cochlearia cold response. Thus, the findings presented herein might constitute {{a good starting point}} for further in-depth analyses of said evolutionary aspects e. g. based on population-genomic datasets. In chapter 1, the cytogenetic evolution within the genus Cochlearia is analyzed via both conventional chromosome counts and flow cytometry measurements. Based on a comprehensive literature review on published chromosome counts, the geographical distribution of cytogenetic variability is described, suggesting an early evolutionary separation of the two diploid karyotypes (2 n= 12 and 2 n= 14). The high frequency of aberrant chromosome numbers in polyploid taxa is interpreted as a result of frequent interploidal hybridization, given the near absence of interspecific fertility barriers, and thus reflecting the dynamics of polyploid evolution within the genus Cochlearia. Moreover, a correlation between genome size and chromosome number, as well as genome downsizing in polyploid taxa are revealed. Chapter 2 provides comprehensive phylogenomic analyses based on Illumina high-throughput sequencing data. Chloroplast and mitochondrial phylogenies are largely in congruence and indicate a glacial survival of the whole genus in arctic refuge areas as well as repeated adaptation to alpine habitats in Central Europe. Divergence time estimates, based on complete chloroplast genomes, imply a diversification of the whole genus {{over the course of several}} Pleistocene glaciations within the last 700, 000 years. Results from nuclear data analyses support both the clear evolutionary separation of the two diploid karyotypes as described in chapter 1, as well as the basal phylogenetic position of arctic taxa as shown in organellar phylogenies, and they reveal new insights into the evolutionary origins of the different polyploid taxa. In chapter 3, the metabolomic analysis of the Cochlearia cold response via metabolite profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is described. Based on temperature-related bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), four bioclimatic ecotypes are defined and utilized as group priors for statistical analyses. All studied plants/ecotypes show strong metabolomic adjustments in reaction to 20 days of cold treatment under 5 °C, especially with regard to increased levels of soluble carbohydrates and amino acids. Statistical analyses do not show a strong discrimination of the four bioclimatic ecotypes based on the analyzed metabolites, yet slight intrageneric variation among the bioclimatic clusters is described, implying similarities in the cold response between arctic and alpine taxa...|$|E
40|$|Scurvy was {{encountered}} oft en in {{the early}} modern era {{in connection with the}} absence of vitamin C on long sea journeys and in frequent wars. Even though the nature of the disease was not known, the effectiveness of foods and remedies rich in vitamin C became known through experience. Europe’s physicians nevertheless had only a vague idea of what scurvy was. Many other illnesses were thought to be scurvy due to the indefinite nature of its symptoms. Doctoral dissertations on scurvy were readily written and defended at European universities. As many as four physicians who later worked as doctors in the Baltic provinces did so as well {{in the latter half of}} the seventeenth century and the early eighteenth century: Benjamin Fischer and Conrad Rudolph Hertz who worked in Riga as military surgeons; Nicolaus Buchner, who was a doctor in Mitau (Jelgava), and Christian Ehrenfried Eschenbach, who worked for a time as a doctor in Tartu and later as a professor of medicine in Rostock. Of those dissertations, Nicolaus Buchner’s doctoral thesis drew upon his observations from his experience as a fi eld doctor with the German-Polish garrison in Dünamünde (Daugavgrīva) fortress, which was besieged by the Swedes during the Great Northern War in the latter half of 1701. His practical work as a doctor provided him with the opportunity to familiarize himself with all phases of the progress of scurvy. The causes of scurvy were generally thought to be the accumulation of salts resulting from the inhalation of salty sea air and the consumption of salted and smoked meat products, thus thickening the blood and leading to the afflictions of scurvy. Only Eschenbach’s position differed from the others. He maintained that the causes of this disease were more likely spoiled food and contaminated drinking water. The dissertations chiefly recommended agents promoting excretion, secretion and voiding (bloodletting, laxatives and medicines for inducing urination, perspiration and vomiting) as treatment for scurvy, as was usual at that time for the treatment of other illnesses as well, and medicines for cleansing the organism, some of which were toxic chemical preparations harmful to the organism. Yet among the recommended medicines were also some ten herbs that due to their content of vitamin C really did prove to be effective means for preventing and alleviating scurvy. Such herbs were <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass</b> (cochlearia), water cress (nasturtium), cress (lepidium), horseradish (raphanus rusticus), lemon juice (succus citri), pine shoots or fir shoots (summitates pinii vel abietis), garlic (allium) and onion (allium gepa). The authors of all four dissertations agreed on the positive effect of some of the substances listed above. Th is means that the practice in treating this disease that had evolved over generations was a step ahead of medical theories.

Journal Of Chromatography A, 34, 428 - 429 The biosynthesis of selected cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates was examined in higher plants. Linen flax seedling shoots (linum usitatissimum L.) were used exclusively to study linamarin biosynthesis while prunasin biosynthesis was studies in both peach shoots (Prunus persica Batsch) and cherry laurel shoots (P. laurocerasus L.). Isoprppylglucosinolate and benzylglucosinolate were studied in <b>scurvy</b> <b>grass</b> seedlings (Cochlearia officinalis L.) and garden cress seedling shoots (Lepidum sativum L.) respectively. Altogether 9 isotopically labelled compounds were prepared {{as part of the}} study and 14 were administered to plant tissue. The quantity of cyanogenic glucosides was determined by measuring hydrogen cyanide following enzymic hydrolysis. The specific activity or dilution of the labelled compound after incorporation into the glucosides was determined and sued to judge the effectiveness of the administered compound as a precursor of the glucosides. Benzaldehyde from prunasin was measured as its semicarbazone and the isothicyanates. Obtained by enzyme hydrolysis of the glucosinolates, were identified by conversion to thiourea derivatives. Paper and thin layer chromatography and electrophoresis were used to separate non-volatile radioactive compounds. Isobutyraldoxime-U- 14 C, 2 -oximinoisovaleric acid-U- 14 C, isobutyronitrile- 1 - 14 C and 2 -hydroxyisobutyronitrile- 1 - 14 C were all incorporated into linamarin to extents comparable to that from L-valine-U- 14 c. By the use of 15 N labelled compounds the C-N bond of isobutyraldoxime and 2 -oximinoisovaleric acid was shown to remain intact during the cornversjon to linarnarin. Isobutyramide- 1 - 14 C and hydrogen cyanide- 14 c were not significantly incorporated into linamarin. Phenylacetaldoxime-U- 14 C, 2 -oximino- 3 -phenylpropionic acid- 2 - 14 C and phenylacetonitrile- 1 - 14 c were converted to prunasin to greater extents than was L-phenylalanine-U- 14 C. Radioactivity from D,L-mandelonitrile- 1 - 14 C and, to a lesser extent, from hydrogen cyanide- 14 -C was also incorporated into the nitrile moiety of prunasin. Phenylacethydroxamic acid- 1 - 14 C was not significantly converted to prunasin. Linen 'lax seedling shoots were examined for both volatile and non-volatile intermediates. Radioactive precursors of linamarin were administered in the presence of other suspected intermediates or inhibitors of linamarin biosynthesis. Both isobutyraldoxime and isobutyronitrile were shown to be formed in the shoots from L-valine-U- 14 C. A non-volatile compound which accumulated {{in the presence of a}} few inhibitors Of linamaran biosynthesis was studied in detail. Treatment with acid under mild conditions yielded isobutyraldehyde while emulsin gave isobutyraldoxime. It was resistant to linamarase. Isobutyronitrile was a product of pyrolysis. The proposed structure for this compound is isobutyraldoxime- 0 -glucoside. Isobutyraldoxime-U- 14 C and phenylacetaldoxime-U- 14 C were both better precursors of the corresponding glucosinolates than were L-valine-U- 14 C or L-phenylalanine-U- 14 C. 2 -Oximinoisovaleric acid-U- 14 C was not significantly incorporated into isopropylglucosinolate. It is concluded that aldoximes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of both cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Other intermediates proposed in cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis are nitriles and 2 -hydroxynitriles in that order, N-Hydroxyamino acids may be intermediates between amino acids and aldoximes. 2 -Oximino acids may also be intermediates in cyanoglycoside biosynthesis although it is possible that the observed incorporation was by way of prior non-enzymic conversion to nitriles. The experiments with labelled administered compounds have outlined a pathway of cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis which may now be profitably studied for confirmation at the enzymic level...|$|E
