40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how the Laplace operator {{can be combined}} with a stochastic jump process to describe {{the evolution of a}} polymer network. Growth processes in polymer networks can proceed through the transfer of rather large oligomeric subunits from a pool of soluble molecules into the filaments forming the network. In such a situation stochastic jump processes are a natural tool for the description of network formation at the nanometer scale. However, modeling of the reaction system in high spatiotem-poral resolution also needs to capture the evolution of the <b>soluble</b> <b>filament</b> precursor molecules, which controls local properties of the growth process. We illustrate how this may be achieved by combining a deterministic diffusion equation with a stochastic jump process within the setting of a piecewise-deterministic Markov process. Since in many applications the diffusion equation will be considered with periodic boundary conditions, we apply the theory of bilinear forms to prove existence and uniqueness of a solution, which is also shown to be positive, mass-preserving, and convergent to an equilibrium. 1 Introduction an...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial cell {{division}} in many organisms involves a constricting cytokinetic ring that is orchestrated by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ. FtsZ forms dynamic filaments {{close to the}} membrane {{at the site of}} division that have recently been shown to treadmill around the division ring, guiding septal wall synthesis. Here, using X-ray crystallography of Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ (SaFtsZ), we reveal how an FtsZ can adopt two functionally distinct conformations, open and closed. The open form is found in SaFtsZ filaments formed in crystals and also in <b>soluble</b> <b>filaments</b> of Escherichia coli FtsZ as deduced by electron cryomicroscopy. The closed form is found within several crystal forms of two nonpolymerizing SaFtsZ mutants and corresponds to many previous FtsZ structures from other organisms. We argue that FtsZ’s conformational switch is polymerization-associated, driven by the formation of the longitudinal intersubunit interfaces along the filament. We show that such a switch provides explanations for both how treadmilling may occur within a single-stranded filament and why filament assembly is cooperative...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inside the {{interphase}} cell, ~ 5 % of {{the total}} intermediate filament protein exists in a soluble form. Past studies using velocity gradient sedimentation (VGS) indicate that <b>soluble</b> intermediate <b>filament</b> protein exists as an N 7 S tetrameric species. While studying intermediate filament assembly dynamics in the Xenopus oocyte, we used both VGS and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to analyze the soluble form of keratin...|$|R
40|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} pituitrin-izadrin induced injury on the levels of metallothionein (MT) and <b>soluble</b> and <b>filament</b> forms of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, and the cerebral cortex, and examined the effect of corvitin on the brain under the noted changes. Our results showed oppositely directed changes – {{a decrease in the}} level of MT and an increase in GFAP in the rat brain, with a tendency to astrogliosis development, under the influence of systemic deficiencies in myocardial function. The use of corvitin at a dose of 42 mg/kg for five days after a cardiac attack caused by pituitary-izadrin leads to recovery in the balance of the studied proteins...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a mathematical model}} to study the in vivo keratin organization in terms of repartition of the keratin material between three different structural states: <b>soluble</b> proteins, <b>filament</b> precursors and filamentous state. The model describes a cycle of assembly and disassembly of keratin material. A generic nucleation function and structural stability of filament precursors are assumed. It is established that the three structural states always coexist and that the repartition of keratin material never exhibits any cyclic behaviour. Under some conditions, it is shown that {{the choice of the}} nucleation function does not affect the qualitative behaviour of the system. However, it might change the stable repartition of the keratin material in the cell...|$|R
40|$|The chronic {{effects of}} low doses of cadmium on the {{distribution}} of <b>soluble</b> and <b>filament</b> forms of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and their polypeptide fragments {{in different parts of the}} rat brain were investigated. Obtained results showed dose-dependent effect of cadmium on the soluble form of GFAP and more pronounced effect on the filament form and composition of the polypeptide fragments of the protein in the rat brain. Prolonged intoxication by cadmium ions in a dose of 1. 0 µg/kg of body weight induced a significant decrease in soluble GFAP and an increase in the filament form in the rat brain, pointing to the development of reactive astrogliosis and the risk of neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|Keratins 8 and 18 (K 8 / 18) are {{intermediate}} filament proteins expressed {{specifically in}} simple epithelial tissues. Dynamic equilibrium of these phosphoglycoproteins in the <b>soluble</b> and <b>filament</b> pool {{is an important}} determinant of their cellular functions, and it {{is known to be}} regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. However, {{little is known about the}} role of dynamic O-GlcNAcylation on this keratin pair. Here, by comparing immortalized (Chang) and transformed hepatocyte (HepG 2) cell lines, we have demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation of K 8 / 18 exhibits a positive correlation with their solubility (Nonidet P- 40 extractability). Heat stress, which increases K 8 / 18 solubility, resulted in a simultaneous increase in O-GlcNAc on these proteins. Conversely, increasing O-GlcNAc levels were associated with a concurrent increase in their solubility. This was also associated with a notable decrease in total cellular levels of K 8 / 18. Unaltered levels of transcripts and the reduced half-life of K 8 and K 18 indicated their decreased stability on increasing O-GlcNAcylation. On the contrary, the K 18 glycosylation mutant (K 18 S 29 A/S 30 A/S 48 A) was notably more stable than the wild type K 18 in Chang cells. The K 18 -O-GlcNAc mutant accumulated as aggregates upon stable expression, which possibly altered endogenous filament architecture. These results strongly indicate the involvement of O-GlcNAc on K 8 / 18 in regulating their solubility and stability, which may have a bearing on the functions of these keratins...|$|R
30|$|However, as Pei et al. (2015) {{observed}} {{because the}} 3 D filament material (PLA) {{used in our}} process is water soluble, future designers may {{need to use a}} different plastic as well as a different 3 D printer to create zero-waste notions that can be applied to ready-to-wear washable garments. Designers {{may not be able to}} use biodegradable material. To address this possible sustainability and waste issue, additional research on washability and durability is needed to supply information on the suitability of the raw materials for end uses. Samuels and Flowers (2015) reported that PLA appliqués remained attached after a 45 -min detergent-free, delicate wash cycle with warm water. They speculated, however, that “rougher washing cycles, higher wash temperatures, detergents, and dryer temperatures may cause PLA breakdown” (p. 20). In the future, when embracing the zero-waste philosophy, 3 D printing technology industries will need to develop non-water <b>soluble,</b> sustainable extrusion <b>filaments</b> for use in apparel and fashion.|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceuticals and {{personal}} care products (PPCPs) are ubiquitous in wastewater streams, but little is known regarding their roles in membrane fouling during the operation of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This study attempted to understand the role of ciprofloxacin exposure in control of filamentous bulking as well as membrane fouling mitigation. Compared with the control MBR, {{results show that the}} ciprofloxacin could selectively inhibit and kill filaments present in the mixed liquor, and, as a consequence, the sludge settleability improved significantly. The addition of ciprofloxacin had little influence on organic removals and nitrification, but had an adverse effect on denitrification. In addition, the sludge flocs exposure to ciprofloxacin still kept in compact structure; specifically, granular sludge was finally formed possibly due to the increase of polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) corroborated the enrichment of polysaccharides in the EPS exposure to ciprofloxacin. On the other hand, because of the release of EPS and the decay of <b>filaments,</b> <b>soluble</b> microbial products (SMP), particularly soluble polysaccharides, increased significantly in the MBR exposure to ciprofloxacin. Despite this, {{the results of this study}} show that the presence of trace contaminants in wastewater streams may play some positive roles in MBR fouling control...|$|R
40|$|Inside the {{interphase}} cell, approximately 5 % of {{the total}} intermediate filament protein exists in a soluble form. Past studies using velocity gradient sedimentation (VGS) indicate that <b>soluble</b> intermediate <b>filament</b> protein exists as an approximately 7 S tetrameric species. While studying intermediate filament assembly dynamics in the Xenopus oocyte, we used both VGS and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to analyze the soluble form of keratin. Previous studies (Coulombe, P. A., and E. Fuchs. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111 : 153) report that tetrameric keratins migrate on SEC with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150, 000; the major soluble form of keratin in the oocyte, in contrast, migrates with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 750, 000. During oocyte maturation, the keratin system disassembles into a soluble form (Klymkowsky, M. W., L. A. Maynell, and C. Nislow. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 114 : 787) {{and the amount of}} the 750 -kD keratin complex increases dramatically. Immunoprecipitation analysis of soluble keratin from matured oocytes revealed the presence of type I and type II keratins, but no other stoichiometrically associated polypeptides, suggesting that the 750 -kD keratin complex is composed solely of keratin. To further study the formation of the 750 -kD keratin complex, we used rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL). The 750 -kD keratin complex was formed in RRLs contranslating type I and type II Xenopus keratins, but not when lysates translated type I or type II keratin RNAs alone. The 750 -kD keratin complex could be formed posttranslationally in an ATP-independent manner when type I and type II keratin translation reactions were mixed. Under conditions of prolonged incubation, such as occur during VGS analysis, the 750 -kD keratin complex disassembled into a 7 S (by VGS), 150 -kD (by SEC) form. In urea denaturation studies, the 7 S/ 150 -kD form could be further disassembled into an 80 -kD species that consists of cofractionating dimeric and monomeric keratin. Based on these results, the 750 -kD species appears to be a supratetrameric complex of keratins and is the major, soluble form of keratin in both prophase and M-phase oocytes, and RRL reactions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between Consumption of large doses of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the behaviour and brain morphobiochemistry of normal growing rats. Four groups of rats were treated with LAB Cultures twice daily for 6 months. The control group received 1 ml of saline per treatment, while two experimental groups received I nil of living bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum, respectively) and the remaining group received a heat-treated (inactivated) L. fermentum culture. After 2 and 6 months of treatment, respectively, eight animals from each group were sacrificed, and specimens were taken for further analyses. The behaviour of the rats was evaluated five times in an open-field test at monthly intervals throughout the study. Lactobacilli treatment for 2 months induced changes in the motoric behaviour of the rats. The concentration of the astrocytesoluble and filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) decreased in the posterior part of the hemispheres, including the thalamus, hippocampus and cortex of the rats treated with L. fermentum. A greater decrease in filament GFAP (up to 50 %) was shown in the group receiving the live from of L. fermentum. In contrast, the GFAP in the live L. plantarum-treated group increased, showing elevated levels of the <b>Soluble</b> and <b>filament</b> forms of GFAP in the posterior part of the hemispheres. A 60 - 66 % decrease in the amount of the astrocyte-specific Ca-binding protein S- 100 b was shown in the posterior parts of the hemispheres and in the hindbrain of rats given LAB for 2 months. Prolonged feeding with LAB for 4 months up to full adulthood led to a further decrease in astrocytc reaction, reflected as all additional decrease in the amount Of Soluble GEAP and locomotor activity in all experimental groups. The changes in filament GFAP and S- 100 b appeared to disappear after prolonged feeding (total of 6 months) with LAB. In summary, LAB dietary treatment affected the ontogenetic development of the astrocytes, with the highest intensity observed in the early stages of rat development. It can be postulated that LAB treatment may play a preventive role in neurological diseases by decreasing astrocyte reaction and, consequently, lowering locomotor activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|After in vitro-induced {{neoplastic}} transformation by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), altered actin {{organization in}} pulmonary epithelial cells was examined. A certain correlation {{was found between}} anchorage independency (A 1), tumorigenicity in nude mice and altered actin organization. DNase 1 inhibition assay demonstrated significant loss of detergent-insoluble F-actin (stress fibers, p less than 0, 02) and <b>soluble</b> F-actin (single <b>filaments,</b> p less than 0, 0001) after A 1 transformation in comparison with untransformed cells, while the level of G-actin increased significantly (p less than 0, 0001). At the same time, fluorescence and electron microscopy also revealed that after A 1 transformation there was a striking loss of stress fibers usually accompanied by reorganization of {{at least some of}} the lost stress fibers into F-actin aggregations. After s. c. implantation of A 1 -transformed cells into nude mice followed by recultivation of the developed tumors, DNase 1 -inhibition assay showed a significant increase (p less than 0, 001) in the level of detergent-insoluble F-actin as compared with untransformed cells, but no significant difference in the amount of G-actin. However, most of this increased detergent-insoluble F-actin was in the form of aggregations as revealed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. This growth behaviour-dependent alteration in actin organization occurring after exposure to MNNG may be causally related to the progressive development of neoplastic phenotypes, although the biological significance of actin aggregation formation remains unclear. The results have also pointed out the importance of parallel investigations into both the biochemical and morphological statuses of actin, particularly when it may be regarded as an indicator of neoplastic transformation and malignancy...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of hyperthyreosis on oxidative stress, state of glial intermediate filaments and memotry was investigated. Significant increasing of lipid peroxidation products into both hippocampus and cortex and {{change for the}} worse of memory was observed. Analysis of the behavioral reactions of rats in the test of passive avoidance conditioned reflex showed that the acquisition of skills of all groups of animals did not differ by time waiting period (latent period). Time saving memory test conditioned reflex of passive avoidance was excellent {{in the group of}} rats treated with thyroxine compared with controls. The change of polypeptide GFAP was observed in hippocampus and cortex. Both soluble and filamentous forms of GFAP increased in hippocampus of rat with hyperthyreosis. In filament fractions, increase in the intensity of 49 kDa polypeptide band was found. In the same fraction of insoluble cytoskeleton proteins degraded HFKB polypeptides with molecular weight in the region of 46 – 41 kDa appeared. Marked increase of degraded polypeptides was found in the soluble fraction of the brain stem. The intensity of the intact polypeptide (49 kDa), {{as well as in the}} filament fraction, significantly increased. It is possible that increasing concentrations of <b>soluble</b> subunits glial <b>filaments</b> may be due to dissociation of own filaments during the reorganization of cytoskeleton structures. Given the results of Western blotting for filament fraction, increased content of soluble intact 49 kDa polypeptide is primarily the result of increased expression of HFKB and only partly due to redistribution of existing filament structures. Calculation and analysis of indicators showed high correlation between the increase in content and peroxidation products of HFKB. These results indicate the important role of oxidative stress in the induction of astroglial reactive response under conditions of hyperthyroidism. This data shows the possibility of the glial cell cytoskeleton reconstruction under effect of thyroid hormones...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether the {{antioxidant}} alpha-lipoic acid protects neurons from diabetic-reperfusion injury. The streptozotocin (STZ) rat model was used to study the glial reactivity and prevention of gliosis by alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) administration. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was determined, as well as lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glu-tathione (GSH) levels in some brain tissues. We observed significant increasing of lipid peroxidation products in both hippocampus and cortex. Changesof polypeptide GFAP were observed in hippocampus and cortex. Both soluble and filamentous forms of GFAP featured the increase in hippocampus of rat with hyperthyreosis. In the filamentfractions, increase in the intensity of 49 kDa polypeptide band was found. In the same fraction of insoluble cytoskeleton proteins degraded HFKB polypeptides with molecular weight in the range of 46 – 41 kDa appeared. Markedincrease of degraded polypeptides was found in the soluble fraction of the brain stem. The intensity of the intact polypeptide – 49  kDa, as well as in the filament fraction, significantly increased. It is possible that increasing concentrations of <b>soluble</b> subunits glial <b>filaments</b> may be due to dissociation of own filaments during the reorganization of cytoskeleton structures. Given the results of Western blotting for filament fraction, increased content of soluble intact 49 kDa polypeptide is primarily the result of increased expression of HFKB and only partly due to redistribution of existing filament structures. Calculation and analysis of indicators showed high correlation between the increase in content and peroxidation products of HFKB. These results indicate the important role of oxidative stress in the induction of astroglial response under conditions of diabet encefalopathia. Administration of alpha-LA reduced the expression both of glial and neuronal markers. In addition, alpha-LA significantly prevented the increase in LPO levels found in diabetic rats. GSH levels increased by the administration of alpha-LA. This study suggests that alpha-LA prevents neural injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and suppressing reactive gliosis. All these changes were clearly counteracted by alpha-lipoic acid. The results of this study demonstrate that alpha-lipoic acid provides for protection to the GFAP, as a whole, from diabet -reperfusion injuries...|$|R
40|$|Systems biology aims to {{understand}} the emergence of biological functions from underlying interaction networks. The behavior of these networks is stochastic, making the investigation of cell-to-cell variability {{an important aspect of}} systems biology. The proteome defines the functional capacity of a cell at a certain point in time. Thus, tools and assays that investigate the concentrations, locations, functions and interactions of proteins at the single cell level will provide new insights in fundamental biology and biomedicine. However, due to the huge diversity of protein species, the dynamic range of protein expression levels, the minute sample volumes, and the lack of amplification techniques, single-cell proteomic studies remain a challenging task, that requires novel and correlative approaches. This is especially true for the analysis of eukaryotic cells, which still challenges existing techniques. This thesis is part of a project that aims to establish a new approach to proteomic studies on single eukaryotic cells. The project is based on the idea to physically lyse single cells and spread their components onto sample carriers for visual and mass analysis by electron microscopy (EM) and mass spectrometry (MS). The work presented in this thesis focuses on the implementation of some of the basic microfluidic modules that {{will be part of the}} envisaged sample preparation pipeline. The microfluidic pipeline must both prepare the lysate of single cells and deposit it on the sample carriers in an efficient and unbiased manner. A prototype consisting of a versatile conditioning module for in-line sample conditioning and a hand-over module for lossless sample deposition and micro-patterning of EM grids was built. The implemented semiautomatic procedure is capable of processing minute sample volumes and the transferred test samples are suitable for structural analysis by negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Further results showed that this method can be used to process the total content of cell lysates; lysate components, such as <b>soluble</b> proteins, <b>filaments</b> and membranes were efficiently stained and clearly resolved on the TEM images; stain quality was excellent and highly reproducible. In addition initial tests demonstrated that the modules could be used to prepare sample grids that are suitable for mass determination by scanning TEM (STEM). Further development of the hand-over module focused on its adaption to MS sample carriers. With this modification, the setup was successfully applied to spot sample-matrix mixtures onto MS plates, resulting in homogenous sample spots for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS analysis. The next aim was to collect single cell samples. A module allowing single-cell lysis and rapid uptake of the cell lysate was developed to achieve this. Using a freely positionable microcapillary electrode this module is capable of targeting individual adherent cells in situ under light microscopy (LM) observation. It allows fast electrical lysis of single cells followed by rapid aspiration of the cellular components into the microcapillary. The combination with LM enables live cell monitoring and thus facilitates the evaluation of the lysis and aspiration procedure as well as the correlation of LM information with subsequently derived data. The investigation of single cell lysate samples by classical negative stain TEM revealed the presence of several cellular components, such as membrane patches, filaments and other prominent structures with distinctive shapes. This preliminary data indicates that the whole lysate of individual cells can be prepared for a visual investigation by negative stain TEM. The modules developed during this thesis provide novel and promising methods for the analysis of the protein content of single eukaryotic cells and their combination will result in a versatile sample preparation pipeline that can be applied to biological questions on the single cell level. ...|$|R
