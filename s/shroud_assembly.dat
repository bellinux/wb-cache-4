5000|$|During 1975-1976, further {{refinements}} to the Models 14 and 15 {{were incorporated into}} production as the MOdels 14-2 and 15-2. The Model 15-2 became the most well known and the best selling Dan Wesson revolver model to go into production. The 15-2 used a roll pin inserted into the frame as a centering dowel combined with a precisely drilled hole in each <b>shroud</b> <b>assembly</b> to facilitate proper shroud centering and alignment, thus {{eliminating the need for}} flanged barrel shrouds. The 15-2 introduced more barrel and shroud options, including barrel/shroud lengths of 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 inches, partial or fully lugged shrouds with choices of solid or ventilated ribs, plus removable and interchangeable front sights. The Model 15-2 could be ordered as [...] "Pistol Pacs" [...] with 3 (initially) and later 4 (or more) barrel/shroud sets shipped inside a fiberglass briefcase with barrel changing tool and clearance gauges; however, most pistols were sold with only one barrel, with the buyers able to purchase other barrels later. All barrels and shrouds within a model series are compatible, thus a Model 15-2 frame from the 1970s may be equipped with a barrel from the 1990s and shroud made in 2016. The 15-2 increased sales markedly over the earlier models, and were often seen in use with both target shooters and hunters.|$|E
40|$|The {{analytical}} {{effort was}} directed towards (1) completing {{the design of}} the combustor exit instrumentation assembly, (2) analyzing the coolant flow distribution of the cowl leading edge tip section, (3) determining effects of purge gas pressure on AIM performance analysis, and (4) analyzing heat transfer and associated stress problems related to the cowl leading edge tip section and the nozzle <b>shroud</b> <b>assembly</b> for test conditions...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of {{numerical}} analysis methods has {{been required to}} solve complicated phenomena that occur in nuclear facilities. Particularly, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) behavior should be resolved for accurate design and evaluation of complex reactor vessel internals (RVIs) submerged in coolant. In this study, the FSI effect on dynamic characteristics of RVIs in a typical 1, 000 MWe nuclear power plant was investigated. Modal analyses of an integrated assembly were conducted by employing the fluid-structure (F-S) model {{as well as the}} traditional added-mass model. Subsequently, structural analyses were carried out using design response spectra combined with modal analysis data. Analysis results from the F-S model led to reductions of both frequency and Tresca stress compared to those values obtained using the added-mass model. Validation of the analysis method with the FSI model was also performed, from which the interface between the upper guide structure plate and the core <b>shroud</b> <b>assembly</b> lug was defined as the critical location of the typical RVIs, while all the relevant stress intensities satisfied the acceptance criteria...|$|E
40|$|The High Flux Isotope Reactor {{utilizes}} large underwater fuel-storage arrays {{to stage}} irradiated fuel {{before it is}} shipped from the facility. Cadmium is required as a thermal neutron absorber in these fuel-storage arrays to produce an acceptable margin of nuclear subcriticality during both normal and off-normal operating conditions. Due to incomplete documentation {{from the time of}} their fabrication, the presence of cadmium within two stainless-steel parts of fuel-storage arrays must be experimentally verified before they are reused in new fuel-storage arrays. A cadmium-verification program has been developed in association with the Waste Examination and Assay Facility located at the Oak Ridge national Laboratory to nondestructively examine these older <b>shroud</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The program includes the following elements (1) x-ray analog imaging, (2) x-ray digital imaging, (3) prompt-gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements, and (4) neutron-transmission measurements. X-ray digital imaging utilizes an analog-to-digital convertor to record attenuated x-ray intensities observed on a fluorescent detector by a video camera. These x-ray intensities are utilized in expressions for cadmium thickness based upon x-ray attenuation theory...|$|R
50|$|A ducted {{propeller}}, {{also known}} as a Kort nozzle, is a propeller fitted with a non-rotating nozzle. It is used to improve the efficiency of the propeller and is especially used on heavily loaded propellers or propellers with limited diameter. It was developed by Luigi Stipa (1931) and Ludwig Kort (1934). The Kort nozzle is a <b>shrouded</b> propeller <b>assembly</b> for marine propulsion. The hydrodynamic design of the shroud, which is shaped like a foil, offers advantages for certain conditions over bare propellers.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the mode localization phenomenon associated with mistuning is presented for <b>shrouded</b> blade <b>assemblies.</b> The calculations {{are based on a}} generic finite element model, which permits modeling of arbitrary mistuning and both slipping and nonslipping shroud interfaces. The results presented indicate that interactions occur between mistuning and slip effects, with maximum mode localization occurring when the shrouds slip freely. Certain modes are found to be very sensitive to shroud slip, and in some cases completely change character when slip occurs. Mode localization is most pronounced in the predominantly bending modes, and varies considerably from mode to mode. As the ratio of interblade coupling strength to mistuning strength is increased, the effect of mistuning is observed to decrease significantly. This result has important implications for the flutter problem, since it suggests that the stabilization effect available from mistuning is significantly less for a shrouded rotor as compared to an unshrouded rotor...|$|R
40|$|The NTS-II Laser Retroreflector {{consists}} of a honeycomb tray onto which are mounted 44 fused silica cube corners with a 50 -millimeter hexagonal entrance pupil and single infrared cube. A thermal shield with a highly reflective outer surface and a black inner surface was incorporated to <b>shroud</b> the <b>assembly</b> protecting it from extreme high temperature exposure thus reducing cube corner thermal distortions to a minimum. A dummy retroreflector, utilizing simulated aluminum cube corners was fabricated and vibration tested to qualification levels to substantiate {{the integrity of the}} tray and cube mounting clips. This dummy was further used in the spacecraft spin balance test. The flight Laser Retroreflector was tested to the flight level vibration spectrum to verify that the unit will survive its expected vibration environment. During this test several GFE cube corners exhibited slight crazing at the clip support mounting holes. These cubes were reworked and retested and proved to be satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} rotor <b>assembly</b> <b>shroud</b> includes {{at least}} one reinforcing flange on the upper surface of the shroud. The strength provided by the reinforcing flange allows for a smaller shroud thickness resulting in a net reduction of shroud mass. The lower shroud mass reduces the centrifugal stress on the rotor assembly blade during operation. The strength provided by the reinforcing flanges also significantly reduces the centrifugal bending stress on the shroud during operation. The shroud mass may be further reduced by tapering the shroud {{leading and trailing edges}} or, for shrouds incorporating a damper, by providing a damper cavity with a lower diameter surface defining an opening therethrough...|$|R
50|$|Steam Generator {{has three}} basic {{components:}} a coil of water tubes, {{surrounded by a}} series of burner assemblies, and covered with an insulated <b>shroud.</b> Each burner <b>assembly</b> consists of an air blower, which blows pre-heated air into the combustion chamber, a fuel atomizer, and an igniter. The blower and atomizer are arranged so that the flame front is tangential to the water-tube coils. Cyclone Power Technologies claims this arrangement allows the heavier particles in the fuel to circle the outside of the chamber until they are completely burned up, allowing for much cleaner, complete combustion of fuel, and resulting in cleaner emissions. However, they have not performed any testing to verify this theory.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is now {{increasingly}} {{necessary to}} predict accurately, {{at the design stage}} and without excessive computing costs, the dynamic behaviour of rotating parts of turbomachines, so that resonant conditions at operating speeds are avoided. In this study, global rotating mode shapes of flexible <b>shrouded</b> bladed disc-shaft <b>assemblies</b> are calculated. The rotating modes have been calculated {{by using a}} finite element cyclic symmetry approach. Rotational effects, such as centrifugal stiffening have been accounted for, and all the possible couplings between the flexible parts have been allowed. Gyroscopic effects have been neglected. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental. The calculations show the influence of shaft flexibility on the natural frequencies of shrouded bladed discs up to four nodal diameters for the two first frequencies series...|$|R
40|$|The Westinghouse 4 -Loop PWR is a 3411 MWth Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The {{reactor core}} {{consists}} of 193 fuel assemblies within the core <b>shroud.</b> Each fuel <b>assembly</b> is arranged in 17 x 17 arrays and includes 264 fuel rods, 24 control rod guide tubes and one instrument tube. The objective of thermal and hydrodynamic design is to safely remove of the generated {{heat in the}} fuel without producing excessive fuel temperatures or steam void formations and without approaching the critical heat flux under steady-state operating conditions. This paper presents reactor core and fuel assembly modeling of the Westinghouse 4 -Loop NPP using the thermo hydraulic subchannel analysis COBRA-EN code. The results of this modeling are compared with the VIPRE- 01 thermal hydraulic code. The study involves {{the determination of the}} departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) in the hot channel of the reactor core, the temperature profiles, heat flux and pressure drop across the hottest channel of the hot assemblies. The obtained results shows that the good agreements are exist between the COBRA-EN and VIPRE- 01 thermal hydraulic codes...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} {{investigation of}} the effects of uncertainty in root fixity on the free vibration of turbine blades is made. Emphasis is particularly placed on the statistical properties of the random eigenvalues and essentially on their standard deviations. These are evaluated using the direct product technique between matrices [1] and validated by Monte Carlo SImulations (MCS). The studied system is a simplified model of a <b>shrouded</b> blade <b>assembly</b> under the conditions of weak interblade coupling. It essentially consists of a cyclic chain of continuous beams with identical properties, fixed at one end via rotational springs with random stiffnesses representing the uncertain roots stiffnesses and coupled via linear springs at their tips. Finite Element Method is used as a discretization technique to obtain the equations of motion of the tuned and mistuned systems and the corresponding random eigenvalue problem. Numerical simulations show that small differences between the rotational springs stiffnesses spolit the natural frequencies that were in pairs, increase the width of each frequency-cluster and strongly localizes the vibration around one blade. This strong localization has been shown to occur in a chain of single-degree-of-freedom, nearly identical, coupled oscillators if the coupling frequency between the subsystems is of order of, or smaller than the spread in the natural frequencies [2] However, for the multi-degree-of-freedom and randomly mistuned system considered her, multiple realizations are required to capture the behaviour of the eigenvalues appearing in frequency-clusters. It is found that for each frequency-cluster, when the standard deviations of theeigenvalues are plotted against the mode number, they form a U-shaped curve. For the particular case when the coupling frequency line crosses a curve, this essentially shows that the vibration localization is stronger at the first and last modes than at the mid frequencies, which belong to one passband in the tuned system...|$|R
40|$|Configuration of VVER- 440 fuel {{assemblies}} was continuously upgraded {{throughout the}} whole period of these reactors operation. The trend towards further enhancing the fuel cycle economy while maintaining its safety has now resulted {{in the development of}} the feasibility study for a third-generation fuel assembly, which incorporates the following improvements: • fuel <b>assembly</b> <b>shroud</b> replaced with stiffening angles; • reduced fuel element diameter (higher water-uranium ratio); • reduced fuel element cladding thickness from the inside (possibility to load more uranium); • increased fuel pellet diameter and elimination of its axial hole (higher uranium mass in the fuel assembly); • increased fuel rod lattice pitch • replacement of several fuel elements in the fuel assembly with various displacers; • fuel enrichment increased up to 4. 95 % of U- 235. This paper summarizes the results of calculations of the principal neutronic parameters of various configurations of VVER- 440 third-generation assemblies (RK- 3). It also summarizes the computational studies of fuel loads with various RK- 3 options, as well as the computational analyses of fuel elements behavior in RK- 3 assemblies. The paper also includes technicoeconomic assessments of fuel cycles using different RK- 3 assembly option...|$|R
5000|$|New planes {{outdated}} the Torpedo Mark 13, but drag {{rings and}} stabilizers renewed its usefulness. Throughout 1943 torpedo performance remained poor, but {{the following year}} witnessed {{a revolution in the}} behavior of the Mark 13. Minor changes to the propeller blades and a reduction in gyro damage helped, but the greatest improvement resulted from the stabilizing effects of two appendages--the drag ring and the <b>shroud</b> ring.The first <b>assembly,</b> known familiarly as the pickle barrel, was readied for use by 1944. Early experiments with parachutes attached to aircraft torpedoes had demonstrated that a drag had a beneficial effect on the airflight characteristics of the weapon. While parachutes did not appear be the solution to the problem, discovery of the principle involved {{led to the development of}} the drag ring. Constructed of plywood, the ring was attached to the head of a torpedo and served as a stabilizer for the period that the weapon was airborne. Oscillations were reduced and the ring effected a 40 percent deceleration in air speed, then acted as a shock absorber when the torpedo struck water. Better water entry, a byproduct of air stabilization, reduced damage so substantially that pilots were able to increase the heights and speeds at which torpedoes were released.The drag ring went a long way toward making the Mark 13 a reliable torpedo, but underwater performance still called for improvement. By midsummer 1944, however, the shroud ring developed by the California Institute of Technology completed the torpedo revolution that had seemed so remote the year before. Almost an exact duplicate of an assembly developed by Newport in 1871, the shroud ring was made to fit over the tail blades of the torpedo. Known to pilots as the ring tail, it produced a steady water run by reducing hooks and broaches and eliminating much of the water roll which characterized the Mark 13. Speed and range were reduced but slightly. Early tests showed that ring-tailed torpedoes took too deep an initial dive, but readjustments of controls soon remedied that last obstacle. Hot, straight, and normal runs approached 100 percent, and the once critical battle reports soon became enthusiastic in praise of the Mark 13. Even psychologically, the appendages contributed to success,since the external design of the torpedo equipped with a pickle barrel and ring tail and the improved appearance of its underwater travel caught the fancy of the airmen.To speed the availability of the modified torpedo the Bureau built tail <b>assemblies</b> with the <b>shroud</b> ring attached, then sent them to the fleet as substitutes for the equipment on hand. By the fall of 1944 the revamped weapon had a wide distribution. As a result of the new improvements, torpedo drops at altitudes up to 800 feet and at speeds up to 300 knots were authorized. Experience soon indicated that these limits could be extended even further. On one occasion in early 1945, 6 Mark 13 torpedoes were released from altitudes between 5000 and 7000 feet; 5 out of the 6 were observed to run hot, straight, and normal. Combat use increased rapidly and the new effectiveness seemed out of all proportion to the changes made. On one air strike on April 7, 1945. Mark 13's sent to the bottom the 45,000 ton (sic) battleship Yamato, a light cruiser, and several destroyers. Months before the end of the war the Mark 13 was universally accepted as the best aircraft torpedo owned by any nation.|$|R
