Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellite,</b> tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E

40|$|Rendezvous {{techniques}} between <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellites</b> {{were found}} using a cotangential elliptic phasing (CEP) transfer. This transfer is a closed elliptic orbit which is cotangent to the synchronous orbits {{of the chase}} vehicle and target satellite. The cotangent point lies on the line of apsides of the transfer orbit which coincides with the line of intersection of the synchronous orbits. The rendezvous maneuvers accomplish plane changes and phase shifts simultaneously, and these maneuvers {{are found to be}} optimal when the plane change is split equally between the velocity increments. The CEP transfer can be extended to several revolutions for a further reduction of fuel usage. A set of <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellites</b> was used in a simulated mission.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{method is}} analytically shown for multiplying {{the number of}} orbital slots for <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellites.</b> This is by radially tethering <b>satellites</b> above the <b>synchronous</b> orbit (forces outwards) balanced to satellites below this orbit (forces inwards).

Thus, several thousand miles of <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellites</b> can be radiated along a small tether line sized for tension of about one percent of a satellite weight. A vertical tether line also provides a track for transport, that is, a ladder or elevator. Analysis for an optimized diameter tether line is developed which is particularly effective when the tether, line is extended to the ground, thus, making a space ladder.

The 16 day EOS periodicity may be shown with the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) {{and the entire}} 16 day period should be simulated for representative link statistics. We desire many attributes of the downlink, however, and a faster orbital determination method is desirable. We use the method of osculating elements for speed and accuracy in simulating the EOS orbit. The accuracy of the method of osculating elements is demonstrated by closely reproducing the observed 16 day Landsat periodicity. An autocorrelation function method is used to show the correlation spike at 16 days. The entire 16 day record of passes over McMurdo Sound is then used to generate statistics for innage time, outage time, elevation angle, antenna angle rates, and propagation loss. The levation angle probability density function is compared with 1967 analytic approximation which {{has been used for}} medium to high altitude satellites.
