5|$|In 1948, Hawks made Red River, an epic western {{reminiscent}} of Mutiny on the Bounty <b>starring</b> John Wayne and Montgomery Clift {{in his first}} film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film Ball of Fire as A Song Is Born, this time <b>starring</b> Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy I Was a Male War Bride, also <b>starring</b> Ann Sheridan.|$|E

Hawks's final two films were both Western remakes of Rio Bravo <b>starring</b> John Wayne. In 1966, Hawks directed El Dorado, <b>starring</b> Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made Rio Lobo, with Wayne in 1970.|$|E

A double <b>star</b> may be determined to be optical if its components have sufficiently different proper motions or different radial velocities, or if parallax measurements reveal its two components to be at sufficiently different distances from the Earth.
