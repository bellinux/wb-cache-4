The lowest order concomitant fields depend quadratically on the imaging gradient amplitude and inversely on the static field strength.

We adopt ideas from spatial statistics literature, and design two spatial statistical measures of dispersion and periodicity, which are computed over spatial point patterns generated from blocks of the scanned image, and whose distributions provide the features for making a decision. We utilize extensive training data and determined well separated decision regions to classify the input media.

The system is especially designed to diagnose and analyse condition of tunnels such as crack widths using the captured images. The system consists of two major parts, the image acquisition system and image merging system. To save the <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> to storage media in real-time, the image acquisition system has been designed with two different control modules and management modules. The control modules {{are in charge of}} the hardware device control and the management modules handle system resources so that the scanned images are safely saved to the magnetic storage devices. The system can be mounted to various kinds of vehicles. After taking images, the image merging system is used for generating an extended image by combining saved images. Several tests were conducted in laboratory as well as in field environment. In the laboratory simulation, both systems are tested in several times and upgraded. In the field-testing, the image acquisition system is mounted to a specially designed vehicle and images of the interior surface of the tunnel is captured. The system is successfully tested in a real tunnel with a vehicle of speed 20 km/h. The captured images of the tunnel condition, including cracks, are as vivid as the view an expert could assess seeing through his/her eyes.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the course}} of an {{industrial}} research project a high-speed optical surface defect detection system was developed. The material to inspect is piston ring wire. Main condition was to continuously inspect the whole surface without slowing down the production speed of 0. 5 to 1. 5 meters per second. The minimum defect size was defined by 100 µm extension in one dimension at wire perimeters up to 40 millimeters. This leads to an amount of up to 120 megabyte of <b>image</b> <b>data</b> to acquire and process in a second. To meet this requirements on one hand fast hardware components (cameras, frame grabber) had to be utilized for grabbing the <b>image</b> <b>data.</b> On the other hand high-speed image processing algorithms had to be developed to compute features which can indicate defects out of the <b>image</b> <b>data.</b> The developed <b>image</b> processing algorithm is based on the computation of higher statistical moments, {{which turned out to be}} well suitable to distinguish between the gaussian distribution of the <b>image</b> <b>data</b> from faultless surface and disturbed statistical distributions in the presence of defects. The adaptation of this concept to line <b>scan</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> and the implementation on on-board processors necessitates some modifications, which result in increasing processing speed, better localization of the defects and higher sensitivity.

40|$|AbstractDensity is a {{physical}} characteristic which depends on the experimental technique used and structural properties of food. True, apparent, and bulk are different types of densities based on the way volume is measured. For porous foods such as grain food products, accurate measurement of density is challenging. Current measurement techniques for food density are inconsistent and nutrient databases do not have sufficient density data. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laser scanners are non-destructive diagnostic tools for characterizing food microstructure. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) optimize the parameters of CT, MRI, and laser scanner to determine food density and compare the corresponding values with other traditional techniques, and 2) to develop neural networks as a prediction method for apparent and bulk densities. MicroCT 40 (Scano Medical Inc.), Lightspeed QX/i clinical CT (GE Healthcare), and 3 Tesla Signa HDx MRI (GE Healthcare) were used to acquire 3 D images of foods for true density. A 3 D laser scanner (NextEngine, Inc) was used to scan the foods items for apparent density. Neural networks were used in conjunction with the data collected from laser scanner and using food composition and processing conditions to generate a black-box prediction scheme. The results of CT, MRI, and laser scanner showed great potential to estimate density in comparison to traditional techniques. Porosity was estimated from the CT and MRI <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>data.</b> Laser scanner was successful in acquiring 3 D images and calculating apparent density.

With new advances {{made in the}} generation, manipulation, and detection of terahertz radiation, terahertz imaging has found its application as inspection tools {{in a wide range}} of areas including biomedicine, materials science, and aerospace industries. In the field of medical imaging, terahertz (THz) has emerged as a new imaging modality due to some fundamental physical properties of the THz wave. THz imaging has been used to examine various biological structures, and THz tomography has been developed to probe the 3 D structures of those samples. THz pulsed imaging (TPI) is one of the THz imaging technologies that have been developed and used to inspect different types of biological structures. Specifically, it has been used to examine breast cancer tumors in hope of providing accurate, fast, and convenient diagnosis. Several works have been published in this research area that demonstrate the potency of THz imaging in differentiating tumor regions from healthy tissue regions.

BSI for quantification of bone metastases may be a valuable complementary method for evaluation of treatment response in mCRPC patients. Patient summaryAn increase in Bone Scan Index (BSI) was associated with shorter time to disease progression in patients treated with ODM- 201. BSI may be a valuable method of complementing treatment response evaluation in patients with advanced prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cardiac {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) is mainly applied in myocardial perfusion and viability detection. Noninvasive imaging of myocardial innervation using PET is a valuable additional methodology in cardiac imaging. Novel methods and different PET ligands {{have been developed to}} measure presynaptic and postsynaptic function of the cardiac neuronal system. Obtained PET data can be analysed quantitatively or interpreted qualitatively. Thus far, PET is not a widely used clinical application in autonomic heart imaging; however, due to its technical advantages, the excellent properties of the imaging agents, and the availability of tools for quantification, it deserves a better position in the clinic. From a historical point of view, the focus of PET software packages for image analysis was mainly oncology and neurology driven. Actually, com-mercially available software for cardiac PET image anal-ysis is still only available for the quantification of myocardial blood flow. Thus far, no commercial software package is available for the interpretation and quantifica-tion of PET innervation <b>scans.</b> However, <b>image</b> <b>data</b> quantification and analysis of kinetic data can be performed using adjusted generic tools. This paper gives an overview of different neuronal PET ligands, interpretation and quantification of acquired PET data...|$|R
40|$|A {{large portion}} of digital <b>image</b> <b>data</b> {{available}} today is acquired using digital cameras or scanners. While cameras allow digital reproduction of natural scenes, scanners are often used to capture hardcopy art in more controlled scenarios. This paper proposes a new technique for non-intrusive scanner model identification, which can be further extended to perform tampering detection on <b>scanned</b> <b>images.</b> Using only <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> samples that contain arbitrary content, we construct a robust scanner identifier to determine the brand/model of the scanner used to capture each <b>scanned</b> <b>image.</b> The proposed scanner identifier is based on statistical features of scanning noise. We first analyze scanning noise from several angles, including through image de-noising, wavelet analysis, and neighborhood prediction, and then obtain statistical features from each characterization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify the correct scanner brands/models with high accuracy...|$|R
