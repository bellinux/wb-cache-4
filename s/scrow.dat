While {{she used to}} be able to shift between Elephant and human form, she is finding it increasingly difficult to do this, which leads her to believe she is dying. For giving her protection and a home, she agreed to become the leader of the <b>Scrow.</b> When she meets Liir, she explains that when Elphaba, besieged at Kiamo Ko by the Wizard's Gale Forces, sent out her Crows to ask for Nastoya's help, the Crows were attacked and devoured by nocturnal rocs, a circumstance of which Nastoya learned only later. Nastoya has been unsuccessfully trying to unite the tribes of the Vinkus—the <b>Scrow,</b> Yunamata and Arjikis—against the Wizard.|$|E

Nastoya is an Elephant who, because of the Wizard's pogrom against Animals, availed herself of a witch's charm that enabled her to {{transform}} into a human. Nastoya is slowly dying, and she asks Liir {{to find a way to}} enable her return to Elephant form before she dies. In return, she promises that she will try to learn about the fate of Nor, Fiyero's daughter, who, with her family, was taken by the Wizard's forces.

Liir comes {{up with the idea}} that Candle's music might release Nastoya from her human form, and he is correct: he has hung around Nastoya the {{preserved}} faces of scraping victims that he and Trism stole after poisoning the dragons (which were going to be displayed as an example of what would happen to those who defied the Emperor), and with Candle playing accompaniment, the faces sing about their lives. Somehow, this allows Nastoya to return to her Elephant form and she dies.|$|E

The coupling efficiency between the resonators, {{which can be}} controlled either by changing the slot position inside the cavity or by varying the separation distance between the rings, plays {{an essential role in}} controlling both group velocity and delay time of the suggested <b>SCROW.</b> The simulation results are obtained using multi-resolution time domain scheme in conjunction with uniaxial perfectly matched layer boundary conditions. By introducing a slot inside the microring resonator of the suggested structure, a quality factor of about 5 × 103 and high delay time are obtained with small ring size...|$|E
40|$|Augmenting {{the level}} of {{integration}} for a lower cost and enhancing {{the performance of the}} optical devices {{have turned out to be}} the focus of many research studies in the last few decades. Many distinct approaches have been proposed in a significant number of researches in order to meet these demands. Optical planar waveguides stand as one of vital employed approach in many studies. Although, their low propagation loss, and low dispersion, they suffers from high power losses at sharp bends. For this reason, large radius of curvature is required in order to achieve high efficiency and compromise the high level of integration. For the purpose of this research, in this thesis different ways to improve the performance of optical microcavity ring resonators (MRRs) have been thoroughly investigated and new configurations have been proposed. The Multiresolution Time Domain (MRTD) technique was further developed and employed throughout this thesis as the main numerical modelling technique. The MRTD algorithm is used as a computer code. This code is developed and enhanced using self built Compaq Visual Fortran code. Creating the structure and Post-processing the obtained data is carried out using self built MATLAB code. The truncating layers used to surround the computational domain were Uniaxial Perfectly Matched Layers (UPML). The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated via the excellent agreement between the results obtained in literature using FDTD method and the results of MRTD. This thesis has focused on showing numerical efficiency of MRTD where the mesh size allowed or the total number of computed points is about half that used with FDTD. Furthermore, the MRR geometry parameters such as coupling gap size, microring radius of curvature, and waveguide width have been thoroughly studied in order to predict and optimise the device performance. This thesis also presents the model analysis results of a parallel-cascaded double-microcavity ring resonator (PDMRR). The analysis is mainly focus on the extraction of the resonant modes where the effect of different parameters of the structure on transmitted and coupled power is investigated. Also, accurate analysis of 2 D coupled microcavity ring resonator based on slotted waveguides (SMRR) has been thoroughly carried out for the purpose of designing optical waveguide delay lines based on slotted ring resonator (<b>SCROW).</b> The <b>SCROW</b> presented in this thesis are newly designed to function according to the variation of the resonance coupling efficiency of a slotted ring resonators embedded between two parallel waveguides. The slot of the structures is filled with SiO 2 and Air that cause the coupling efficiency to vary which in turn control both the group velocity and delay time of <b>SCROW</b> structures results from the changing the properties of the bent slotted waveguide modes which strongly depends on the slot’s position. Significant improvements on the quality factor and greater delay time have been achieved by introducing sub-wavelength-low-index slot into conventional waveguide.

40|$|Several caldera volcanoes {{lie within}} the 6 km thick Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group of north-west England, {{which is a}} remnant of a Palaeozoic subaerial {{continental}} arc. Scafell caldera, > 140 km 2, is best known and intensively studied {{because it is a}} rare example, worldwide, where exhumation and glacial dissection reveals the entire succession of pre-caldera, caldera-fill and post-caldera lake succession along with the caldera floor faults, vents and domes. Several calc-alkaline high-K silicic ignimbrites and andesite pyroclastic units are associated with Scafell caldera and nearby Langdale caldera. Correlation of individual ignimbrites from the caldera fills to distal outflow sheets is hampered by their large number (> 18), by hydrothermal alteration, Acadian cleavage, thrusting, and regional prehnite-pumpellyite metamorphism. Therefore, most outflow ignimbrites have not yet been traced to their source areas. Building upon previous work on the calderas and to the south of those (around Coniston), targeted field-mapping has been successfully used in combination with a range of mostly ‘immobile’ trace-element ratios (e. g. Nb/Y, Zr/TiO 2, Th/Nb, Th/Y, V/Y) to resolve local successions and to confirm the presence of the Scafell caldera tuffs outflow sheets as far as 11 km south from Scafell caldera. The Coniston Fells succession is significantly revised, with new thickness estimates and the discovery of three high-level intrusions, the Oxendale-, Wetherlam-, and Glassy Crag Dacites, each geochemically distinct from Scafell units. A welded outflow sheet from Langdale caldera is identified 14 km southwest of the caldera for the first time. Moreover, the Lincomb Tarns Formations in the central Lake District differs geochemically from the unit mapped as this in the Coniston area, for which a new name (Foul <b>Scrow</b> Tuff Member) is proposed. Whole-rock trace-element geochemistry combined with detailed fieldwork proves to be an effective tool for correlating ancient ignimbrites even where there has been locally limited tectonic deformation and alteration...|$|E
