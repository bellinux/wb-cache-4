5|$|There {{has never}} been a serious {{accident}} at Charing Cross station itself. On 25 October 1913, two trains collided in thick fog at Waterloo junction, killing three people. On 31 July 1925, there was a minor <b>side-on</b> <b>collision</b> near platform 2.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January 2011, {{trainset}} 4654 partly derailed {{during a}} <b>side-on</b> <b>collision</b> with {{a freight train}} near Zevenaar in the Netherlands. There were no injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies are}} {{built around a}} control chassis, {{featuring}} a full roll cage, originally designed by PACE Innovations but which can be made, or partially made, by other accredited builders, including certain race teams. Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver {{in the event of}} a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a <b>side-on</b> <b>collision.</b> The cars also feature a collapsible steering column and a fire extinguisher system.|$|E
50|$|East {{and west}} of the station are sets of points leading to the {{platform}} tracks. Operations over the points toward the platform tracks can be run at 100 km/h. The main through tracks are protected by catch points against <b>side-on</b> <b>collisions</b> from trains running from the platform tracks.|$|R
40|$|Four side-on crash {{tests have}} been run, aiming at {{studying}} the crash {{safety of the}} combination of personal by worn police equipment and side-on crash protection in modern cars. The four tests involved a policeman (dummy) with and without personal equipment in a driving position in a vehicle with and without side-on crash protection. Very short, {{it can be said}} that the performed tests do not show any conflict between side-on crash protection in cars and the equipment worn on the uniform, but the fact that some police equipment is stiff, hard and angular increases the injury risk, however, not quantified in these tests. From a more strict crash safety perspective, most of the tested police-related equipment such as truncheon, weapon and radio are stiff and voluminous. Regardless of the viewpoint of operational police work or durability, the backsides of the weapon and truncheon holsters etc. could be much smoother and more energy absorbing, resulting in a far lesser injury risk in the event of a traffic accident. In a closing discussion of this document there are some suggestions for measures, together with a loose discussion about injury risk. Some of the points are: - Information. - Placement of equipment. - Possible future adjustments of the uniform in respect of incorporated crash protection over the hip. - Possible future adjustments of car seats and/or car door interior panels. Fractures to the hip area seem to be the injury with the closest connection between police equipment and <b>side-on</b> <b>collisions...</b>|$|R

50|$|In December 2005, Trishul {{collided}} with a commercial ship, Ambuja Laxmi, outside the Mumbai harbour, while returning from a training mission. Radar systems installed by the port authorities and those on board Ambuja Laxmi were unable to detect Trishul, and were unable to prevent the <b>side-on</b> <b>collision.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Paik (2001)gives an {{interesting}} analysis {{that shows that}} spherical carriers can withstand a 90 degree <b>side-on</b> <b>collision</b> with another similar LNG carrier at 6.6kts (50% of normal port speed) with no loss of LNG cargo integrity. This drops to only 1.7kts for a fully loaded 300,000 dwt oil tanker collision into an LNG carrier. Although collisions are possible in open water, large oil tankers only enter a few US ports and {{the chance of a}} collision is not generally credible. However, the possibility of collision would need to be considered in an analysis of those ports when considering port geometry. (Pitblado, 2004) ...|$|E
