50|$|Norman de Bruyne had a meeting, on 9 April 1936, with de Havilland {{aircraft}} {{and received a}} cheque for £1000 and a consultancy to research into reinforced phenolformaldehyde resins for use in propeller manufacture. This decision by De Havilland Propellers division {{turned out to be}} one of considerable importance as it led directly to the acceptance and use of <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> in many, if not all, aircraft from the mid-1940s to the present day.|$|E
50|$|The {{aerospace}} industry manufactures {{small numbers of}} very expensive products and is thus able to afford the high capital and unit operating costs of autoclaves. Typically, this entails applying carefully controlled levels of heat and pressure to parts and assemblies. The curing of composites requires compacting the piles of material, pressing this material against the mold, forcing out volatiles and excess resin, and holding everything motionless during the entire cure cycle. In <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding,</b> the autoclave forces the parts together and holds them while the adhesive cures. Unlike a press, the autoclave applies pressure uniformly, irrespective of {{the shape of the}} workload.|$|E

3000|$|A kind of {{epoxy resin}} <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> (<b>bond</b> tensile {{strength}} is about 10  MPa) {{is applied to}} cohere the loading plates ([...] 72 mm× 20 mm) and the ends of specimens before the uniaxial tensile tests. The pull rods fixed on loading plates should be connected with the fixtures of the MTS material testing system. It’s also essential to adjust the tightness degree of connecting bolts in the pull rods and align the pull rods and the central axis of a specimen as accurately as possible.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} an {{increasing}} desire to apply <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> in glass constructions, {{the lack of a}} reliable failure criterion is a major obstacle. Since the average overlap shear strength values normally provided cannot be applied as a general limit for arbitrary <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> geometries, extensive testing has to be performed on any new design to ensure its structural performance and safety. Not only the building industry, also maritime, aeronautical and car industries are struggling with this issue. To supply a contribution, this paper provides a numerical analysis of the stress distributions in an adhesive layer during a single lap shear test as was performed at Ghent University. Firstly, an appropriate mesh and element type was chosen after which the influence of different geometries on the peak shear stress was investigated. Additionally, simulations with different stiffness levels for the adhesive were performed. From the numerical analysis, it could be concluded that the impact of the thickness is most important. The study is part of an extensive, two-year research project into <b>structural</b> glass-metal <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds,</b> run by Ghent University in cooperation with the Adhesion Institute of the TU Delft...|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of {{honeycomb}} structures for structural applications had been independently proposed for building application and published already in 1914. In 1934 Edward G. Budd patented a welded steel honeycomb sandwich panel from corrugated metal sheets and Claude Dornier aimed 1937 to solve the core-skin bonding problem by rolling or pressing a skin which is in a plastic state into the core cell walls. The first successful <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> of honeycomb sandwich structures was achieved by Norman de Bruyne of Aero Research Limited, who patented an adhesive with the right viscosity to form resin fillets on the honeycomb core in 1938. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie made extensive use of stainless steel honeycomb panels using a brazing process they developed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an atomistic-based {{representative}} {{volume element}} (RVE) is developed {{to characterize the}} behavior of carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced amorphous epoxies. The RVE consists of the carbon nanotube, the surrounding epoxy matrix, and the CNT/epoxy interface. An atomistic-based continuum representation is adopted throughout all {{the components of the}} RVE. By equating the associated strain energies under identical loading conditions, we were able to homogenize the RVE into a representative fiber. The homogenized RVE was then employed in a micromechanical analysis to predict the effective properties of the newly developed CNT-reinforced amorphous epoxy. Numerical examples show that the effect of volume fraction, orientation, and aspect ratio of the continuous fibres on the properties of the CNT-reinforced epoxy adhesives can be significant. These results have a direct bearing on the design and development of nano-tailored adhesives for use in <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of design rules for <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joints. In daily practice engineers are confronted with the problem to verify the safety of their designs. Setting up an experimental programme can do this. For the marine, transport, building and civil engineering sectors this will not be an option, because it is too expensive and time consuming. The use of design rules might be an alternative, but current guidelines for structuraladhesive bonded joints do not guarantee the safety. To develop design rules that mee the required leve;l of safety, new approaches have to be used. Such a systematic approach is presented in this paper. It is based on the current <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> boding technology and on so-called teliability methods. Partial factors are used to take the required safety level into account. Additional conversion factors are introduced to cover the effect of ageing. Methods are discussed how to calibrate these factors.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} join a plane {{composite}} cable to the main structure of a composite footbridge designed within (Caron, 2009), {{it was decided to}} investigate <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding.</b> This technique is indeed particularly adapted to composite materials. However <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> induces stress concentrations {{at the edges of the}} adhesive joint, which have been studied by a large number of researchers in order to reduce these phenomena and increase the capacity and service life of the bonded joint (Kinloch, 1987). These studies are all concerned with optimizing shear stress transfer in adhesively bonded joints. This paper investigates the role of hydrostatic pressure on the ultimate capacities of common civil engineering adhesives. The conclusions led us to study a new joint geometry, the " curved " bonded joint that naturally creates compressive stresses on the edge of the bonded joint. Several experimental investigations are presented within this paper to illustrate the optimization. These are quasi-static tests that compare classical shear lap joints to curved joints. Additional testing is currently in progress, but the curved bonded joint seems to hold good prospects and a patent has been filed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular joining technique in various industrial applications. Among the many types of <b>structural</b> <b>adhesives,</b> viscoelastic adhesives have a low modulus and relatively low strength, allowing large deformations of the joints. However, these flexible adhesives typically show a strongly nonlinear elastic behaviour. Static and dynamic experiments show a large variability of joint stiffness and strength, even within a set of nominally identical bonded samples. Combined with an uncertain ageing behaviour, this makes a durability estimation of elastic <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> extremely difficult. This paper describes a part of an extensive research project {{in the field of}} durability estimation of structural elastic adhesively bonded joints, used in dynamically loaded structures. The research work discussed here focusses on the quasi-static properties of simple adhesive butt joints, which geometry is described {{in the first part of}} this paper. This part also outlines the variability of the sample geometry. The second part describes the experimental campaign to assess the (quasi static) tensile and shear stiffness of the joints. This part also describes the stated variability of these properties and relates it with observed geometrical variability and scatter on adhesive material properties. In the third part, a robust, nominal, nonlinear finite element model is created to analyse the sensitivity of the joint stiffness to geometrical and material variability. These modelling results are then correlated to the experimental data shown in the second part. A fourth part concludes this work and discusses ongoing and planned research activities. status: publishe...|$|R

Hot-fire testing {{is part of}} an adhesive down-selection program on the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor Nozzle to provide additional confidence in the down-selected adhesives. The current nozzle <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> system is being replaced due to obsolescence. Prior to hot-fire testing, adhesives were tested for chemical, physical and mechanical properties, which resulted in the selection of two potential replacement adhesives, Resin Technology Group's TIGA 321 and 3 M's EC 2615 XLW. Hot-fire testing consisted of four forty-pound charge (FPC) motors fabricated in configurations that would allow side-by-side comparison testing of the candidate replacement adhesives with the current RSRM adhesives. Results of the FPC motor testing show that: 1) the phenolic char depths on radial bondlines is approximately the same and vary depending on the position in the blast tube regardless of which adhesive was used, 2) the replacement candidate adhesive char depths are equivalent to the char depths of the current adhesives, 3) the heat-affected depths of the candidate and current adhesives are equivalent, and 4) the ablation rates for both replacement adhesives were equivalent to the current adhesives...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} energy efficient, low weight {{structures}} has boosted {{the use of}} composite structures assembled using increased quantities of <b>structural</b> <b>adhesives.</b> <b>Bonded</b> structures may be subjected to severe working environments such as high temperature and moisture due to which the adhesive gets degraded {{over a period of}} time. This reduces the strength of a joint and leads to premature failure. Measurement of strains in the adhesive bondline at any point of time during service may be beneficial as an assessment can be made on the integrity of a joint and necessary preventive actions may be taken before failure. This paper presents an experimental approach of measuring peel and shear strains in the adhesive bondline of composite single-lap joints using digital image correlation. Different sets of composite adhesive joints with varied bond quality were prepared and subjected to tensile load during which digital images were taken and processed using digital image correlation software. The measured peel strain at the joint edge showed a rapid increase with the initiation of a crack till failure of the joint. The measured strains were used to compute the corresponding stresses assuming a plane strain condition and the results were compared with stresses predicted using theoretical models, namely linear and nonlinear adhesive beam models. A similar trend in stress distribution was observed. Further comparison of peel and shear strains also exhibited similar trend for both healthy and degraded joints. Maximum peel stress failure criterion was used to predict the failure load of a composite adhesive joint and a comparison was made between predicted and actual failure loads. The predicted failure loads from theoretical models were found to be higher than the actual failure load for all the joints...|$|R
