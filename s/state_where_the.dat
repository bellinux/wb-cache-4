5|$|For Reitz, Afrikaans was {{predominantly}} {{a language}} of culture, not of government, where he propagated {{the use of the}} official language of the Boer republics, Dutch. During his presidency of the Orange Free <b>State,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> use of English was significant among the burghers, he strongly promoted the use of Dutch, against politicians like John G. Fraser and others who were in favour of English.|$|E

Both states are characterised by their symptoms, which {{relate to the}} excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood.|$|R

5|$|The {{new regime}} passed {{its own version}} of Legea Rurală, thus {{effectively}} imposing land reform, as well as putting an end to corvées. This was accomplished through discussions in August 1864 by the newly established Council of <b>State,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> law was advanced by, among others, Kogălniceanu, Bolintineanu, George D. Vernescu, Gheorghe Apostoleanu and Alexandru Papadopol-Callimachi. Kogălniceanu's other measures as minister included: the establishment of Bucharest University, the introduction of identity papers, the establishment of a national police corps (comprising Dorobanți units), the unification of Border Police.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{considered}} in the Tennessee Valley, two in the Chicago area, one near the Shasta Dam in California, and some in Washington <b>state,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Hanford site was eventually established. An OSRD team had selected the Knoxville area in April 1942, and in May Arthur Compton, {{the director of the}} Metallurgical Laboratory, had met with Gordon R. Clapp, the General Manager of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District (MED), Colonel James C. Marshall, asked Colonel Leslie R. Groves Jr. to undertake a study within the Army's Office of the Chief of Engineers. After receiving assurances that the TVA could supply the required quantity of electric power if given priority for procuring some needed equipment, Groves also concluded that the Knoxville area was suitable. The only voice of dissent at the 25 June meeting was Ernest O. Lawrence, who wanted the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to his Radiation Laboratory in California. The Shasta Dam area remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a <b>state</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
