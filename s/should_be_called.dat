5|$|There was {{an element}} naming {{controversy}} {{as to what}} the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the IUPAC adopted unnilseptium (symbol Uns) as a temporary, systematic element name for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium, not nielsbohrium, since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions, bohrate and borate. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name bohrium, and thus the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. It was subsequently decided that oxyanions of bohrium <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> bohriates to avoid confusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{literary}} documentarian HB Jassin, who {{compared the}} two using an Indonesian translation of Sous les Tilleuls entitled Magdalena, wrote {{that there was}} very little chance that the novel <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> plagiarism, as Hamka's descriptions of locations were highly detailed and consistent with his earlier works. Jassin also emphasised that the novel discussed issues with Minang adat, which would not be found in a foreign work. Siregar, however, considered the similarities between Zainuddin and Steve, as well as Hayati and Magdalena, too close, suggesting plagiarism. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw noted, without concluding whether similarities were conscious or unconscious, that the books had similarities, but agreed that Van der Wijck had purely Indonesian themes.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a team called Essex is in July 1732 when a combined Essex & Herts team played against the London Cricket Club. In July 1737, there was London v Essex at the Artillery Ground, London winning by 45 runs. In a return game at Ilford on 1 August 1737, Essex won by 7 runs. References are then occasional until 1785 when the Hornchurch Cricket Club became prominent. This club had a strong team that was representative of Essex as a county. However, the sources differed among themselves re whether the team <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Essex or Hornchurch. But {{there is no doubt}} that Essex was a First-Class county from 1785 until 1794, after which the county strangely and abruptly disappeared from the records for a long time.|$|E

25|$|By-{{elections}} are elections held to fill {{seats in}} Parliament that fall vacant in between general elections, known as casual vacancies. In the past, the Government took {{the position that}} the Prime Minister had discretion whether or not a by-election <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> to fill a casual vacancy in an SMC, and could leave a parliamentary seat unfilled until the next general election. However, in the case of Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General (2013), which arose from a vacancy in Hougang SMC, the Court of Appeal held that the Constitution obliges the Prime Minister to call a by-election unless a general election is going to be held in the near future. However, a by-election need only be called within a reasonable time, and the Prime Minister has discretion to determine when it should be held.|$|E

25|$|Article 49(1) of the Constitution, {{which is}} the {{provision}} governing by-elections in Singapore today, does not stipulate a time limit within which a vacant parliamentary seat must be filled. During the 2008 parliamentary debate, the Prime Minister asserted that he had discretion to decide when a by-election <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> if at all. He described the legal framework as his Government understood it as facilitating the efficient execution of the Government's policies, because political parties rather than individual candidates exist as the fundamental elements of the government. The {{focus is on the}} party delivering its promises, and because a vacancy in Parliament does not affect a party's mandate to rule, the vacancy need not be filled before the next general election. In 2013, the Court of Appeal held in Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General (2013) that this was an incorrect interpretation of Article 49(1).|$|E

Mister Justice Richard Johnson approved the settlement. The Irish State acknowledged its acceptance that Rossiter's detention was unlawful, that the Treatment of Persons in Custody Act was not followed appropriately and that issues surrounding his death were not sufficiently investigated. The jury also made two recommendations relating to the treatment of persons in garda custody. These were that medical attention <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> to any garda station for any person, and especially those under the age of 17, if there were obvious signs of any injury or weakness, and that social services should be made available to gardaí at all times.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{carrying}} on the canal ended in 1954, when the carriage of coal between Stoke and Marple ceased. There {{had been some}} leisure use of the canal {{since the end of}} the First World War, with the High Lane Arm acting as a base, where a number of boathouses were built. In 1937, the local authority decided that such buildings should incur rates, and a group of boaters joined together to challenge this. They were unsuccessful, although they did prevent the rates from being backdated for six years, and in 1943, a more formal organisation was formed. The chairman, Harry Downs, who had had many dealings with the North Cheshire Water Board, suggested that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the North Cheshire Cruising Club, and this was agreed. They subsequently rented part of the arm from the LNER. The club is acknowledged to be the first such cruising club to be formed in Britain.|$|E
