40|$|This article {{documents}} the rapid rise of covert <b>searching,</b> through delayed <b>notice</b> <b>search</b> warrants, {{and argues that}} covert searching {{in its current form}} presumptively violates the Fourth Amendment’s “rule requiring notice. ” Congress authorized these “sneak and peek” warrants in the USA Patriot Act, in 2001, and soon after added a reporting requirement to monitor this invasive search technique. Since 2001, the use of delayed <b>notice</b> <b>search</b> warrants has risen dramatically, from around 25 in 2002 to 5, 601 in 2012, suggesting that “sneak and peek” searches are becoming alarmingly common. In fact, {{it is not at all}} clear whether true “sneak and peek” searches are on the rise. The data are confounded with other types of searches and thus are failing to capture what Congress intended. This article proposes an amendment to the reporting requirement to fix this problem and allow adequate monitoring of “sneak and peek” searches. To date, most courts have concluded that delayed <b>notice</b> <b>search</b> warrants raise no Fourth Amendment concerns. This article argues to the contrary. As a matter of Fourth Amendment first principles, covert searches infringe on the privacy and sanctity of the home. Moreover, history shows that delayed notice warrants are a modern procedural innovation, and did not exist at common law in the years leading up to the drafting of the Fourth Amendment in 1791. Instead, covert searches presumptively violate the Fourth Amendment “rule requiring notice” — a principle deeply rooted in the history of search and seizure law, and meant to protect against many of the dangers created by covert, delayed <b>notice</b> <b>searching...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} uses Huber’s (1991) {{conceptualization of}} organizational learning to analyze knowledge acquisition by management teams in emerging firms. Involvement in ongoing knowledge acquisition activities is positively and {{significantly related to}} new venture performance. In addition, task environment dynamism is a positive moderator {{of the relationship between}} involvement in knowledge acquisition activities and new venture performance. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Most of the existing research has focused on the human capital of the founder or founding team at start-up or at some point of time early in the organization’s history. Although research has shown a link between preexisting human capital and venture performance, knowledge gaps exist for three important reasons: (1) the initial knowledge level may not be sufficient, (2) changes in the external environment may require additional knowledge, and (3) the development and growth of the organization may demand additional knowledge and skills. These gaps may be addressed through organizational learning. We develop measures for congenital learning, vicarious and <b>search</b> and <b>notice</b> learning, and grafting in accordance with Huber’s (1991) typology of knowledge acquisition activities. We validate a model in which ongoing involvement in learning activities is positively related to venture performance. We test our hypotheses in a sample of 124 emerging ventures. The results indicate that measures of congenital, vicarious and <b>search</b> and <b>notice</b> learning are significantly correlated with new venture performance. In addition the dynamism of the task environment is a positive moderator of the relationship between vicarious and <b>search</b> and <b>notice</b> learning and grafting and new venture performance. Thus, involvement in ongoing knowledge acquisition activities is even more important in rapidly changing environments. USASBE 2008 Proceedings- Page 024...|$|R

These prostheses, called Tactile Vision Substitution Systems (TVSS), transform a sensory input from a given modality (vision) into another modality (touch).

40|$|Display clutter is a widely-acknowledged but {{ill-defined}} {{problem that}} affects operators in complex, data-rich domains, such as medicine and aviation. Largely regarded {{a function of}} data density and display organization, clutter {{has been shown to}} degrade performance on a range of tasks, most notably visual <b>search</b> and <b>noticing.</b> Clutter effects may be exacerbated by stress, a major performance-shaping factor in the above domains. The goal of this dissertation was to develop an eye tracking-based approach for tracing and preventing the effects of clutter and stress on attention allocation and information acquisition. The research involved three stages: 1) identify the most diagnostic eye tracking metrics for capturing and explaining the effects of clutter and stress on performance, 2) determine which eye tracking metrics can detect the effects of clutter early on, in real time, and form the basis for models of clutter effects, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of real-time display adjustments for preventing performance decrements. This research was carried out in several contexts, including emergency department (ED) electronic medical records (EMRs). First, three experiments were conducted in different application domains, including the ED, to establish the relationship between clutter, stress, attention, and performance during visual <b>search</b> and <b>noticing</b> tasks. Clutter resulted in performance decrements on both tasks. The underlying changes in attention allocation were captured by several eye tracking metrics, some of which were able to differentiate between the effects of data density and organization. A fourth experiment calculated the most promising eye tracking metrics in real time and used them as input to logistic regression models of response time. Long response time due to poor organization could be modeled most accurately. Finally, a fifth experiment presented ED physicians with real-time adaptations (highlighting and shortcut panel) to their EMR while they reviewed patient records to perform diagnoses. Both adjustments led to better performance and were viewed favorably by physicians. Overall, this research adds to the knowledge base on clutter and visual attention, supports the further development of eye tracking as a basis for real-time processing, and contributes to improved safety in various domains by supporting timely and accurate information acquisition...|$|R

40|$|Before the 1740 s, the Dutch Republic did {{not have}} printed {{newspapers}} outside the provinces of Holland and Utrecht (i. e., the western and {{central part of the}} country). However, in 1743 the Groninger Courant was established in the city of Groningen, and the Leeuwarder Courant followed suit in Frisia’s capital of Leeuwarden in 1752. After several decades, both northern newspapers got a regional competitor, as a result of political turmoil and changing regimes: the Ommelander Courant in Groningen and its countryside in 1787, and the Friesche Courant in Frisia in 1795. This article argues that these four mentioned newspapers must have contributed, through their presence and content, to the confirmation – and most likely the intensification – of regional identity in the Republic’s northern provinces {{by the end of the}} eighteenth century. Only the existence of regional news media with titles including the city or provincial name would already have evoked feelings of self-confidence and prestige, particularly when these media were sold outside their own regions. Concerning the newspapers’ content, the above suggested effects were not much achieved via the news columns. They were mainly focused on foreign topics, while local news reports formed a very modest share within the papers’ news supply. One of the explanations for this was the fact that early modern Dutch newspapers were not yet dailies, and therefore the dissemination of most local news still happened faster orally than through the papers. Several samples in the four investigated newspapers demonstrate, however, that their increasing number of advertisements, announcement and <b>search</b> <b>notices</b> included predominantly information related to northern entrepreneurs and firms, the local and regional governments, and known or unknown private persons living nearby. Not only governmental and personal announcements but als commercial advertisments revealed all kinds of events, and topographical or personal details. In other words, they can be considered as messages bringing local and regional news. This part of the papers led to more knowledge about what happened in readers’ near surroundings. Advertisements about, for instance, the sale of houses and legacies were often implicit announcement about citizens who had passed away and their relatives’circumstances. Although such knowledge does not necessarily leads to an increasing regional awareness, the article claims that regional appreciation can only arise when people have become informed about their own region...|$|R

40|$|Methods for protein {{structure}} (3 D) -sequence (1 D) compatibility evaluation (threading) {{have been developed}} during the past decade. The protocol in which a sequence can recognize its compatible structure in the structural library (i. e., the fold recognition or the forward-folding search) is available for the structure prediction of new proteins. However, the reverse protocol, in which a structure recognizes its homologous sequences among a sequence database, named the inverse-folding search, is a more difficult application. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of the latter approach. A structural library, composed of about 400 well-resolved structures with mutually dissimilar sequences, was prepared, and 163 of them had remote homologs in the library. We examined whether they could correctly seek their homologs by both forward- and inverse-folding searches. The {{results showed that the}} inverse-folding protocol is more effective than the forward-folding protocol, once the reference states of the compatibility functions are appropriately adjusted. This adjustment only slightly affects the ability of the forward-folding <b>search.</b> We <b>noticed</b> that the scoring, in which a given sequence is re-mounted onto a structure according to the 3 D- 1 D alignment determined by the dynamic programming method, is only effective in the forward-folding protocol and not in the inverse-folding protocol.

The implications of these results are discussed...|$|R

This article aims at filling in this gap of knowledge, taking the silicosis as a case study. We investigated silicosis-related web-activities using Google Trends (GT) for capturing the Internet behavior worldwide in the years 2004 - 2015. GT-generated data were, then, compared with the silicosis-related scientific production (i. e., PubMed and Google Scholar), the media coverage (i. e., Google news), the Wikipedia traffic (i. e, Wikitrends) and the usage of new media (i. e., YouTube and Twitter). A peak in silicosis-related web <b>searches</b> was <b>noticed</b> in 2010 - 2011 : interestingly, both scientific articles production and media coverage markedly increased after these years in a statistically significant way. The public interest and the level of the public engagement were witnessed by an increase in likes, comments, hashtags, and re-tweets.

GT could be useful to assess the reaction of the public and the level of public engagement both to novel risk-factors associated to occupational diseases, and possibly related changes in disease natural history, and to the effectiveness of preventive workplace practices and legislative measures adopted to improve occupational health. Further, occupational clinicians should become aware of the topics most frequently searched by patients and proactively address these concerns during the medical examination.

In these situations, motorists often fail to search for bicyclists, <b>search</b> but don’t <b>notice</b> approaching bicyclists, or misjudge the gap of the approaching bicyclist. In addition, bicyclists do not always position themselves to be readily seen or approach at high rates of speed. Bicycle-motor vehicle crashes involving right-turning vehicles and through-moving bicycles have been typed as “the right-hook. ” The overall goal of the research in this presentation was to quantify the safety performance of alternative traffic control strategies to mitigate right-turning vehicle-bicycle crashes at signalized intersections.

40|$|From {{the outset}} {{the task was}} to {{investigate}} the validity of ethnic mortality data collection and suggest ways it could he improved. This began with a concern about an anomaly between the hospitalisation rates for young Maori involved in road accidents and the reported official road mortality rates for these same young Maori. The hospitalisation figures suggested Maori were over-represented and the mortality rates suggested Maori were under-represented. Using a sample of those who died on the road in 1990, the ethnic data collected by police was compared with ethnic data collected by funeral directors, the responses of next-of-kin and the ascribed ethnicity taken from a <b>search</b> of death <b>notices.</b> Major differences of ethnic classification were revealed, particularly between next-of-kin and police and funeral directors, raising serious questions about the validity of the two official sets of data. An assessment of the validity of the two sets of data was made by linking an historical analysis of the concepts and definitions of race and ethnicity with a qualitative study of the ethnic data collection practices of police and funeral directors. The final ethnic data sets were revealed to be a construction of the 'commonsense' conceptual understandings of race and ethnicity held by police and funeral directors being applied to the practices of collection and classification. These concepts, understandings and practices contained a variable mixture of historical paradigms and discourses. On the basis of validity as it is understood by statisticians, both official collections could reasonably be judged invalid. However, the deeper issue underlying this finding concerns the value of ethnic statistics. Their value lies in their use for justifying resource allocation and distribution between different ethnic groups. Ethnic data and its collection cannot be viewed outside the politics of resource allocation and the project of improving ethnic data is firmly located in this context...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes three}} essays on employers 2 ̆ 7 search behavior that explore a simple yet central {{question to the}} literature on search, i. e., do the costs of continued search affect employers 2 ̆ 7 search behavior and if so what adjustments are employers willing to undergo to avoid a future increase in the costs of keeping their vacancies open. In so doing the thesis makes two contributions. First, while existing search literature typically considers an environment where employers 2 ̆ 7 optimal search strategy is constant over {{the duration of the}} employers 2 ̆ 7 search, this thesis proposes a theoretical framework in which the employers 2 ̆ 7 search environment changes and explores, theoretically and empirically, employers 2 ̆ 7 optimal adjustments to such changes. Second, unlike job searchers 2 ̆ 7 behavior that has been studied extensively, evidence reported in this thesis contributes to a scant empirical literature on employers 2 ̆ 7 search behavior by making use of a novel vacancy data set. ^ Specifically, the three essays explore whether an employer 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of a future job opening affects how the employer goes about searching for a worker. Unlike employers who search to fill a current opening, employers with advance notice of a vacancy search to fill a future opening and do not incur a loss of output while searching prior to the advance notice period exhaustion date. Based on such a distinction between employers, Essay One establishes two findings using a new Slovenian vacancy data set. First, the essay documents that employers who received advance notice of a vacancy search differently compared to employers who did not, confirming a similar finding reported for the U. S. in related literature. More importantly, the essay documents the effect additional week of search has on the vacancy 2 ̆ 7 s hazard as the employers approach exhaustion of the advance notice period. Essay Two explores whether employers with advance <b>notice</b> <b>search</b> differently compared to employers who did not receive advance notice of a vacancy because they are more selective or on account of some other reason. Essay Three proposes a theoretical framework that addresses findings in Essays One and Two. Further, the essay explores the role of advance notice of a vacancy in explaining the differences between the employer 2 ̆ 7 s offered contract type/qualification requirement at the time of a vacancy posting and the actual contract type/worker 2 ̆ 7 s attained qualification at the time of hiring. ...|$|R
40|$|The many {{methods for}} {{merchandising}} {{a bed and}} breakfast inn embrace both traditional means and the growing areas available online. The key to all tactics is to show would-be guests how the B 2 ̆ 6 B matches their lodging preferences. Getting that message to the proper guests is essential regardless of the approach. Despite {{the growing popularity of}} the internet, nearly three-quarters of B 2 ̆ 6 B guests still prefer to telephone the innkeeper for a reservation. In many cases, however, such calls are influenced by an inn 2 ̆ 7 s internet presence. Traditional means for promoting a B 2 ̆ 6 B are guidebooks and local associations 2 ̆ 7 publications. The inn can also gain notice if it attracts the attention of travel journalists. The inn can present itself as a venue for special events, notably weddings and family dinners. In any case, the inn should participate in community events and be seen as a participant in the local business community. If an inn is large enough it might want to deal with tour wholesalers or incentive travel, but that is an entirely different world from the typical B 2 ̆ 6 B guest. One traditional method of spurring reservations is to send a direct-mail piece, preferably to the inn 2 ̆ 7 s own list of previous guests or to a prequalified list of people who like to stay in B 2 ̆ 6 Bs. The internet offers a more direct way to interact with would-be guests and to gain reservations, but it also has pitfalls-the most common being that the inn can be lost in the huge volume of websites. Thus, an innkeeper may wish to create a website with keywords that <b>search</b> engines will <b>notice</b> in conjunction with queries about lodging in the area. A well-designed website is essential, and it must include a way for the guest to make a request for rates and availability. That request may be {{in the form of a}} web-based booking engine or an email link. Innkeepers can use email to send messages about upcoming promotions to a list of previous guests or those who have inquired about the inn-or purchase a third-party list for this purpose. A most important issue relating to email is to avoid being seen as a spammer. Moreover, the innkeeper must be in a position to respond to guests 2 ̆ 7 email requests in a prompt and personal manner. In the midst of all this, the innkeeper must find time to operate the property. Thus, engaging outside professional help for many of the merchandising tasks may be appropriate, depending on the inn 2 ̆ 7 s size and situation...|$|R
40|$|Welcome to {{the first}} issue of our 5 th volume of Evidence Based Library and Information Practice. And what an issue it is! We are very pleased to {{showcase}} the keynote addresses from the 5 th International Evidence Based Library and Information Practice (EBLIP 5) conference that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in July 2009. Andrew Booth, who was Chair of the International Program Committee for the conference, kindly agreed to take on a guest editorial role in gathering these keynote presentations together. I believe {{it is the first time}} the EBLIP community has been able to have the keynote papers from an EBLIP conference gathered in this way. Reading these commentaries will give you a true sense of the themes and questions that were woven throughout the conference and will give you lots to think about. For a fuller description and to put this Feature section in context, please be sure to read Andrew’s editorial at the beginning of the section. As we begin our fifth year of publication, submissions of original research articles continue to grow. In this issue we have five original articles on topics ranging from information literacy instruction to cataloguing of e‐books. Two articles look at using communities of practice in the support of evidence based practice; clearly this is an area of emerging research within EBLIP that readers will benefit from learning more about. One of these articles, by Urquhart, Brice, Cooper, Spink, and Thomas, won the Best Oral Presentation award at the EBLIP 5 conference. In addition to the original research articles, we also have seven evidence summaries, covering topics such as unionization, information seeking behaviour, and the LIS blogosphere. The EBL 101 column tackles critical appraisal, a daunting task that will not seem quite so scary once you’ve read the column! As well, in the Commentary section, Jessie McGowan and colleagues have contributed a checklist for the peer review of electronic search strategies, developed from research they have recently completed, which will be of certain interest to all librarians who do systematic review or other in‐depth <b>searching.</b> Readers may <b>notice</b> a change to our citation style with this issue. EBLIP has made the switch from MLA to APA style. We hope readers are pleased with this change. The editorial team felt that APA was a more common style in the social sciences, and therefore one with which authors would be more familiar, leading to fewer copyediting problems. It also removed the need to continually insert page numbers whenever the author was referring to another’s work, and we like that APA puts the date of the work front and centre in the in‐text citation so readers can know when the paper being referred to was published. Certainly we will go through a transition period that won’t be perfect, but I hope that this change is one that is for the better. Finally, I would like to welcome Jonathan Eldredge to the Editorial Team. Jon takes over from Scott Walter as Associate Editor for Classics. Jon is very familiar with the Classics section, as he himself has written two classic summaries in the past. We are aiming to publish at least two classics per year, and Jon would love to hear from you with suggestions of older research papers that have influenced practice, stood the test of time, and still have much to teach us. A major goal of EBLIP is to bring research closer to practitioners, and to make it useful. Classics and evidence summaries are ways in which our team continually strives to bridge this gap, and continues to inspire our minds to look at things in new ways...|$|R
