50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> is {{the second}} largest of the 19 dunnart (Sminthopsis) species, with an adult body mass of 35g (females) to 44g (males); only the Julia Creek dunnart (S. douglasi; 40-70 g) is larger. Their thermoneutral body {{temperature}} is around (34.4 °C.) Penile morphology and molecular biology suggest that the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> is a basal Sminthopsis, without a clear relationship to any other species. The Sandhill Dunnart's physiology also resembles that of other dunnarts.|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} park is {{an important}} habitat for some of Australia's most endangered wildlife species, such as the malleefowl and <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart.</b> The conservation park {{is also home to}} kangaroos, wombats and dingoes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> is so rare, {{little is}} known about its appearance. At around 1 to 2 inches, it is very small.It {{is one of the largest}} and rarest of all dunnarts.

50|$|To {{the north}} it borders Yellabinna Regional Reserve, {{to the east}} Pureba Conservation Park. The {{conservation}} park is outside of the dog fence, which borders it in the south. Therefore, it is situated in the area, where dingoes are tolerated.

50|$|<b>Sandhill</b> <b>dunnarts</b> {{typically}} begin breeding in September, with offspring {{born from}} September to October. There have been sites where young dunnarts {{were found in}} October and April.

50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> (Sminthopsis psammophila) is {{a species}} of small {{carnivorous}} Australian marsupial of the family Dasyuridae. It is known from four scattered arid areas of Australia: near Lake Amadeus in Northern Territory, the central Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the southwestern edge of the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia, and at Yellabinna in South Australia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{causes of the}} decline of the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Dunnart</b> are not known, {{it is likely to be}} under threat from {{predation}} by introduced species such as foxes and cats, habitat degradation due to livestock grazing, and inappropriate fire regimes. But despite the great damage done to their habitat by the fire regimes, sandhill dunnarts are able to recolonize burnt areas because of their adaptation to mid-successional complexes of vegetation. However, a single fire can wipe out an entire population. As the remnants become increasingly isolated from one another, the lack of connective bush corridors greatly reduces the likelihood of recolonisation. They are a major threat to this species because of its dependence on large spinifex hummocks. In addition, land clearance for agriculture at the Eyre Peninsula has caused a great reduction in viable habitat for the <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart,</b> leaving only 43 percent of the area’s original vegetation remaining.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species of dunnarts, {{weighing}} in from 30 to 55 g. One might assume that the size would result in a fondness for larger invertebrates, but it is recorded that the medium-sized marsupial prefers to eat smaller prey, such as ants, beetles, spiders, grasshoppers, termites, wasps and centipedes. The species is known to be generalist feeders and extremely opportunistic. Being a voracious predator, its diet remains high in all seasons, varying only slightly in proportion.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> can {{be found}} in sandy, arid and {{semi-arid}} regions with Spinifex grass hummocks in Australia. Because of the dunnart’s distinct and limited habitat needs, Spinifex hummocks are an essential part of its environment. It takes shelter from extreme temperatures and humidity within the burrows it digs under larger Spinifex hummocks, which range from about 12 to 110 centimeters in length and are up to 46 centimeters deep. Females occasionally dig deeper, creating a chamber typically used for raising their young. Males, however, are known to occupy small burrows dug between Spinifex clumps, hollow logs and even burrows dug by other animal species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> {{is listed}} as “vulnerable” under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is afforded some {{protection}} within reserves, such as the Ironstone Hill Conservation Park and the Yellabinna Wilderness Protection Area in South Australia, and the Queen Victoria Spring Nature Reserve in Western Australia. In 2001, a national recovery plan listing several actions {{to aid in the}} recovery of the species was published. These actions included preventing further habitat clearance, conducting surveys in areas likely to support the species, implementing monitoring programs for key populations, and conducting research on captive individuals to increase understanding of this species’ reproductive biology. Experimental burns were also recommended to encourage the growth of suitable spinifex habitat.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{adapted to}} these harsh {{conditions}} includes few large birds or mammals. However, the desert does sustain {{many types of}} lizard including the vulnerable great desert skink (Egernia kintorei) {{and a number of}} small marsupials including the endangered <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> (Sminthopsis psammophila) and the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda). One way to survive here is to burrow into the sands, as a number of the desert's animals, including the southern marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops), and the water-holding frog do. Birds include the chestnut-breasted whiteface (Aphelocephala pectoralis) found on {{the eastern edge of the}} desert and the malleefowl of Mamungari Conservation Park. Predators of the desert include the dingo (as the desert is north of the Dingo Fence) and two large monitor lizards, the perentie (Varanus giganteus) and the sand goanna (Varanus gouldii).|$|E

40|$|Sixteen {{polymorphic}} microsatellite loci {{were developed}} using a 454 sequencing approach, and three loci, developed for Sminthopsis douglasi, were optimized for the endangered <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart,</b> Sminthopsis psammophila. Nineteen loci (16 S. psammophila and three S. douglasi) were tested on 38 individual S. psammophila from two populations in South Australia. Three loci deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, possibly due to null alleles. No evidence of linkage disequilibrium was detected. We recommend a final panel of 17 loci for future genetic analyses of S. psammophila, which will aid in conservation management of this poorly understood and nationally endangered marsupial. Amanda L.

40|$|Optimised {{detection}} and sensitivity of fauna-monitoring programs {{is essential for}} the adaptive management of threatened species. We describe the influence of trap type, trapping duration and timing on the detection rates of small vertebrates, in particular the nationally endangered <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> (Sminthopsis psammophila) in its two primary populations in South Australia. A total of 118 and 155 sandhill dunnarts were captured from the Middleback and Yellabinna regions, respectively, from five trapping sessions between 2008 and 2012. Wide deep pitfall traps (225 mm diameter × 600 – 700 mm deep) captured significantly more adult sandhill dunnarts than shorter, narrower pitfalls (150 mm diameter × 500 mm deep) or Elliott traps. Deep pitfall traps also captured significantly more hopping mice (Notomys mitchellii) but smaller mammal species were equally trapable in deep or short pitfall traps. Capture rates declined through successive nights of trapping. Capture rates of sandhill dunnarts were greatest in one study region when the moon illumination was less than 40 % compared with fuller moon phases but were not affected by moon illumination in the other study region. The results suggest that higher capture rates of sandhill dunnarts will be achieved when using wide, deep pitfall traps on dark nights during the first two nights of trapping. Trapping in summer detected more juvenile sandhill dunnarts than trapping in winter. John L. Read, Matthew J. Ward and Katherine E. Moseb...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} rates of {{extinction}} in the world, particularly for mammals of the arid zone. Arid and semi-arid species are subject to a number of threatening processes, including predation from introduced cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes), land clearance for agriculture, changing fire regimes post-European settlement and, more recently, increased mining activities and climate change. Unfortunately, the biology, life history and population dynamics of many semi-arid zone mammal species are little known, making effective management and conservation problematic, particularly for those that are considered rare and endangered. One such species is the nationally endangered <b>sandhill</b> <b>dunnart</b> (Sminthopsis psammophila). The species is known from only a small number of individuals inhabiting three disjointed populations; two in South Australia and one in Western Australia. In order to conserve this species, ecological knowledge is required to predict how it is likely to respond to current and future threats, and accordingly what type of management actions are needed to ensure its persistence. This study used a combination of ecological and genetic information from a population in a semi-arid environment to investigate: 1) the influence of a variable environment on the life history and population dynamics of S. psammophila during a high and low rainfall year; 2) broad- and fine-scale genetic diversity and connectivity across the species’ range and within a population and 3) habitat preferences of the species and the influence rainfall and time since fire may have on the habitat preferences. One core population west of the Middleback Ranges on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, was trapped for two years during a capture-mark-recapture study comprising 23, 529 trap nights. Eleven sites were established within an area of approximately 24, 000 ha. The vegetation in the region consists of open mallee with an understorey of spinifex (Triodia spp.) and a diverse range of shrubs. Tissue samples were taken from individuals caught to examine the fine-scale genetic diversity and connectivity within the study area using 16 newly developed microsatellite markers. Additional tissue samples from the remaining two core populations were collected through collaborations to study the historical connectivity across the species’ range using a combination of microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control region sequence data. The broad scale genetic analyses revealed that the three known core populations of S. psammophila are genetically differentiated, but do not show evidence of long-term population isolation. Within the core population the fine-scale genetic analyses and capture-mark-recapture data indicated that both males and females are relatively mobile with no significant genetic structure amongst 107 samples evident within the 24, 000 ha study area. In addition, no significant sex-biased dispersal was detected, suggesting it is advantageous for both males and females to disperse from their natal areas. The study found that the presence and abundance of S. psammophila at sites was influenced by rainfall events. During the low rainfall year significantly fewer S. psammophila were caught and a higher proportion of individuals were transients. The changes in the population were attributed to a decreased survival rate of dispersing juveniles and second year adults, most likely caused by reduced food (invertebrates) availability during the low rainfall year. In addition, the breeding season may have been delayed or reduced in response to fewer food resources during that year. S. psammophila was found to be positively associated with the number of logs and vertical habitat complexity and negatively associated with the average height of spinifex (Triodia spp.). These associations likely reflect a preference for areas with increased protection from predators and increased foraging opportunities. We did not detect an effect of time since fire on the presence of S. psammophila. However, resident females were observed favouring sites with slightly higher spinifex density during the low rainfall year. This may suggest a preference for areas that provide increased foraging opportunities in microsites, such as areas where leaf litter accumulates, during low resource years. The relatively high mobility in this species appears to be an adaptation to a system with variable food resources; individuals need to be mobile in order to track food pulses created by rainfall through the landscape. Therefore large areas of suitable habitat will need to be protected in order to maintain a viable S. psammophila population. The preference of S. psammophila for complex understorey suggests that recently burnt vegetation may be unsuitable for the species. Limiting large scale wildfires will be required to protect the species in the future, especially if climate change leads to an increase in the severity and frequencies of wildfires. The findings from this study have been made available to the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Dunnart</b> Recovery Team and have contributed to the development of an effective conservation management plan for S. psammophila, both regionally and nationally.
