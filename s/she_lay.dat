5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this spot as well. In 1875, the {{cemetery}} in which <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> was destroyed, {{and she had no}} kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E

She can choose whether or not to fertilize an egg as <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> it; if <b>she</b> does so, it develops into a female worker bee; if <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> an unfertilized egg it becomes a male drone. She decides which type of egg to lay {{depending on the size of}} the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> a fertilized egg; if she finds a larger drone cell, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> an unfertilized drone egg.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula {{filed for}} divorce from a {{hospital}} bed where <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> dying of cancer. She claimed {{she was trying to}} preserve some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending at the time of Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> {{derelict}} in the Hamoaze until April 1901, {{when she}} was sent to Malta as a depot ship. To release her name for the new armoured cruiser, Achilles was renamed Hibernia in 1902. She was renamed Egmont in March 1904, and remained in Malta until 1914. Her role in Malta was assumed by the stone frigate Fort St Angelo. She was brought home to Chatham that year, and served there as a depot ship under the successive names of Egremont (19 June 1916) and Pembroke (6 June 1919). The ship was sold for scrap on 26 January 1923 to the Granton Shipbreaking Co.|$|E
5|$|She {{left home}} in 1990 {{at the age}} of 16, and moved to Melbourne, where she {{qualified}} as a hairdresser and beauty therapist. By 1994 she was running a hair dressing store and managing seven employees. Her life was changed that year by a fall from a building in Melbourne in which fractured her third and fourth thoracic vertebrae, rendering her an incomplete paraplegic. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> there for forty minutes before someone found her. She spent the next four weeks in the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, and then another {{two and a half months}} in the Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre in Kew. She was forced to move back in with her parents, where she lived for the next five years, but within a year of her accident, she was managing five hairdressing stores.|$|E

5|$|Upon the German {{invasion}} of France, beginning on 10 May 1940, Courbet was hastily rearmed. She supported Allied {{troops in the}} defence of Cherbourg during June, later that month taking refuge in England. As part of Operation Catapult, she was seized in Portsmouth by British forces on 3 July and {{was turned over to}} the Free French a week later. She was used as a patrol vessel depot ship and an anti-aircraft ship there until 31 March 1941 when she was disarmed and hulked. Her engines and boilers were removed in 1944 to prepare her for use as a breakwater during the Normandy landings in June 1944. She was scrapped where <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> after the war.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served {{extensively}} on foreign stations; Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron from her commissioning, and Dresden was sent to Caribbean waters in 1913. Dresden was due to return to Germany for periodic maintenance shortly before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but this became impossible with the onset of hostilities. She therefore operated as a commerce raider, before linking up with Vizeadmiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron. Dresden thereafter participated in the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 and the Battle of the Falkland Islands the following December. She was the only German vessel to escape destruction at the latter engagement, and she remained at large for several more months. Dresden finally put into the Chilean island of Más a Tierra in March 1915 owing to worn-out engines. A pair of British cruisers violated Chilean neutrality and attacked Dresden while <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> at anchor; the Germans scuttled their ship to prevent her capture.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E

5|$|Marie died on 18 July 1938, at 5:38p.m., {{eight minutes}} after lapsing into a coma. Her two eldest children, Carol and Elisabeth, {{accompanied}} by Prince Michael, were at her deathbed. Two days later, on 20 July, Marie's body {{was brought to}} Bucharest, where <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> in state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace. Her coffin was surrounded by flowers and glowing tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars. Thousands of people filed by Marie's bier during the three-day lying in state and, on the third day, the palace was opened for factory workers. Marie's funeral cortege {{made its way to}} the train station, passing under the Arch of Triumph. Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery, where she was interred. Marie's heart, according to her own wishes, was placed in a small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her Stella Maris chapel in Balchik. In 1940, after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II, her heart was transferred to Bran Castle. There, Ileana built a chapel to house the heart, kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|The tugs {{took the}} hulk of the Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking {{advantage}} of the beginning of the slack water. They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, rudder pintles and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
