The role of free volume, glass—transition temperature (Tg), microscopic viscosity, and polarity or environments to which excited molecules are exposed is emphasized in order to illustrate possible manners in which the photophysical, photochemical, and subsequent chemistries can be influenced. Many of these factors can affect several monomolecular and bimolecular processes encountered in the sensitization of photocrosslinkable polymers: the photophysics of the sensitizer, energy transfer to the reactive sites on the polymer, {{and the formation of}} crosslinks.

It is concluded that the response of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> to diving is initiated by a central 'pattern recognition' of an input from facial receptors, that this input and the effects of apnoea, acting by mutual reinforcement, maintain the strong sympathetic outflow, and that the mechanism releasing m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> on diving overrides the normal blood pressure regulatory function of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> Diving exerts differentiated influence on different parts of the sympathetic nervous system, as illustrated by the inhibition of <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>a...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{properties of}} High-T_ c cuprates are investigated {{both in the}} normal state and in the superconducting state. In particular, we pay atte ntion to the pseudogap in the normal state and the phase transition from the pse udogap state to the superconducting state. The pseudogap phenomena observed in cuprates are naturally understood as a precursor of the strong coupling superconductivity. We have previously show n by using the self-consistent T-matrix calculation that the pseudogap is <b>a</b> <b>resu</b> lt of the strong superconducting fluctuations which are accompanied by the stron g coupling superconductivity in quasi-two dimensional systems [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 68 (1999) 2999. ]. We extend the scenario to the superconducting state. The close relation between the pseudogap state and the superconducting state is pointed out. Once t he superconducting phase transition occurs, the superconducting order parameter rapidly grows rather than the result of BCS theory. With {{the rapid growth of}} the order parameter, the gap structure becomes sharp, while it is remarkably broad in the pseudogap state. The characteristic energy scale of the gap does not chan ge. These results well explain the phase transition observed in the spectroscopi c measurements. Further, we calculate the magnetic and transport properties which show the pseu dogap phenomena. The comprehensive understanding of the NMR, the neutron scatter ing, the optical conductivity and the London penetration depth is obtained both in the pseudogap state and in the superconducting state.
