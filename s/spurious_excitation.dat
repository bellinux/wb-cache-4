40|$|A general {{approach}} to the definition and assessment of response errors in dynamic and pseudo-dynamic tests is presented. By use of complete measurements during the test, either {{the characteristics of the}} experimental and the prototype system can be estimated by means of a linear ideal representation. This allows to compare quantitatively in terms of eigenfrequencies and damping ratios the experimental system and the prototype one. In the pseudo-dynamic test, the apparent effect of the control errors is a modification of the linear-equivalent matrices of stiffness and damping which are identified from the experimental data. In the shaking-table test, the control errors may introduce <b>spurious</b> <b>excitation</b> that, if properly measured, can also be shown to modify the response characteristics. JRC. DG.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Coulomb {{correlations}} in the half-filled Hubbard {{model of the}} honeycomb lattice is studied within the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) combined with exact diagonalization (ED) and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), for unit cells consisting of six-site rings. The important difference between this approach and the previously employed cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) is that DCA preserves the translation symmetry of the system, while CDMFT violates this symmetry. As the Dirac cones of the honeycomb lattice are the consequence of perfect long-range order, DCA yields semimetallic behavior at small on-site Coulomb interactions U, whereas CDMFT {{gives rise to a}} <b>spurious</b> <b>excitation</b> gap even for very small U. This basic difference between the two cluster approaches is found regardless of whether ED or QMC is used as the impurity solver. At larger values of U, the lack of translation symmetry becomes less important, so that the CDMFT reveals a Mott gap, in qualitative agreement with large-scale QMC calculations. In contrast, the semimetallic phase obtained in DCA persists even at U values where CDMFT and large-scale QMC consistently show Mott-insulating behavior...|$|E

40|$|One {{version of}} the {{membrane}} paradigm states {{that as far as}} outside observers are concerned, black holes can be replaced by a dissipative membrane with simple physical properties located at the stretched horizon. We demonstrate that such a membrane paradigm is incomplete in several aspects. We argue that it generically fails to capture the massive quasinormal modes, unless we replace the stretched horizon by the exact event horizon, and illustrate this with a scalar field in a BTZ black hole background. We also consider as a concrete example linearized metric perturbations of a five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black brane and show that a <b>spurious</b> <b>excitation</b> appears in the long-wavelength response that is only removed from the spectrum when the membrane paradigm is replaced by ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon.

40|$|Anharmonicities {{in nuclear}} {{quadrupole}} collective motions {{are studied in detail}} by deriving first the selfconsistent effective interactions {{and then by}} applying a boson expansion method. Our theory of effective interactions in nuclei is based on the concept of nuclear saturation and the selfconsistency between the shape of an average potential and that of a density distribution (nuclear selfconsistency). The higher-order effective interactions (e. g. a three-body interaction, etc.) are derived by imposing the nuclear selfconsistency in higher-order accuracy when other modes are simultaneously excited in the system. The interactions thus derived are carefully examined. A theory is generalized further to a system with a velocity-dependent potential, yeilding multipole-pairing interactions. The selfconsistent effective interactions thus derived are applied to the mcroscopic analyses of anharmonicities in nuclear quadrupole collective motions. The numerical calculations are made in terms of the boson expansion technique developed by Kishimoto and Tamura with several new refinements, such as the removal of <b>spurious</b> <b>excitation</b> modes and the inclusion of all possible noncollective excitations. From the analyses, it is demonstrated that the three-body interaction provides an important mechanism to restore the order in the system, which otherwise would have been destroyed. General agreements with experimental date on nuclei in various mass region have confirmed that our theory is capable of describing various types of anharmonicities characteristic to the nuclei in question.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>spurious</b> <b>excitation</b> of gravity {{waves in the}} context of four-dimensional data {{assimilation}} is investigated using a simple model of balanced dynamics. The model admits a chaotic vortical mode coupled to a comparatively fast gravity wave mode, and can be initialized such that the model evolves on a so-called slow manifold, where the fast motion is suppressed. Identical twin assimilation experiments are performed, comparing the extended and ensemble Kalman filters (EKF and EnKF, respectively). The EKF uses a tangent linear model (TLM) to estimate the evolution of forecast error statistics in time, whereas the EnKF uses the statistics of an ensemble of nonlinear model integrations. Specifically, the case is examined where the true state is balanced, but observation errors project onto all degrees of freedom, including the fast modes. It is shown that the EKF and EnKF will assimilate observations in a balanced way only if certain assumptions hold, and that, outside of ideal cases (i. e., with very frequent observations), dynamical balance can easily be lost in the assimilation. For the EKF, the repeated adjustment of the covariances by the assimilation of observations can easily unbalance the TLM, and destroy the assumptions on which balanced assimilation rests. It is shown that an important factor is the choice of initial forecast error covariance matrix. A balance-constrained EKF is described and compared to the standard EKF, and shown to offer significant improvement for observation frequencies where balance in the standard EKF is lost. The EnKF is advantageous in that balance in the error covariances relies only on a balanced forecast ensemble, and that the analysis step is an ensemble-mean operation. Numerical experiments show that the EnKF may be preferable to the EKF in terms of balance, though its validity is limited by ensemble size. It is also found that overobserving can lead to a more unbalanced forecast ensemble and thus to an unbalanced analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Using as {{benchmarks}} {{a series}} of increasingly large hydrated uracil clusters, we examine {{the nature and extent}} of charge-transfer (CT) contamination in condensed-phase, time-dependent density-functional theory. These calculations are plagued by a large number of <b>spurious</b> CT <b>excitations</b> at energies comparable to (and sometimes below) the valence excitation energies, even when hybrid density functionals are used. Spurious states below the first nð* and ðð * states of uracil are observed in clusters as small as uracil-(H 2 O) 4.

The extent of CT contamination is reduced substantially by introducing an electrostatic (point charge) description of an extended solvent network, even in cases where the region of solvent described by density functional theory is large (> 120 atoms). Alternatively, CT contamination may be reduced by eliminating certain excitation amplitudes from the linear response equations, with minimal loss of accuracy (< 0. 1 eV) in the valence excitation energies.

This is difficult to achieve for more than the lightest nuclei without an effective approximation scheme. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to define and evaluate an approximation scheme that can be used to study nuclei that are described as two particles attached to a closed (sub-) shell nucleus. The equation-of-motion coupled-cluster formalism has been used to obtain ground and excited state energies. This method is based on the diagonalization of a non-Hermitian matrix obtained from a similarity transformation of the many-body nuclear Hamiltonian. A chiral interaction at the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order using a cutoff at 500 MeV was used. The ground state energies of ^ 6 Li and ^ 6 He were in good agreement with a no-core shell-model calculation using the same interaction.

40|$|In this article, we derive a quantal self-consistent time-reversal {{invariant}} parameter-free cranking {{model for}} isoscalar monopole excitation coupled to intrinsic motion in even-even light nuclei. The model uses a wavefunction {{that is a}} product of monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions and a constrained variational method to derive, from a many-particle Schrodinger equation, a pair of coupled self-consistent cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the monopole and intrinsic systems. The monopole co-ordinate used is the trace of the quadrupole tensor and hence describes the overall deformation of the nucleus. The monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions are coupled to each other by the two cranking equations and their associated parameters and by two constraints imposed on the intrinsic system. For an isotropic Nilsson shell model and an effective residual two-body interaction, the two coupled cranking equations are solved in the Tamm Dancoff approximation. The strength of the interaction is determined from a Hartree-Fock self-consistency argument. The excitation energy of the first excited state is determined and found to agree closely with those observed in the nuclei He- 4, Be- 8, C- 12, O- 16, Ne- 20, Mg- 24, and Si- 28.

We discuss the resulting solutions and illustrate these results by considering practical examples. Basic Sensor Concept A typical TSM-resonator for viscosity sensing applications is made of a thin AT-cut quartz disk, which is plated with metal electrodes {{on both sides of the}} disk (see Fig. 1). When applying an electric alternating voltage to the electrodes, the resonator starts to vibrate in thickness-shear-mode. The adjacent liquid is entrained by the shear move-ment of the immersed TSM-resonator, which leads to a change of the resonance fre-quency and the damping compared to the vibrating resonator in air. By detecting this shift, the viscosity-density product of the liquid can be determined [1], [2].

The gyro-TWT amplifier at 140 GHz produced up to 30 kW of peak power in operation with 3 ts pulses at 6 Hz, 2. 30 GHz unsaturated bandwidth, a peak linear gain of 29 dB and an efficiency of 12 %. This is the highest frequency gyro-TWT reported as yet. The use of a very high order operating mode in a novel mode selective interaction structure namely, a quasioptical open confocal waveguide makes the gyro-TWT potentially capable of up to 100 kW CW operation at 140 GHz and at 94 GHz in the W-band (75 - 110 GHz) if built to industrial standards. The theory and experimental results from the first VED with a PBG resonator, {{in the form of}} a high power high frequency gyrotron oscillator at 25 kW power level at 140 GHz in a high order mode, TE 041 are also presented. The absence of any <b>spurious</b> mode <b>excitation</b> over 30 % variation in the magnetic field corresponding to an equal variation in the cyclotron frequency indicates that the PBG resonator was highly mode selective while operating in a higher order mode. This opens up promising avenues for building highly oversized resonators for generating Terahertz radiation with low voltage electron beams. (cont.) The successful operation of this high frequency gyrotron suggests that overmoded PBG resonators can also be used in conventional slow-wave devices to build moderate power (few hundreds of Watts) VEDs in the millimeter and sub-millimeter wave regime for a variety of applications. A gyrotron oscillator experiment with an overmoded open confocal resonator was also run at a peak power of up to 83 kW at 136 GHz with an efficiency of 16 %. The gyrotron oscillator experiment had excellent mode stability which makes an oversized quasioptical open confocal resonator a candidate for use in high frequency millimeter and sub-millimeter wave gyrotrons. A second harmonic confocal gyrotron experiment was also tried at 280 GHz but the poor quality electron beam prevented the generation of the second harmonic, however, the stronger fundamental mode interaction was suppressed thus validating the advantages of using confocal resonators in high harmonic gyrotrons to suppress the stronger fundamental interaction.

One of the main parameter affecting {{the level of the}} response is the structural and the mechanical damping. When resonant excitation can not be avoided in service the second source of damping is enhanced by the design of friction joints which can limit the amount of oscillation due to the dissipation of energy caused by the slip of contact surfaces. One of the typical feature in a blade that is a source of damping is the blade root attached to the slot of the rim of the disk. Despite the relatively low value of the damping introduced by the blade root joint, it can reach the same order of magnitude of the structural damping. In order to increase its effectiveness, different geometries of blade root joints are usually adopted (fir tree, dovetail) and optimized according to the operating conditions of the bladed disk. In this paper a test campaign is presented in order to collect a database of measurements of the damping introduced by two different geometry of blade root joints: dovetail joint and the crowned joint. The test rig is first described together with the excitation system and the measurement system. Due to the low amount of damping that must be measured, both systems are non-contact {{in order to avoid the}} introduction of any <b>spurious</b> damping. The <b>excitation</b> system is provided by a an electromagnet facing the dummy blade carrying the real geometry of the root attachment. Commissioning of the exciter and of the measurement system is described and discussed in order to define the fastest and most reliable Forced Response measurement, including issues like the heating of the dummy blade and the calibration of the electromagnetic exciter. The test campaign shows the effectiveness of the two geometries at a different level of pulling loads simulating the centrifugal force and different amplitude of the exciting forc...|$|R
