500|$|In {{defending}} himself {{from what he}} believed was the elitism of his online critics, Idol admitted {{that he was still}} learning about computers, but compared it to the early punk ethic of simply trying your best as a musician, even if you had difficulty. He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer. [...] "I don't know much about computers, but I have the desire to learn and I have a computer and a modem, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> for it. Banging my head sometimes, but continuing on." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Mullie, having Froot Loops as O'Neill's breakfast was not scripted, {{and he is}} unsure if {{the loop}} {{reference}} was intentional. [...] This was contradicted by Script coordinator Cath-Anne Ambrose who said [...] "I had to get Froot Loops cleared , and so the guy calls me back and says, 'Well {{how do you feel}} about Eggo Waffles? Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to these guys [...] and ask, 'How do you feel about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga and Fernando Garibay while {{on the road for}} The Monster Ball Tour, and was {{produced}} by both. It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, Born This Way, Ryan Seacrest's radio show, where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album. Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] (2009), from Gaga's previous release, The Fame Monster. Before starting work on [...] "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. [...] "I remember being backstage and hearing the concert start, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out there and hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that feeling. I wanted to outdo that moment that opens up the show. I'm just that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." [...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know {{anything}} else about it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are {{you sure you want to}} do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Knowles said that one of the hardest parts of the tour was [...] "squeezing a decade's worth of hits into a two-hour show" [...] and performing the songs in designer Thierry Mugler's [...] "elaborate" [...] costumes. She elaborated: [...] "I'm never gonna go onstage or do a video and not work until my feet are blistered, and until I'm basically, I can't walk any more. I always give, and I do that because I know how lucky I am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people can get a little sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that people can see the show months before you get into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert. As a creative advisor, Mugler stated about the show: ...|$|E

60|$|Though {{in doing}} <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> beyond the {{boundaries}} of the immediate topic, I may fitly point out that the method of inquiry here followed, is one which enables us to understand various phenomena besides those of laughter.

60|$|SHITE (thinking) Yes, this {{priest is}} still in the first stage of faith. (aloud) As you see, there are many villages here: Zorii, Awohaka, and Akasaka. But the tall grass of Awo-no-ga-kara grows round the roads between them, and the forest is thick at Koyasu and Awohaka, and many robbers come out under the rains.
