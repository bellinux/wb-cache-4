30|$|The {{silvicultural}} {{data from}} the <b>stem</b> <b>bank</b> [23] were examined for the trees from which these three logs were cut.

40|$|Wood is a {{biological}} material with great variability. Every {{piece of wood}} is a unique individual. The great challenge in the wood products manufacturing process {{has always been to}} select pieces of wood with properties that fulfil the product requirements. This will be even more important in the future as customers increasingly demand sawn products with special properties regarding dimension, moisture content, wrap and last, but not least, biological or aesthetic features. To be albe to fulfil these requirements, the right logs have to be selected for a certain product before the sawing process. This means that an accurate tool that can measure external and internal features is needed. The main objective of this work was to develop and evaluate algorithms for nondestructive measurement of external and internal properties in sawlogs {{with the aid of a}} bidirectional X-ray LogScanner. The LogScanner outlines and the LogScanner signals were simulated using CT (computer tomography) images from the Swedish Pine (Pinus sylvestris) <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank</b> and the European Spruce (Picea abies) <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank.</b> With the aid of data from the <b>stem</b> <b>bank</b> databases, the simulated scanner signals, the saw simulation program virtual SawMill (vSM), and statistical analysis programs, new control algorithms were developed and evaluated. The studies show that an X-ray LogScanner with two X-ray sources has a great potential to become a powerful tool for control of the sawmill process. The most important conclusions of work presented in this thesis were that: - X-ray based technology is a suitable technique for nondestructive measurement of internal features in green sawlogs. - CT scanning is a powerful research tool for measurement and visualisation of different log properties. - Parameterisation is an efficient method for reduction of the amount of data from a CT scanner. - It is very efficient to use data from a “Stem Bank data-base” based on CT scanning for simulation, analysis and development of the sawing process and different measurement technologies. - An X-ray LogScanner with two X-ray sources can measure log features such as diameter under bark, species, log type, knot structure, rotational position of knots, density, heartwood content, annual ring width and predict strength and grade of sawn boards.

40|$|With {{the help}} of the Swedish Scots Pine <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank,</b> the {{variation}} of internal knot properties was studied between stems and stands in sections in which the vertical variation was small. By means of explanatory site, stand and tree variables, knot property models were developed to describe variation between and within stands. Much of the between stand variation, and the lesser part of the random tree variation, in knot size, knot length and knots per whorl, was accounted for. However, knot angle was difficult to predict. This probably largely depended both on genetic control of this property, and on the measurement error caused by the low longitudinal resolution of the computer tomography scanning technique employed. Individual tree measurements of variables stable over time, such as growth-ring width close to the pith and stem diameter {{at the height of the}} lowest dead branch, were highly significant, and were the most important explanatory variables...|$|E
40|$|The {{forestry-wood chain}} today {{involves}} many actors, and {{the decisions taken}} {{in the process of}} making trees into finished products are so many that the effect of each individual decision is difficult to assess, especially if the natural variation of the input material is considered. This means that a simulation approach to the forestry-wood chain is suitable, since it makes it possible to evaluate the effects of decisions in a short timeframe, while the input material can be kept constant for different production setups. The long term aim is to connect tree and log properties to the quality of a final product through simulation, depending on the various operations involved in making the product. A part of this is realized through this thesis. It is shown that a simulation model of a cross-cutting and finger-jointing process is representative of a real process. The model is used to evaluate an adaptive strategy for setting the safety zone size between finger-joints and sound knots, a strategy which improves recovery in a finger-jointing operation by 3 %. Another issue addressed in this thesis is that of simulation input data. The sawing simulation tool used to a large extent in research today, Saw 2003, usesthe Swedish Pine <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank</b> as input data. This is a very well-documented datasource, and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the <b>stem</b> <b>bank</b> logs allows wood features such as knots to be represented in a realistic way in Saw 2003. There are limitations to the <b>stem</b> <b>bank,</b> however, mostly {{due to the fact that}} CT scanning is a time consuming process, which means that the amount of scanned logs is relatively small. In this thesis, it is shown that it is possible to use a small amount of log features for determining the knot structure in a log, which opens up possibilities for using industrial data from two-directional X-ray scanners. This would increase the amount of logs to be used as simulation input data. A second set of data used for simulation was also collected in a study of a production process, where the wood raw material was followed from the logyard through all production operations of making finger-jointed furniture components. Each individual piece of wood was traced through the operations, thus ensuring a link between the properties of logs and those of the finished product. This second data set was collected by grey-scale camera scanning of boards prior to cross-cutting and finger-jointing, and was used in the development of cross-cutting and finger-jointing simulation. It contains information on non-clearwood features of the board surfaces such as knots, cracks, and pitch pockets. It can be concluded from this thesis that it is possible to increase bothfunctionality and the amount of input data in the simulation of the forestry-wood chain, and by doing so production strategies and decisions can be evaluated. Wood quality discussions may be simplified by being able to assess the effects on the production process of decisions being made. Future work involves adding more functionality to the simulation environment as well as evaluating the methods proposed in this thesis industrially. The long term vision is to be able to integrate the forestry-wood chain from log to finished product in one simulation model.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a method for reconstruction of parametrically described whorls and knots from data possible to extract from industrial scanning of logs, using X-ray scanners. The method was conceived using the logs in the Swedish Pine <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank</b> as a foundation, and was based on a few predictor features extracted from these logs; namely whorl volume, distance between whorls and distance between pith and surface. These features were not measured in images but calculated from existing parameterised knots. Simulated test sawing shows that the reconstruction method results in a representative model of the knot structure in the log, when considering the grade distribution of the sawn timber produced by the simulation program. The results of this study could, for instance, be used for improved online quality predictions at sawmills. One step in this direction is to use industrial X-ray data to enlarge the amount of log data available for sawing simulation research. Future work can, therefore, focus on developing a practical application of the results presented here. Validerad; 2012; 20120305 (magfre...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{about how}} tree {{properties}} affect {{the final product}} is necessary to utilise each log and tree in the forestry production chain fully. So far, the Swedish Pine <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank</b> (SPSB) has been used extensively for sawing simulation, but not for simulation further down the production process. Hence, it is desirable to model the further processing of sawn timber using the SPSB. In this study, a simulation tool for cross cutting and finger jointing of boards has been developed and tested. The simulation program utilises the SPSB and the results from a sawmill simulation program to simulate a cross-cutting and finger-jointing process. The tool has been tested against an empirical material consisting of defect data from an industrial scanner, used at a producer of finger-jointed furniture products. To illustrate the potential use of the finger-jointing simulation program, two investigations have also been carried out. The first deals with comparing the recovery for finger jointing and cutting of solid boards for different products. The second investigation {{is an attempt to}} estimate the impact of process-related defects on the recovery of finger-jointed products. The results show that the simulation tool produces similar results as the real process, {{and the use of the}} SPSB provides adequate predictions of the real system’s behaviour. The first of the investigations shows that finger jointing generally has a better recovery than cutting of solid boards, but for short products, the latter might be a viable option. The second investigation suggests that process-related defects reduce recovery by up to 5 % units in the finger-joint process studied. Thus, there is future potential for using the finger-jointing simulation tool to investigate production strategies and/or raw material selection in the forestry production chain.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} value {{recovery}} and production {{control in the}} forestry–wood chain for improved competitiveness of sawmills through higher profit and better adaptation to product requirements of the customers. The subject was approached using simulation technique with a database of virtual logs and a sawing simulator capable of processing the logs in the database. CT images of young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) sawlogs were processed with artificial neural networks (ANN) for identifying knots in sapwood where the contrast in the images is low. ANN classifications were deemed a feasible method where traditional image analysis methods failed. Further processing of the classified image allowed for parametric descriptions of the logs in a format compatible with the previously established Swedish Pine <b>Stem</b> <b>Bank</b> (SPSB). Static models of stem shape and interior knot structure were used to create stems that were also compatible with the SPSB. Processing the stems with the sawing simulator demonstrated the possibility of predicting timber grade recovery and volume yield from stands based on site, stand and tree characteristics. It was also shown that timber values in logs can be predicted using variables derived from 3 -dimensional (3 D) scanning of stems’ external geometry {{as well as from}} 3 D scanning in combination with X- ray log scanning. The improvement achieved with the combined scanning was rather low compared to using 3 D scanning alone. Results of a study of bucking methods, log sorting methods and production control showed that the more detailed information the bucking and log sorting decisions are based on, the higher the value recovery. Furthermore, the more processing stations involved in production control, the better are the demand targets met. In a study aiming at increased share of target board lengths, different bucking alternatives were evaluated. It was concluded that optimizing forest operations, value recovery and production as separate entities will not produce optimal results. A case study of a sawmill where the length of the timber was of high interest showed that increasing the share of target lengths of small dimensions can only be done at a relatively high cost in terms of volume yield loss. It was also shown that log classes should be defined with varying diameter limits for different log lengths at the conventional diameter-based log sorting. In order to meet the desired length distribution of the timber, it is necessary to alter the log length distribution, and this can be done with adaptive control heuristics that dynamically updates control log prices during bucking. It is concluded that there is an unexploited value potential in the forestry–wood chain which can be reached using modern measurement techniques and that a better characterization of the wood raw material will facilitate an improved customer-order orientation.

Specific attention is given to the argument against private banking that is purportedly based on equality.

40|$|AbstractThe {{expansion}} {{of national and}} international research efforts in stem cell research is increasingly paired with the trend of establishing <b>stem</b> cell <b>banks</b> and registries. In jurisdictions crossing the spectrum of restrictive to liberal <b>stem</b> cell policies, <b>banks</b> and registries are emerging as an essential resource for transnational access to quality-controlled and ethically sourced stem cell lines. In this study, we report the preliminary findings of a survey of <b>stem</b> cell <b>banks</b> participating in the International Stem Cell Forum's International <b>Stem</b> Cell <b>Banking</b> Initiative (ISCBI).
