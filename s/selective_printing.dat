40|$|Laser induced forward {{transfer}} (LIFT) is a versatile direct-write method for spatially <b>selective</b> <b>printing</b> {{of a wide}} range of materials. In the conventional LIFT technique a thin film (usually of thickness < 1 µm) of the material (the donor) to be printed is deposited on top of a substrate (the carrier) which is transparent to the incident laser wavelength. A laser pulse is then focussed/imaged onto the carrier-donor interface which induces the necessary impulsive force to push the donor onto a substrate placed nearby (the receiver) either by melting it (for the case of a sufficiently thin donor) or ablating the top layer (the thick donor case). In this talk, I shall describe our progress to date using femtosecond light pulses for LIFTing, and discuss what we have been able to achieve using sacrificial absorbing layers to provide the impulsive push, pre-machining of the donor, active and passive spatial beam shaping of the laser profile, use of LIFT to print source material for optical waveguide fabrication, and printing of the smallest metallic dots so far (300 nm diameter) ...|$|E

40|$|In early 2003, in a {{major shift}} in policy, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) {{announced}} that its learning materials would progressively move from a predominantly print-based mode of delivery to a new 'hybrid' mode of delivery across all discipline areas. Central to this delivery would be a resource-rich CDROM containing all study materials, supported with a range of multimedia based enhancements, online support and <b>selective</b> <b>print</b> materials. As this represented a fundamentally new approach to the delivery of materials at USQ, it was essential to ascertain a clear understanding of about the implications of this change for student learning. In implementing this policy it was necessary to establish a range of pedagogically sound, cost effective delivery guidelines, {{for the development of the}} course materials and the multimedia based enhancements. In response to this need, this study has developed a set of 10 multimodal design heuristics used to guide the development of these materials. In establishing these guidelines, this thesis contextualises important issues associated with hybrid delivery and considers how catering for a multiliterate clientele by using a combination of multimedia based enhancements in an electronic environment may improve the learning opportunities for students. Two Faculty of Business courses delivered in 2004, ECO 2000 'Macroeconomics for Business and Government' and MGT 2004 'People Development', were chosen to pilot the new hybrid mode of delivery. The combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches was used to investigate how students have utilised this new environment. This approach rendered a clear indication of student views about the CD based delivery and, more particularly, an appreciation of how they utilised the multimedia based enhancements to augment their studies. Analysis of the research data indicated a strong acceptance of the CD based learning environment. This was particularly true for off-campus and international students. On the whole, students reported a preference for a CD based resource, though this acceptance was moderated by a desire to still receive some print-based materials. Importantly, from this analysis it was possible to add a further four multimodal design heuristics to the original set of ten which informed the design of the multimedia based enhancements for each course. This study demonstrates that higher levels of student engagement are possible when integrating a range of multimedia based enhancements to cater for a range of student learning modalities, whilst also maintaining a balanced environment for more traditional learners 1...|$|R

The resulting pristine CNT thin films are then successfully patterned using either pre-growth or post-growth techniques. By developing a layered photoresist process that is compatible with ferric nitrate catalyst, significant improvements over popular pre-growth patterning methods are obtained. Limitations of traditional post-growth patterning methods are circumvented by <b>selective</b> transfer <b>printing</b> of CNTs with either thermoplastic or metallic stamps.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{investigate}} the effects on material properties of layer-by-layer application of pressure during fabrication of polymeric parts by additive manufacturing (AM). Although AM, also known popularly as 3 D printing, has set a new standard for ease of use and minimal restraint on geometric complexity, the mechanical part properties do not generally compare with conventional manufacturing processes. Contrary to other types of polymer processing, AM systems do not normally use (in-process) pressure during part consolidation. Design/methodology/approach: Tensile specimens were produced in Somos 201 using conventional laser sintering (LS) and <b>selective</b> laser <b>printing</b> (SLP) – a process under development in the UK, which incorporates the use of pressure to assist layer consolidation. Findings: Mechanical testing demonstrated the potential to additively manufacture parts with significantly improved microstructure and mechanical properties which match or exceed conventional processing. For example, the average elongation at break and ultimate tensile strength of a conventionally laser-sintered thermoplastic elastomer (Somos 201) increased from 136 ± 28 per cent and 4. 9 ± 0. 4 MPa, to 513 ± 35 per cent and 10. 4 ± 0. 4 MPa, respectively, when each layer was fused with in-process application of pressure (126 ± 9 kPa) by SLP. Research limitations/implications: These results are based on relatively small sample size, but despite this, the trends observed are of significant importance to the elimination of voids and porosity in polymeric parts. Practical implications: Layerwise application of pressure should be investigated further for defect elimination in AM.

We demonstrate a robust route for printing large-scale micropatterns of solution-processed semiconducting small molecules/insulating polymer blends for high performance arrays of nonvolatile ferroelectric polymer memory.

40|$|In recent years, the {{creation}} of a more economical bumping process has been the focus. One of the most promising technologies is the low-cost stencil printing based flip-chip technology. It consists of electroless Nickel/Gold (Ni / Au) Under Bump Metallurgy (UBM) plated on an Aluminum bond pad, followed by <b>selective</b> solder paste <b>printing,</b> using the stencil mask, on top of the UBM. It eliminates the expensive photolithography with thick photoresist and the usage of vacuum sputtering. Ni/Au UBM is not only important in stencil printed bumping technology, but also widely used in some of the anisotropic conductive flip chip technologies as conductive mini bump for the anisotropic conductive film (ACF). The redistribution (RDL) technology facilitates the adaptation of chips designed for wire bonding to flip chip bonding, and relaxes the otherwise tight wire bond pitch to a loose area array pitch. RDLs are formed by adding passivation and metal layers on the top of die, relocating the pads according to the design rules of the solder bumping process. The basic redistribution process includes both a reroute metal layer and additional dielectric layers. The redistribution metal can be aluminum, copper, or other metals. The choice of the conductive material is determined by the substrate and the electrical requirements of the IC. The most popular dielectrics for redistribution technology are Benzocyclobutene (BCB) and Polyimide (PI). BCB has a number of properties that makes it suitable for thick passivation including low moisture uptake, a low dielectric constant and a high degree of planarization over the topography in IC chips...|$|R
40|$|The strong {{variations}} in lift that occur {{with changes in}} forward speed lead {{to one of the}} fundamental difficulties in aircraft design: how to provide sufficient lift at landing and take-off without having oversized wings for cruise conditions. This fundamental problem is generally tackled using two approaches. First, by providing flaps and other high-lift devices, extra lift can be generated during landing and take-off, albeit at the cost of extra drag and complexity. Second, by using long and smooth runways, higher landing and take-off speeds can be tolerated, closing the gap between these speeds and those of operational flight. Even so, it is common for aircraft flying in the cruise condition to be operating with rather small main wing angles of attack (AoAs) compared with those at stall, implying that smaller wings would be desirable if acceptable landing and take-off could be achieved. A number of designers have attempted to tackle this problem with various forms of powered lift augmentation. This paper re-examines the idea of the Custer wing duct, also known as a channel wing, here applied to small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Such aircraft are generally not operated from long smooth runways and rarely have complex high-lift systems in their wings. It is shown that by using suitable ducts around the propellers, startlingly good take-off and landing performance can be achieved, and that suitable ducts can be readily incorporated into small UAVs with the use of 3 D <b>printing</b> (<b>selective</b> laser sintering) for their manufacture.
