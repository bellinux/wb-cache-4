40|$|With {{recent events}} such as the Chinese ASAT test in 2007 and the USA 193 {{intercept}} in 2008, many <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> are becoming increasingly aware of the potential threat to their satellites as the result of orbital debris or even other satellites. However, to be successful at conjunction monitoring and collision avoidance requires accurate orbital information for as many space objects (payloads, dead satellites, rocket bodies, and debris) as possible. Given the current capabilities of the US Space Surveillance Network (SSN), approximately 18, 500 objects are now being tracked and orbital data (in the form of two-line element sets) is available to <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> for 11, 750 of them (as of 2008 September 1). The capability to automatically process this orbital data to look for close conjunctions and provide that information to <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> via the Internet has been continuously available on CelesTrak, in the form of Satellite Orbital Conjunction Reports Assessing Threatening Encounters in Space (SOCRATES), since May 2004. Those reports are used by many operators as one way to keep apprised of these potential threats. However, the two-line element sets (TLEs) are generated using non-cooperative tracking via the SSN’s network of radar and optical sensors. As a result, the relatively low accuracy of the data results in a large number of false alarms that <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> must routinely deal with. Yet, <b>satellite</b> <b>operators</b> typically perform orbit maintenance for thei...|$|R

2500|$|On 13 March, The Wall Street Journal, citing {{sources in}} the US government, {{asserted}} that Rolls-Royce had received an aircraft health report every thirty minutes for five hours, implying that the aircraft had remained aloft for four hours after its transponder went offline; Malaysia denies the report. [...] The Wall Street Journal later amended its report and stated simply that the belief of continued flight was [...] "based on analysis of signals sent by the Boeing 777's satellite-communication link... the link operated {{in a kind of}} standby mode and sought to establish contact with a satellite or satellites. These transmissions did not include data." [...] The following day, <b>satellite</b> <b>operator</b> Inmarsat released a public statement stating that [...] "routine, automated signals were registered" [...] on its network; analysis of these [...] "keep-alive message" [...] that continued to be sent after air traffic control first lost contact could help pinpoint the aircraft's location.|$|E

2500|$|Murdoch's British-based {{satellite}} network, Sky Television, incurred massive {{losses in}} its early years of operation. As with many of his other business interests, Sky was heavily subsidised by the profits generated by his other holdings, but convinced rival <b>satellite</b> <b>operator</b> British Satellite Broadcasting to accept a merger on his terms in 1990. [...] They were quick to see the advantages of direct to home (DTH) satellite broadcasting that did not require costly cable networks and the merged company, BSkyB, has dominated the British pay-TV market ever since. By 1996, BSkyB had more than 3.6 million subscribers, triple the number of cable customers in the UK. British financier Lord Jacob Rothschild, a close Murdoch friend since the 1960s, served as deputy chairman of Murdoch's BSkyB corporation from 2003–2007. Murdoch has a seat on the Strategic Advisory Board of Genie Oil and Gas, having jointly investing with Rothschild in a 5.5 percent stake in the company which conducted shale gas and oil exploration in Colorado, Mongolia, Israel and, controversially, the occupied Golan Heights.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1990s, the {{popularity}} of satellite broadcasting greatly increased in the Arab world and in Lebanon. The first Lebanese station to use this technology was Future Television, launching Future International SAT in 1994, while LBCI and the Lebanese government followed by launching LBCSAT and Tele Liban Satellite respectively. In order to compete with these emerging stations, {{and in order to}} find an international audience, Al-Manar announced its intention to launch a satellite channel on 9 March 2000. Muhammad Ra'd, a Hezbollah member of parliament and al-Manar's largest shareholder, submitted the request to the minister of transmission, which was approved in April 2000. Although the launch of the satellite station was originally planned for July, the date was moved up in order to coincide {{with the end of the}} Israeli occupation of South Lebanon on 25 May. This success led other television stations to follow in launching satellite stations, including Murr TV in November 2000, but it was shut down for [...] "violating an election law prohibiting propaganda" [...] — a fate which al-Manar did not meet, although its programming was also considered propaganda by many analysts [...] ArabSat, a leading communications <b>satellite</b> <b>operator</b> in the Middle East, headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was at first wary about collaborating with al-Manar, because of the station's Shi'a agenda [...] — the two companies agreed, however, that the programming would be adapted to the pan-Arab audience, leading to a slight difference between the local broadcast and the one via satellite. At first, only three hours of satellite programming were broadcast per day, but by December 2000, the station was broadcasting around the clock.|$|E
