40|$|Abstract Introduction Patients on hemodialysis, {{particularly}} those with temporary non-tunneled dialysis access, constitute a high-risk population for bloodstream infections associated with significant {{morbidity and mortality}} rates. This population also has a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases with poor prognosis. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old Caucasian man with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, who presented with an eventually lethal case of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> with an unusual involvement of the heart, including bacterial coronary arteritis, myocardial abscesses and papillary muscle infarction and rupture, along with complications involving other organs. Conclusions It is important to try to minimize invasive procedures in patients who are hemodialysis dependent. The strict control of heart function is indicated considering the large spectrum of unusual cardiac complications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Splenic abscess is {{an unusual}} {{condition}} usually seen in immunocompromised patients or associated with intravenous drug abuses. Several conditions including trauma, immunodeficiency, corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive therapy and diabetes mellitus have been listed under the predisposing factors for a splenic abscess. Splenic abscess in a patient on hemodialysis is a rare but life-threatening condition if not corrected. We describe a case of splenic abscess with bacterial endocarditis on maintenance hemodialysis. He had <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> secondary to bacterial endocarditis at the mitral valve from the dialysis accesssite infection. Although hematologic seeding from endocarditis has been the predisposing factor for splenic abscess, we postulate that access-site infections may predispose hemodialysis patients to splenic abscess. Splenic abscess may be considered {{as one of the}} causes when patients on hemodialysis develop unexplained fever...|$|E
40|$|Rates of hospital-acquired staphylococcal {{infection}} increased {{throughout the}} 1990 s; however, information is limited on trends in community-onset staphylococcal {{disease in the}} United Kingdom. We used Hospital Episode Statistics to describe trends in hospital admissions for community-onset staphylococcal disease and national general practice data to describe trends in community prescribing for staphylococcal disease. Hospital admission rates for staphyloccocal <b>septicemia,</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> pneumonia, staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome, and impetigo increased > 5 -fold. Admission rates increased 3 -fold for abscesses and cellulitis and 1. 5 -fold for bone and joint infections. In primary care settings during 1991 - 2006, floxacillin prescriptions increased 1. 8 -fold and fusidic acidprescriptions 2. 5 -fold. The increases were not matched by increases in admission rates for control conditions. We identified a previously undescribed but major increase in pathogenic community-onset staphylococcal disease over the past 15 years. These trends are of concern given the international emergence of invasive community-onset staphylococcal infections...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{purified}} {{teichoic acid}} preparation {{was used in}} an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM response in staphylococcal disease. Antibody determination in a normal population, showing a difference of up to 20 -fold in the mean IgG titers between the youngest children and adults, was used to establish age-correlated upper normal values. IgM antibodies {{were found to be}} of little diagnostic value since their response was often low or absent. Increased IgG titers were found in 24 of 27 (89 %) patients with endocarditis, in 11 of 14 (79 %) with complicated septicemia, and in 10 of 20 (50 %) with uncomplicated septicemia with serum samples drawn between days 7 and 30 of disease. With paired samples, the numbers of patients with increased IgG titers were 17 of 17, 3 of 4, and 6 of 7, respectively, in the same patient groups. Increased IgG titers were less often demonstrated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis (7 of 22). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for teichoic acid antibodies was found to be a sensitive and specific method for diagnosing <b>staphylococcal</b> endocarditis and <b>septicemia.</b> For optimal results, both the substantial age-correlated variation in normal titers and the importance of adequately spaced samples should be considered...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} {{of studies on}} the hemorrhagic fevers of Southern Africa {{carried out in the}} South African Institute for Medical Research, {{attention}} has been called to occurrence of meningococcal septicemia in recruits to the mining industry and South African Army, to cases of <b>staphylococcal</b> and streptococcal <b>septicemia</b> with hemorrhagic manifestations, and to the occurrence of plague which, in its septicemic form, may cause a hemorrhagic state. "Onyalai," a bleeding disease in tropical Africa, often fatal, was related to profound thrombocytopenia possibly following administration of toxic witch doctor medicine. Spirochetal diseases, and rickettsial diseases in their severe forms, are often manifested with hemorrhagic complications. Of enterovirus infections, Coxsackie B viruses occasionally caused severe hepatitis associated with bleeding, especially in newborn babies. Cases of hemorrhagic fever presenting in February-March, 1975 are described. The first outbreak was due to Marburg virus disease and the second, which included seven fatal cases, was caused by Rift Valley fever virus. In recent cases of hemorrhagic fever a variety of infective organisms have been incriminated including bacterial infections, rickettsial diseases, and virus diseases, including Herpesvirus hominis; in one patient, the hemorrhagic state was related to rubella. A boy who died in a hemorrhagic state was found to have Congo fever; another patient who died of severe bleeding from the lungs was infected with Leptospira canicola, and two patients who developed a hemorrhagic state after a safari trip in Northern Botswana were infected with Trypanosoma rhodesiense. An illness manifested by high fever and melena developed in a young man after a visit to Zimbabwe; the patient was found to have both malaria and Marburg virus disease...|$|R
40|$|We report our {{experience}} of managing 6 patients with numerous cerebral cysticerci. Their age ranged between 5 and 45 years and 3 of them were females. All of them presented with clinical symptoms and signs of raised intracranial tension with partial seizure n 3 and behavioural abnormality in one patient. The diagnosis of cysticercosis was based on characteristic CT or MRI findings or both in all six, biopsy of subcutaneous nodule in two and igG ELISA for cysticercosis in one patient. Of the two patients who received albendazole therapy one died and other deteriorated. Four were managed with only antioedema measures including corticosteroids, of which one recovered completely and 3 partially. One of the patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy died because of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia.</b> Cysticidal therapy in patients with numerous cerebral cysticercii may be dangerous. It is suggested that albendazole therapy may be avoided in patients with numerous cerebral cysticercii and these patients should preferably be treated with antioedema measures and antiepileptic drugs and corticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|A 3 cm polyp of the gastric greater {{curvature}} {{formed by}} a histiocytoma (fibroxanthoma) {{was discovered in}} a 62 -year-old, diabetic, chronically-ill woman undergoing evalua-tion for anemia. The histology of the endoscopic biopsy of this lesion mimicked a signet ring adenocarcinoma as the mucosa was infiltrated by histiocytic cells with enlarged, atypical nuclei and intracytoplasmic mucin. The patient died without clinical evidence of recurrence from <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> 8 months following subtotal proximal gastrectomy. While the pathologic findings fell into the spectrum of an in-flammatory fibroid polyp or histiocytoma (inflammatory pseudotumor, plasma cell granuloma) of the stomach, the predominance of foamy histiocytes was distinctive. In addition, histiocytic cells {{were present in the}} enlarged perigastric lymph nodes, the spleen, and the bone marrow. The histogenesis of this gastric polyp is obscure and not the focus of this report.

40|$|Objective: The {{impact of}} {{anaerobic}} growth {{conditions on the}} Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) production was studied. Methods: Ten strains of S. aureus derived from patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS), 10 isolates of S. aureus, and documented TSST- 1 -producing strains recovered from patients with either <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> or staphylococcal nongenital abscesses were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The bacterial growth was measured using optical density (OD) determinations at 520 nm. The toxin production was assayed using the TS-RPLA latex agglutination test. Results: Both TSS and non-TSS strains of S. aureus grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions exhibited comparable OD patterns of growth, and the levels of toxin production remained constant during the logarithmic phase. Toxin titers developed during the logarithmic grovvth phase and peaked after 24 h of incubation. When stationary-phase isolates grown initially under aerobic conditions were subjected to strict anaerobic conditions, subsequent toxin titers, compared with isolates grown in the continued presence of oxygen, were depressed 2 -fold, peaking at a later time. Conclusions: TSST- 1 production is diminished under continued anaerobic conditions...|$|E
30|$|Results: Among {{the twelve}} cases, there were as many men as women. Mean age was 47.2 Â years. An {{immunosuppression}} factor {{was found in}} 41.7 % cases. Clinically, all patients had fever. A deterioration of the general condition was observed in 9 cases. Tumor syndrome was found in 50 % of patients. Biologically, cytopenia was noted in 11 casesâbicytopenia in 7 cases and pancytopenia in 4 cases. Hepatic cytolysis was observed in 10 patients, hyperferritinemia in 11 cases and hypertriglyceridemia in 11 cases. Cytological examination of bone marrow confirmed hemophagocytosis in 9 cases (3 patients had refused sternal puncture). The causal infection was of bacterial origin in 58 % of casesâthree cases of tuberculosis, one case of brucellosis, one case of rickettsial disease, one gram-negative bacilli septicemia and one <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia.</b> The viral origin was found in 5 patientsâ 2 cases of EBV infection, one case of CMV infection, one HSV infection in one case and one case of HIV infection associated with candidiasis. A specific etiological treatment was initiated in all patients, with a favorable outcome in 83 % of cases. However, we deplore two deaths. They were immunocompromised patients.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{progress}} in antimicrobial therapy, septicemia remains {{a major problem}} of modern medicine. The clinical features and outcome may vary in different clinical settings and in a single setting during the years. As an example, gram-negative bacilli have been the prevalent cause of fulminant septicemia in granulocytopenic patients during the seventies. Nowdays, the use of indwelling central venous catheters and/or quinolone prophylaxis have favored the emergence of coagulase-negative staphylococci as {{a major cause of}} septicemia in these patients. As a consequence, the optimal management of febrile episodes in granulocytopenic patients should include not only a combination of a broad spectrum betalactam plus an aminoglycoside to prevent early death from gram-negative septicemia, but also antistaphylococcal antibiotics in cases not improving after 72 hours. The clinical spectrum of infective endocarditis continues to evolve. Infection of the right heart valves that was rare until a few decades ago, is now a frequent cause of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> in intravenous drug addicts. Along with prosthetic valve infection, new clinical syndromes of nosocomial endocarditis are emerging. Infections of permanent central venous catheters, ventriculoatrial shunts or pace-maker leads may in fact cause right-sided infective endocarditis. Septicemia will continue to challenge physicians in the future...|$|E
40|$|T H E {{reported}} mortality from <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> {{associated with}} foci {{of all sorts}} varies from 8 to 90 per cent. 1 " 11 Inspection of the sum-mary of recent reports in table 1 shows that though reduction in the gen-eral mortality has followed the use of one or another therapeutic agent, {{the invasion of the}} blood stream by staphylococci is still a grave matter. More-over, strict criteria for diagnosis are not always defined. Stookey and Scarpellino 3 insisted upon the presence of three positive blood cultures for inclusion of cases in their series, and excluded all cases of osteomyelitis, but most authors have not laid down such rigid criteria. The presence of two positive blood cultures {{would seem to be a}} fair criterion in cases that are to constitute the basis of therapeutic evaluation, but in general, waiting for three positive cultures before beginning treatment is hardly justified. Another gap in the armamentarium of evaluation is the lack of extensive data dealing with the mortality in bacteremic osteomyelitis.

40|$|Purpose: Erlotinib (Tarceva) is {{a potent}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor (HER 1) inhibitor. Infusional 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is a standard therapy for colorectal cancer. This trial assessed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of erlotinib combined with FOLFOX. Experimental Design: Patients with advanced solid tumors were sequentially enrolled into three cohorts (cohort 1 : 100 mg/d erlotinib, 65 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m(2) leucovorin, 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5 -FU, and 400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion 5 -FU; cohort 2 : oxaliplatin increased to 85 mg/m(2) and 5 -FU infusion increased to 600 mg/m(2); and cohort 3 : erlotinib increased to 150 mg/d). Results: Thirty-two patients were enrolled (23 with colorectal cancer) : no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed in cohort 1. In cohort 2, two of nine patients experienced a DLT (both diarrhea). In cohort 3, two of nine patients had a DLT (diarrhea and <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia).</b> Cohort 3 determined the MTD cohort and expanded to 17 patients in total. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis, and rash (primarily mild/moderate). No pharmacokinetics interactions were observed. One patient (colorectal cancer) had a complete response, seven patients had a partial response, and nine had stable disease. Conclusions: The MTD was defined as follows: 150 mg/d erlotinib, 85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin; 200 mg/m(2) leucovorin, 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5 -FU, and 600 mg/m(2) infusion 5 -FU. At the MTD, the combination was well tolerated and showed antitumor activity, warranting further investigation in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and other solid tumors...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{arthritis}} is {{a rapidly}} progressive and highly erosive {{disease of the}} joints in which both host and bacterial factors are of pathogenic importance. One potential bacterial virulence factor {{is the ability to}} express a polysaccharide capsule (CP). Among 11 reported capsular serotypes, CP type 5 (CP 5) and CP 8 comprise 80 to 85 % of all clinical blood isolates. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of CP 5 as a virulence factor in <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>septicemia</b> and septic arthritis with a recently established murine model of hematogenously spread S. aureus arthritis. NMRI mice were inoculated intravenously with S. aureus strains isogenic for expression of CP 5, and clinical, bacteriological, serological, and histopathological progression of disease was studied. Inoculation of 7 x 10 (6) CFU of S. aureus per mouse induced 55 % mortality in the group inoculated with the CP-expressing bacteria, compared to 18 % in the group inoculated with CP- mutants. A lower dose of inoculum (3 x 10 [6] per mouse) did not give rise to mortality in mice inoculated with CP mutant strains, whereas 18 % of the mice inoculated with the CP 5 -expressing S. aureus died. Importantly, mice inoculated with S. aureus expressing CP 5 had a significantly higher frequency of arthritis and a more severe form of the disease. In vitro assays suggested that macrophages were not able to phagocytize CP 5 + staphylococci as efficiently as they were CP 5 - strains. In addition, once phagocytized, CP 5 + bacteria were less efficiently killed than CP- mutants. In summary, CP 5 leads to a higher frequency of arthritis and a more severe course of the disease. This seems to be related to the effects of the downregulatory properties of CP on the ingestion and intracellular killing capacity of phagocytes. Our results clearly indicate that the expression of CP 5 is a determinant of the virulence of S. aureus in arthritis and septicemia...|$|E
