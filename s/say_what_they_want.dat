Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe.

40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practice}} {{differs from}} hospital {{medicine in the}} personal nature of the doctor-patient relationship and in the need to address social and psychological issues {{as well as physical}} problems. Recent changes in undergraduate medical education have resulted in more teaching and learning taking place in general practitioner (GP) surgeries. AIM: To explore patients' experiences of attending a surgery with a medical student present. METHOD: A questionnaire was designed, based on semi-structured interviews. Questionnaires were posted to patients who had attended teaching surgeries in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty questionnaires were sent; of these, 335 suitable for analysis were returned. The response rate in Newcastle was 79 %, and in London 60 %. Ninety-five per cent of responders agreed that patients have an important role in teaching medical students. Patients reported learning more and having more time to talk, however, up to 10 % of responders left the consultation without <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to <b>say</b> and 30 % found it more difficult to talk about personal matters. CONCLUSION: The presence of a student has a complex effect on the general practice consultation. Future developments in medical education need to be evaluated in terms of how patient care is affected as well as meeting educational aims...|$|R
