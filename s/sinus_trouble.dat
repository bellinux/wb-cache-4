2500|$|As a reservist in the British Army, Sutcliffe was {{the first}} Yorkshire player to be called up, in August 1939, as the Second World War became imminent. He missed Yorkshire's final match of the season against Sussex at Hove, which ended on 1 September, the day the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. He rejoined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and {{attained}} the rank of major. [...] He did not leave Great Britain during his army service which ended in November 1942. Now aged 48, he was discharged from the army on medical grounds having undergone two operations that year for <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> and a shoulder injury. For {{the remainder of the}} war, he divided his time between his sportswear business and charity fundraising.|$|E

50|$|Windsor Lad {{suffered}} from ill health during his stud career and made little impact as a stallion. He developed severe <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> and was put down in 1943. His most notable offspring was the Irish Triple Crown winner Windsor Slipper.|$|E
50|$|Nasal polyps (NP) are noncancerous growths {{within the}} nose or <b>sinuses.</b> Symptoms include <b>trouble</b> {{breathing}} through the nose, loss of smell, decreased taste, post nasal drip, and a runny nose. The growths are sac-like, movable, and nontender. They typically occur in both nostrils {{in those who}} are affected. Face pain may occasionally occur. Complications may include sinusitis.|$|R

[...] Facsimile One is described as closing down the Pineal gland which Descartes described as the [...] "principle seat of the soul" [...] and is also associated with the third eye in Hinduism.|$|E
50|$|Walker {{believed}} that dairy products especially had a deleterious effect on human health. He {{testified to the}} disappearance of many ailments upon the exclusion of dairy products. He explained that pathogenic organisms find an ideal breeding ground in the excess mucus that dairy products generate. He cited the following diseases as being aggravated or caused by mucus conditions in which dairy products are the major offender: undulant fever, colds, flu, bronchial troubles, tuberculosis, asthma, hay fever, <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble,</b> pneumonia and certain types of arthritis.|$|E
50|$|Hafey was {{the first}} major success of Rickey's {{expansive}} farm system, breaking through in 1927 when he led the National League in slugging. Hafey, however, had suffered multiple beanings in 1926. He developed <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> and his vision deteriorated, and Hafey began to wear eyeglasses while playing. Although Specs Toporcer {{was the first}} baseball player to wear glasses, Hafey was the most prominent; he is one of two Hall of Famers with eyeglasses, Reggie Jackson being the other. Because his vision became so variable, Hafey was obliged to rotate among three different pairs of glasses.|$|E
5000|$|Randell {{served in}} the army and was cast in some Australian wartime {{propaganda}} short films such as 100,000 Cobbers (1943) and South West Pacific (1943). He was discharged on medical grounds in 1943. [...] "They threw me out of the army... because I had tuberculosis, warning me I wouldn't live to be an old man," [...] said Randell. One report said he was suffering <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble,</b> was having trouble remembering his lines in shows and {{was on the verge of}} a nervous breakdown. He decided to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Los Angeles and travelled to the USA in 1943.|$|E
50|$|The domineering Maggie Robinson (Peggy Mount - the 'Lollipop' of the title) and her timid husband Reg aka 'Mr. Mole' (Hugh Lloyd) are a comically-mismatched couple {{living in}} Fulham, London (they married late in life, 'Lollipop' having had aged parents {{to look after}} and 'Mr. Mole' having waited for 'Miss Right'). Their {{domestic}} bliss is interrupted by the arrival from Africa of Reg's brother, the brash, workshy Bruce (Rex Garner) and his hypochrondriac wife Violet (Pat Coombs). The comedy revolves partly around Reg and Maggie's attempts to get Bruce employment. Another feature is Reg's <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> (which prevents him fully appreciating his wife's cooking).|$|E
5000|$|After a short {{retirement}} due to <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> Hodgins {{signed for}} the Nottingham Panthers in 1959-60 {{after a brief}} spell with the Brighton Tigers. In 1961 he was appointed player-coach of the newly formed Altrincham Aces. He then went to play for Milan in Italy. It was in Milan where Hodgins earned his other nickname, [...] "Il Leone" [...] or [...] "The Lion". During a game he received a stick to the face, shattering his nose, and left the ice for treatment. Convinced {{this was the last}} they would see of him the Milanese crowd were amazed to see him take to the ice minutes later to shore up the defence.|$|E

5000|$|... 1942 June: The Experimental Submarine Flotilla {{moved to}} [...] "Port ZD" [...] (Port D) at Keose on Loch Erisort in Scotland. Their first powered manned torpedo was the Mark I Chariot. Its hull was 21 in in diameter. It could make 2.9 kn and could dive safely {{to a depth}} of 20 ft. The nose was a warhead with 600 pounds of high explosive. Training was hard. The men often {{suffered}} from oxygen poisoning because of the use of pure oxygen at depth, burst eardrums and <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble.</b> The strangeness of the Chariots added to their problems. They were trained to ride and steer for a long time under water, and to then cut through harbour defence nets. The hardest part was learning to work with the Chariots' warheads.|$|E
40|$|In October 1993 and 1994, respectively, 77 and 76 third-year {{veterinary}} students {{visited a}} swine farm {{to work with}} pigs for 3 h. On both occasions, {{a large number of}} students reported flu-like symptoms after the visit. To further investigate this, the students were presented with a questionnaire modeled after the standard questionnaire used for evaluating organic dust exposure. General and/or respiratory symptoms were reported by 103 / 142 (72. 5 %) students. General symptoms, such as eye irritation, headache and tiredness were experienced by 60 / 103 (42. 2 %) students. Cough, nasal and throat irritation, and <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> were the most prevalent respiratory symptoms and were reported by 94 / 103 (91 %) of the students. Symptoms mostly developed the same day and disappeared within 3 d after exposure. The presence of respiratory and/or general symptoms was not significantly different between students who wore a mask during the lab or those who did not. Students with pre-existing allergies were more likely to develop respiratory symptoms than non-allergic students...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether there was excess ill health in people living near a coking works, and if so whether it was related to exposure to coking works' emissions. DESIGN [...] Populations varying in proximity to the coking works were compared with control populations. Health data were correlated with available environmental data. METHODS [...] Analysis of routinely collected mortality, cancer registration, and birth statistics; community survey using self completed postal questionnaires; retrospective analysis of general practice (GP) records; tests of respiratory function; and analysis of available environmental data. MAIN RESULTS [...] Study and control populations were comparable in terms of response rates, gender, and most socioeconomic indicators. For adults, age standardised mortality and cancer rates of the population closest to the coking works were comparable with those for the district as a whole. Gender ratios, birthweight, and stillbirth rates were comparable {{in the study and}} control populations. For several indicators of respiratory health including cough, <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble,</b> glue ear, and wheeze (but not for asthma and chronic bronchitis) there was a gradient of self reported ill health, with the highest prevalence in areas closest to the works. For example, <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> was reported by 20 % of adults and 13 % of children in the area closest to the works compared with 13 % and 6 % respectively in the control area. GP consultations for respiratory disorders increased when pollution (measured by SO 2 levels) was high: annual consultation rates per 1000 varied from 752 in the top group of daily pollution levels to 424 in the bottom group. Analysis of locally collected smoke and SO 2 data indicated that SO 2 concentrations were highest closest to the works and, after closure of the coking works, the number of days on which SO 2 and smoke levels exceeded 100 micrograms/m 3 and 90 micrograms/m 3, respectively, fell steeply. CONCLUSION [...] Routinely available indicators failed to provide convincing evidence that the coking works had harmed health. Self report and GP consultations indicated that respiratory ill health in the people living close to the works was worse than expected. Some of the excess probably resulted from exposure to coking works emissions. The health effects of relatively low level but intermittently high air pollution from a point source may be subtle, contributing to respiratory morbidity, but not apparent in analysis of routine health indicators...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the extent to}} which acute reactions to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) among 723 adult non-smokers differ between those who report a medical history indicative of atopy and those with no such history. Study subjects were divided into three risk groups, based on their medical history: people who reported a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of asthma, hay fever, or allergic reactions to pollen, dust, or mites (n = 140); people not in Group I, who reported a doctor-confirmed history of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble</b> (n = 246); and all other subjects (n- 337). Reactions to ETS were assessed by asking subjects to report how much it bothers them to be exposed to other people's tobacco smoke and to indicate whether they typically experience symptoms when exposed to ETS. Study findings support the concept that people with a history of atopy or respiratory illness are more sensitive to the acute irritating effects of ETS compared to people without such a medical history. Complaints by non-smokers of eye irritation, nasal congestion, coughing, and headaches in response to exposure to ETS are common. '" 6 Speer 1 found that of 250 non-smoking adults with no atopic history, 69 % reported eye irritation, 29 % reported nasal symptoms, 25 % reported coughing, and 31 % reported headache...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} exposure to organic solvents {{and the presence of}} pulmonary and upper respiratory tract mucous membrane symptoms, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 215 newspaper pressroom workers who were occupationally exposed to organic solvent and lubricant mixtures. Thirty-four compositors, who were not occupationally exposed to the solvents or lubricants, served as controls. Pressroom workers and compositors underwent spirometric testing and were also asked about the presence of cough, phlegm, hemoptysis, dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, nose or throat irritation, eye irritation, and <b>sinus</b> <b>trouble.</b> The spirometric results did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the pressroom workers {{were significantly more likely to}} report pulmonary or upper respiratory tract mucous membrane symptoms than were compositors (P 3 ̆c 0. 005). An exposure-response relationship could be demonstrated when comparing the number of solvents exposed with the total number of symptoms (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Similarly, an exposure-response relationship could be demonstrated when comparing the frequency of use of each of the seven solvents with the total number of symptoms (P 3 ̆c 0. 002). Each of these findings was supported in a multivariable linear regression model that adjusted for potential confounders such as age, smoking history, and number of years in the industry. A high prevalence of these symptoms was reported even though the degree of exposure to solvents and lubricants was within the current permissible exposure limits...|$|E
