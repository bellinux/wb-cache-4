According to Eurostat, people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Cyprus accounted for approximately 23 - 27%, roughly aligned with the EU average of about 23 - 26% in the measured period (2004 - 2012). In 2010, 16% of the population were part of households with income below €10,189 per adult capita, corresponding to 60% of the median income per adult capita.

The aim {{of the study was}} to collect information on socioeconomic characteristics and biomedical risk factors in migrant TB patients in Italy and compare it with data collected among Italian TB patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted among TB patients aged ≥ 18 years over a 12 -months enrolment period in 12 major Italian hospitals. Information on education, employment, housing and income was collected, and European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions index was used to assess material deprivation. Among migrants, we also analyzed factors associated with <b>severe</b> <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> Migrants were compared with younger (18 - 64 years) and older (65 + years) Italians patients. Out of 755 patients enrolled (with a median age of 42 years, interquartile range: 31 - 53), 65 % were migrants. Pulmonary, microbiologically confirmed, and new cases were 80 %, 73 %, and 87 % respectively. Prevalence of co-morbidities (i. e. diabetes, chronic kidney disease, neoplastic diseases and use of immunosuppressive drugs) was lower among migrants compared to Italian TB patients, while indicators of socioeconomic status, income and housing conditions were worst in migrants. Forty-six percent of migrants were severely deprived vs. 9 % of Italians (p< 0. 0001, 11. 3 % and 5. 5 % among younger and older Italians, respectively).

This analysis sought {{to identify the}} determinants of poor self-rated health as an indirect measure of health status and mortality prognosis in an adult female population {{during a period of}} socio-economic transition in Armenia. Methods Differences in self-rated health in women respondents were analyzed along three main dimensions: social, behavioral/attitudinal, and psychological. The data used were generated from cross-sectional household health surveys conducted in Armavir marz in 2001 and 2004. The surveys utilized the same instruments and study design (probability proportional to size, multistage cluster sampling with a combination of interviewer-administered and self-administered surveys) and generated two independent samples of households representative of Armavir marz. Binary logistic regression models with self-rated health as the outcome were fitted to the 2001 and 2004 datasets and a combined 2001 / 2004 dataset. Results Overall, 2 038 women aged 18 and over participated in the two surveys (1 019 in each). The rate of perceived "poor" health was relatively high in both surveys: 38. 1 % in 2001 and 27. 0 % in 2004. The sets of independent predictors of poor self-rated health were similar in all three models and included <b>severe</b> and moderate <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> probable and possible depression, low level of education, and having ever smoked. These predictors mediated the effect of women's economic activity (including unemployment), ethnicity, low access to/utilization of healthcare services, and living alone on self-rated health. Conclusion <b>Material</b> <b>deprivation</b> was the most influential predictor of self-rated health. Thus, social reforms to decrease the gap between the rich and poor are recommended as a powerful tool for reducing health inequalities and improving the health status of the population. </p...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the view}} that the {{undeclared}} economy is separate from the declared economy has been transcended, not least because it has been recognised that formal employers often pay their formal employees not only an official declared salary but also an undeclared (envelope) wage so as to evade their full tax and social insurance liabilities. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the prevalence of this illegal wage practice used by formal employers to reduce their labour costs by not declaring to the authorities the full salary of their formal employees. To do this, we report the pooled results of both a 2007 and 2013 Eurobarometer dataset in order to investigate both individual- and country-level variations in under-declared employment in the European Union. The finding is that the likelihood of receiving an additional undeclared (envelope) wage is more common among employees who are men, younger employees, manual workers, people who know others engaged in undeclared work, and those living in East-Central Europe and Southern Europe. Moreover, the likelihood of this illegal wage practice is greater in countries at lower levels of economic development and with less modernised state bureaucracies, lower levels of social transfers, social protection and labour market interventions to protect vulnerable groups, and with greater <b>severe</b> <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and inequality.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to explore the effect of the economic crisis on child health using Spain as a case study, and to document and assess the policies implemented in response to the crisis in this context. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional data from Eurostat, the Spanish Health Interview Survey, and the database of childhood hospitalisation were analysed to explore impacts on child health, and key determinants of child health. A content analysis of National data sources/government legislation, and Spanish literature was used to describe policies implemented following the crisis. RESULTS: Unemployment rates in the general population (8. 7 % in 2005 and 25. 6 % in 2013), and children living in unemployed families (5. 6 % and 13. 8 %) increased in the study period. The percentage of children living under the poverty line, and income inequalities increased 15 - 20 % from 2005 to 2012. <b>Severe</b> <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> rate has worsened in families with Primary Education, while the number of families attending Non-Governmental Organisations has increased. An impact on children's health at the general population level has not currently been detected; however an impact on general health, mental health and use of healthcare services was found in vulnerable groups. Investment in social protection and public policy for children showed a reduction as part of austerity measures taken by the Spanish governments.

40|$|Introduction. Socioeconomic inequalities {{affecting}} {{health are}} of major importance in Europe. The literature enhances {{the role of}} social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic characteristics and urbanization, to achieve health equity. Yet, {{there is still much}} to know, mainly concerning the association between cause-specific mortality and several social determinants, especially in metropolitan areas. /nThis study aims to describe the geographical pattern of cause-specific mortality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), at small area level (parishes), and analyses the statistical association between mortality risk and health determinants (<b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and urbanization level). Fourteen causes have been selected, representing almost 60 % of total mortality between 1995 and 2008, particularly those associated with urbanization and <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> /nMethods. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out. Using a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model, we estimated sex–specific smoothed Standardized Mortality Ratios (sSMR) and measured the relative risks (RR), and 95 % credible intervals, for cause-specific mortality relative to 1. urbanization level, 2. <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and 3. <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> adjusted by urbanization. /nResults. The statistical association between mortality and <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and between mortality and urbanization changes by cause of death and sex. Dementia and MN larynx, trachea, bronchus and lung are the causes of death showing higher relative risk associated with urbanization. Infectious and parasitic diseases, Chronic liver disease and Diabetes are the causes of death presenting higher relative risk associated with <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> Ischemic heart disease was the only cause with a statistical association with both determinants, and MN female breast was the only without any statistical association. Urbanization level reduces the impact of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> for most of the causes of death. Men face a higher impact of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and urbanization level, than women, in most cause-specific mortality, even when considering the adjusted model. /nConclusions. Our findings explore the specific pattern of fourteen causes of death in LMA and reveals small areas with an excess risk of mortality associated with <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> thereby identifying problematic areas that could potentially benefit from public policies effecting social inequalities.

Longitudinal data on <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> longstanding illness and limiting longstanding illness enables investigations {{of the effects of}} <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> on risk of limiting longstanding illness. This study investigates whether a shift from affording to not affording a car predicts the probability of limiting longstanding ill (LLSI). Methods The 2008 – 2011 longitudinal panel of Statistics on Income, Social Inclusion and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is utilised. Longitudinal fixed effects logit models are applied, using LLSI as dependent variable. Transition from affording a car to not affording a car is used as a proxy for <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> All models are controlled for whether the person becomes longstanding ill (LSI) as well as other time-variant covariates that could affect the results.

In order to approximate chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> we use a three-step index of chronic cumulative disadvantage. In the first step, population members deprived in three domains of static <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> are identified. In the second step, the extent of cumulative disadvantage of these individuals is examined and, in the final step, persons suffering from chronic cumulative disadvantage over the period 2005 - 2008 are identified, by aggregating the information on static cumulative disadvantage in each year covered. Then, we examine the overlap between chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and (smoothed) longitudinal poverty. The results reveal considerable differences across EU countries regarding both the level {{and the structure of}} the population at high risk of chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and longitudinal poverty.

The results of the analysis reveal a number of qualitative similarities and quantitative differences across EU member states. Nevertheless, in almost all countries under examination, lack of full employment by the individual or, especially, by the household's reference person, low educational qualifications, being a member of a lone parent household or living in a household headed by a woman or by a very young or, to a lesser extent, an elderly person, lead to high risks of chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> as well as longitudinal poverty...|$|R

Drawing on data from the British Household Panel Survey, I show that while low income and <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> identify very different households as being poor, and display distinct trends over time, in many cases they identify the same groups at being at risk of material poverty...|$|R
