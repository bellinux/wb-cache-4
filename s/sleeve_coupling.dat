40|$|AbstractBasically robots are {{designed}} in such {{way that they}} remove human intervention from labour intensive and hazardous work environment, sometimes they are also used to explore inaccessible work places which are generally impossible to access by humans. The inspection of pipe comes in same category because they carry toxic chemicals, fluids {{and most of the}} time has small internal diameter or bends which become inaccessible to human. The complex internal geometry and hazard content constraints of pipes demand robots for inspection of such pipes in order to check corrosion level of pipe, recovery of usable parts from pipe interior, sampling of sludge and scale formation on pipe internal surface etc. Several designs of In-pipe inspection robots (IPIR) have been proposed in the literature to solve the problems related with inspection of these complicated internal geometries. Designing of an in-pipe inspection robot (IPIR) is a difficult task and hence the designer must take care of the design issues like Mobility, Steer ability, Turning radius, Size and shape adaptability, Online adaptability, Flexibility, Stability, Autonomous operation and obstacle avoidance, Efficiency at uneven surface, Safe operation, Material selection, Type of task to be performed inside the pipe, Number of actuators, Operation in active pipe line, Retrieval of robot, User friendly navigation and control system, Range of operation, Quantitative analysis of defects inside the pipe. Based on above, this research work presents investigations into design issues pertaining to development of In-pipe inspection robotics and proposes a new model of an In-pipe inspection robot to overcome some critical design issues. This proposed model is a screw drive type wall press adaptable wheeled In-pipe inspection robot. It is able to move through vertical, horizontal pipes and it can easily pass through elbow of a pipe line. This model comprises of three modules- rotor, stator and control unit. The Rotor module has three wheels mounted on the outer periphery with a helix angle of 15 °. Wheels of rotor follow the helical path on the internal surface of pipe line and move in the longitudinal direction inside the pipe. A geared DC motor of 200 RPM is connected to rotor by a flexible <b>sleeve</b> <b>coupling.</b> Due to its flexibility motor can transmit torque to rotor even in case of minor misalignments and can easily be stopped at any point of journey inside the vertical or horizontal pipeline, thereby eliminating the need of braking system to achieve stability. Stator module is the housing of motor and it contains three spring loaded wheels on the outer periphery. Control Module of robot consist battery and wireless control unit. Spring loaded wheels of rotor and stator provide it shape adaptability and enhance friction between wheels and pipe interior...|$|E

40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) drive <b>sleeve,</b> (b) <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve,</b> (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The mode of failure in the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves,</b> however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves,</b> it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves...</b>|$|R

3000|$|Efforts {{have been}} {{conducted}} to investigate the mechanical performance of splices with <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> of various geometrical and mechanical configurations, mostly under incremental tensile loading. In general, the most common failure modes for splices under incremental tensile loading have been bar fracture and bar pull-out due to grout-bar bond failure (Einea et al. 1995; Jansson 2008; Ling et al. 2012). In these circumstances, the mechanical performance of the splices essentially depends on the bond behavior between grout and bars. Test results have indicated that the mechanical performance of the splices is generally {{not as strong as}} that of the connected bars. For example, the tensile strengths and deformation capacities of the splices were lower than those of the connected bars (Einea et al. 1995; Ling et al. 2012; Kim and Lee 2012; Ling et al. 2014; Henin and Morcous 2015), e.g., the ultimate strengths and ultimate strains of 24 specimens appropriately fabricated by Ling et al. (2014) averaged 95 and 62  % of those of the connected bars, respectively. In general, appropriate geometrical configuration of <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves,</b> adequate embedded length of bars, and high compressive strength of grout help to enhance the grout-bar bond and, therefore, improve the mechanical performance of the splices. On the other hand, limited information is available for the behavior of splices under cyclic loading. Hayashi et al. (1997) studied strength, rigidity, capacity of elongation, and the bond stress-slip relationship of splices under cyclic loading. The loading reversed 20 loops and ranged from 0.95 F [...]...|$|R
40|$|Open-tubular {{capillaries}} {{have been}} joined together {{for use in}} on-column ion-exchange preconcentration of anions by capillary electrochromatography (CEC) with elution by a transient isotachophoretic gradient. This involved the coupling of a preconcentration capillary and a separation capillary using a PTFE <b>sleeve.</b> Such <b>coupling</b> allowed precise lengths of differently coated capillaries to be joined in-line to form a single multi-mode column. The different segments could be tailored to optimize a separation by either altering the length of each segment to precisely manipulate the amount of stationary phase present or by changing the internal diameter of each segment to alter the phase ratio in the chromatographic column without affecting the path length for UV detection. In this work, a segmented in-line capillary was {{used in conjunction with}} a fluoride–octanesulfonate discontinuous electrolyte system {{to increase the number of}} anions that could be preconcentrated and separated. Quaternary ammonium functionalised latex particles were used for creating the preconcentration segment and the separation segment was coated with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). This allowed the detection of trace anions in drinking water and in situ sampling of river water for the analysis of trace inorganic anions. The repeatability of producing the quaternary ammonium functionalized latex-coated segments was assessed and the effect of segmentation on peak efficiency was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Plasma antennas {{represent}} {{the importance of}} technology in wireless communication that was developed due to its potential and innovativeness. Plasma antenna is a type o f antenna in which the metal conducting elements of a conventional antenna are replaced by plasma. In microwave field, the analyses of different gases by using discharge tube are investigated by injecting the RF source to produce monopole plasma antenna. The discharges have limitation on practical usefulness in commercial applications. This thesis introduces a concept of plasma monopole antennas through RF- charging of different inert gas. The plasma antenna is constructed using different inert gases as the plasma medium. The relationship between the generated plasma parameters and the antenna characteristics are investigated and discussed in two related topics. First, the preliminary studies on plasma antenna performance and behaviour are presented. Special focus is given on proving the theoretical plasma antenna on simulation by using different gas to analyse the characteristics o f plasma antenna behaviour. The antenna’s capability to operate as a transceiver is verified through simulation by using CST Microwave Studio. It is shown that the S- parameter for different gases and pressures give different performance due {{to the number of}} turns of <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve</b> used. The effect of the thickness o f the <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve</b> is also discussed. The second topic in this thesis is the development of plasma antenna where the implications on the fabricated antenna characteristics are discussed. The antenna characteristics that will be taken into account is the s- parameter, radiation pattern and antenna gain. The capability of plasma antenna is satisfied to transmit and receive the signal when the plasma antenna is supplied with RF sources. This research works are limited to the investigations of basic plasma antenna characteristics in a single antenna setup. Further investigations such as actual implementation of plasma antenna in wireless transmission are also described...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{problem in}} the turbine {{industry}} {{is associated with the}} mitigation of bending vibration modes of high-speed rotating shafts. This is especially pertinent at speeds approaching the critical frequencies. Here, a shaft, complete with eccentric sleeves at the free ends, is designed and developed, with a view to passively control critical speeds and vibration induced bending. In this article, using the Extended Hamiltonâ��s principle, the equations of motion (axial, torsional, inplane and out-of-plane bending) for a rotating flexible shaft are derived; considering non-constant rotating speed, Coriolis and centrifugal forces, with the associated boundary conditions due to the eccentric sleeves and torsional springs in angular deformations of lateral vibrations in bending. The numerical dynamic analysis showed that considering the sleeves as flexible only had a small effect upon the first critical speed of the shaft. Therefore, rigid body modelling of the sleeves is sufficient to capture the essential dynamics of the system. The derived equations of motion with the associated boundary conditions show {{that in the case of}} constant rotating speed, the eccentric <b>sleeves</b> are <b>coupling</b> xy-bending with xz-bending and also torsion. Also the derived equations of motion and the associated boundary conditions in the case of non-constant rotating speed are essentially nonlinear due to inertia terms. This work is essential to the advance of linear and nonlinear dynamic analysis of the system by means of determination of normal modes and critical speeds of the shaft.
