40|$|Pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} and {{polymerase chain reaction}} genome fingerprinting based on repetitive chromosomal sequences (rep-PCR) were used for typing 14 strains of Ochrobactrum anthropi. Six strains isolated during an outbreak of bacteraemia in patients who had received a contaminated rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin gave identical patterns by both techniques. Different patterns were found in <b>sporadic</b> and <b>reference</b> strains, except for one clinical isolate received from another hospital that showed the same pattern as the epidemic clone. This patient had also received rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin from the same source {{at the time of}} the outbreak. This study illustrates the advantages of genetic typing methods in terms of high typeability and discriminating power, even for rare pathogens. Furthermore, it highlights the need for interhospital communication for effective identification of common sources of outbreaks related to intrinsic drug contamination. © 1995 MMV Medizin Verlag.

40|$|The SMM {{attitude}} {{ground support}} system (AGSS) supports {{the acquisition of}} spacecraft roll attitude reference, performs the in-flight calibration of the attitude sensor complement, supports onboard control autonomy via onboard computer data base updates, and monitors onboard computer (OBC) performance. Initial roll attitude acquisition is accomplished by obtaining a coarse 3 axis attitude estimate from magnetometer and Sun sensor data and subsequently refining it by processing data from the fixed head star trackers. In-flight calibration of the attitude sensor complement is achieved by processing data {{from a series of}} slew maneuvers designed to maximize the observability and accuracy of the appropriate alignments and biases. To ensure autonomy of spacecraft operation, the AGSS selects guide stars and computes sensor occultation information for uplink to the OBC. The onboard attitude control performance is monitored on the ground through periodic attitude determination and processing of OBC data in downlink telemetry. In general, the control performance has met mission requirements. However, software and hardware problems have resulted in <b>sporadic</b> attitude <b>reference</b> losses...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{survival}} between familial and sporadic cancers {{have been}} inconclusive and only recent {{data on a}} limited number of cancers are available on the concordance of survival between family members. In this review, we address these questions by evaluating the published and unpublished data from the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database and a total of 13 cancer sites were assessed. Using <b>sporadic</b> cancer as <b>reference,</b> HRs were close to 1. 0 for most of the familial cancers in both the offspring and parental generations, which suggested that survival in patients with familial and sporadic cancers was equal, with an exception for ovarian cancer with a worse prognosis. Compared to offspring whose parents had a poor survival, those with a good parental survival had a decreased risk of death for most cancers and HR was significantly decreased for cancers in the breast, prostate, bladder, and kidney. For colorectal and nervous system cancers, favorable survival between the generations showed a borderline significance. These data are consistent in showing that both good and poor survival in certain cancers aggregate in families. Genetic factors are likely to contribute to the results. These observations call for intensified efforts to consider heritability in survival as one mechanism regulating prognosis in cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Listeriosis is {{a severe}} {{infection}} which mainly affects pregnant women, neonates and immuno-compromised adults. ANSES’s Laboratory for Food safety {{has been the}} European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for L. monocytogenes in the food chain since 2006. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) is routinely used in the EURL for the surveillance of L. monocytogenes isolated from foods, animals and the environment. One of the main EURL activities is to evaluate alternative molecular subtyping methods to PFGE, and integrate their use within the National Reference Laboratories (NRL) network. Since 2008, the United Kingdom (UK) -NRL for L. monocytogenes at the Health Protection Agency (HPA), London, has used fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (fAFLP) for the routine surveillance of L. monocytogenes isolated from human clinical cases, food and food processing environments in the UK. This study compares fAFLP with PFGE for subtyping L. monocytogenes. Results A panel of 109 L. monocytogenes isolates from either human cases of listeriosis, foods, food processing environments and animals {{were used for the}} comparative evaluation. Among these, 2 strains were tested from duplicate culture by both methods. The panel also included field isolates, isolates associated with outbreaks or <b>sporadic</b> cases and <b>reference</b> strains. The two strains tested in duplicate displayed the same fAFLP and PFGE types. Strains known to be epidemiologically associated with one another were found to have unique PFGE and fAFLP types. FAFLP and PFGE divided the strains into 76 and 82 distinct profiles, or types, respectively. The discriminatory index calculated was 0. 993 and 0. 996 for fAFLP and PFGE, respectively. Conclusions The discriminatory ability of fAFLP was similar to that of PFGE for the subtyping of L. monocytogenes isolates. As a less labour intensive technique fAFLP may be a better method to use than PFGE in investigating outbreaks of human listeriosis and tracking the source of contamination in food processing facilities in real time. </p...|$|R

50|$|The short pass was the favoured {{style of}} Queens Park FC during the 1870s, {{although}} the club's original offside rule (August 1867) suggests that forward passing {{was part of}} their game at this early stage.

40|$|Intercultural {{traffic and}} {{mingling}} have been vital to economic innovation, past and present, witness {{the role of}} travellers, migrants and diasporas as cultural brokers. While intercultural exchange is a prominent theme in cultural studies, studies of ethnicity have often been more occupied by group boundaries and antagonisms than cross-group relations. In relation to social capital a central notion has been the ethnic economy. Here this notion is rejected because in effect it refers to national origin rather than ethnicity and diverts attention from social and economic relations across cultural differences and boundaries. While immigrant groups may play a large part in national and transnational enterprise, formal and informal, this is not conceivable without considerable and extensive crosscultural relations. In the interstices of studies of migration and ethnic economies there are <b>sporadic</b> <b>references</b> to interethnic economies. The shift of emphasis to crosscultural enterprise means taking into account bonding, bridging and linking social capital within and across cultural boundaries. Much literature and reporting on ethnicity is fraught with friction, tension, antagonism. Virtually per definition we only hear of ethnicity when it generates problems, oppression, conflict, {{in line with the}} media principle "When it bleeds it leads". But what of the situations when ethnicity does not entail conflict or when conflict is only minor? Here the distinction between bonding social capital (strong ties among close relations), bridging social capital (weak ties among people from different backgrounds but similar socioeconomic status) and linking social capital ("friends in high placesâ€™") takes on cultural dimensions: each apply within and across cultural settings. The question of cultural difference and social capital arises in three different contexts: immigration and migration, transnational enterprise, and ethnically diverse societies. social capital;migration;ethnic economies;cultural difference...|$|E
40|$|Chronology of {{historical}} events of India has been poorly documented. Most dates of significant events {{are based on}} interpretations of contents in Sanskrit Samhitas and Puranas, archaeological evidences, and accounts written by foreigners. Chronology of Indian History was first written by European scholars, whose objectivity was always doubtful. Because India was a British colony for about 250 years and was instrumental in introducing the European system of education, no Indian could seriously question the anomalies that existed in those chronologies. Therefore generations of Indians were taught a subjective chronology. Only after India became independent in 1947, scholars of India began reinvestigation of the existing chronology and suggested changes in dates of many events. For example, the date of Rigveda was fixed by Max Müller as 1500 BC. However, scholars such as Kalyanaraman, BB Lal, David Frawley, Subhash Kak, Georg Feuerstein, and others have indicated the date of Rigveda compilation as> 6000 BC. Based on an in-depth study of Vedic literature, the Asian Agri-History Foundation (AAHF) conjectured the date of Rigveda as c. 8000 BC. As far as the chronology of events of Indian agriculture, there were only <b>sporadic</b> <b>references.</b> However, Western scholars had unearthed {{a lot of information}} on the agricultural history of West Asia, China, etc. The work carried out by AAHF has given substantial additional information on the history of Indian agriculture.

The author had made his first effort to prepare a chronology of agriculture, especially of India in 2000 AD (Choudhary et al., 2000). In subsequent years, the author noted many errors in dating events of India made by historians from the West, starting with the fictitious “invention ” of Aryan invasion of India, and wrong dating of the Vedas. It therefore became necessary to rewrite agricultural chronology and the author, {{under the auspices of the}} Asian Agri-History Foundation (AAHF), published it as an appendix in the book on agricultura...|$|E
