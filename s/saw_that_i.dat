500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{featured}} {{the first meeting}} of Daenerys Targaryen and Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and Yara's first meeting with Tyrion Lannister. Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R. Rahman {{received}} an email from Danny Boyle, {{the director of the}} film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: [...] "Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and it would be great for us to have you on our film". Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

I didn't go. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> dump. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> thing when <b>I</b> was coming in on the steamer, and I didn't go because I was diffident, sentimentally diffident, about going and looking at that thing again--that great, long, bony thing; it looked just like Mr. Rogers's foot.|$|R

2500|$|Driven by an unswerving {{belief in}} his abilities, Romário's laid back manner and {{overwhelming}} self-confidence would be displayed throughout his career, with Guus Hiddink, his coach at PSV, stating, “If he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was a bit}} more nervous than usual ahead of a big game, he’d {{come to me and}} say: ‘Take it easy, coach, I’m going to score and we’re going to win'. What’s incredible is that eight out of the ten times he told me that, he really did score and we really did win.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My father... {{took us to}} see one of {{the first}} talking pictures, The Singing Fool, in which Al Jolson sang [...] "Sonny Boy". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{incident}} Duchamp later recalled, [...] "I {{said nothing to}} my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would not be very much interested in groups after that." [...] Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to Du [...] "Cubisme", he participated in the La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), organized by the designer André Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the Section d'Or invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, [...] "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".|$|E

2500|$|Charles [...] "Wag" [...] Bennett, one of {{the judges}} at the 1966 competition, was {{impressed}} with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed that care and attention and love.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, aged 12, he {{enrolled}} in a minor seminary in Traunstein. This period lasted until the seminary was closed for military use in 1942, and the students were all sent home. Ratzinger returned to the Gymnasium in Traunstein. During this period in the seminary, following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was legally required in effect beginning 25 March 1939. Following the seminary closure he continued required attendance with the Hitler Youth to avoid financial penalties in the Gymnasium tuition fees. The financial penalty (which theoretically required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities) was overlooked when a sympathetic mathematics professor allowed him not to attend any meetings. In Ratzinger's book Salt of the Earth, Ratzinger says the following [...] "... Thank goodness, {{there was a very}} understanding mathematics teacher. He himself was a Nazi but an honest man, who said to me, 'Just go once and get the document so [...] that we have it' ... When he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> simply didn't want to, he said, 'I understand, I'll take care of it', and so I was able to stay free of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look {{at myself in the mirror}} the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I <b>saw,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just as well! You simply tell Jane you <b>SAW</b> me; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was greatly}} shocked {{at what she}} said, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> forgive her. I don't think she'll say any more." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{was placed}} in solitary {{confinement}} with clothing, a pallet bed, table and armchair in [...] "the worst of all the cells", where he suffered greatly from the darkness, summer heat and [...] "millions of fleas". He was soon housed {{with a series of}} cell mates, and after five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was. In his new cell, [...] "I sat in my armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them. I felt that I had nothing to hope for, and the only relief left to me was not to think of the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith's {{meeting with}} Chamberlain, Curzon and Cecil at 3.00 p.m. only {{highlighted}} {{the weakness of}} his position. They unanimously declined to serve in a Government that did not include Bonar Law and Lloyd George, as a Government so constituted offered no [...] "prospect of stability." [...] Their reply to Asquith's follow-up {{question as to whether}} they were serve under Lloyd George caused him even more concern. The [...] "Three Cs" [...] stated they would serve under Lloyd George if he could create the stable Government they considered essential for the effective prosecution of the War. The end was near and a further letter from Balfour declining to reconsider his earlier decision brought it about. The Home Secretary, Herbert Samuel, recorded in a contemporaneous note; [...] "We were all strongly of opinion, from which [...] did not dissent, that there was no alternative [...] We could not carry on without LlG and the Unionists and ought not to give the appearance of wishing to do so." [...] At 7.00pm, having been Prime Minister for eight years and 241 days, Asquith went to Buckingham Palace and tendered his resignation. Describing the event to a friend sometime later, Asquith wrote; [...] "When I fully realised what a position had been created, I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not go on without dishonour or impotence, or both." [...] That evening, he dined at Downing Street with family and friends, his daughter-in-law Cynthia describing the scene; [...] "I sat next to the P.M.—he was too darling—rubicund, serene, puffing a guinea cigar and talking of going to Honolulu." [...] Cynthia believed that he would be back [...] "in the saddle" [...] within a fortnight with his position strengthened.|$|E

6000|$|The mild {{face of the}} {{sufferer}} was overcast. [...] "I wish he <b>saw</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do," [...] said he, in a low voice. Then looking {{towards the}} minister, he articulated, [...] "Pray for us." ...|$|R

2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
