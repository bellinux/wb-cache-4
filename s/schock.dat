5|$|All {{the members}} of the cast for the {{production}} were from Britain or the Commonwealth. Later in the season, one of England's few pre-war international opera stars, Eva Turner, appeared as Turandot. For the company's second season, eminent singers from continental Europe were recruited, including Ljuba Welitsch, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Paolo Silveri, Rudolf <b>Schock</b> and Set Svanholm. Other international stars who were willing to re-learn their roles in English for the company in its early years included Kirsten Flagstad and Hans Hotter for The Valkyrie. Nevertheless, even as early as 1948, the opera in English policy was weakening; the company was obliged to present some Wagner performances in German to recruit leading exponents of the main roles. At first Rankl conducted all the productions; he was dismayed when eminent guest conductors including Beecham, Clemens Krauss and Erich Kleiber were later invited for prestige productions. By 1951 Rankl felt that he was no longer valued, and announced his resignation. In Haltrecht's view, the company that Rankl built up from nothing had outgrown him.|$|E

He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine <b>Schock</b> confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E

40|$|Eine Betablockertherapie ist bei den meisten Patienten mit ICD aufgrund der Grunderkrankung (Herzinsuffizienz, KHK) indiziert. Unklar ist weiterhin, ob der Klasse III antiarrhythmische Effekt von Sotalol einen zusätzlichen Benefit zur Verhinderung von ventrikulären Rhythmusstörungen und ICD-Schocks erzielen kann. Methode: Es handelt sich um eine prospektive, randomisierte Cross-over Studie. Es wurden 67 Patienten mit ICD eingeschlossen, die sich zum Follow-up in der ICD-Ambulanz der Universität Tübingen vorstellten. Von jedem Patienten wurden sequentiell 3 Phasen von je 120 Tagen Dauer in randomisierter Reihenfolge durchlaufen: Metoprolol 2 x 95 mg, Sotalol 2 x 160 mg oder keine Medikation. Bei gehäuften <b>Schocks</b> oder Tachykardien konnte die Leerphase frühzeitig beendet werden. Die primären Endpunkte der Studie waren: Anzahl der VF- oder VT-Episoden, Anzahl gerechtfertigter und ungerechtfertigter <b>Schocks.</b> Ergebnisse: Bei 9 Patienten (13 %) wurde das Absetzen des Betablockers aufgrund von Tachykardien in der Auswaschphase nicht toleriert. Somit kamen 58 Patienten zur Auswertung: Anzahl der Patienten mit {{mindestens}} einem der folgenden Ereignisse: Ereignis/	VF/	VT/	Adäquate Schocks/	Alle <b>Schocks</b> Metoprolol	 2 	 2 *	 2 *	 2 * Sotalol	 3 	 3 	 2 	 2 * Leerphase	 6 	 8 	 8 	 12 * p< 0, 05 gegenüber der Leerphase (McNemar Test) Die Verträglichkeit von Metoprolol und Sotalol war in unserem Kollektiv vergleichbar, bei einem Patienten kam es zu einer anhaltenden Torsades des pointes-Tachykardie unter Sotalol. Schlussfolgerung: Die Wirkung des reinen Betablockers Metoprolol und dem Klasse III Antiarrhythmikum Sotalol auf die Suppression von Tachykardien bei ICD-Patienten ist nicht signifikant unterschiedlich. Ohne Betablockade treten gehäuft <b>Schocks</b> auf, ungerechtfertigte <b>Schocks</b> traten in unserer Untersuchung ausschließlich in der Leerphase auf. Most {{patients with}} an ICD show an indication to a therapy with beta blockers {{because of their}} underlying disease (cardiac insufficiency, coronary heart disease). It is unclear if class 3 antiarrhythmic effect implicates an additional benefit {{for the prevention of}} ventricular dysrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia VT, ventricular fibrillation VF) and ICD-shocks. Method: This is a prospective, randomized cross-over study. 67 patients with an ICD coming for follow-up to the ICD-outpatient clinic of the University of Tübingen have been included. Every patient sequentially passed three periods of 120 day duration each in randomized order: metoprolol 2 x 95 mg/d, sotalol 2 x 160 mg/d, drugless period (no beta blockers). In case of cummulative shocks or ventricular tachycardia, the drugless period could be finished precociously. Primary endpoints of the study have been: number of VF- or VT-episodes and number of justified or unjustified shocks. Results: 9 patients (13 %) did not tolerate discontinuation of beta blockers because of tachycardia in wash-out period. Hence 58 patients have been evaluated. Number of patients showing {{at least one of the}} following events: Event/ 	VF/	VT/	justified shocks/	all shocks Metoprolol	 2 	 2 *	 2 *	 2 * Sotalol	 3 	 3 	 2 	 2 * drugless period	 6 	 8 	 8 	 12 * p< 0, 05 compared to drugless period (McNemar test) Compatibility of metoprolol and sotalol showed no difference. One patient suffered from a sustained torsades des pointes tachycardia during sotalol therapy. Conclusion: The effect of mere beta blocker metoprolol and sotalol on suppression of tachycardias of ICD-patients is not significantly different. Without beta blocker medication shocks accumulate, unjustified shocks only appeared during drugless period in this study...|$|R
40|$|We {{discover}} and study a new quartzofeldspathic fulgurite, sized 12 cm in diameter {{in the main}} branch, of Bustarviejo (Madrid, Spain). Here we characterize fulgurite aliquots by Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with a X¿ray Dispersive Spectrometry and cathodoluminescence probes (ESEM¿EDS¿CL), in situ high¿temperature X¿ray diffraction (HTXRD), Hyperspectral Raman Microscopy (Raman) and Thermoluminescence (TL). The fulgurite body was formed by lightning strike fusion on arkose sand during a fast process of volatilization and extreme reducing conditions at temperatures in excess of 2000 K. The fulgurite is composed of <b>schocked</b> quartz, neo¿formed cristobalite, native Si¿Fe¿Al alloys and aluminum¿silicate glass with spherical cavities. Both, the hyperspectral CL and Raman mappings highlight the cristobalite rim of the <b>schocked</b> quartz grains.
