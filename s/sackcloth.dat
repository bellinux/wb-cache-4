25|$|The {{body was}} found while {{gathering}} peat on 22June 1936 by Johansson. His harrow apparently caught on <b>sackcloth.</b> On examination Johansson saw parts of a skeleton. The next day, Johansson and his father contacted the local police and a doctor. On investigation, they realized it {{was too old to}} be of criminal interest.|$|E
25|$|Christians {{continued}} {{the practice of}} using ashes as an external sign of repentance. Tertullian (c. 225) said that confession of sin should be accompanied by lying in <b>sackcloth</b> and ashes. The historian Eusebius (c. 260/265339/340) recounts how a repentant apostate covered himself with ashes when begging Pope Zephyrinus to readmit him to communion.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, penance {{had been}} a public ritual. Penitents were divided into a {{separate}} part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to mass wearing <b>sackcloth</b> and ashes in {{a process known as}} exomologesis that often involved some form of general confession. There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (sacerdos), and it seems that, for some sins, private penance was allowed instead. Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included absolution at its conclusion.|$|E
25|$|The most {{similar story}} {{is that of the}} two cannibal mothers in 2 Kings 6:24–33, which forms part of the Elisha cycle. The {{background}} is a famine in Samaria, caused by a siege on the city. As the king passes through the city, a woman calls him and asks him to decide in a quarrel between her and another woman: The two women had agreed to cook and eat the son of one woman, and on the other day to do the same with the son of the other woman; but after they ate the first woman's son, the other woman hid her own son. The king, shocked from the description of the case, tore up his royal cloth and revealed that he was wearing <b>sackcloth</b> beneath it. He blamed Elisha for the circumstances and went on to chase him.|$|E
500|$|The Mari Lwyd (...) is a wassailing folk custom {{found in}} South Wales. The {{tradition}} entails {{the use of}} an eponymous hobby horse which is made from a horse's skull mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a <b>sackcloth.</b> It represents a regional variation of a [...] "hooded animal" [...] tradition that appears in various forms throughout Britain.|$|E
500|$|Hoodening (...) , also spelled Hodening and Oodening, is a folk custom {{found in}} Kent, a county in {{south-eastern}} England. The tradition entails {{the use of}} a wooden hobby horse known as a hooden horse [...] which is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a <b>sackcloth.</b> Originally, the tradition was restricted to the area of East Kent, although in the twentieth century it spread into neighbouring West Kent. It represents a regional variation of a [...] "hooded animal" [...] tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the hoodening tradition, and the {{original}} derivation of the term [...] "hooden", remain subject to academic debate. An early suggestion was that the term [...] "hooden" [...] {{was related to the}} pre-Christian god Woden, and that the tradition therefore originated with pre-Christian religious practices in the Early Medieval Kingdom of Kent, however this approach has not found support from historians or folklorists studying the tradition. A more widely accepted definition among scholars is that the term [...] "hooden" [...] relates to [...] "hooded", a reference to the <b>sackcloth</b> worn by the individual carrying the horse.|$|E
500|$|What is {{the matter}} with you that, that even after the unending admissions of guilt in [...] you cannot stop {{representing}} yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was [...] "too little"?... {{there appears to be a}} vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life. [...] For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in <b>sackcloth</b> and ashes; I, however, know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes... our accusations against your former colleagues (Göring, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) who, being dead, cannot defend themselves are agony to me... I hope and think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, the kirk had considerable control over the lives of the people. It had {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools, which were administered through the parishes, and over the morals of the population, particularly over sexual offences such as adultery and fornication. A rebuke was necessary for moral offenders to [...] "purge their scandal". This involved standing or sitting before the congregation for up to three Sundays and enduring a rant by the minister. There was sometimes a special repentance stool near the pulpit for this purpose.

The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725.|$|E

2500|$|Ashes {{were used}} in ancient times to express grief. When Tamar was raped by her half-brother, [...] "she {{sprinkled}} ashes on her head, tore her robe, and with her face buried in her hands went away crying" [...] (...) [...] The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults. In Job , Job says to God: [...] "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." [...] The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying: [...] "O daughter of my people, gird on <b>sackcloth,</b> roll in the ashes" [...] (...) [...] The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God: [...] "I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, <b>sackcloth</b> and ashes" [...] (...) [...] Just prior to the New Testament period, the rebels fighting for Jewish independence, the Maccabees, prepared for battle using ashes: [...] "That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes" [...] ( [...] ; see also [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The public penance that grave sinners {{underwent}} {{before being}} admitted to Holy Communion just before Easter lasted throughout Lent, {{on the first}} day of which they were sprinkled with ashes and dressed in <b>sackcloth.</b> When, towards the end of the first millennium, the discipline of public penance was dropped, the beginning of Lent, seen as a general penitential season, was marked by sprinkling ashes on the heads of all. [...] This practice is found in the Gregorian Sacramentary of the late 8th century. About two centuries later, Ælfric of Eynsham, an Anglo-Saxon abbot, wrote of the rite of strewing ashes on heads at the start of Lent.|$|E
2500|$|The Eastern Orthodox churches {{generally}} do not observe Ash Wednesday, although in recent times, {{the creation of the}} Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate has led to the observance of Ash Wednesday among Western Orthodox parishes. In this tradition, ashes [...] "may be distributed outside of the mass or any liturgical service" [...] although [...] "commonly the faithful receive their ashes immediately before the Ash Wednesday mass". In Orthodoxy, historically, [...] "serious public sinners in the East also donned <b>sackcloth,</b> including those who made the Great Fast a major theme of their entire lives such as hermits and desert-dwellers." [...] Byzantine Catholics, although in the United States they use [...] "the same Gregorian calendar as the Roman Catholic rite", do not practice the distribution of ashes as it is [...] "not part of their ancient tradition".|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, {{the sons}} of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob {{wanted to know how}} things were doing, so he asked Joseph to go down there and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up {{receiving}} came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put <b>sackcloth</b> around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (...) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph's {{brothers}} stripped {{him of his}} coat of many colors and cast him into an empty pit. They sat down to eat, and when they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites from Gilead bringing spices and balm to Egypt, Judah persuaded the brothers to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites. Passing Midianite merchants drew Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 shekels of silver, and they brought him to Egypt. When Reuben returned to the pit and Joseph was gone, he rent his clothes and asked his brothers where he could go now. They took Joseph's coat of many colors, dipped it in goat's blood, {{and sent it to}} Jacob to identify. Jacob concluded that a beast had devoured Joseph, and rent his garments, put on <b>sackcloth,</b> and mourned for his son. All his sons and daughters tried in vain to comfort him. And the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's captain of the guard.

2500|$|Robert of Anjou was {{the third}} son of King Charles II and Mary of Hungary. Charles II’s first son Charles Martel of Anjou had died by 1295, putting his second son Louis next {{in line for the}} throne. [...] Louis, however, did not desire the crown of Naples, and would instead become bishop of the diocese of Toulouse in 1296. Louis and Charles II died in 1297 and in 1308 respectively, leading to Robert’s {{coronation}} in 1309. By 1317, Louis, with the help of Robert’s royal influence, was canonized as Saint Louis of Toulouse. [...] The Neapolitan House of Anjou now possessed its own saint, which Robert of Anjou would use to his political advantage. It was around this year that the Sienese painter Simone Martini was commissioned, most likely by Robert of Anjou, to paint the Altarpiece of St Louis of Toulouse, now in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte. In this altarpiece, Saint Louis of Toulouse sits enthroned in his brown <b>sackcloth</b> and crimson jeweled cope, holding his crozier with his right hand and donning his bishop’s mitre on his haloed head. Two angels hover over him, sustaining the crown of sainthood above his mitre. As he receives the celestial crown, the Saint, with his left hand, offers the Neapolitan crown to his brother Robert of Anjou, shown in profile, who kneels before him.|$|E
2500|$|Ahasuerus {{appoints}} Haman as his viceroy. Mordecai, {{who sits}} at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavor as he refuses to bow down to him. Having found out that Mordecai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordecai but the entire Jewish minority in the empire. Obtaining Ahasuerus' permission and funds to execute this plan, he casts lots ("purim") to choose the date on which to do this – the thirteenth of the month of Adar. When Mordecai finds out about the plans, he puts on <b>sackcloth</b> and ashes, a sign of mourning, publicly weeping and lamenting, and many other Jews in Shushan {{and other parts of}} Ahasuerus' empire do likewise, with widespread penitence and fasting. [...] Esther discovers what has transpired; there follows an exchange of messages between her and Mordecai, with Hatach, one of the palace servants, as the intermediary. Mordecai requests that she intercede with the king on behalf of the embattled Jews; she replies that nobody is allowed to approach the king, under penalty of death. Mordecai warns her that she will not be any safer in the palace than any other Jew, says that if she keeps silent, salvation for the Jews will arrive from some other quarter but [...] "you and your father's house will perish," [...] and suggests that she was elevated to the position of queen to be of help in just such an emergency. Esther has a change of heart, says she will fast and pray for three days and will then approach the king to seek his help, despite the law against doing so, and [...] "if I perish, I perish." [...] She also requests that Mordecai tell all Jews of Shushan to fast and pray for three days together with her. On the third day, she seeks an audience with Ahasuerus, during which she invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai's refusal to bow to him; egged on by his wife Zeresh and unidentified friends, he builds a gallows for Mordecai, with the intention to hang him there the very next day.|$|E
