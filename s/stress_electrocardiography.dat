40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with known or suspected coronary artery disease, diagnosis and risk stratification can be aided by non-invasive tests for myocardial ischaemia. The main indications {{for the use}} of radionuclide perfusion imaging (sestamibi) rather than exercise electrocardiography include complete left bundle branch block, inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> and an inability to exercise. The published data on myocardial perfusion imaging is limited to eight studies of only 628 {{patients with}} widely varying ranges of sensitivities and specificities and the major problem being the bias created when patients with positive test results are referred far more frequently for coronary angiography than those with negative results. Furthermore, certain categories of patients are postulated to have a high number of false positives, especially obese patients and women, but this hypothesis has not been tested. METHODS & RESULTS: A retrospective descriptional study on patients with positive sestamibi scans, who had coronary angiography within six months of each other, was performed. The study population consisted of 132 patients, 53. 8 % of whom were male and 44. 7 % had a body mass index of less than 28. The overall positive predictive value of the sestamibi scan in predicting significant coronary angiographic stenosis was 63. 6 %. This value increased significantly to 80. 3 % in males (p 50. 000). The positive predictive value did not differ in the different age categories, nor did it change with the different indications for sestamibi scanning. CONCLUSIONS: The sestamibi scan remains a useful screening test for coronary artery disease in patients who are exercise intolerant or those with inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography.</b> The test is highly predictive in males rather than females...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{invention}} of robotic systems {{has begun a}} new era of endoscopic cardiac surgery. Reports on totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting are limited, however, and data regarding feasibility, safety, and efficacy are needed to determine this technique's position in the therapeutic armamentarium. This study describes the largest multicenter experience in the literature with robotic totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting specifically addressing procedural feasibility, safety, and efficacy. Methods: Between September 1998 and November 2002, a total of 228 patients with coronary artery disease were scheduled for totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif.) at five European institutions. Patients underwent totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting with either an on-pump (group A, n = 117) or an off-pump approach (group B, n = 111). Patients underwent postoperative angiography or <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> and were followed up for 6 months. Results: Procedural feasibility was demonstrated through the completion of 164 successful totally endoscopic cases. Sixty-four patients (group C, 28 %) had conversion to nonrobotic procedures. Conversion rates decreased with time. The overall procedural efficacy, as defined by angiographic patency or lack of ischemic signs on <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography,</b> was 97 %. The incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 6 months was 5 %. Conclusion: Both on- and off-pump totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting are feasible, with a conversion rate that diminishes with increasing experience. Conversion does not adversely affect outcome and thus constitutes a safe alternative. Although target vessel reintervention may be slightly higher than that reported for open coronary artery bypass grafting, graft patency and major adverse cardiac events for both approaches are comparable to those reported in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting procedure. © 2007 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Long-term observations may allow improved estimation of prognosis in cases of sublethal intoxication. Objectives: To assess horses and ponies exposed to sublethal amounts of monensin for evidence of chronic sequelae and ability to return to prior/intended use. Methods: Twenty-nine horses and 8 ponies were assessed utilising serum biochemistry, treadmill exercise <b>stress</b> testing. <b>electrocardiography,</b> and pre- and post exercise echocardiography >= 6 weeks after ingestion of monensin-contaminated feed. Animals with evidence of monensin-induced cardiomyopathy were re-examined after a period of rest of >= 11 months.

Results: During resting echocardiography, It animals had reduced/low-normal left ventricullar fractional shortening (FS), an increase in FS in 8 of these animals was measured >= 11 months la(er. Six animals had reduced or low-normal FS during post exercise echocardiography. Two horses had ventricular premature depolarisations during exercise.

40|$|Background: Meditation is a {{mind and}} body {{practice}} for increasing calmness and physical relaxation, improving psychological balance, coping with illness, and enhancing overall health and well-being. Many studies have already been carried out to see the effect of Yoga, Pranayam, meditation, Sudarhan Kriya on physiological parameters, but till date, {{there is not a}} single study which shows the cumulative effect of yoga, pranayam, meditation along with sudarshankriya on physiological parameters. Methods: This observational study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur and in association with Art of living organization. The study participants were enrolled into three groups. In the first group, 10 participants of Advance Meditation Program (AMP), who were doing this program for the first time, in second group, 10 participants who were doing AMP along with regularly practicing Padam Sadhna for at least 2 years and finally, in the third group, 10 participants who were not practicing any kind of meditation or yoga. After consent, subjects filled the Cohen's <b>stress</b> questionnaire. <b>Electrocardiography</b> (ECG) was recorded before AMP and after AMP. Results: There was significant difference in heart rate (P = 0. 002), systolic blood pressure (P = 0. 028), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0. 005), RR interval (P = 0. 020), PR interval (P = 0. 040), and stress score (P = 0. 027) in first time participants. Similarly, in the second group (repeaters) also significant difference was noticed. Conclusion: AMP has its positive effects on ECG, blood pressure, and stress level.

Eleven patients had single vessel dis-ease; the right coronary was involved in seven of these patients. Thirteen patients had single vessel implants. employing the left internal mammary artery in 11 patients and a saphenous vein graft from the aorta in two. Thirty-one patients had double internal mam-mary artery implantation accompanied by gastroepiploic arterial implantation in four. Fifty per cent of the patients were symptomatically improved after surgery, the best results occurring in two patients with isolated anterior descending coronary disease. Of the 34 patients having postoperative coronary and mammary arteriography, 15 % showed improvement which could be ascribed to mammary revascularization; 24 % had limited myocardial revascularization and no symptomatic improvement; 29 % had patent implants without development of collateral vessels, and the implanted vessels were occluded in 32 %. Eleven of the 34 (32 %) had fair or good symptomatic improve-ment {{in the absence of}} revascularization.

In 1935, Tenant and Wiggers described the sequelae of coronary occlusion [2]. From their description the ischaemic cascade has been derived. In this cascade, symptoms are a relatively late phenomenon and are preceded by electrocardiographic changes. This has led to the routine application of stress electrocardiog-raphy in the evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

The primary objective was to generate evidence to inform practical and effective interventions to reduce the sleepiness-related road crash risk of young adults. The study sample comprised 83 young adult drivers aged between 18 and 25 years old, sampled from two metropolitan centres in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Queensland (QLD) in Australia. Data were collected prospectively across a 7 -day period {{using a combination of}} questionnaires, daily sleep diary, stress and driving related diaries, 24 -hour ambulatory assessment of both sleep-wake activity (using actigraphy) and <b>stress</b> (using <b>electrocardiography),</b> and in-vehicle monitoring technologies. The project sought to address the following research questions; (1) to determine the impact of sleepiness on on-road driving performance in young adults; (2) to contribute to evidence on young adults’ exposure to driving while sleepy, and (3) to determine interactions between sleepiness and stress related driving risk factors in young adults. Results indicated that participants were generally meeting current recommendations for sleep duration (between 7 - 9 hours each night), believed that their sleep quality was ‘fair’, and did not experience significant subjective sleepiness, nor stress, while driving at times of the day associated with greater crash risk. However, objective risky driving performance was negatively associated with habitual objective sleep duration, suggesting that individuals with shorter sleep were more prone to drive in a risky manner. In contrast, higher subjective sleepiness was associated with less risky driving, suggesting that young drivers may adopt self-regulatory strategies in certain situations. This finding was mirrored in questionnaire data, where participants reported differences in their driving behaviour while sleepy (e. g. by avoiding other ‘unsafe’ behaviours such as speeding or distractions), compared to driving when not sleepy. Road crashes remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity for young adults, and sleepiness is a major contributor to those crashes. These new findings provide robust knowledge to inform potential new interventions to reduce sleep-related road crashes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Early {{diagnosis}} of {{coronary artery disease}} represents a significant challenge for modern medicine. Detection and assessment of atherosclerotic lesions in the peripheral blood vessels and detection of endothelial dysfunction may be a useful marker of arterial disease severity, including CAD. Among the currently used diagnostic methods, the assessment of peripheral arteries intima-media thickness (IMT) is recognized as an early marker of atherosclerosis. Aim of the study: The aim {{of the study was}} evaluation of ultrasound measurements of intima-media thickness of carotid artery (CIMT) and plaque detection as markers indicating on the presence of coronary artery disease, defined as ? 50 % reduction in diameter of at least one large coronary artery segment. Materials and methods: The study included 71 subjects - 54 (76. 1 %) men and 17 (23. 9 %) women - mean age of 61. 5 ? 7. 5 years. The protocol included medical examination, assessment of biochemical parameters, resting ECG, <b>stress</b> test <b>electrocardiography,</b> transthoracic echocardiography and carotid ultrasound examination with evaluation of CIMT and evaluation of the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. Coronary angiography was performed in all the patients with the semiquantitative analysis of the severity of atherosclerotic lesions, and calculation of the Gensini Score (GS). Results: Coronary artery disease was present in 43 (60. 5 %) patients. The average CIMT in the patients with coronary artery disease was higher than among the patients without coronary stenoses, respectively 1. 01 ? 0. 11 mm and 0. 88 ? 0. 14 mm (p= 0. 0001), as well as the percentage of the number of plaques present within the examined carotid vascular segments - respectively 76. 7 vs 42. 9 %, p= 0. 008. The correlation analysis revealed the presence of a positive relationship between the average value of CIMT and Gensini Score values including total (?= 0. 36, p = 0. 0017), proximal (?= 0. 32, p= 0. 0056) and distal (?= 0. 33, p= 0. 0052) score of the examined coronary segments. The values of the Gensini Score, both total and distal, were significantly higher among the patients with the presence of atherosclerotic plaques located in the carotid arteries (p= 0. 0035, p= 0. 0011). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the increased thickness of the intima-media, male sex and ST segment depression during the exercise test are independent risk factors for the presence of coronary artery disease. Incorporating IMT values in the algorithm of the noninvasive {{diagnosis of}} coronary disease resulted in improved sensitivity and a negative prognostic value. Conclusions: The mean thickness of intima-media complex and the incidence of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries are greater in patients with coronary artery disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{usefulness}} of high dose dipyridamole stress echocardiography with dipyridamole <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> and exercise electrocardiography {{for the evaluation of}} coronary artery disease. DESIGN [...] Prospective investigation with coronary angiography as the criterion standard and blinded assessment of study data. SETTING [...] Cardiology unit of a tertiary referral centre. SUBJECTS [...] Fifty eight patients with suspected coronary disease; three of these were excluded because of poor echogenicity at baseline (test feasibility 95 %). Angiography showed normal coronary arteries in 15 and coronary disease (greater than or equal to 70 % diameter stenosis) in 40. INTERVENTIONS [...] Cross sectional echocardiography and 12 lead electrocardiography during dipyridamole stress (up to 1 mg/kg) and exercise electrocardiography on a separate occasion. Wall motion was analysed with an 11 -segment model developed at Hammersmith Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Test sensitivity, specificity, and side effect data. RESULTS [...] 16 of 40 patients with coronary artery disease had inducible asynergy; all had multivessel disease and a tight stenosis in the vessel that supplied the abnormal segment. Exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression were significantly shorter in patients with a positive echocardiogram than in those without (both p less than 0. 01). The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole stress echocardiography were 40 % and 93 % respectively; sensitivity improved to 60 % when baseline (n = 18) or reversible asynergy defined an abnormal study (likelihood ratio = 9). Corresponding figures for <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> were 38 % and 80 % for dipyridamole and 80 % and 67 % for exercise. Adverse reactions were seen in 67 % of patients and included two instances of pronounced hypotension, one episode of prolonged myocardial ischaemia, and one cardiac arrest in a patient who was successfully resuscitated. CONCLUSION [...] A positive high dose dipyridamole echocardiogram predicts multivessel disease and impaired coronary reserve, but low overall sensitivity and occasionally troublesome side effects limit its clinical usefulness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExercise <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ExECG) is underutilized as {{the initial}} test {{modality}} {{in patients with}} interpretable electrocardiograms {{who are able to}} exercise. Although stress myocardial imaging techniques provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information, variables derived from ExECG can yield substantial data for risk stratification, either supplementary to imaging variables or without concurrent imaging. In addition to exercise-induced ischemic ST-segment depression, such markers as ST-segment elevation in lead aVR, abnormal heart rate recovery post-exercise, failure to achieve target heart rate, and poor exercise capacity improve risk stratification of ExECG. For example, patients achieving ≥ 10 metabolic equivalents on ExECG have a very low prevalence of inducible ischemia and an excellent prognosis. In contrast, cardiac imaging techniques add diagnostic and prognostic value in higher-risk populations (e. g., poor functional capacity, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease).

40|$|AbstractAims: to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) by means of modified <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> in patients presenting with intermittent claudication. Methods: three hundred consecutive patients (188 male) with intermittent claudication (post-exercise ankle brachial index < 0. 8), and 100 age and sex-matched controls, were assessed for CAD with resting and stress 12 -lead-precordial ECG. A history of angina and previous myocardial infarction (MI) was recorded. Exclusion criteria: recent (< 1 month) MI; unstable angina; prior coronary intervention; arrhythmias; conduction abnormalities; uncontrolled hypertension; heart failure, digoxin therapy, and inability to perform tests. Results: based on antecedent angina, MI and abnormal resting ECG, CAD prevalence was 47 % in claudicants and 6 % in controls; on 12 -lead-precordial ECG stress testing, CAD prevalence was 46 % (95 % CI: 40. 1 - 51. 7 %) in claudicants and 11 % (95 % CI: 4. 8 - 17. 2 %) in controls (both p < 0. 0001). Only 67 % of claudicants (n = 141) with antecedent angina, MI or an abnormal resting ECG, met the criteria of CAD on stress testing; also 28 % of claudicants without antecedent angina, MI and a normal resting ECG (n = 159) had evidence of CAD. The odds ratio for CAD in claudicants was 6. 9. Based on 12 -lead-precordial ECG stress testing we detected the presence of: one-, two- and three-vessel disease in 14. 7 % (95 % CI: 10. 6 - 18. 7 %), 19 % (95 % CI: 14. 5 - 23. 5 %) and in 12. 3 % (95 % CI: 8. 6 - 16 %) of claudicants; and in 8, 3 and 0 % of controls, respectively. Conclusions: forty six percent of patients with intermittent claudication had concomitant CAD, and 31 % two- or three- vessel disease.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to apply a {{decision}} analytic model for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) to define the optimal utilization of coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) and stress testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The model tested in this study assumes that CAD is evaluated with a stress test and/or cCTA and that a patient with positive evaluation results undergoes cardiac catheterization. On the basis of values of sensitivity, specificity, and radiation dose from the published literature and test costs from the Medicare fee schedule, a decision tree model was constructed as a function of disease prevalence. RESULTS: The false-negative rate is lowest when cCTA is used as an isolated test. The false-positive rate is minimized when cCTA is used in combination with stress echocardiography. Effective radiation is minimized by use of <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> or stress echocardiography alone or prior to cCTA. When the pretest probability of CAD is low, a strategy that uses stress echocardiography followed by cCTA minimizes the false-positive rate and effective radiation exposure, with relatively low imaging costs and with a false-negative rate only slightly higher than a strategy including stress myocardial scintigraphy.

METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of 280 revascularized patients undergoing myocardial scintigraphy under stress (exercise or pharmacological stress with dipyridamole) and at rest according to a 2 -day protocol. A set of clinical, stress electrocardiographic and scintigraphic variables was assessed. Cardiac events were classified as "major" (death, infarction, unstable angina) and "any" (major event or coronary angioplasty or new myocardial revascularization surgery). RESULTS: Thirty-six major events occurred as follows: 3 deaths, 11 infarctions, and 22 unstable anginas. In regard to any event, 22 angioplasties and 7 new surgeries occurred in addition to major events, resulting a total of 65 events. The sensitivity of scintigraphy in prognosticating a major event or any event was, respectively, 55 % and 58 %, showing a negative predictive value of 90 % and 83 %, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography,</b> and a scintigraphic visualization of left ventricular enlargement were significant variables for the occurrence of a major event. On multivariate analysis, abnormal myocardial scintigraphy was a predictor of any event.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the accuracy of}} computed tomography coronary angiography (CT-CA) for detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD; a parts per thousand yen 50 % lumen reduction) in intermediate/high-risk asymptomatic patients. A total of 183 consecutive asymptomatic individuals (92 men; mean age 54 +/- 11 years) {{with more than one}} major risk factor (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, family history, smoking) and an inconclusive or nonfeasible noninvasive stress test result (<b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography,</b> stress echocardiography, nuclear stress scintigraphy) underwent CT-CA in an outpatient setting. All patients underwent conventional coronary angiography (CAG) within 4 weeks. Data from CT-CA were compared with CAG regarding the presence of significant CAD (a parts per thousand yen 50 % lumen reduction). Mean calcium score was 177 +/- 432, mean heart rate during the CT-CA scan was 58 +/- 8 bpm and the prevalence (per-patient) of obstructive CAD was 19 %. CT-CA showed single-vessel CAD in 9 % of patients, two-vessel CAD in 9 % and three-vessel CAD in 0 %. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CT-CA were 100 % (90 - 100), 98 % (96 - 99), 97 % (85 - 99), 100 % (97 - 100), respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 151 and 0, respectively.

40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{significance of}} normal quantitative planar thallium- 201 stress scintigraphy was evaluated {{in patients with}} a chest pain syndrome. The prevalence of cardiac events during follow-up {{was related to the}} pretest (that is, before stress scintigraphy) likelihood of coronary artery disease determined on the basis of symptoms, age, sex and <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography.</b> In a consecutive series of 344 patients who had adequate thallium- 201 stress scintigrams, 95 had unequivocally normal studies by quantitative analysis. The pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease in the 95 patients had a bimodal distribution. During a mean follow-up period of 22 ± 3 months, no patient died. Three patients (3 %) had a cardiac event: two of these patients (pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease 54 and 94 %) had a nonfatal myocardial infarction 8 and 22 months, respectively, after stress scintigraphy, and one patient (pretest likelihood 98 %) underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 16 months after stress scintigraphy for persisting anginal complaints. Three patients were lost to follow-up; all three had a low pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease. It is concluded that patients with chest pain and normal findings on quantitative thallium- 201 scintigraphy have an excellent prognosis. Cardiac events are rare (infarction rate 1 % per year) and occur in patients with a moderate to high pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the added {{diagnostic}} value of peripheral artery tonometric (PAT) measurements, based on finger pulsatile arterial volume changes, to standard 12 -lead <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG), for detecting exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as the standard of comparison in a double-blinded, multicenter protocol. MethodsAn automated algorithm for identifying myocardial ischemia from PAT was derived from 345 training cases. The PAT outcome was combined with the ECG result (ischemic, nonischemic, or equivocal), giving a PAT-enhanced value. A threshold of normality was determined to optimize agreement with the SPECT results in the training sample. The PAT-enhanced analysis was then validated in 616 subjects, only two of whom had technically unacceptable PAT studies. ResultsIn the validation cohort, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the PAT-enhanced diagnosis yielded an area under the curve of 0. 72, a sensitivity of 63. 5 %, compared with 44. 7 % for ECG alone (p < 0. 0001), and a specificity of 67. 8 % common to both ECG and PAT-enhanced diagnoses. Similar results {{were found in the}} training sample. Although over 10 % of validation subjects had equivocal ECG results, with the aid of PAT, it was possible to provide diagnostic information for all but one subject. ConclusionsPeripheral artery tonometry may be useful for improving the diagnosis of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia by both enhancing the sensitivity without impairing the specificity and increasing the percentage of definitive test results...|$|E
40|$|Exercise-induced ST-segment {{elevation}} (STE) in lead aVR may be {{an important}} indicator of prognostically important coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the prevalence and associated clinical features of exercise-induced STE in lead aVR among consecutive patients referred for exercise <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ExECG) is unknown. All consecutive patients receiving a Bruce protocol ExECG for the diagnosis of CAD at a tertiary care academic center were included over a two-year period. Clinical characteristics, including results of coronary angiography, were compared between patients with and without exercise-induced STE in lead aVR. Among 2227 patients undergoing ExECG, exercise-induced STE ≥ 1. 0 mm in lead aVR occurred in 3. 4 % of patients. Patients with STE in lead aVR had significantly lower Duke Treadmill Scores (DTS) (- 0. 5 vs. 7. 0, p< 0. 01) and a higher frequency of positive test results (60. 2 % vs. 7. 3 %, p< 0. 01). Furthermore, patients with STE in lead aVR were more likely to undergo subsequent cardiac catheterization than those without STE in lead aVR (p< 0. 01, odds ratio = 4. 2). Among patients referred for ExECG for suspected CAD, exercise-induced STE in lead aVR was associated with a higher risk DTS, an increased likelihood of a positive ExECG, and referral for subsequent coronary angiography. These results suggest that exercise-induced STE in lead aVR may represent a useful ECG feature among patients undergoing ExECG in the risk stratification of patients...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{compared}} {{the role of}} multislice computed tomography coronary angiography (MSCT-CA) and <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) in the diagnostic workup of patients with chronic chest pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSCT-CA was performed in 43 patients (31 men, 12 women, mean age 58. 8 +/- 7. 7 years) with stable angina after a routine diagnostic workup involving stress ECG and conventional CA. The following inclusion criteria were adopted: sinus rhythm and ability to hold breath for 12 s. Beta-blockers were administered in patients with heart rate>or= 70 beats/minute. In order to identify or exclude patients with significant stenoses (>or= 50 % lumen), we determined posttest likelihood ratios of stress test and MSCT-CA separately and of MSCT-CA performed after the stress test. RESULTS: The pretest probability of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was 74 %. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2. 3 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 0 - 5. 3] and 0. 3 (95 % CI: 0. 2 - 0. 7) for the stress test and 10. 0 (95 % CI: 1. 8 - 78. 4) and 0. 0 (95 % CI: 0. 0 -infinity) for MSCT-CA, respectively. MSCT-CA increased the posttest probability of significant CAD after a negative stress test from 50 % to 86 % and after a positive stress test from 88 % to 100 %. MSCT-CA correctly detected all patients without CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive MSCT-CA is a potentially useful tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with stable angina owing to its capability to detect or exclude significant CAD...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diagnosis of {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) is considered as a challenge in cardiology due to the low accuracy of noninvasive methods such as basal and <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG). This diagnostic challenge can be reduced but not eliminated using dipyridamole as a stress method instead of exercise. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of dipyridamole stress Tc- 99 m Sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with complete LBBB. Methods: We studied 40 patients with permanent and complete LBBB using Tc- 99 m Sestamibi SPECT and dipyridamole stress to evaluate CAD. Perfusion defect was considered fixed when there was no difference between rest and stress score, while reversible defect was defined as a segment with higher score on stress images. All patients underwent coronary angiography. Results: Eleven patients (27. 5 %) had normal myocardial perfusion SPECT and 29 patients (72. 5 %) had reversible perfusion defects. Angiography was positive in 30 patients, while 10 cases showed normal angiography. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predict value and negative predict value of our study for detecting > 50 % coronary stenosis was 86. 6 %, 70 %, 89 % and 64 % respectively. Conclusion: We found 33 (82. 5 %) patients with concordant angiography and myocardial perfusion SPECT results (p= 0. 002).

Previous morphologic studies support the concept of direct hypertensive vascular injury in these patients. To determine whether abnormalities of myocardial perfusion were present in an asymptomatic group of patients with coarctation repair, 18 men and 9 women {{with a mean age}} of 26 years (range 19 to 41) were studied between 2 and 25 years after operative correction. <b>Stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> and quantitative thallium imaging by a circumferential profile technique were used. These patients were compared with a normal group, statistically defined as having a less than 1 % prevalence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease. The postoperative coarctation group demonstrated a reduction in global thallium redistribution in each view analyzed. As compared with findings in the control subjects, thallium washout in the anterior view (41. 9 versus 48. 6 %, p = 0. 02) and left anterior oblique projection (40. 5 versus 48. 2 %, p = 0. 007) was significantly diminished. Although the postoperative coarctation group had a lower thallium redistribution rate in the lateral view (41. 4 versus 46. 3 %, p = 0. 09) this difference did not reach statistical significance because of the intrinsic variability of this projection. Plots of the median percent thallium washout revealed independence from circumferential profile angle, indicating global abnormalities in perfusion. No correlation between clinical variables and thallium kinetics could be established, suggesting marked individual variability in the development of this vascular lesion. The observation of abnormal thallium kinetics in patients with coarctation repair may have consequences for long-term follow-up and therapy...|$|E
40|$|New {{insights}} into {{ischemic heart disease}} in women REVIEW Coronary artery disease is different in women than in men in its pathogenesis, symptoms, and prognosis. Needed is a strategy for detecting and assessing coronary disease specifically in women. This review highlights recent evidence on sex differences in coronary artery disease. ■ KEY POINTS Coronary artery disease {{is the leading cause}} of death in women, and more women than men die of it. The prognosis after an acute myocardial infarction is worse in women than in men, possibly because women receive less aggressive treatment owing to atypical presentations. Different risk factors and mechanisms of disease may be at work in women. When women with acute coronary syndromes undergo angiography, about half do not have any flow-limiting stenosis visible. Endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease may account for ischemia in this situation. Exercise <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> does not appear to be as accurate in women as in men, but stress echocardiography and single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be. Research is needed to clarify how best to identify women at risk of coronary events and to assess those with suspected disease. Possible strategies involve measuring serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations, coronary calcium and atherosclerotic burden, vascular reactivity, and functional capacity. SCHEMIC HEART DISEASE appears to be substantially different in women than in men, and it is time to devise sex-specific strategies for detecting and assessing it. Compared with men, women have: • As great a prevalence of coronary disease, at least in their older years • A higher death rate from coronary disease • Worse outcomes after acute coronary events • Different pathophysiologic mechanisms of coronary disease • Different presentations and risk factors. Herein we summarize the current under-standing of ischemic heart disease in women and challenges in detecting it...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective. We {{evaluated}} dobutamine <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> {{for detecting}} potentially reversible contractile dysfunction or residual ischemia in the infarct-related area. Background. ST-T segment changes in pathologic Q wave leads during stress testing may reflect contractile reserve, inducible ischemia or passive mechanical stretching. Dobutamine echocardiography allows detection of contractile reserve at low doses and inducible ischemia at high doses. Methods. We used low (5 to 10 μg/kg body weight per min) and high doses (20 to 40 μg/kg per min) of dobutamine in 49 {{patients with a}} previous Q wave myocardial infarction and analyzed the relation between ST-T segment changes in pathologic Q wave leads and regional contraction. Results. At low dose dobutamine, regional contraction improved in the infarct-related area in 23 patients. New or further ST segment elevation and pseudonormalization of negative T waves developed at low doses more frequently in patients with than without contractile reserve (both p < 0. 001), giving a sensitivity of 43. 5 % and 60. 9 % and a specificity of 100 % and 96. 2 %, respectively. At high dose dobutamine (43 patients), new or further ST segment elevation and pseudonormalization of negative T waves, occurring beyond those observed at low doses, lead a low predictive accuracy for contractile reserve (sensitivity of 9. 5 % and 14. 3 % and specificity of 68. 2 % and 81. 8 %, respectively). Pseudonormalization of negative T waves at high dose dobutamine was 100 % specific (but only 25 % sensitive) for homozonal ischemia. Conclusions. ST segment elevation or pseudonormalization of negative T waves, or both, is indicative of contractile reserve in the infarct-related area when either develops at low dose dobutamine, but {{may be associated with}} worsening or no change in contractile function at high doses...|$|E
40|$|Cirrhotic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{the term}} used to describe a constellation of features indicative of abnormal heart structure and function in patients with cirrhosis. These include systolic and diastolic dysfunction, electrophysiological changes, and macroscopic and microscopic structural changes. The prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy remains unknown at present, mostly because the disease is generally latent and shows itself when the patient is subjected to stress such as exercise, drugs, hemorrhage and surgery. The main clinical features of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy include baseline increased cardiac output, attenuated systolic contraction or diastolic relaxation in response to physiologic, pharmacologic and surgical stress, and electrical conductance abnormalities (prolonged QT interval). In the majority of cases, diastolic dysfunction precedes systolic dysfunction, which tends to manifest only under conditions of stress. Generally, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy with overt severe heart failure is rare. Major stresses on the cardiovascular system such as liver transplantation, infections and insertion of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts (TIPS) can unmask the presence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and thereby convert latent to overt heart failure. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy may {{also contribute to the}} pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome. Pathogenic mechanisms of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy are multiple and include abnormal membrane biophysical characteristics, impaired β-adrenergic receptor signal transduction and increased activity of negative-inotropic pathways mediated by cGMP. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis require a careful assessment of patient history probing for excessive alcohol, physical examination for signs of hypertension such as retinal vascular changes, and appropriate diagnostic tests such as exercise <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography,</b> nuclear heart scans and coronary angiography. Current management recommendations include empirical, nonspecific and mainly supportive measures. The exact prognosis remains unclear. The extent of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy generally correlates to the degree of liver insufficiency.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{importance of}} both prevention and personal responsibility in controlling heart disease, {{the leading cause}} of death in the USA and elsewhere, has attracted renewed attention. Coronary artery disease is preventable, using relatively simple and inexpensive lifestyle changes. The inexorable rise in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, often in the risk cluster known as the metabolic syndrome, drives the ever-increasing incidence of heart disease. Population-wide improvements in personal health habits appear to be a fundamental, evidence based public health measure, yet numerous barriers prevent implementation. A common symptom in patients with coronary artery disease, classical angina refers to the typical chest pressure or discomfort that results when myocardial oxygen demand rises and coronary blood flow is reduced by fixed, atherosclerotic, obstructive lesions. Different forms of angina and diagnosis, with a short description of the significance of pain and silent ischemia, are discussed in this review. The well accepted concept of myocardial oxygen imbalance in the genesis of angina is presented with new data about clinical pathology of stable angina and acute coronary syndromes. The roles of <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> and stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphic imaging are reviewed, along with the information these tests provide about risk and prognosis. Finally, the current status of gender disparities in heart disease is summarized. Enhanced risk stratification and identification of patients in whom procedures will meaningfully change management is an ongoing quest. Current guidelines emphasize efficient triage of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Many experts believe the predictive value of current decision protocols for coronary artery disease still needs improvement in order to optimize outcomes, yet avoid unnecessary coronary angiograms and radiation exposure. Coronary angiography remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of coronary artery obstructive disease. Part II of this two part series will address anti-ischemic therapies, new agents, cardiovascular risk reduction, options to treat refractory angina, and revascularization...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chest pain (CP) {{patients}} in the Emergency Department (ED) present a diagnostic dilemma, with a low prevalence of coronary disease but grave consequences with misdiagnosis. A common diagnostic strategy involves ED cardiac monitoring while excluding myocardial necrosis, followed by stress testing. We sought to describe the use of stress echocardiography (echo) at our institution, to identify cardiac pathology compared with <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) alone. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 57 urban ED Chest Pain Unit (CPU) patients from 2002 - 2005 with stress testing suggesting ischemia. Our main descriptive outcome was proportion and type of discordant findings between stress ECG testing and stress echo. The secondary outcome was whether stress echo results appeared to change management. Results: Thirty-four of 57 patients [59. 7 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 46. 9 - 72. 4 %] had stress echo results discordant with stress ECG results. The most common discordance was an abnormal stress ECG with a normal stress echo (n= 17 / 57, 29. 8 %, CI 17. 9 - 41. 7 %), followed by normal stress ECG but with reversible regional wall-motion abnormality on stress echo (n = 10 / 57, 17. 5 %, CI 7. 7 - 27. 4 %). The remaining seven patients (12. 3 %, CI 3. 8 - 20. 8 %) had non-diagnostic stress ECG due to sub-maximal effort. Stress echo showed reversible wall-motion abnormality in two, and five were normal. Twenty-five of the 34 patients (73. 5 %, CI 56. 8 - 85. 4 %) with discordant results had a different diagnostic strategy than predicted from their stress ECG alone. Conclusion: The addition of echo to stress ECG testing in ED CPU patients altered diagnosis in 34 / 57 (59. 7 %, CI 46. 9 - 72. 4 %) patients, and appeared to change management in 25 / 57 (43. 9 %, CI 31. 8 - 57. 6 %) patients.

Women who {{have been diagnosed with}} breast cancer are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases than the general population, in part due to the direct toxic effects of cancer treatment on the cardiovascular system. The aim of this review was to determine the utility of cardiac stress tests for the detection of cardiovascular disease after cardiotoxic breast cancer treatment. Design: Systematic review. Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for studies utilizing heart function tests in breast cancer survivors. Studies utilizing a cardiac stress test and a heart function test performed at rest were included to determine whether stress provided added benefit to identifying cardiac abnormalities that were undetected at rest within each study. Results: Fourteen studies were identified. Overall, there was a benefit to utilizing stress tests over tests at rest in identifying evidence of cardiovascular disease in five studies, a possible benefit in five studies, and no benefit in four studies. The most common type of stress test was myocardial perfusion imaging, where reversible perfusion defects were detected under stress in individuals who had no defects at rest, in five of seven studies of long-term follow-up. Two studies demonstrated the benefit of stress echocardiography over resting echocardiography for detecting left ventricular dysfunction in anthracycline-treated breast cancer survivors. There was no benefit of stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in one study. Two studies showed a potential benefit of <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography,</b> whereas three others did not.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{diagnostic}} accuracy and the prognostic significance of <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) and of thallium- 201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in determining the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in an elderly population. METHODS: A selected series of 132 patients (90 males, mean age 72. 4 years; 42 females, mean age 68. 2 years) hospitalized because of cardiac events associated with suspected CAD, underwent stress ECG and thallium- 201 testing; as endpoints we considered the heart rate and the appearance of clinical symptoms or ST segment depression. Patients unable to develop an adequate exercise workload, were tested with dipyridamole. All patients also underwent coronary angiography following the stress test. One hundred and twenty-four patients had a mean follow-up of 2 years. Endpoints included subsequent coronary events or new serious disease. The sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of both ECG and of thallium- 201 SPECT were calculated. RESULTS: ECG findings were positive in 102 patients and coronary angiography confirmed the presence of CAD in 92 of them; ECG findings were negative in 30 patients, but only 14 were free from obstructive coronary lesions. Thallium- 201 SPECT findings were positive in 112 patients (coronary angiograms confirmed CAD in 101) and negative in 20 patients (in 13 of whom angiography confirmed the absence of disease). The sensitivity of the stress tests was quite good: 85. 1 % for ECG and 93. 5 % for thallium- 201 SPECT; conversely, the specificity of ECG was superior to that of SPECT (58. 3 vs 54. 1 %). The sensitivity of both techniques was superior in males than in females and seemed to correlate with the extent of CAD. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of thallium- 201 SPECT was 86. 3 % whereas that of ECG was 80. 3 %. Considering the overall cardiac events, the predictive value of SPECT was superior to that of ECG both in terms of the positive value (54 vs 51 %, p = NS) and, more importantly, in terms of the negative value (84 vs 62 %, p < 0. 03).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} significance of stress-induced ST elevation early after {{acute myocardial infarction}} {{and its relation to}} functional recovery remain controversial. The aims of this study were (1) to determine the incidence of ST elevation during dobutamine and exercise tests and (2) to assess the relative accuracy of exercise and dobutamine ST elevation for predicting functional recovery after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 52 patients who underwent supine exercise (from 25 W to maximal charge) and dobutamine (from 5 to 40 microg/kg per minute and up to 1 mg atropine) <b>stress</b> <b>electrocardiography</b> in the same position. ST elevation was defined as new or worsening at > 1 mm, 80 ms after J point. Echocardiography and quantitative angiography were available in all patients before hospital discharge. The follow-up resting echocardiogram was recorded 30 +/- 6 days after the acute event. ST elevation developed during 30 (58 %) dobutamine and 24 (46 %) exercise tests. The sum of ST elevation was higher during dobutamine testing (7. 7 +/- 3. 8 mm) than during exercise (5. 5 +/- 2. 5 mm) (P =. 03). A low peak creatine kinase level was the single independent predictor of dobutamine-induced ST elevation. Functional improvement occurred in 35 patients. Two independent predictors of functional recovery were selected from multivariate analysis: dobutamine ST elevation (chi(2) = 9. 1; P =. 0026) and low peak creatine kinase level (chi(2) = 5. 1; P =. 025). When dobutamine ST elevation was not included in multivariate analysis, exercise-induced ST elevation emerged as an independent predictor of functional recovery (chi(2) = 5. 0; P =. 023). Significant linear correlation was found between the sum of ST elevation at peak dobutamine stress and the extent of functional recovery (r = 0. 87; P <. 0001). In contrast, no correlation was observed with exercise ST elevation (r = 0. 06; P = not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Stress-induced ST elevation is an ancillary sign of viable myocardium that can recover. The sum of ST elevation at peak dobutamine stress correlates with the extent of functional recovery. Peer reviewe...|$|E
