50|$|During the {{lull in the}} wet season, {{from late}} June to early July, female L. figueresi emerge from their nests, mate, and then either {{establish}} new nests or, more rarely, re-use old nests. Heavy rains prevent much mating and foraging but some females keep extra cells open for new larvae for sporadic favorable weather during the rainy season. Nests typically contain a female and her offspring and are enlarged {{at the beginning of}} the dry season in late November and early December. Only seasonally active, females store up pollen only until mid-February and die after their first season of reproduction. During the dry season, it is more difficult to dig up the hardening soil so there is less creation of nests. Broods <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> in their nest. By May, males and females co-exist yet don't work on the nest at this time. After about 80 days, which is considerably longer than the 20 to 35 days of other halictine bees, they become young adults and leave the nest around mid-June, mating with others and starting the cycle over again.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{an exploration}} into {{the concept of}} employee engagement; its components and drivers within the employment relationship. It examines the literature and secondary research available on the topic, to date, and the potential value which could be derived for both the employee and the organisation from its effective implementation. Engagement {{could be described as}} a ‘hot topic ’ in management; but how can we get it? The study focuses on the apparent changes to the employment relationship and the challenge of employee retention which is believed to exist in the labour market. A primary task for organisations today is to attract the right people but also to provide them with an environment in which to <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> <b>grow.</b> It is believed that the needs of the workforce have evolved. Organisations are discovering financial compensation alone {{may not be enough to}} keep the highly skilled and motivated workforce a business needs to excel. Employee engagement is no longer simply a nice thing to do; it can be employed as a strategic element that impacts both retention levels and the bottom line. This research was compiled in relation to a single case; an Irish Recruitment Agency. Within the study, both qualitative and quantitative data was accumulated and analyzed. The research found employee engagement to be a pivotal element of the modem employment relationship, which, when successfully incorporated into an organisation, can become a significant contributor to high retention levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{whale shark}} (Rhincodon typus) has a global {{distribution}} in warm to warm temperate oceans, {{and is a}} species of high conservation concern currently categorized as Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Despite its dire conservation status and concerns about {{the growing number of}} ecotourism interactions with this species worldwide, relatively little information is available on key aspects of whale shark biology such as growth rates, reproductive rates, survival rates and breeding habitats. In particular, critical information such as age and growth of whale sharks is needed to improve the management and conservation of this species. Robust knowledge of life history parameters is needed to improve demographic models for whale sharks and enable better evaluation of their vulnerability to fishing pressures and recovery from population declines. Whale sharks are well known to form aggregations in specific locations, with one such site being the South Ari Atoll in the Maldives. My study aimed to expand knowledge of the population dynamics, including age and growth, of whale sharks at the South Ari Atoll by calculating growth parameters and rates from encounters with free-swimming sharks over a decade (April 2006 to May 2016). A total of 1545 encounters with 125 individual sharks were recorded during this time period. To obtain the most accurate information on the sizes of whale sharks, total lengths were estimated by three different measurement methods (visual, laser photogrammetry, and tape), and linear regression was utilized to investigate how these different methods compared to one another. The results showed that visual estimates tended to underestimate sizes of the larger sharks, and laser and tape measurements yielded similar results to one another (R 2 = 0. 824). New sharks observed at the South Ari Atoll during the study period were significantly smaller than returning sharks, suggesting that young sharks may be recruited to the South Ari Atoll, where they <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> <b>grow</b> until reaching maturity before leaving the area. To the best of my knowledge, my study is the first to infer growth parameters and rates from measurements of free-swimming whale sharks. Estimates of von Bertalanffy growth parameters for combined sexes, calculated from 180 encounters with 44 individual sharks (Males (n= 40), Females (n= 4), TL= 3. 16 m – 8. 00 m), yielded an L¥ of 19. 56 and a k value of 0. 021. Analyzing 177 encounters with 40 male sharks (TL= 3. 16 m - 8. 00 m) exclusively provided an L¥ of 18. 08 and a k value of 0. 023. These values correspond to a male age at maturity of ~ 25 years and a longevity of ~ 140 years, exceeding those estimated for whale sharks captured off Taiwan based on analysis of biannual vertebral rings (male maturity = 17 years; longevity (combined sexes) = 80. 4 years). There have been few growth studies, mainly from vertebral analysis, that have produced wide ranges in L¥ (14 – 20. 5) and k values (0. 017 – 0. 037). These differences underscore the need for additional regional studies to obtain population specific estimates of these key life history parameters...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} drivers of lifelong learning and to emphasize its importance in modern life. Developed economies throughout the world are driven more by knowledge and globalization than were economies of even the recent past. European economies of the 20 th century were largely driven by manufacturing and the need to industrialize. Filling such economies with functional workers required education systems of similar design, that turned out masses of equally-educated workers in large batches. Increased automation, the widespread introduction of computer technologies and communications, and cheaper transportation have combined to encourage firms to be lean, international, and changing. Computer technologies encouraged sharing of documents, speeded workflow from design to production. Cheaper transportation allowed an increase in internationalization of workforces. These major shifts drove change from industrialized to knowledge-based economies. Paper discusses how two simple English words came together, <b>stayed</b> together, <b>and</b> <b>grew</b> into a powerful term driving new political initiatives, and continue to influence political, economic, social, and even cultural currents. Today's developed societies are rapidly aging, live longer and have fewer children.
