2500|$|A German chemist {{had invented}} {{phosphorus}} matches in 1832 {{but they were}} dangerous because the yellow phosphorus used was poisonous {{and because it was}} in the match head and thus could easily light by accident. The Swedes improved on the design by using a safer red phosphorus, which they put on the <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> of the matchbox. They called them [...] "safety matches". They made Sweden the leading exporter of matches and made matches the most important Swedish export.|$|E
2500|$|Kevlar is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} material on marching snare drums. It allows for an extremely high amount of tension, resulting in a cleaner sound. There is usually a resin poured onto the Kevlar to make the head airtight, and a nylon top layer to provide a flat <b>striking</b> <b>surface.</b> This {{is one of the}} primary types of marching snare drum heads. Remo's [...] "Falam Slam" [...] patch is made with Kevlar and is used to reinforce bass drum heads where the beater strikes.|$|E

2500|$|The ball {{is made of}} a {{very hard}} rubber wrapped in pandanus. Players are not {{protected}} by any padding or masks, and will often wear only a lava-lava. The sennit-wrapped wooden bats are modeled on the three-sided Samoan war club called the [...] "lapalapa," [...] {{which are based on}} the stalk of coconut fronds. Bats are shaped to individual players' likings and can be over a meter long; because the <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> of the bat is angled (just as the [...] "lapalapa" [...] club and the coconut frond stalk), the path of a hit ball is extremely hard to predict.|$|E
2500|$|Flares {{are most}} {{commonly}} gravity-fed from a dispenser inside [...] the aircraft's fuselage. These dispensers can be programmed {{by the pilot}} or ground crew to dispense flares in short intervals, one at a time, long intervals, or in clusters. Most currently used flares are of the pyrophoric variety, and thus the dispensers {{do not have to}} ignite and deploy the flare at the same time. With pyrotechnic flares, a lanyard automatically pulls off a friction cap covering the exposed end of the flare as it falls from the dispenser. A friction surface inside the cap rubs against the exposed end of the flare (similar to a match-head and <b>striking</b> <b>surface)</b> and ignites the flare.|$|E
2500|$|Both types {{strike by}} rapidly {{unfolding}} and swinging their raptorial claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400g (102,000m/s2 or 335,000ft/s2) and speeds of [...] from a standing start. Because they strike so rapidly, they generate vapor-filled bubbles {{in the water}} between the appendage and the striking surface—known as cavitation bubbles. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey {{in addition to the}} instantaneous forces of 1,500newtons that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the <b>striking</b> <b>surface,</b> which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to stun or kill.|$|E

50|$|Pusey was a Pennsylvanian {{attorney}} who {{was fond of}} smoking cigars. Fed up with carrying bulky boxes of wooden matches, he set to work to invent paper matches that would be lighter and smaller. His final design had matches secured to a thin paper wrapping with an attached <b>striking</b> <b>surface.</b> Unlike present-day matchbooks, Pusey positioned the <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> {{on the inside of}} the paper fold. This allowed all 50 matches to be lit at once.The diamond match company later put the <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> on the outside.|$|E

5000|$|The {{safety of}} true [...] "safety matches" [...] {{is derived from}} the {{separation}} of the reactive ingredients between a match head {{on the end of a}} paraffin-impregnated splint and the special <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> (in addition to the safety aspect of replacing the white phosphorus with red phosphorus). The idea for separating the chemicals had been introduced in 1859 in the form of two-headed matches known in France as Allumettes Androgynes. These were sticks with one end made of potassium chlorate and the other of red phosphorus. They had to be broken and the heads rubbed together. There was however a risk of the heads rubbing each other accidentally in their box. Such dangers were removed when the <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> was moved to the outside of the box. The development of a specialized matchbook with both matches and a <b>striking</b> <b>surface</b> occurred in the 1890s with the American Joshua Pusey, who sold his patent to the Diamond Match Company.|$|E

50|$|Breaking is a {{martial arts}} {{technique}} {{that is used}} in competition, demonstration and testing.

The most common object is a piece of wood or brick, though it is also common to break cinder blocks, glass, or even a piece of metal such as steel bars. Glass is usually discouraged, since its shards may cause injury when broken.|$|E
