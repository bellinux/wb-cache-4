25|$|Multinational IPOs {{may have}} many syndicates {{to deal with}} differing legal {{requirements}} in both the issuer's domestic market and other regions. For example, an issuer based in the E.U. may be represented by the main <b>selling</b> <b>syndicate</b> in its domestic market, Europe, in addition to separate syndicates or selling groups for US/Canada and for Asia. Usually, the lead underwriter in the main selling group is also the lead bank in the other selling groups.|$|E

5000|$|A {{team that}} did not appear on Monday Night Football during the season could be playing in the Wild Card game. Since the NFL only <b>sells</b> <b>syndicated</b> {{packages}} to teams that play a Monday night game during the season, the logistics selling a sealed bid package of a single playoff game to local television stations on Monday morning for a Saturday game would be improbable. While in 2014, both Carolina and Arizona played on Monday during the season, the stations with the Monday night package were able to air {{the game in the}} local markets.|$|R
5000|$|They pay ballplayers a lot {{of money}} for hitting [...]333; I'd pay anybody {{a lot of}} money if they could be right 33.3 percent of the time in this business. — Dick Shepherd, on the film {{industry}} Born Richard Allen Silberman in 1927 in Kansas City, Missouri, he attended Stanford University and studied journalism. After graduating, he worked for talent agent Lew Wasserman, <b>selling</b> <b>syndicated</b> TV shows. In the early 1950s, Jews were somewhat ostracized where he worked, and he changed his name to Shepherd, according to his son Scott. During his employment with Wasserman, Shepherd enlisted in the United States Army, writing stories for the Stars and Stripes newspaper in post-World War II Germany. After his service, he would go on to head production at Warner Bros. in 1970 and MGM in 1976, before founding his own agency, the Artists Agency, where he would work into his 70s.|$|R
60|$|These {{indiscriminate}} concessions {{will be very}} injurious to {{the future}} of the Protectorate, and should be limited by law. At present the only use is to <b>sell</b> them to <b>syndicates</b> and companies, and so to pay a fictitious dividend to the actionnaires. Evidently such a process is rather on the 'bear and bull' system of the stock-market than legitimate mining.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1933, Jerry Siegel wrote a short prose story titled [...] "The Reign of the Superman", {{which was}} {{illustrated}} {{by his friend}} Joe Shuster and self-published in a science fiction magazine. It {{told the story of}} a bald villain with telepathic powers. Trying to create a character they could <b>sell</b> to newspaper <b>syndicates,</b> Siegel re-conceived the [...] "superman" [...] character as a powerful hero, sent to our world from a more advanced society. [...] He and Shuster developed the idea into a comic strip, which they pitched unsuccessfully.|$|R
60|$|I {{was then}} under {{contract}} for my Innocents Abroad, {{but did not}} have a cent to live on while I wrote it. So I went to Washington to do a little journalism. There I met an equally poor friend, William Davidson, who had not a single vice, unless you call it a vice in a Scot to love Scotch. Together we devised the first and original newspaper <b>syndicate,</b> <b>selling</b> two letters a week to twelve newspapers and getting $1 a letter. That $24 a week would have been enough for us--if we had not had to support the jug.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, {{an article}} in the virulently anti-Semitic Dearborn Independent claimed that Frazee was one of many Jews who had ruined baseball. Although Frazee was not Jewish, the article played up longstanding {{stereotypes}} about Broadway impresarios. Frazee was unable to respond, since {{at the time it was}} published he was not only dealing with a divorce, but the death of his father. The article wrecked any chance Frazee had of rehabilitating himself. Although he was forced to <b>sell</b> to a <b>syndicate</b> of Midwestern businessmen fronted by Johnson crony Bob Quinn, he held out for $1.2 million—nearly double what he paid for the team in 1916. Ironically, the Red Sox had some of their worst seasons ever under Quinn's ownership after one of his principal investors died.|$|R
5000|$|During {{prohibition}} (which {{lasted from}} 1920 to 1933), the sale, manufacture {{and distribution of}} alcohol was severely curtailed. This new legal sanction created a landslide of illegal distribution of liquor and moonshine, which some farmers and illegal distillers would call {{the golden age of}} moonshining. Since alcohol was illegal, moonshiners and bootleggers faced a high demand for liquor that allowed them to have a monopoly over the alcohol trade in the United States. The Great Depression—from 1929 to 1939—also contributed to the popularity of moonshining in the United States. During that time of economic hardship, many Americans turned to manufacturing and distributing illegal products. [...] In the southern states, some moonshiners sold their product to bootleggers, who transported it all over the country, often <b>selling</b> to crime <b>syndicates</b> such as that run by Al Capone.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his popularity, Jepko did not {{significantly}} profit from his work. According to a former colleague, his Nitecaps show had been financially successful, but his deal with Mutual was not to his advantage. Where {{he and his staff}} had done all the selling of commercial time on the KSL program, Mutual insisted on doing the <b>selling</b> for the <b>syndicated</b> show. There were problems almost immediately, resulting in on-going friction between the way Mutual wanted things done and how Jepko thought things ought to be. Jepko ended up convinced that Mutual did not understand his unique audience. Mutual, on the other hand, faced with challenges gaining affiliate clearances for the show (only around 70 of Mutual's over 500 affiliates ever carried the show) decided Jepko's audience was too old, unsophisticated, and not large enough to bring in a profit for the network. As Jepko perceived it, Mutual betrayed their original contract with him and gave up on the show. By the time Jepko's contract ended, Jepko had lost whatever money his original Nitecaps show had brought him. (5) ...|$|R
