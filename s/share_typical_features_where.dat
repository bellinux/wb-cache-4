Both Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) were applied in parallel to achieve volumetric, three-component velocity data sets of the reacting flow field at pressures of 2 and 10 bar with 700 K pre-heating. Limited optical access to the mixing zone required a combination of PIV and DGV to obtain averaged three-component velocity data from a single viewing direction. The acquired volume data sets of the time-averaged flow in the mixing zone contain about 40 parallel planes spaced at 2 mm with a spatial resolution of 1. 2 × 1. 2 mm 2 each.

Surprisingly, they all recognized the 64 kDa autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase. In this study we investigated which <b>typical</b> <b>features</b> of cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies are represented by these monoclonals. We show by double immunofluorescence testing that MICA 1 - 6 stain pancreatic beta cells which is {{in agreement with the}} beta-cell specific expression of glutamate decarboxylase. In contrast an islet-reactive IgM monoclonal antibody obtained from a pre-diabetic individual stained all islet cells but lacked the tissue specificity of MICA 1 - 6 and must therefore be considered as a polyreactive IgM-antibody. We further demonstrate that MICA 1 - 6 revealed <b>typical</b> <b>features</b> of epitope sensitivity to biochemical treatment of the target tissue which has been demonstrated for islet cell antibodies, and which has been used to argue for a lipid rather than a protein nature of target antigens. Our results provide direct evidence that the epitopes recognized by the MICA are destroyed by methanol/chloroform treatment but reveal a high stability to Pronase digestion compared to proinsulin epitopes. Conformational protein epitopes in glutamate decarboxylase therefore show a sensitivity to biochemical treatment of sections such as ganglioside epitopes.

40|$|Superantigens {{are defined}} as {{proteins}} that activate {{a large number of}} T cells through interaction with the V � region of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). Here we demonstrate that the superantigen produced by Mycoplasma arthritidis (MAM), unlike six bacterial superantigens tested, interacts not only with the V � region but also with the CDR 3 (third complementarity-determining region) of TCR-�. Although MAM <b>shares</b> <b>typical</b> <b>features</b> with other superantigens, direct interaction with CDR 3 - � is a feature of nominal peptide antigens situated in the antigen groove of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules rather than superantigens. During peptide recognition, V � and V � domains of the TCR form contacts with MHC and the complex is stabilized by CDR 3 –peptide interactions. Similarly, recognition of MAM is V�dependent and is apparently stabilized by direct contacts with the CDR 3 - � region. Thus, MAM represents a new type of ligand for TCR, distinct from both conventional peptide antigens and other known superantigens. In the first step of a specific immune response, T lymphocytes are activated by interaction between the TCR and peptide antigen bound to the MHC. Specific peptide recognition is achieved by the unique structure of TCRs, formed by somatic rearrangement of their composite gen...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{synthetic}} bone grafts to foster bone formation {{is a challenge}} in regenerative medicine. Understanding the interaction of bone substitutes with osteoclasts is essential, since osteoclasts not only drive a timely resorption of the biomaterial, but also trigger osteoblast activity. In this study, the adhesion and differentiation of human blood-derived osteoclast precursors (OCP) on two different micro-nanostructured biomimetic hydroxyapatite materials consisting in coarse (HA-C) and fine HA (HA-F) crystals, in comparison with sintered stoichiometric HA (sin-HA, reference material), were investigated. Osteoclasts were induced to differentiate by RANKL-containing supernatant using cell/substrate direct and indirect contact systems, and calcium (Ca++) and phosphorus (P 5 +) in culture medium were measured. We observed that OCP adhered to the experimental surfaces, and that osteoclast-like cells formed at a rate influenced by the micro- and nano-structure of HA, which also modulate extracellular Ca++. Qualitative {{differences were found between}} OCP on biomimetic HA-C and HA-F and their counterparts on plastic and sin-HA. On HA-C and HA-F cells <b>shared</b> <b>typical</b> <b>features</b> of mature osteoclasts, i. e. podosomes, multinuclearity, tartrate acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive staining, and TRAP 5 b-enzyme release. However, cells were less in number compared to those on plastic or on sin-HA, and they did not express some specific osteoclast markers. In conclusion, blood-derived OCP are able to attach to biomimetic and sintered HA substrates, but their subsequent fusion and resorptive activity are hampered by surface micro-nano-structure. Indirect cultures suggest that fusion of OCP is sensitive to topography and to extracellular calcium. Preprin...|$|R
40|$|The {{pancreatic}} B-cell hormone amylin {{is known}} {{to be involved in the}} regulation of meal ending satiation and it also <b>shares</b> <b>typical</b> <b>features</b> of adiposity signals. Chronic amylin administration has recently been shown to increase energy expenditure under certain conditions. Here we investigate the acute effect of peripheral administration of amylin or its agonist salmon calcitonin (sCT) on energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ). First, rats were injected with amylin (5 microg/kg IP) or saline just before dark onset. Despite significantly decreased food intake in amylin-treated rats compared to control until 2 h post-injection (p< 0. 05), amylin did not influence energy expenditure or RQ. Reduced food intake, which reduces energy expenditure, may have confounded a stimulatory effect of amylin on energy expenditure. Therefore, in the second experiment, amylin (1, 5 and 10 microg/kg IP) or saline was injected in the middle of the light phase (t= 0 h) without access to food during 3 h post-injection. Amylin had no significant effects on energy expenditure or RQ. In a similar paradigm, the effect of sCT (0. 1, 1. 0 and 5. 0 microg/kg IP) was tested. During food restriction, 5. 0 microg/kg sCT significantly stimulated energy expenditure compared to control (p< 0. 05). Subsequent to refeeding at t= 3 h, energy expenditure was decreased compared to control at t= 8 h and t= 10 h after 5. 0 microg/kg sCT, probably due to sCT's strong anorectic action. Thus amylin may prevent the compensatory decrease in energy expenditure normally seen in animals that eat less. The longer acting sCT stimulated energy expenditure in animals without food access...|$|R

Together, these two templates can separate the contributions from the host galaxy and the AGN even in the case of limited data points, given that this model has only two free parameters. Using this method, we re-analyze 69 z≳ 5 quasars with extensive Herschel observations, and derive their AGN luminosities L_ AGN in a range ∼ (0. 78 - 27. 4) × 10 ^ 13 L_, the infrared luminosities from star formation L_ SF,IR∼ (< 1. 5 - 25. 7) × 10 ^ 12 L_, and the corresponding star formation rates SFR∼ (< 290 - 2650) M_/ yr.

Although Mongolian gerbil reproductive organs have been increasingly investigated, its prostate structure is far from being properly known, and investigations of this organ focused on the ventral lobe (VL). Thus, the present study provides a thorough morphological description of prostatic complex in the male adult gerbil on the basis of topographic, histological, and ultrastructural analysis and ductal branching. Like other rodents, four pairs of PL were observed. However, in contrast to the rat and mouse, the VL is the least voluminous component and the dorsolateral lobe (DLL) is the most prominent and spatially isolated from remaining PL. The occurrence of a dorsal lobe (DL), hidden between bladder and insertion of seminal vesicles, has not been mentioned in previous reports with Mongolian gerbil. Collagenase digestion followed by microdissection revealed that, except for DL, which has a tubularacinar organization, all PL exhibit tubular organization and variable ductal branching. Distinct histological and ultrastructural features such as secretory epithelium, aspect of luminal secretion and stromal organization are reported for each PL and are confirmed by morphometric and stereological methods. Histological sections showed at least three intralobar segments in VL and DL. Ultrastructural analysis evidenced that, although luminal epithelial cells of PL <b>share</b> <b>typical</b> <b>features</b> of exocrine secretory cells, there are striking lobe phenotypical variations. Both merocrine and apocrine pathways are observed in variable rates in all PL, with the predominance of the former in the DLL and the latter in the CG.

We infer the existence of a social contract that mitigates these potential losses in the study area to a remarkable extent; in its absence, average yields are estimated to be 18 % lower. The finding that the water allocation is close to efficient (given the power supply) marks a sharp contrast with much of the existing literature. Notwithstanding the social contract, the random and inadequate supply of power, and therefore water, is inefficient.

To analyze this question we combine MEA recordings with optical imaging in sparse cortical cultures to assign individual spikes to visually-identified single neurons.

In response to elevated calcium levels, NCS proteins invoke the calcium-myristoyl switch which is the central mechanism of their involvement in cellular calcium signalling. It has been shown that membrane association of proteins by a myristoyl group alone is very weak and requires further stabilising interactions such as hydrogen bonds between the protein and membrane phospholipids or the involvement of another membrane-associated protein. The subcellular membrane localisation of neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins in living cells, such as VILIP- 1 and VILIP- 3, differs substantially. We have followed the hypothesis that the differential localisation might be due to specific binding capabilities of individual VILIPs for phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). Several highly conserved lysine residues in the N-terminal region could provide favourable electrostatic interactions. Molecular modelling results support a binding site for phospho-inositides in the N-terminal area of VILIP- 1, and the involvement of the conserved N-terminal lysine residues in binding the phosphoinositol head group. Experimentally, the binding of VILIP- 1 to inositol derivatives was tested by a PIP strip assay, which showed the requirement of phosphorylation of the inositol group for the interaction of the protein with PIPs. Monolayer adsorption measurements show a clear preference of VILIP- 1 binding to PI(4, 5) P 2 over PI(3, 4, 5) P 3. Moreover, we found co-localisation of VILIP- 1 with PI(4, 5) P 2 at the cell surface membrane in hippocampal neurons, supporting the notion of interactions between VILIP- 1 and PIPs in living cells.
