5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E

5|$|After manager Ronald Koeman's departure, Benfica {{immediately}} <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement. Media speculated {{the club}} would sign Sven-Göran Eriksson and later Carlos Queiroz, but Benfica signed the former Porto and Sporting CP manager Fernando Santos. Santos {{was the first}} manager since Fernando Riera to manage all of Portugal's Big Three clubs. In the transfer market, Benfica brought back Rui Costa and recruited other notable players including Katsouranis and David Luiz. Fabrizio Miccoli had his loan renewed for a second year, while Geovanni, Manuel Fernandes and Ricardo Rocha left the club during the season.|$|E

Much of the senior production crew from the previous film worked on The Living Daylights, with John Glen directing, John Barry providing the score and Peter Lamont acting as production designer. Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum again provided the script and initially proposed a prequel, showing Bond's first mission, although this was turned down by Broccoli. Script work continued while the producers searched for Moore's successor.|$|E

5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} find one before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVisual <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moving target}} among {{stationary}} distractors {{is more efficient}} than <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stationary target among moving distractors, and <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fast target among slow distractors is more efficient than vice versa. This indicates that the ease of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> target with a particular motion is not determined simply by the difference between target and distractor velocities. We suggest <b>a</b> simple model <b>for</b> predicting ease of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> unique motion, based upon a quantitative measure of target saliency. Essentially, search will be easier the more the target motion deviates from the general pattern of velocities in the scene. Our model predicts a number of well-known motion search phenomena, and suggests that one control for target saliency as well as target discriminability when drawing conclusions about visual system mechanisms from search experiments...|$|R

5|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, {{about a year after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.|$|E
5|$|The band <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new concert venue {{because the}} Arlequines was {{becoming}} {{too small for}} their growing audience. They moved to Cemento, {{where most of the}} 1991 concerts took place. They played with the bands Todos tus muertos, Pobres pibes, Nepal, Militia, Devastación, Rapier, and Resistencia Nativa. Their albums Hermética and Intérpreteswhich had been released as LP records and cassettes, were released by Tripoli on a single compact disc. Tony Scotto left the band because of creative differences and was replaced by Claudio Strunz. Strunz, drummer of the band Heinkel and owner of Hermética's rehearsal room, had already played with the band during practice sessions when Scotto was absent. He made his debut at Sunchales. The band appeared in two television programs, La movida del '90 and Siglo XX Cambalache and recorded their second full-length album, Ácido Argentino, with 150 hours of recording time at the Aguilar studios. It was released at Cemento on December 27.|$|E
5|$|To {{maximize}} {{their chances of}} success, Square <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E

5|$|Kesha {{had been}} {{recording}} demos {{for a few}} years, when one of her demos {{ended up in the}} hands of Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at BMI. Cox, who had worked with Kesha before, passed along the demos to a friend at BMI, who passed it to the manager of Lukasz Gottwald, known as Dr. Luke. At the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Dr. Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs. Luke was busy with other projects at the time, and Kesha ultimately wound up signed to David Sonenberg's management company, DAS. While at DAS she worked with several top writers and producers, but rarely worked with or even spoke to Luke. DAS <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> label deal for Kesha despite her still being in a signed contract with Luke. Kara DioGuardi, an artists and repertoire (A) representative for Warner, was also interested in signing Kesha but the deal never went through because of the outstanding contract with Luke. Shortly after, Kesha and DAS parted ways and Kesha wound up reunited with Luke.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E
5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to walk out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E
