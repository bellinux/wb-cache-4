40|$|Abstract. For various {{problems}} in the procedure of high-power induction motor’s <b>starting</b> and disadvantages of traditional <b>starting</b> methods, this paper proposed {{a new type of}} full-voltage <b>starting</b> method of high-power induction motor—a full-voltage <b>starting</b> method with dynamic reactive power compensation, introduced its principle, studied the control strategy of full-voltage <b>starting</b> with dynamic var compensation emphatically, and established the simulation model for direct <b>starting,</b> soft <b>starting</b> and full-voltage <b>starting</b> with dynamic var compensation based on the Matlab/Simulink simulation software to do digital simulation and compared three methods. The simulation results indicated that the method proposed in this paper can make the high-power induction motor <b>start</b> fast and smoothly with both high-torque and low <b>starting</b> current, and it has a better <b>starting</b> performance than traditional <b>starting</b> methods and the advantage of not affecting power quality...|$|R
