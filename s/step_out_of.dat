5|$|In March 2016 Laurence Fox apologised for {{swearing}} at {{a member}} of the audience who had been muttering audibly in the front row during a performance of The Patriotic Traitor at London's Park Theatre on 8 March. The audience saw Fox <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
5|$|The boy's {{mother said}} that the video had helped him {{to deal with his}} depression. After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it when he felt distressed.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{performs}} {{further research}} on the adoption records and uncovers information on a third sister (Perkins), who is apparently troubled and homeless. With Starkey's help, Mulder canvases abandoned buildings in a desolate part of town. However, the Dark Figure finds and kills the girl. After finding Father Gregory at the scene, Mulder believes that {{he is responsible for}} the murders. Under questioning by Mulder and Scully, Father Gregory insists that he tried to protect the girls' souls from the Devil, and that the fourth girl must be located. While the agents <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the interrogation room, Starkey enters and demands to know the location of the fourth girl. When Gregory does not answer, he is burned alive by Starkey, who is revealed to be the Devil.|$|E

Proponents of SFBT suggest that such change often occurs when the therapist assists clients to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their usual problem-oriented thinking.|$|E

25|$|The entire losing team {{remains in}} the {{boardroom}} and are confronted with their loss. They are interrogated as to {{the reasons for their}} loss and which players contributed to it or failed at the task. Then, for the final stage of the boardroom meeting, the project manager is asked to select a certain number of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meeting. The remaining teammates return to the suite while the project manager and the selected teammates <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the boardroom momentarily so the host can consult with his advisors.|$|E
25|$|Giles played winter cricket in South Africa for Vredenberg & Saldanha (1992–95) and Avendale (1995–96). On 2 July 1998, Giles {{made his}} Test debut against South Africa, and took 1 for 106 in 36 overs. He {{then went on}} to tour Australia in the One Day squad. On 31 December, it was {{announced}} that Giles was to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the One Day match between the ODI squad and the Bradman XI, and into the Test squad for the final Test match in Sydney. He was chosen in light of Australia's selection of Shane Warne, Colin Miller and Stuart MacGill, England captain Alec Stewart stating that the selection of Giles gave England another option.|$|E
25|$|Veteran Mark Martin, {{coming off}} his final year with Roush Racing, was signed drive {{the car for}} 23 races (21 points races plus the Budweiser Shootout and Nextel All-Star Challenge) in 2007, with Joe Nemechek moving over to the team's new 13 team. Regan Smith was pinned to fill the {{remaining}} 16 races of the season, while driving in the Busch Series for the team as well. The team also {{changed its name to}} Ginn Racing to reflect Bobby Ginn's new majority interest in the team. Martin was leading in the final turn of the season-opening Daytona 500, after lining up on the final restart with former Roush teammates Greg Biffle and Matt Kenseth behind him. Coming down the front stretch, and with the field wrecking behind him, Martin looked to have finally come through at Daytona. But the caution was not called, and Kevin Harvick caught Martin on his outside, beating him to the line by two-hundredths of a second. Martin put together more strong finishes, and after the fourth race at Atlanta was leading the points standings in {{what was supposed to be}} his first season of semi-retirement. Resisting the chance to capture his first championship, Martin did <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car as scheduled, breaking a streak of 621 consecutive starts. In 24 starts for the team, Martin scored 11 top 10s, and finished 27th in points despite missing 12 races.|$|E

The arrest received national attention. When a police officer asked Gates to step outside, he replied, [...] "I'll speak to your mama outside," [...] which was parodied in [...] "The Stakeout" [...] when Dave asked Tom to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the van and he responded, [...] "I'll <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your mama's van!" ...|$|E

500|$|Balzac's use of repeat characters, {{moving in}} and out of the Comédies books, {{strengthens}} the realist representation. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes Rogers, [...] "they do not <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see". He also used a realist technique which French novelist Marcel Proust later termed [...] "retrospective illumination", whereby a character's past is revealed long after she or he first appears.|$|E
500|$|After {{the show}} ended, several media outlets {{reported}} that Madonna {{may have been}} drunk during the performance; however, Madonna blasted these reports, by responding: [...] "Thanks for supporting me. Too bad people don't know the art of acting and playing a character. I could never do any of my shows high or drunk. And yes underlying {{all of this is}} sexism and mysongony [...] which proves that not only do we not get equal pay but we are still treated like heretics if we <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> line and think outside the box!

500|$|In {{the bedroom}} scene, both the {{negative}} and positive actions of the Lady are motivated by her desire. Her feelings cause her to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the typical female role and into that of the male, thus becoming more empowered. At the same time, those same actions make the Lady appear adulterous; some scholars compare her with Eve in the Bible. By forcing Gawain to take her girdle, i.e. the apple, the pact made with Bertilak—and therefore the Green Knight—is broken. In this sense, {{it is clear that}} {{at the hands of the}} Lady, Gawain is a [...] "good man seduced".|$|E
500|$|Stanford put {{the game}} on ice in the fourth period when Pop {{introduced}} the bootlegger play, {{which was to be}} widely copied and still is in use. On the original bootlegger, Warner made use of Biff Hoffman's tremendous hands. Hoffman would take the pass from center and then fake to another back. Keeping the ball, he would hide it behind him and run as though he had given it to a teammate. Sometimes defensive players would <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Hoffman's path, thinking he was going to block. Hoffman [...] "bootlegged" [...] for the touchdown against California...|$|E
500|$|O'Hara {{recalled}} that Ford would {{allow her to}} improvise extensively during the filming, but was very much the boss, commenting that [...] "nobody dared <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> line, which gave the performers a sense of security". O'Hara became such good friends with Anna Lee during the shooting that she later named her daughter Bronwyn after Lee's character. The film was lauded by the critics, and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture. Both O'Hara and co-star Walter Pidgeon, who played the minister, were praised for their performances, with Variety writing that [...] "Maureen O'Hara splendid {{as the object of}} his unrequited love, who marries the mine owner's son out of pique".|$|E
