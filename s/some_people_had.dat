5|$|Principal {{photography}} lasted six months. It {{was mainly}} shot on a Los Angeles soundstage, but some second unit shooting {{was done in}} San Francisco, California. The film's many rooftop sequences were shot on the soundstage, with exteriors of San Francisco later greenscreened in. A behind-the-scenes feature shows {{that some of the}} roof scenes were shot in August 2002. The film employed over 400 people, and Wiseau is credited as an actor, an executive producer, the writer, producer, and director. Two others, Chloe Lietzke and Drew Caffrey, are credited as executive producers, but according to Sestero, Lietzke had no involvement in the film and Caffrey had died years prior to filming. Wiseau had a number of problems with his behind-the-camera team, and replaced the entire crew twice, though he later said that they were replaced four times. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> multiple jobs on the film; for example, in addition to playing the role of Mark, Sestero also worked as a line producer, assistant to Tommy Wiseau, and helped with casting. Wiseau frequently forgot his own lines or missed cues, requiring numerous retakes and on-set direction from the script supervisor; as a result, much of his dialogue had to be re-dubbed in post production.|$|E

25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} is a sense of the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality.

Most raids were reportedly connected with narcotics, not with terrorism, implying misuse of the new powers of emergency. Previously, as of May 2016, under the emergency law, house arrest had been imposed on 404 people, mostly Muslims of North African descent.

D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year, helped move Republican leadership. Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote. With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch, Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote. She received her commission on October 7. [...] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: [...] "That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> [...] I must be liberal.

500|$|Wipeout Pulse was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis).

According to Berry, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> felt that the previous game was too difficult; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence (AI) too advanced, whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted [...] "something more challenging to keep them coming back". The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition, which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure. In addition, the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time, in the event that they [...] "got stuck". Reflecting on this, Berry said: [...] "We want the people who buy it, to see all the game, {{we do not want to}} lock them out".|$|E
