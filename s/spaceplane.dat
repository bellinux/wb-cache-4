5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable <b>spaceplane</b> and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its <b>spaceplane</b> proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E
5|$|Its major {{components}} were a <b>spaceplane</b> orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E
5|$|Much of the UK's space {{industry}} is centred on EADS Astrium, based in Stevenage and Portsmouth. The company builds the buses – the underlying structure onto which the payload and propulsion systems are built – {{for most of}} the European Space Agency's spacecraft, as well as commercial satellites. The world leader in compact satellite systems, Surrey Satellites, is also part of Astrium. Reaction Engines Limited, the company planning to build Skylon, a single-stage-to-orbit <b>spaceplane</b> using their SABRE rocket engine, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system is based Culham.|$|E
50|$|Rocket-powered <b>spaceplanes</b> {{also face}} a {{significant}} thermal environment {{if they are}} burning for orbit, but this is nevertheless far less severe than air-breathing <b>spaceplanes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Company Bristol <b>Spaceplanes</b> has {{undertaken}} design and prototyping of three potential <b>spaceplanes</b> {{since its founding}} by David Ashford in 1991. The European Space Agency has endorsed these designs on several occasions.|$|R
50|$|All <b>spaceplanes</b> to date {{have used}} rocket engines with {{chemical}} fuels. As the orbital insertion burn {{has to be done}} in space, orbital <b>spaceplanes</b> require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight.|$|R

25|$|The HL-20 Personnel Launch System was a circa 1990 NASA <b>spaceplane</b> {{concept for}} manned orbital {{missions}} studied by NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. It was envisaged as a lifting body re-entry vehicle {{similar to the}} Soviet BOR-4 <b>spaceplane</b> design. Its stated goals were to achieve low operational costs, improved flight safety, and a possibility of landing on conventional runways. No flight hardware was built.|$|E
25|$|The X-37 lands {{automatically}} {{upon returning}} from orbit, {{and is the}} second reusable spacecraft {{to have such a}} capability, after the Soviet Buran shuttle. The X-37 is the smallest and lightest orbital <b>spaceplane</b> flown to date; it has a launch mass of around , and is approximately one quarter {{of the size of the}} Space Shuttle orbiter. In 2013, Guinness World Records recognised the X-37 as the world's smallest orbital <b>spaceplane.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{antecedents of}} the Dream Chaser in the U.S. {{go back to}} the mid-twentieth century X-20 Dyna-Soar concept of 1957 and the 1966 Northrop M2-F2 and Martin X-23 PRIME lifting bodies. Its design is derived from NASA's 1990 HL-20 lifting body design which was itself similar to the 1970s Soviet Spiral, which in turn was considered by NASA engineers as influenced by the late 1960s HL-10, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 military <b>spaceplane</b> concept, a <b>spaceplane</b> studied as a means to develop a Soviet counterpart to the US's X-20 Dyna-Soar.|$|E

25|$|In May 2016, {{the company}} halted {{development}} of the Lynx <b>spaceplane</b> and pivoted company focus toward development its LOX/LH2 engine technology, particularly on a funded project for United Launch Alliance. The company laid off more than 20 people of the 50–60 persons onboard prior to May.|$|E
25|$|Altitudes {{attained}} by X-15 aircraft {{fell short}} of those of Alan Shepard's and Gus Grissom's Project Mercury space capsules in 1961, or of any other manned spacecraft. However, the X-15 ranks supreme among manned rocket-powered aircraft, becoming the world's first operational <b>spaceplane</b> in the early 1960s.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} rocket-powered aircraft/spacecraft planes, the <b>spaceplanes,</b> that are {{designed}} to fly outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} many {{proposed}} methods for achieving orbital spaceflight that have the potential of being much more affordable than rockets. Some of these ideas such as the space elevator, and rotovator, require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Other proposed ideas include ground accelerators such as launch loops, rocket assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as Reaction Engines Skylon, scramjet powered <b>spaceplanes,</b> and RBCC powered <b>spaceplanes.</b> Gun launch has been proposed for cargo.|$|R

25|$|The {{first major}} film {{appearance}} of a representation of a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was 2006's Superman Returns.

25|$|Many ways {{to reach}} space other than rockets have been proposed.

Electromagnetic launchers such as launch loops might be feasible with current technology.

25|$|The Boeing X-37, {{also known}} as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), is a {{reusable}} uncrewed spacecraft. It is boosted into space by a launch vehicle, then re-enters Earth's atmosphere and lands as a <b>spaceplane.</b> The X-37 is operated by the United States Air Force for orbital spaceflight missions intended to demonstrate reusable space technologies. It is a 120%-scaled derivative of the earlier Boeing X-40.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{announced}} a funded study to investigate {{ways in which}} Europe might {{take advantage of the}} Dream Chaser crewed <b>spaceplane</b> technology. Named the DC4EU (Dream Chaser for European Utilization), the project will study using it for sending crews and cargo to the ISS and on missions not involving the ISS, particularly in orbits of substantially greater altitude than the ISS can reach.|$|E
25|$|The next crewed {{space program}} {{was even more}} ambitious and {{proposed}} in March 1986, as Astronautics plan 863-2. This consisted of a crewed spacecraft (Project 863-204) used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station (Project 863-205). Several <b>spaceplane</b> designs were rejected two years later and a simpler space capsule was chosen instead. Although the project did not achieve its goals, it would ultimately evolve into the 1992 Project 921.|$|E
