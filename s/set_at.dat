40|$|We analyze how unionized wage setting a¤ects the {{location}} of firms. We find {{that the degree of}} centralization (at firm or sectoral level) and regionalization (at regional or supra-regional level) is crucial. We show that wage <b>setting</b> <b>at</b> the firm level is the best policy to attract firms when trade costs are low, while wage <b>setting</b> <b>at</b> a more centralized level is most effective to attract firms when trade costs are high. Moreover, wage <b>setting</b> <b>at</b> the supra-regional level is beneficial for the already more agglomerated region and hurts the peripheral region. location, unions, regionalization, centralization...|$|R

5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were <b>set</b> <b>at</b> 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was <b>set</b> <b>at</b> 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E
