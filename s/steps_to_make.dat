5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided to take <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, {{under the protection of}} the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E

25|$|Chemists {{frequently}} {{refer to}} chemical compounds using chemical formulae or molecular {{structure of the}} compound. There has been a phenomenal {{growth in the number}} of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported in the scientific literature by professional chemists around the world. An enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million chemical compounds are known. The names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several international organizations like IUPAC and CAS have initiated <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as CAS registry number to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature (such as chemistry journals and patents). This information is compiled as a database and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are: SMILES and the International Chemical Identifier or InChI.|$|E

2500|$|In the April 21, 1947 {{issue of}} Time, Mark Woods called the Blue Network of 1942 (that is, {{just before the}} sale) [...] "a dump." [...] The article {{describes}} the then-116 station network {{as the home of}} cast-off speeches and classical music, which had only generated $14 million in revenue. [...] It could, perhaps, be argued that Woods was denigrating the state of the Blue Network at that time, to contrast with the relative success of the network later in the 1940s; this is possible {{in light of the fact}} that the Blue Network had been profitable in 1942. [...] Woods and the rest of the management team, after the sale to Noble, began to take <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Blue Network more competitive with NBC and CBS.|$|E
2500|$|Although cow's milk is {{the basis}} of almost all infant formula, plain cow's milk is unsuited for infants because of its high casein content and low whey content, and {{untreated}} cow's milk is not recommended before the age of 12 months. The infant intestine is not properly equipped to digest non-human milk, and this may often result in diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and malnutrition. [...] To reduce the negative effect on the infant's digestive system, cow's milk used for formula undergoes processing to be made into infant formula. This includes <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> protein more easily digestible and alter the whey-to-casein protein balance to one closer to human milk, the addition of several essential ingredients (often called [...] "fortification", see below), the partial or total replacement of dairy fat with fats of vegetable or marine origin, etc.|$|E

Other states, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, have attracted depositors seeking privacy and protection. Having taken <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its banks more attractive, Singapore strengthened penalties for violators of bank secrecy (and now imposes steeper fines and longer jail sentences for offenders), and modified its laws on trusts and inheritance. Nevertheless, this new model is being currently challenged by the OECD. Singapore is also now the location of Credit Suisse's international banking headquarters.

2500|$|Chancellor Corlew {{ruled in}} favor of the plaintiffs on May 29, 2012, finding that the county had not given {{adequate}} public notice to the planning commission's meeting. The ruling found that only about 196 copies of The Murfreesboro Post newspaper, in which the meeting was advertised, had been distributed in unincorporated areas of Rutherford County, where a third of the county's population lived. The county had also failed to advertise the meeting on its website or local cable channel, which officials acknowledged had been an oversight. Corlew stated in his opinion that because of the great public interest in the mosque, the county should have taken extra <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the public aware of the meeting.

2500|$|Social {{media can}} be a useful source of market {{information}} {{and a way to}} hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes; in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of market intelligence which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 [...] "bend test" [...] which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called [...] "bend gate" [...] controversy created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or [...] "real time" [...] information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.|$|E
2500|$|Once the war began, the Carter administration's {{policy was}} broadly neutral and {{included}} several actions that favored Iran, although these {{could also be}} seen as aimed primarily at preventing a wider war. While many U.S. officials were initially optimistic that limited Iraqi gains would force Iran to agree to an arms-for-hostages deal (this proved unnecessary because Iran purchased adequate arms and equipment from Syria, Libya, North Korea, the Soviet Union, and Israel), a consensus soon emerged that the war had disrupted whatever progress had been made during negotiations with Sadeq Tabatabaei. When Iraq unilaterally attempted to station MiG-23 aircraft, helicopters, and special forces in several Persian Gulf states to use for operations against Iran, [...] "most made frantic attempts to dissuade the Iraqi aircraft from landing; Bahrain even physically blockaded its runways." [...] The Iraqi presence was initially tolerated in Oman (Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said [...] "had been a close friend of the Shah and was probably convinced by Saddam that one decisive attack could bring the revolution down") and Ras al-Khaimah (which had designs on an island the Shah had seized from the United Arab Emirates in 1971), but U.S. officials were [...] "horrified" [...] by the prospect of a regional war, and [...] "after a series of telephone conversations between the White House, Sultan Qaboos, and Sheik Saqr, the Iraqis were swiftly sent on their way." [...] Likewise, when King Hussein informed [...] "U.S. ambassador to Jordan" [...] Nick Veliotes that Iraq was considering the annexation of Khuzestan Province, Veliotes stated: [...] "The U.S. was unalterably opposed to any efforts to dismember Iran." [...] On October 3, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski advised Carter that [...] "we should actively seek new contacts with Iran to explore the possibility of helping it just enough to put sufficient pressure on Iraq to pull back from most, if not all, its current acquisitions," [...] citing the need [...] "to safeguard Iran from Soviet penetration or internal disintegration." [...] The U.S. even tried, unsuccessfully, to stop the flow of weapons from Jordan to Iraq—prompting [...] "Saddam to claim in December that it was supporting 'Iran's [...] "aggression" [...] against Iraq.'" [...] Despite this, the U.S. tolerated the provision of weapons and intelligence from Egypt to Iraq, in exchange for Iraq's assistance in ending the diplomatic isolation Egypt had endured {{as a result of its}} Peace Treaty with Israel. In addition, the U.S. [...] "took active <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that Iraq's ability to export [...] through the Gulf was unimpaired and could be quickly restored after the cessation of hostilities, primarily by expediting the purchase and early placement of single point mooring buoys," [...] although this [...] "had only limited effect, given the scale of Iranian retaliatory strikes."
