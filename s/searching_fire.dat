6000|$|Miss Greenfield's {{turn for}} singing now came, {{and there was}} {{profound}} attention. Her voice, with its keen, <b>searching</b> <b>fire,</b> its penetrating vibrant quality, its [...] "timbre" [...] as the French have it, cut its way like a Damascus blade to the heart. It was the more touching from occasional rusticities and artistic defects, which showed that she had received no culture from art.|$|E
6000|$|... 236. The feeling which, in the {{foregoing}} {{notes on the}} pictures that entertained my vacation, I endeavored to illustrate as dominant over early Pre-Raphaelite work, is very far from being new in the world. Demonstrations in support of fact against fancy have been periodical motives of earthquake and heartquake, under the two rigidly incumbent burdens of drifted tradition, which, {{throughout the history of}} humanity, during phases of languid thought, cover the vaults of <b>searching</b> <b>fire</b> that must at last try every man's work, what it is.|$|E
60|$|With {{the coming}} of the light the 53rd Field Battery, the one which had already done so admirably at Lombard's Kop, again {{deserved}} well of its country. It was impossible to get behind the Boers and fire straight at their position, so every shell fired had to skim over the heads of our own men upon the ridge and so pitch upon the reverse slope. Yet so accurate was the fire, carried on under an incessant rain of shells from the big Dutch gun on Bulwana, that not one shot miscarried and that Major Abdy and his men succeeded in sweeping the further slope without loss to our own fighting line. Exactly the same feat was equally well performed {{at the other end of}} the position by Major Blewitt's 21st Battery, which was exposed to an even more <b>searching</b> <b>fire</b> than the 53rd. Any one who has seen the iron endurance of British gunners and marvelled at the answering shot which flashes out through the very dust of the enemy's exploding shell, will understand how fine must have been the spectacle of these two batteries working in the open, with the ground round them sharded with splinters. Eye-witnesses have left it upon record that the sight of Major Blewitt strolling up and down among his guns, and turning over with his toe the last fallen section of iron, was one of the most vivid and stirring impressions which they carried from the fight. Here also it was that the gallant Sergeant Bosley, his arm and his leg stricken off by a Boer shell, cried to his comrades to roll his body off the trail and go on working the gun.|$|E

5000|$|According to Burton [...] {{the system}} of {{fortification}} lacked the latest developments, mostly using the obsolete en barbette system which failed to protect the defending artillerymen. The consequence: Thus the works were utterly unfit to resist the developed powers of rifled artillery, the concentrated discharge from shipping, and even the accurate and <b>searching</b> <b>fire</b> of the Spencer carbine. The Londres work, besides being {{in a state of}} decay, was an exposed mass of masonry which ought to have shared the fate of forts from Sumpter to Pulaski, and when granite fails bricks cannot hope to succeed. Had the guns been mounted in Monitor towers, or even protected by sand-bags, the ironclads would have suffered much more than they did in running past them.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} to model a tank versus tank battle {{scenario in which}} the defender is provided an armed helicopter unit support, against surprise advance of the attacker towards an important place. The stochastic and dynamic nature of the battle system has been handled by means of Monte Carlo simulation. In that activities like move, <b>search,</b> <b>fire,</b> hit and kill are simulated and their effects generated in the model. The game has been repeated for parameters relating to (i) fire power (ii) mobility (iii) intervisibility (iv) blind shooting (v) defender/attacker force ratio and (vi) helicopter unit support with the defender. Then, average numerical effects in each case have been analysed. Although the results are based on tentative data, the. trend {{seems to suggest that}} a battalion of Centurion tanks or 2 coys with a helicopter unit support stand fairly good chance to defeat the attack by M- 47 / 48 tanks equivalent to 4 coys. Neyertheless, the methodology provides an effective basis to systematically approach realistic situations and quantitatively assess weapon systems effectiveness under tactical alternatives and battle field environments. </p...|$|R
