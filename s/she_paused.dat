25|$|Before 1898, {{devotion to}} the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem {{encountered}} Jesus along the Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> to wipe the sweat from Jesus's face with her veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.|$|E
25|$|On 23 April 1945, John W. Brown left in convoy with {{a load of}} U.S. Army {{general cargo}} below and trucks lashed to her decks to begin her seventh voyage. The convoy {{encountered}} bad weather but no enemy forces while crossing the North Atlantic and arrived off The Downs on the southeast coast of England on V-E Day, 8 May 1945. She then proceeded to Antwerp, Belgium, where she discharged her cargo. Departing on 19 May, she arrived at Le Havre, France, on 22 May. There she embarked 31 U.S. Army officers and 321 U.S. Army enlisted men, some of them liberated prisoners-of-war, and departed on 24 May. <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> in The Solent for two days, then got back underway on 27 May in convoy for the United States, the convoy burning its running lights at night {{for the first time}} since the beginning of the war. The convoy arrived at New York on 11 June 1945.|$|E
25|$|She {{spent the}} rest of 1979 and {{the first two weeks of}} 1980 in port engaged in post-deployment leave and upkeep. The ship resumed normal {{operations}} on 14 January when she put to sea to participate in READEX 1-80. En route to Puerto Rico, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> at Onslow Beach for four days from 15 to 19 January to allow reservists to train in LVT operations. Underway again on 20 January, she proceeded to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, where she arrived four days later. Barnstable County spent the night of 24 January in port after loading four drones and proceeded the next day to the Mobil Sea Range, near the Bahamas. Upon successfully launching and completing the portion of an air exercise, she returned to Roosevelt Roads to unload the drone launching equipment and refuel before get underway for Freeport in the Bahamas for a five-day liberty call at the beginning of February. The ship returned to Little Creek on 14 February. There, she spent the next 12 days preparing to be visited by a board of inspection and survey. She got underway briefly on 28 and 29 February to load ammunition. Back at Little Creek on 1 March, she completed her preparations for the inspection only to have it canceled by record snow storms. The ship remained busy, however, getting ready to deploy overseas.|$|E

500|$|After the United States {{joined the}} Allies, Yorktown {{operated}} {{off the coast}} of Mexico until August 1917, when <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, Yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on Clipperton Island. [...] From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. [...] After her time off the Mexican coast, Yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, Yorktown, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax, soon there after before returning to New York. She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California.|$|E
500|$|Harding went to {{bed early}} in the evening of July 27, 1923. Later that night, he called for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> to plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and she raced to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
2500|$|Pirro was {{considered}} the front-runner, but her campaign had immediate difficulties. [...] During her August 10, 2005 live televised candidacy announcement in New York City, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> for more than thirty seconds looking for a missing part of her speech, then asked, on the air, [...] "Do I have page 10?" [...] Democrats re-aired the sequence {{as part of a}} Jeopardy! theme parody. [...] The Conservative Party of New York was also reluctant to embrace Pirro. [...] On August 18, 2005, another Republican candidate, former Mayor of Yonkers John Spencer, gave a radio interview in which he attacked Pirro, calling her chances of winning the Conservative Party of New York State nomination [...] "a Chinaman's chance." [...] Spencer later apologized.|$|E

2500|$|Tumult got {{underway}} {{again on}} the 20th and set her course for the Panama Canal and the Pacific. Early in June, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> briefly at Manzanillo, Mexico, to obtain emergency medical aid for a member of her crew and then continued on to San Diego, California. Provisioning, exercises, and repairs there occupied the remainder of June and most of July. On 21 July, the minesweeper got underway for San Francisco where she remained throughout most of August. On the 28th, she finally set course for the Pacific war zone, escorting a convoy of vulnerable, slow-moving, cargo vessels which pulled a section of portable dock [...] Tumult spent the entire month of September shepherding these awkward charges across the Pacific. On 2 October, having safely delivered the convoy, Tumult anchored at Espiritu Santo.|$|E

During this deployment, Somers returned to the Gulf of Tonkin alternately plane guarding Hancock and serving on the gunline.

[...] After that, she returned to plane guard duties, this time for [...] Two days after joining the carrier, however, Somers was detached to return to Subic Bay.
