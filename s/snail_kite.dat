5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered <b>snail</b> <b>kite.</b> The Everglades <b>snail</b> <b>kite</b> eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the <b>snail</b> <b>kite</b> received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E
25|$|Birds: bald eagle, {{northern}} caracara, <b>snail</b> <b>kite,</b> osprey, {{white and}} brown pelicans, sea gulls, whooping and sandhill cranes, roseate spoonbill, Florida scrub jay (state endemic), and others. One subspecies of wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, namely subspecies osceola, is {{found only in}} the state of Florida. The state is a wintering location for many species of eastern North American birds.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, in Cooper's hawks, female {{desertion}} of offspring {{has been}} found to be closely related to both the likelihood of offspring survival and future reproductive success. Females in weak physical condition are more likely to abandon offspring to complete migration, increasing breeding chances and opportunities for the following year. In mammals, aardwolves have been shown to practice male mate desertion in response to female promiscuity. Lastly, ambisexual mate desertion, in which both sexes desert at nearly equal frequencies, has been observed in <b>snail</b> <b>kites.</b> Mate desertion by either sex depends on food supply, in that <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> are more likely to desert when snails are abundant and rate of nesting success is high. Thus, mating strategies exhibited by <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> are somewhat plastic, depending on varying environmental conditions.|$|R
40|$|While {{variation}} in age structure {{over time and}} space has long been considered important for population dynamics and conservation, reliable estimates of such spatio-temporal {{variation in}} age structure have been elusive for wild vertebrate populations. This limitation has arisen because of problems of imperfect detection, the potential for temporary emigration impacting assessments of age structure, and limited information on age. However, identifying patterns in age structure is important for making reliable predictions of both short- and long-term dynamics of populations of conservation concern. Using a multistate superpopulation estimator, we estimated region-specific abundance and age structure (the proportion of individuals within each age class) of a highly endangered population of <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> for two separate regions in Florida over 17 years (1997 - 2013). We find that in the southern region of the snail kite-a region known to be critical for the long-term persistence of the species-the population has declined significantly since 1997, and during this time, it has increasingly become dominated by older <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> (> 12 years old). In contrast, in the northern region-a region historically thought to serve primarily as drought refugia-the population has increased significantly since 2007 and age structure is more evenly distributed among age classes. Given that <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> show senescence at approximately 13 years of age, where individuals suffer higher mortality rates and lower breeding rates, these results reveal an alarming trend for the southern region. Our work illustrates the importance of accounting for spatial structure when assessing changes in abundance and age distribution {{and the need for}} monitoring of age structure in imperiled species...|$|R
25|$|Limpkins are {{reported}} to be attacked and eaten by American alligators. There are also reports of adults with serious foot and leg injuries, suggesting {{that they may have}} been attacked by turtles while standing on floating vegetation. Their nests are apparently predated by snakes, raccoons, crows and muskrats. Foraging adults may in times of drought be victims of kleptoparasitism by <b>snail</b> <b>kites,</b> and the attempted theft of apple snails caught by limpkins has also been observed in boat-tailed grackles.|$|R
500|$|Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are {{salt water}} marshes that absorb marine water {{when it gets}} high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during {{hurricane}} and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. [...] Animal life in this zone is dependent upon {{the amount of water}} present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades <b>snail</b> <b>kite</b> (Rostrhamus sociabilis), [...] wood stork (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.|$|E
500|$|For example, Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) [...] are an amphibious {{fresh water}} mollusk. They {{have a single}} gill and lung, and live on stalks of sawgrass in water depths no more than [...] They are the primary food of the {{endangered}} Everglades <b>snail</b> <b>kite</b> (Rostrhamus sociabilis) and limpkin (Aramus guarauna) {{as well as the}} raccoon, otter, and young alligator. Apple snails lay their eggs on sawgrass stalks about [...] above the water line, and they are intolerant of being submerged for long periods of time. When the eggs hatch, young snails must enter the water quickly or face death. When water levels are too low or rise too quickly while snail eggs are developing, apple snails do not flourish, affecting the many reptiles, mammals, and birds that feed on them. With regard to the ecology of trophic dynamics, or food chains, the 174species of invertebrates {{play a vital role in}} the Everglades. Crayfish, insects, scorpions, and other invertebrates also support a web of animals.|$|E
500|$|In September 2008 the National Research Council (NRC), {{a nonprofit}} agency {{providing}} science and policy {{advice to the}} federal government, submitted {{a report on the}} progress of CERP. The report noted [...] "scant progress" [...] in restoration because of problems in budgeting, planning, and bureaucracy. The NRC report called the Everglades one of the [...] "world's treasured ecosystems" [...] that is being further endangered by lack of progress: [...] "Ongoing delay in Everglades restoration has not only postponed improvements—it has allowed ecological decline to continue". It cited the shrinking tree islands, and the negative population growth of the endangered Rostrhamus sociabilis or Everglades <b>snail</b> <b>kite,</b> and Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow. The lack of water reaching Everglades National Park was characterized as [...] "one of the most discouraging stories" [...] in implementation of the plan. The NRC recommended improving planning on the state and federal levels, evaluating each CERP project annually, and further acquisition of land for restoration. Everglades restoration was earmarked $96 million in federal funds as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 with the intention of providing civil service and construction jobs while simultaneously implementing the legislated repair projects.|$|E
25|$|Limpkins in Florida were {{examined}} for parasites, which included trematodes, nematodes and biting lice. Two biting lice species were found, Laemobothrion cubense and Rallicola funebris. The trematode Prionosoma serratum {{was found in}} the intestines of some birds, this species may enter the bird after first infecting apple snails (this {{has been shown to be}} the route of infection for a closely related trematode to infect <b>snail</b> <b>kites).</b> Nematodes Amidostomum acutum and Strongyloides sp. are also ingested and live in the gut.|$|R

5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> and apple <b>snails,</b> do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|R

5000|$|Environmental groups {{argue that}} the {{extension}} of SR 7 {{just west of the}} Grassy Waters environmental preserve in Palm Beach County, also the source of the drinking water supply for the West Palm Beach region, threatens to damage critical habitat for several endangered species including the Everglades <b>Snail</b> <b>Kite.</b> As of 2005, only about 1,300 of the hawks were known to still be extant.Because of the potential impact on nesting Snail Kites and their habitat,The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been urging the Florida Department of Transportation, since 2005, to reconsider the road placement through Grassy Waters Preserve. In its Biological Opinion issued on 13 November 2014, the USFWS stated [...] "While the Service finds the project is unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of the Everglade <b>snail</b> <b>kite,</b> based on the current small size of the <b>snail</b> <b>kite</b> population and the unknown, and potentially significant, effects of the project on the Everglade <b>snail</b> <b>kite,</b> the Service continues to urge the FDOT to eliminate the proposed corridor for the project and either adopt the “no build” alternative for the proposed roadway extension, or choose an alternative that does not impact the PCNA or GWP - such as an alignment west of the Ibis development." [...] The Audubon Society lists the <b>Snail</b> <b>Kite</b> population as being in trouble since much of its habitat has been drained and remaining parts inundated to improper water levels needed to sustain the Apple snails on which it feeds. The SR7 expansion will exacerbate both issues by destroying habitat and changing water levels in the habitat bordering the road.|$|E

40|$|This {{appendix}} is {{an update}} to {{a risk assessment}} of methylmercury (MeHg) exposure to birds foraging at Stormwater Treatment Area 2 (STA- 2) that was completed in 2004. The previous assessment was required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection as a special condition to a modification to Everglades Forever Act permit 0126704. This update was requested by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) through the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to supplement information provided in the permit application {{for the expansion of}} STA- 2 and STA- 5. Specifically, the USFWS requested (1) an update of the assessment for bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) foraging at STA- 2 to reflect new data on mercury levels in fish collected in 2004; (2) a new assessment for adult wood storks (Mycteria americana) foraging at STA- 2; and (3) a scoping-level assessment for <b>snail</b> <b>kites</b> (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) foraging at STA- 2, using data currently available. In addition to assessing current risk, {{attempts have been made to}} extrapolate and forecast future risk, if these receptors were foraging in the expanded area of Cell 4, as currently proposed. Exposure models were based on literature-derived life history parameters combined with site-specific, measured mercury burdens in fish collected under the permit-mandated monitoring program. Monte Carlo simulations were used to incorporate quantifiable uncertainty and to capture the combination of possible factors leading to worst case exposures. The likelihood that these simulated exposures would be harmful to these birds was then assessed based on the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level and a derived, no-observed-adverse-effect level taken from the peer-reviewed literature. The results of this risk assessment indicated a low likelihood that MeHg exposures to birds foraging currently at STA- 2 would exceed effects thresholds. This places these birds in a low ris...|$|R
50|$|The Accipitridae are {{a diverse}} {{family with a}} great deal of {{variation}} in size and shape. They range in size from the tiny pearl kite (Gampsonyx swainsonii) and little sparrowhawk (Accipiter minullus), both of which are 23 cm (9 in) in length and weigh about 85 g (3 oz), to the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), which measures up to 120 cm (47 in) and weighs up to 14 kg (31 lbs). Wingspan can vary from 39 cm in the little sparrowhawk to more than 300 cm in the cinereous and Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis). In these extreme species, wing chord length can range from 113 to 890 mm and culmen length from 11 to 88 mm. Until the 14th century, even these huge vultures were surpassed by the extinct Haast's eagle (Harpagornis moorei) of New Zealand, which is estimated to have measured up to 140 cm (55 in) and to have weighed 15 to 16.5 kg in the largest females. In terms of body mass, the Accipitridae are the most diverse family of birds and may also be in terms of some aspects of linear size diversity, although lag behind the true parrots and pheasant family in length diversity. Most accipitrids exhibit sexual dimorphism in size, although, unusually for birds, it is the females that are larger than the males. This sexual difference in size is most pronounced in active species that hunt birds, such as the Accipiter hawks, in which the size difference averages 25-50%. In a majority of species, such as generalist hunters and rodent-, reptile-, fish-, and insect-hunting specialists, the dimorphism is less, usually between a 5% to 30% size difference. In the carrion-eating Old World vultures and <b>snail</b> eating <b>kites,</b> the difference is almost non-existent.|$|R
