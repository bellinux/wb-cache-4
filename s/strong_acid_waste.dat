40|$|Photographic {{flights were}} made over an ocean <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> dump site while dumping was in progress. The flights {{resulted}} in wide angle, broadband, spectral radiance film exposure data between the wavelengths of 500 to 900 nanometers for sun elevation angles ranging from 26 to 42 degrees. It is shown from densitometer data that the spectral signature of <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> discharged into ocean {{water can be}} observed photographically, the influence of sun elevation upon remotely sensed apparent color can be normalized by using a single spectral band ratioing technique, and photographic quantification and mapping of <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> through its suspended iron precipitate appears possible...|$|R
40|$|A {{remote sensing}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the industrial <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> ocean dump site located approximately 38 n mi SE of Cape Henlopen, Delaware, {{to see if there}} was a relationship between aircraft remotely sensed spectral signatures and the iron concentration measured in the plume. Results are presented which show that aircraft remotely sensed spectral data can be used to quantify and map an <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> dump in terms of its particulate iron concentration. A single variable equation using the ratio of band 2 (440 - 490 nm) radiance to band 4 (540 - 580 nm) radiance was used to quantify the acid plume and the surrounding water. The <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> varied in age from freshly dumped to 3 1 / 2 hours old. Particulate iron concentrations in the <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> were estimated to range up to 1. 1 mg/liter at the 0. 46 meter depth. A classification technique was developed to remove sunglitter-affected pixels from the data set...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{laboratory}} transmission and remotely sensed ocean upwelled spectral signatures of <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> ocean water solutions are presented. The studies {{were performed to}} establish ocean-dumped <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> spectral signatures and to relate them to chemical and physical interactions occurring in the dump plume. The remotely sensed field measurements and the laboratory measurements were made using the same rapid-scanning spectrometer viewing a dump plume and with actual <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> and ocean water samples, respectively. Laboratory studies showed that the signatures were produced by soluble ferric iron being precipitated in situ as ferric hydroxide upon dilution with ocean water. Sea-truth water samples were taken and analyzed for pertinent major components of the <b>acid</b> <b>waste.</b> Relationships were developed between the field and laboratory data both for spectral signatures and color changes with concentration. The relationships allow for the estimation of concentration of the indicator iron from remotely sensed spectral data and the laboratory transmission concentration data without sea-truth samples...|$|R

25|$|In a <b>strong</b> <b>acid,</b> {{equilibrium}} lies {{far to the}} right, {{meaning that}} almost all of the original HA is dissociated at equilibrium. A <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> yields a weak conjugate base (A−), so a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> is also described as an acid whose conjugate base is a much weaker base than water.|$|R
40|$|Results {{of field}} {{experiments}} {{conducted in the}} Atlantic Coastal Zone indicate that plumes resulting from ocean dumping of <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> and sewage sludge have distinguishable spectral characteristics when the radiance of the pollutant is normalized (ratioed to) background ocean water. <b>Acid</b> <b>waste</b> spectra peak between 550 - 650 nm while sewage sludge spectra have peak values at wavelengths of about 700 nm or greater. Results indicate that identification of <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> and sewage sludge plumes may be independent of geographical location in the Atlantic Coastal Zone. Radiance ratio curves obtained in the laboratory qualitatively agree with those obtained from field experiments. Results from the July 25, 1977, Galveston Deep Ocean Dump Site experiment show the radiance ratio curve of the biodigested industrial waste to be fairly flat and similar to the radiance ratio curves of sewage sludge line dumps and sewage sludge spot dumps {{that have been in}} the water for several hours...|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} {{sulfonic}} acids, TsOH is a <b>strong</b> organic <b>acid.</b> It {{is about one}} million times <b>stronger</b> than benzoic <b>acid.</b> It {{is one of the}} few <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> that is solid and, hence, conveniently weighed.

40|$|Spectral {{signatures}} of suspended {{matter in the}} ocean are being extracted through characteristic vector analysis of remote ocean color data collected with MOCS (Multichannel Ocean Color Sensor). Spectral signatures appear to be obtainable through analyses of 'linear' clusters that appear on scatter diagrams associated with eigenvectors. Signatures associated with <b>acid</b> <b>waste,</b> sewage sludge, oil, and algae are presented. The application of vector analysis to two <b>acid</b> <b>waste</b> dumps overflown two years apart is examined in some detail.

25|$|The {{strength}} of an acid refers to its ability or tendency {{to lose a}} proton (H+). A <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent).

Examples of <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
