5000|$|Low-alloy <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>steel</b> is a {{grade of}} tool steel {{characterized}} by its proportion of iron to other elements, the kind of elements in its composition, and its treatment during the manufacturing process. The three ASTM established grades of low-alloy <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>steel</b> are L2, L3, and L6. [...] This grade originally contained L1, L4, L5 and L7 as well as three F grades (F1, F2, and F3) but because of falling demand only grades L2 and L6 remain in production.|$|E

50|$|SAIL's Rourkela Steel Plant is {{a unique}} unit under SAIL {{with a wide variety}} of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>steels.</b> The use of its {{products}} abound. Its HR coils find application in manufacturing LPG cylinders, automobiles, railway wagon chassis and other high-strength type steels. It is SAIL’s only plant that produces silicon steels for the power sector, high quality pipes for the oil and gas sector and tin plates for the packaging industry. Its wide and sophisticated product range includes flat, tubular and coated products. Special Plate Plant, Rourkela, is emerging as a major special steels centre for defence equipment. It produces armoured plate for the T-90 and Arjun (tank), and the BMP-2 infantry combat vehicle, which are built at Avadi and Medak respectively by the Ordnance Factory Board. Its annual capacity of 2,000 tonnes is being upped to 12,000 tonnes. The AB/A grade steel used in making India's first fully home made Aircraft carrier INS Vikrant (2013) were produced in Rourkela Steel Plant.|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how state governments in the sixteen southern states employ <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities for financial management, their characteristics, and how they fit into state debt management. The study analyzes the characteristics of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities: the formal differences between subsets of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities and their functions and uses. The findings indicate that the formal differences between subsets of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities support the theoretical concept that public authorities, government corporations, and special districts underlie the conceptual entity {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entity. The analysis supports the findings that the formal differences between public authorities, government corporations, and special authorities include the ability to control the amount of information reported to the state government, the financial aspects that each entity possesses, and the ability to issue debt in the market place. ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> {{entities}} {{were used}} {{for more than just}} circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|R

5000|$|Following Russia's 2011 police reform, Russian OMON {{units were}} to be renamed Distinctive Purpose Teams (KON), while OMSN (SOBR) would become <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> Teams (KSN). It was {{announced}} that <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> Centers for Rapid Deployment forces would also be created in Russian regions, to include regional OMON and OMSN units. In essence, all police spetsnaz (special designation) units were brought together under the joint command of the Interior Ministry — the Center for Operational Spetsnaz and Aviation Forces of MVD (Центр специального назначения сил оперативного реагирования и авиации МВД России). In January 2012, Russia's OMON was renamed from Otryad Militsii Osobogo Naznacheniya, (<b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> Militia Unit) to Otryad Mobilniy Osobogo Naznacheniya (<b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> Mobile Unit), keeping the acronym.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the ordinary corporate income tax, <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> taxes are sometimes levied to extract abnormal profits arising {{from the use of}} natural resources. Such dual tax regimes exist in Norway for oil and hydropower, where the corresponding <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax bases are unaffected by any derivatives payments. Dual tax firms with hedging programs therefore face the risk of potentially large discrepancies between the tax bases for corporate income tax and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax. I investigate how this tax base asymmetry influences the extent of hedging of value-maximizing firms facing hedgeable as well as unhedgeable risk. Dual tax firms facing deadweight costs in low-profit events generally demand less hedging than ordinary firms, but otherwise respond similarly to characteristics of the underlying risk exposures. The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax does not influence firms' hedge portfolios in the absence of deadweight cost.
