The intermediaries (e. g., distributors, wholesalers, retailers) constituting marketing channels perform specific distribution functions,such as transportation, storage, <b>sales,</b> <b>financing,</b> and relationship building, better than most manufacturers. Over his distinguished career, Louis P. Bucklin investigated many questions about the structuring and functioning of marketing channels using conceptual, empirical, and microeconomics model-based methodologies. Today, the academic marketing literature contains hundreds of articles that have employed these three broad classes of methodologies to investigate issues of channel intermediaries´ interorganizational relationships, for example, power-dependence, relational outcomes, conflict and negotiations, and manufacturing firms´ channel strategy, for example, channel structure, selection, coordination and control. So far, however, there has been no review of how the three different methodologies have contributed to advancing knowledge across this set of channels research domains...|$|E

To issue DR (deposit receipt of stock) in overseas did not restrict the holding limitation of foreigners; it also has the advantage of getting the domestic premium in Korea. So it is considered to be the principal method of the overseas sale of the state-owned enterprises. The result of this thesis shows that, generally speaking, the recent issue of the DR of state-owned enterprises is successful as a blueprint of privatization.

This CASE/ERP's main modules, which based on ERP theory. The thesis specifies every module's actual business requirements, business data flow, database structure, and main function design. CASE/ERP is a software package for the enterprise's management. It includes almost every aspects of the enterprise. The main modules of CASE/ERP are purchase, inventory, sale, distribution, transportation, general ledger, financial table, accounts receivable, account payable, budget, fixed assets, salary, cost, production data, master production scheduling, material requirements planning, capacity requirements planning, workshop control, just in time production, human resource, facilities, quality control, business forecast and policy decision etc. CASE/ERP is essentially different from the single module development software. Its modules are highly integrates, one module's data can be shared with another. High integration bring more difficulties to the software design and implementation. The modules of CASE/ERP are related with database. We design the databases according to the principle of 'one thing one database'. We describe almost every attributes of an entity in one database. Then along with the business process flow, we design the correlation functions (using by different department) to update some attributes of the entity. The system design of CASE/ERP has three main lines, they are purchase-sale-inventory, manufacture and finance. The business within each main line is relatively tight connection. And we establish relationships between main lines by common database. The module providing the data, writes the information into the common databases. The module using the data, reads the information from the common databases. The thesis introduces the design and implementation process of CASE/ERP's material, manufacture, <b>sales,</b> <b>financing,</b> and cost. The content of each chapter and the relationship between them are specified as follows: The material system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as purchase requirement, purchase order, goods receiving, and the inventory business. The main function of this system includes collecting the requirements of material from the material requirements and inventory reordering planning; referring to the vendor's status and the material's purchase lot policy and lead time to make purchase orders; checking and accepting purchase material; registering warehouse account; distributing material in warehouse, recording each inventory operation information such as material in, out, moving, and taking stock. The manufacture system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as production data, MPS (master production scheduling), MRP (material requirements planning), CRP (capacity requirements planning), workshop control and JIT (just in time production) etc. The main functions of this system are: recording production data, such as product structure, working center and manufacture routing etc.; working out master production scheduling according to the customer order and sales forecast; calculating the need quantity and need time of the material for manufacture, working out the material requirements planning; comparing the working load and the capability of working center in a period of time, working out the capacity requirements planning; arranging the production mission of workshop and production line. The sales system of CASE/ERP deals with sales planning, sales order, goods delivering, and sales invoice. Sales order is the center of the sales business. The main functions of this system are: referring to the yearly production planning to work out the products sales planning; recording the customers' orders; making out the shipment sheet, recording the actual shipment information; making out the sales invoice and notifying the financial department to settle the account receivable. The financing system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as general ledger, cash control, financial table, accounts payable, account receivable, etc. The financing system controls all the enterprise's economical activities, account the enterprise's current assets and fixed assets and liabilities and owner's equity. The main functions of this system are: applying for reimbursement; checking the account of cash in bank; defining and printing financial table; settling the account payable for purchase goods; settling the account receivable for sale products. The cost system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as standard cost calculate, actual cost calculate, cost planning. The cost system distributes the direct materials and the direct labor and manufacturing expenses to the products, and calculates the actuarial cost for each product. Cost system compares the actuarial cost with the planning cost and the standard cost. Through the comparison, we can analyze whether the actuarial cost structure is right, and find the right way to reduce production costs. CASE/ERP conforms to the method provided by software engineering during the development process. By reason of the limit of pages, the thesis only specifies main module's design and implementation process, and only describes some main database structures and main programs flow charts. At present, CASE/ERP has already been successfully used in some large enterprises. It brings many benefits for enterprise's management...|$|E
