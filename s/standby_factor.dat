40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} improve availability by testing redundant parts at pre-determined intervals. The purpose of the testing is to detect nonfunctional back-up equipment and develop work-around measures or replacement spacecraft before {{a failure of the}} primary equipment reduces availability. The work reported here is an outgrowth of the NASA Space Network's program for the maintenance and replenishment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. The approach is based on a <b>standby</b> <b>factor</b> and a cyclic stress factor. The <b>standby</b> <b>factor</b> accounts for the effects of adverse storage conditions encountered as part of the in-flight environment. The stress factor accounts for the effects of physical or thermal cycling due to the application of force or power that characterizes the operation or use of a component. By the quantitative consideration of standby and cycling risks, a regular testing interval can be calculated - an interval for testing that furnishes information for availability planning but does not subject the spacecraft to undue risk. This paper includes quantitative solutions for appropriate testing intervals for equipment configurations and failure rates that are representative of a Tracking and Relay Data Satellite. The effect of a single test on the availability of certain equipment is also illustrated...|$|E

40|$|System {{characteristics}} of a repairable system are studied from a Bayesian viewpoint with different types of priors assumed for unknown parameters, in which the system consists of one active component and one standby component. The detection of <b>standby,</b> the coverage <b>factor</b> and reboot delay of failed components are possibly considered. Time to failure of the components is assumed to follow exponential distribution. Time to repair and time to reboot of the failed components also follow exponential distributions. When time to failure, time to repair and time to reboot have uncertain parameters, a Bayesian approach is adopted to evaluate system characteristics. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to derive the posterior distribution for the mean time to system failure and the steady-state availability. Some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the results derived in this paper. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{unavailability}} of standby {{safety system}} components due to failures in {{nuclear power plants}} is considered to involve a time independent and a time dependent part. The former relates to the component`s unavailability from demand stresses due to usage, and the latter represents the component`s unavailability due to standby time stresses related to the environment. In this paper, data from the nuclear plant reliability data system (NPRDS) were used to partition the component`s unavailability into the contributions from standby time stress (i. e., due to environmental factors) and demand stress (i. e., due to usage). Analyses are presented of motor operated valves (MOVs), motor driven pumps (MDPs), and turbine driven pumps (FDPs). MOVs fail predominantly (approx. 78 %) from environmental <b>factors</b> (<b>standby</b> time stress failures). MDPs fail slightly more frequently from demand stresses (approx. 63 %) than standby time stresses, while TDPs fail predominantly from standby time stresses (approx. 78 %). Such partitions of component unavailability have many uses in risk informed and performance based regulation relating to modifications to Technical Specification, in-service testing, precise determination of dominant accident sequences, and implementation of maintenance rules...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, the {{residential}} sector {{is a substantial}} energy consumer mainly due {{to the requirements of}} space heating and cooling, lighting and electronic appliances in the building. In Australia, {{the residential}} sector accounts for a significant proportion of final energy consumption, with a significant proportion of this energy attributed to space conditioning. Appliances including lighting, refrigeration, water heating, cooking and <b>standby</b> power also <b>factoring</b> into the energy used in Australian households. In response to sharp rises in energy prices in recent years, many households are taking steps to reduce their energy consumption. Many are investing in energy efficient appliances, home upgrades, installing rooftop solar panels, etc. However, low income can become a barrier, preventing many people from investing in energy efficiency as a way of reducing costs. This paper is a part of a broader study aiming to identify the areas of energy inefficiency in social housing dwellings, and improve the overall efficiency through modifying occupants’ energy use culture. The firsthand information on where and how energy is used in the dwellings was collected through conducting walk-through energy audits in the sample dwellings. This information was then combined with the information provided by the households’ representatives on the time of use of their appliances as well as direct observations to calculate energy consumption in these households. Practical guidelines were then proposed, taking into account their energy use behaviour to minimize their energy consumption at a minimum cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work {{can be seen as}} making the bridge between the fields of Solid-State Integrated Circuits (IC) and Power Electronics. Multiple AC-DC and DC-DC power {{converters}} are investigated from the IC standpoint, this means a constant effort to realize converters that are fully integrated on a single chip, or have at least a very high level of integration. Moreover, it is of paramount importance to improve power conversion efficiency throughout the transport chain of energy from source (e. g., a battery, the mains) to load (i. e., the application which is the consumer). Creating new converter systems that are very efficient and integrated into chip-scale solutions enable the benefit of longer battery autonomy in portable devices, on top of enabling ever lighter and slimmer devices. In non-mobile applications, less power is required from the mains for the same functionality and consequently this helps to reduce emissions related to electricity generation, such as carbon dioxide, etc. To summarize this work, a few different research targets are introduced: 1) monolithic switched-capacitor DC-DC conversion for granular power delivery on-chip, 2) reduction of standby power in mains-connected devices through the addition of an efficient and compact auxiliary supply to provide power during standby mode, and 3) high-ratio DC-DC voltage conversion in a monolithic context. Modern integrated circuits contain more and more functionality within a single chip. These are also called Systems on Chip and examples of such systems are the Application Processing Unit chips at the heart of today’s smartphones or personal computers. Because these single-chip systems house a large amount of subsystems, it is only logical that they require multiple different supply voltages to power these functions. In the past, most required voltages were generated off-chip on the printed circuit board, {{in the vicinity of the}} chip. This approach, however, is becoming less and less viable due the growing number of desired supply voltages and the associated number of interconnection pins to get the power from the off-chip power converters to the on-chip loads. Moreover, there are other negative aspects related to this approach. Therefore, a better approach is to provide the chip with one, or a few, different supply voltages, and use on-chip power converters to further provide the desired supply voltages. This requires less package pins, and enables better regulation of the desired supply voltage, since the feedback loop can now be performed locally on the chip. The goal of this work is to enable the above. To that end, an investigation of suitable fully-integrated DC-DC converters is conducted. Specifically, the realization of a switched-capacitor DC-DC converter in a standard CMOS technology with a high power density was targeted. It is important to implement the converter in a standard CMOS process to enable co-integration with its loading circuits on the same chip. Secondly, a high power conversion density yields a lower chip area requirement to implement the converter. This work investigated circuit techniques to deliver top-notch specifications, given this context. Standby power is caused by mains-connected devices in standby mode. They have a power supply that is optimized for the active mode, where power levels may be very large with respect to the low required power level of <b>standby,</b> a <b>factor</b> 100 x or more. It cannot be expected that these converters are efficient both at their nominal power (active mode) and also at light-load (standby mode) condition. Therefore, the power consumption of mains-connected devices is much higher than what it could be. Since standby power on a global scale is associated to about 10 % of residential electricity consumption and 1 % of CO 2 emissions, standby power reduction could help to counter global warming. Therefore, this work aims to build the AC-DC converters that enable such reductions in standby power and prevent the associated emissions. The research toward high-ratio voltage conversion in an integrated context is motivated by the research conclusion, of the previous work on AC-DC converters, that switched-capacitor DC-DC converters are particularly well suited for this task. Monolithic high-ratio DC-DC conversion can, for example, be used to deliver high voltages from a standard Li-ion battery in a very small and light form factor, which is particularly important for robotic insects, where high voltages are required in the drivers that power the wings. Switched-capacitor DC-DC converters do not rely on the duty cycle to set their voltage conversion ratio, as its popular inductive buck converter counterpart does, and can therefore maintain a 50 % duty cycle, regardless of the actual voltage conversion ratio. Instead, the conversion ratio is a consequence of the switched-capacitor topology. As such, it is a better candidate for high-ratio voltage conversion than the buck converter, which is this case more affected by efficiency limiting drawbacks, due to its reliance on very low duty cycles in order to obtain high voltage conversion ratios. The research in this work explores, given the system-level choice for the SC DC-DC converter, which topology is expected to yield the best performance, considering the typical context of CMOS integration.
