Background: There is little evidence-based data related to the relationship between self-directed learning (SDL) and nursing competency. Methods: A descriptive correlational design was used. We conducted convenience sampling of 519 undergraduate nursing students from three universities during their final period of clinical practice. We investigated SDL according to the <b>SDLR</b> <b>scale</b> for nursing education (Chinese translation version), and used the Competency Inventory for Registered Nurses to evaluate nursing competency. Results: The mean SDLR score of the students was 148. 55 (standard deviation [SD] 18. 46), indicating intermediate and higher SDLR. The mean score for nursing competency was 142. 31 (SD 30. 39), indicating intermediate nursing competence. SDLR had a significant positive and strong relationship with nursing competency. Conclusion: SDLR is a predictor of nursing competency...|$|E
