60|$|Sir Patrick <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, and {{stretched}} out his legs luxuriously.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilding <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{and looked}} at him, his face inexpressibly shocked.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Templeton <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, frowning; {{but more}} from utter bewilderment now than anger.|$|E
60|$|The guest seemed {{helpless}} {{to take his}} gaze from it, and he <b>sat</b> fallen <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair at it when the woman {{came in with a}} pie.|$|R
60|$|Sharkey had <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair with}} a ghastly face while {{he listened to the}} surgeon's words. He mopped himself with his red handkerchief, and wiped away the fatal dust with which he was smeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't take you!" [...] {{he almost}} groaned. [...] "It's madness! It's impossible!" [...] And {{he went out}} into the passage. He ran down the steps and got into his cab. An immense time seemed to pass before it began to move. It started at last, and Hilary <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> it, <b>his</b> hands clenched, still as a dead man.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. His {{long fingers}} played nervously together, {{he looked at}} her gravely.|$|E
60|$|The Governor <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair with}} a grunt. His secretary, on his {{immediate}} right, leaned towards him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair and}} looked at the girl in amazement. She was rather young to have {{conceived}} such ideas.|$|E
6000|$|Pat's face {{suddenly}} sobered {{and rising}} {{to his feet}} he strode over to where Upton <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{his feet on the}} desk, and swung a big fist, hard as nails, perilously close to Upton's nose. [...] "Take ut back, ye little spalpeen," [...] he commanded. [...] "Take ut back and tell me ye loike me betther for what I am than for what I was!" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{his seat}} by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching. He {{had a reason}} of his own {{connected}} with a pet building scheme, for observing Bosinney. The architect might do for his purpose; he looked clever, as he <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, moodily making little ramparts with bread-crumbs. Soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut, but too small, as though made many years ago.|$|R
6000|$|He saw {{the priest}} bend down and kiss {{the altar and}} then face about and bless all the people. All crossed {{themselves}} and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bench. The priest {{came down from the}} altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{and meeting}} the other's hatred with a gaze as steady as his own, {{replaced}} his pistol.|$|E
60|$|Mamie {{handed him}} her note. He read {{it without a}} word. When he had {{finished}} he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, thinking.|$|E
60|$|Strong {{as was his}} composure, {{the lawyer}} <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair {{with a sort of}} solid stupefaction at which Paynter could not help smiling.|$|E
6000|$|Dictation over, {{with its}} need of sitting and {{thinking}} instead of bustling around {{and making a}} noise and really doing something, Babbitt <b>sat</b> creakily <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> revolving desk-chair and beamed on Miss McGoun. He was conscious {{of her as a}} girl, of black bobbed hair against demure cheeks. A longing which was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled him. While she waited, tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the desk-tablet, he half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams. He imagined their eyes meeting with terrifying recognition; imagined touching her lips with frightened reverence and--She was chirping, [...] "Any more, Mist' Babbitt?" [...] He grunted, [...] "That winds it up, I guess," [...] and turned heavily away.|$|R
5000|$|Of his riding style, 19th-century {{observer}} Henry Custance said, [...] "He was a {{very strong}} man on a horse... always <b>sat</b> well <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> saddle, kept hold of the horse's head and {{was a very}} resolute finisher." [...] Despite this, he was not known as a stylish jockey. He did, however, maintain a unique style off the track, known for wearing tartan suits, red slippers and feathered hats. [...] When mocked for this, he was reported to have replied with characteristic vanity, [...] "My tailor makes my clothes for nothing. It is not often he comes across a figure like mine to fit them on." [...] In turn, Hawley commented, [...] "I don't care how he dresses; he is a good enough jockey for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Margaret {{was obliged}} to be silent, and marvel, while her brother <b>sat</b> motionless, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, till Dr. Henley came in; {{and after a few}} words to him, went on talking to his wife, till dinner was announced. Philip went with them into the dining-room, but had {{scarcely}} sat down before he said he could not stay, and returned to the drawing-room sofa. He said he only wanted quiet and darkness, and sent his sister and her husband back to their dinner.|$|R
60|$|No more did the {{financier}} {{reveal his}} own feelings. He still <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, unmoved, in apparent contemplation. The posture was familiar to Langmaid.|$|E
60|$|The master <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair {{white and}} dumb. Incredible, extraordinary, and utterly unlooked for as was this revelation, he felt instinctively {{that it was}} true.|$|E
60|$|Having concluded, Monsieur de Garnache <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{and threw}} one {{leg over the}} other, fixing his eyes upon the Seneschal's face and {{awaiting}} his reply.|$|E
60|$|Late in {{the long}} {{twilight}} of the early spring day a stranger who was traveling in the old fashion on horseback, with <b>his</b> legs swathed <b>in</b> green baize against the mud of the streaming roads, and with his spattered saddle-bags hung over the pommel before him, was riding into Leatherwood. He paused in a puddle of the lane that left the turnpike not far off, and curved between the new-plowed fields {{in front of a}} double log cabin, which had the air of being one of the best habitations of its time though its time was long past; the logs it was built of were squared; the chimneys at either end were of stone masonry instead of notched sticks laid in clay. Against the wall of the porch between the two rooms of the cabin an old man <b>sat</b> tilted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, smoking a pipe which he took from his mouth at sight of the stranger's arrest.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hamilton Fynes {{discovered}} that place of entertainment without difficulty, ordered for himself {{a cup of}} coffee and a sandwich, and drew a chair close up to the small open fire, taking care, however, to sit almost facing the only entrance to the room. He laid his hat upon the counter, close to which he had taken up his position, and smoothed back with his left hand his somewhat thick black hair. He was a man, apparently of middle age, of middle height, clean-shaven, with good but undistinguished features, dark eyes, very clear and very bright, which showed, indeed, but little need of the pince-nez which hung by a thin black cord from his neck. <b>His</b> hat, low <b>in</b> the crown and of soft gray felt, would alone have betrayed his nationality. His clothes, however, were also American <b>in</b> cut. <b>His</b> boots were narrow and of unmistakable shape. He ate his sandwich with suspicion, and after his first sip of coffee ordered a whiskey and soda. Afterwards he <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, glancing every now and then at the clock, but otherwise manifesting no signs of impatience. In less than half an hour an inspector, cap in hand, entered the room and announced that everything was ready. Mr. Hamilton Fynes put on his hat, picked up his suitcase, and followed him on to the platform. A long saloon carriage, with a guard's brake behind and an engine in front, was waiting there.|$|R
6000|$|SPECIAL EDITORIAL NOTE, OR, FIT OF CONVULSIONS INTO [...] WHICH AN EDITOR FALLS IN INTRODUCING THIS SORT OF [...] STORY TO HIS READERS. We need {{offer no}} apology to [...] our readers in {{presenting}} {{to them a}} Russian novel. [...] There {{is no doubt that}} the future in literature lies [...] with Russia. The names of Tolstoi, of Turgan-something, [...] and Dostoi-what-is-it are household words in America. [...] We may say with certainty that Serge the Superman is [...] the most distinctly Russian thing produced in years. [...] The Russian view of life is melancholy and fatalistic. [...] It is dark with the gloom of the great forests of the [...] Volga, and saddened with the infinite silence of the [...] Siberian plain. Hence the Russian speech, like the [...] Russian thought, is direct, terse and almost crude in [...] its elemental power. All this appears in Serge the [...] Superman. It is the directest, tersest, crudest thing [...] we have ever seen. We showed the manuscript to a friend [...] of ours, a critic, a man who has a greater Command of [...] the language of criticism than perhaps any two men in [...] New York to-day. He said at once, [...] "This is big. It is [...] a big thing, done by a big man, a man with big ideas, [...] writing at his very biggest. The whole thing has a [...] bigness about it that is--" [...] and here he paused and [...] thought a moment and added--"big." [...] After this he <b>sat</b> [...] <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and said, [...] "big, big, big," [...] till we [...] left him. We next showed the story to an English critic [...] and he said without hesitation, or with very little, [...] "This is really not half bad." [...] Last of all we read [...] the story ourselves and we rose after its perusal--itself [...] not an easy thing to do--and said, [...] "Wonderful but [...] terrible." [...] All through our (free) lunch that day we [...] shuddered.|$|R
60|$|Trenchard {{replenished}} it {{with the}} utmost promptness, then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tall chair and pulled a moment at the fresh pipe with which he had equipped himself.|$|E
60|$|He ceased, {{and there}} was silence. M. de Rivarol <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, the {{feathered}} end of a quill between his teeth. Presently {{he cleared his throat}} and asked a question.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair wearily, {{with his}} chin sunk upon his chest. For a time he did not think, and then, he read again the {{sentence}} {{in front of his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Varden {{opined that}} if he did, {{he ought to be}} ashamed of himself; such sentiments being more {{consistent}} (so she argued) with a benighted Mussulman or wild Islander than with a stanch Protestant. Arguing from this imperfect state of his morals, Mrs Varden further opined that he had never studied the Manual. Hugh admitting that he never had, and moreover that he couldn't read, Mrs Varden declared with much severity, that he ought to be even more ashamed of himself than before, and strongly recommended him to save up his pocket-money for the purchase of one, and further to teach himself the contents with all convenient diligence. She was still pursuing this train of discourse, when Hugh, somewhat unceremoniously and irreverently, followed his young master out, and left her to edify the rest of the company. This she proceeded to do, and finding that Mr Willet's eyes were fixed upon her with an appearance of deep attention, gradually addressed the whole of her discourse to him, whom she entertained with a moral and theological lecture of considerable length, in the conviction that great workings were taking place <b>in</b> <b>his</b> spirit. The simple truth was, however, that Mr Willet, although his eyes were wide open and he saw a woman before him whose head by long and steady looking at seemed to grow bigger and bigger until it filled the whole bar, was to all other intents and purposes fast asleep; and so <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair with <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pockets until his son's return caused him to wake up with a deep sigh, and a faint impression that he had been dreaming about pickled pork and greens--a vision of his slumbers which was no doubt referable to the circumstance of Mrs Varden's having frequently pronounced the word 'Grace' with much emphasis; which word, entering the portals of Mr Willet's brain as they stood ajar, and coupling itself with the words 'before meat,' which were there ranging about, did in time suggest a particular kind of meat together with that description of vegetable which is usually its companion.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{her chair}} {{as though she}} had been struck.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{her chair}} and {{regarded}} his pinched and determined visage.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Selingman <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> place. He {{was staring}} at his {{companion}} with wide-open eyes. Jean Coulois was moistening his lips with his tongue, his eyes were brilliant.|$|E
60|$|He waved {{away the}} attendants, drank a deep draught from the cup at his elbow, wiped {{his mouth with}} the back of his hand, and <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tall chair to hear her.|$|E
60|$|He eyed me sardonically for a moment, as if enjoying in {{anticipation}} {{the pleasure of}} compelling me against my will. He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and threw one heavily-booted leg across the other.|$|E
60|$|Rivera's way was different. Indian blood, {{as well as}} Spanish, was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins, and he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a corner, silent, immobile, {{only his}} black eyes passing from face to face and noting everything.|$|R
60|$|Almost at {{the same}} time the Prince <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the shadows of the Duchess of Devenham's box at the Opera and talked quietly to Lady Grace.|$|R
60|$|He, too, {{expressed}} surprise, and Sir Thomas <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a hush of reprobation {{that seemed}} to have the chill of the centuries behind it. The Empire's work was resumed.|$|R
