40|$|According to the task-affordance hypothesis, {{people will}} be more likely to use a {{specific}} strategy as tasks more readily afford its use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the degree to which older and younger adults used a self-testing strategy to learn items, because previous studies suggest that age-related differences in the use of this powerful strategy vary across tasks. These tasks (words affixed to a board vs. pairs on flashcards) differentially afford the use of the self-testing strategy and may moderate the age-related effects on strategy use. Participants performed a recall-readiness task in which they continued to study items until they were ready for the criterion <b>test.</b> As predicted, <b>self</b> <b>testing</b> was used less often on tasks that least afforded its use. Namely, participants used <b>self</b> <b>testing</b> less when they studied single words affixed to a board than when they studied pairs on flashcards.

40|$|Objectives The main {{hypothesis}} in {{this study}} is that stakeholders have different preferences concerning IT innovations in hospitals, and these preferences are caused by perceived cost/benefit ratios. This will translate in disagreement between stakeholders on which innovations to implement first, possibly explaining the slow diffusion of innovations in health care. Methods Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to quantify stakeholders positions in their priority of nine IT innovations. These innovations were selected after a systematic literature review and expert interviews. In the AHP, decision criteria related to costs and benefits of the innovations were defined: improvement in efficiency, health gains, satisfaction with care process, and required investments. Stakeholders judged the importance of the decision criteria and prioritized the selected IT innovations according to their expectations of how well the innovations would perform on these decision criteria. Results Sixty-two respondents, including patients, nurses, physicians, managers, health care insurers and policy makers showed significant differences in their expectations about their respective costs and benefits of the innovations, resulting in diverging preferences for the health care innovations. For instance, <b>self</b> <b>tests</b> {{are one of the most}} preferred innovations by health care insurers and managers, due to its expected positive impacts on efficiency and health gains. However, physicians, nurses and patients strongly doubt the health gains of <b>self</b> <b>tests,</b> and accordingly rank <b>self</b> <b>tests</b> as the least preferred innovation. Conclusions We found clear differences in expectations of different stakeholder groups on IT innovations. The differences can be understood from the perspective of costs and benefits per stakeholder for each innovation. This study gives a first quantitative insight in stakeholder differences and presents a novel way to study stakeholder differences. The results may be used by decision makers to include alignment of stakeholder positions in implementation processes...|$|R

This study aimed to (1) validate a scale measuring acceptability of self-testing for trichomoniasis, (2) compare acceptability of <b>self</b> versus clinician <b>testing</b> using a POC test for trichomoniasis, (3) examine changes in acceptability after experience and review of results, and (4) examine predictors of acceptability. Methods Women (14 e 22 years old) performed the POC test and completed surveys assessing acceptability of <b>self</b> and clinician <b>testing</b> at baseline, after testing, and after discussion of results. Factor analysis examined scale structure; changes in mean scale scores were assessed with mixed models. Generalised linear models examined predictors of acceptability. Results Of 247 participants, 54 (22 %) had a positive POC test for trichomoniasis. Factor analysis confirmed four acceptability subscales: trust of results, confidence, comfort, and effects of testing. At baseline, trust and confidence were higher, and comfort was lower, for clinician versus <b>self</b> <b>testing.</b> For self-testing, all subscale scores increased from baseline to after testing, and trust increased from after testing to after discussion. Trust of self and clinician results was not significantly different after discussion. A positive attitude towards home testing predicted higher self-test acceptability on all subscales. Tampon use was associated with increased self-test comfort at baseline. Concordance between self and clinician results predicted increased trust of <b>self</b> <b>testing</b> after discussion.
