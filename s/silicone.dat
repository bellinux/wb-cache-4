40|$|<b>Silicones</b> {{are used}} to {{manufacture}} finger and wrist joints. However these joints have fractured prematurely in vivo. There {{is a lack of}} literature on the mechanical properties of <b>silicones.</b> The aim of this thesis was to investigate the viscoelastic and related properties of elastomers such as <b>silicones</b> and polyurethanes (suggested as a possible substitute for <b>silicones</b> in the implants) and to relate the properties to how an implant may perform in vivo. The viscoelastic properties of medical-grade <b>silicones</b> and Elast-Eon^TM 3 were found to depend on frequency in compression. Above a certain frequency, the <b>silicones</b> appeared to undergo a transition from the rubbery to the glassy state. There is a danger that this could lead to the creation of fracture surfaces. The viscoelastic properties of the <b>silicones</b> were not significantly affected by the temperature; pre-treatment of specimens had no appreciable effect on the results. When the viscoelastic properties were measured in tension, {{there was a significant difference}} between the properties measured in tension and compression. Accelerated aging significantly increased the moduli of Elast-Eon^TM 3, which is of some concern. The cross-link densities of the <b>silicones</b> were measured using a solvent swelling technique and the Flory-Rehner equation. The results showed that this method is useful as an approximate model.

Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of <b>silicone,</b> clay and plaster.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the <b>silicone</b> sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from <b>silicone</b> and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of <b>silicone</b> rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} general types of breast implant devices, defined by their filler material: saline solution, <b>silicone</b> gel, and {{composite}} filler. The saline implant has an elastomer <b>silicone</b> shell filled with sterile saline solution during surgery; the <b>silicone</b> implant has an elastomer <b>silicone</b> shell pre-filled with viscous <b>silicone</b> gel; and the alternative composition implants featured miscellaneous fillers, such as soy oil, polypropylene string, etc. Composite implants are typically {{not recommended for}} use anymore and, in fact, their use is banned in the United States and Europe due to associated health risks and complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of <b>silicone</b> breast implants requires the metallic element Platinum (Pt., 78) {{as a catalyst}} to accelerate the transformation of <b>silicone</b> oil into <b>silicone</b> gel for making the elastomer <b>silicone</b> shells, and for making other medical-silicone devices. The literature indicates that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of <b>silicone</b> breast implant; therefore, platinum {{is present in the}} surrounding pectoral tissue(s).

40|$|Abstract: Cycloaliphatic {{epoxy resins}} {{have been used}} {{alongside}} <b>silicones</b> and ceramics for more than 30 years as insulation materials for outdoor applications. Insulators made of cycloaliphatic epoxies offer many advantages over those made of ceramic or <b>silicones.</b> Standard cycloaliphatic epoxies are construction materials, however, they do not exhibit hydrophobicity as do <b>silicones.</b> A new generation of cycloaliphatic epoxy systems with enhanced hydrophobic properties, hydrophobic cycloaliphatic epoxy try to join the advantages of both cycloaliphatic epoxy resins and <b>silicones.</b> The paper presents the laboratory and field test results of commercially available hydrophobic cycloaliphatic epoxy insulators. These insulators exhibit the hydrophobic properties under clean conditions. Unfortunately, when polluted by industrial dust, the surface become hydrophilic. No hydrophobicity transfer was found even three months after surface contamination. Nevertheless, compared with the standard cycloaliphatic epoxy the hydrophobic cycloaliphatic epoxy offers some advantage under light industrial pollution or sea pollution. ...|$|R
