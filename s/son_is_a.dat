25|$|Most of {{the extant}} temples at Mỹ Sơn, {{such as the}} Isanabhadresvara, {{were built in the}} 10th century AD. Unfortunately, the {{inscriptions}} from this period have not survived, except in fragmentary form. At the beginning of the 10th century, the Cham center of power was at Đồng Dương, not far from Mỹ Sơn. By the end of the century, it had been displaced southward to Bình Định Province on account of military setbacks in wars with the Viet. However, Cham kings continued periodically to renovate the temples at Mỹ Sơn and even to build new foundations. The latest significant Cham record at Mỹ <b>Sơn</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pillar inscription of King Jaya Indravarman V dated 1243 AD. By the early 15th century, the Cham had lost their northernmost lands, including the area of Mỹ Sơn, to the Viet.|$|E
25|$|This Bible, {{as indeed}} all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, {{did not contain}} {{the full text of}} the Bible, and {{contained}} much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis of moral and allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the Psalter he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the Gospels he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused diatessaron of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there {{does not seem to be}} any very obvious connection between them. Thus the sleep of Adam, recorded in the beginning of Genesis, is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and Abraham sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for his <b>son</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the Apostles to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.|$|E

Otherwise known as [...] by their classmates, with an honorific used mainly with boys, Yoshino was assigned female at birth, but wants to be a boy. Yoshino usually refrains from dressing in traditionally feminine clothes, such as skirts or dresses. Despite this, Yoshino's mother insists on buying such clothes for Yoshino. Shortly after becoming friends with Shuichi, Yoshino gets a haircut in a boyish style, taking on the appearance of a boy their age, especially when Yoshino is dressed in a male school uniform. Like Shuichi, Yoshino becomes increasingly concerned and resentful about undergoing puberty, such as {{at the beginning of}} menstruation or the growth of breasts. Yoshino goes to buy a chest-flattening garment to escape the necessity of wearing a bra. Also like Shuichi, Yoshino shows signs indicating gender dysphoria, though later stops thinking that way due to personal exposure to modeling.|$|E

Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if}} he could produce or assist in an episode's creation, as his <b>son</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fan of the show; the producers subsequently created a character for Downey. Lauren Conrad met MacFarlane while recording a [...] clip for the episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears" [...] (season 5, 2006). She has watched Family Guy for years and considers Stewie her favorite character. Commenting on his appearance in the episode [...] "Big Man on Hippocampus" [...] (season 8, 2010), actor Dwayne Johnson stated that he was a [...] "big fan" [...] of Family Guy. Johnson befriended MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film Tooth Fairy. R singer Rihanna has admitted to being a fan of Family Guy, as has pop singer Britney Spears; she tries to imitate Stewie's English accent.

500|$|The {{origins of}} the episode and the {{character}} of Patrick began when Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if he}} could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his <b>son</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fan of the show, so the producers came up with the character of Patrick for Downey. Show producer Seth MacFarlane believes Downey [...] "did a great job," [...] and brought a [...] "very kind of half crazy, and maybe just eccentric personality to that character that really worked out great." [...] When Patrick makes his second appearance in season 10's [...] "Killer Queen", he is not voiced by Downey. Instead, he is voiced by Family Guy writer, and recurring guest voice actor, Danny Smith. Bob Barker voiced himself presenting The Price Is Right; but the actual sequence took years to make. Barker has provided his voice for the show twice, although MacFarlane has never met him. John Veiner voiced Bobby McFerrin falling down a flight of stairs. The ball-in-a-cup scene is commented upon by MacFarlane, where he states that [...] "the voice-overs work, the drawings work" [...] and that Walter Murphy [...] "did a great job of creating a piece of deliberately annoying music." [...] Several jokes had been pitched for Peter's words after killing an evil dragon, but all were dropped, as they weren't deemed funny enough by production staff.|$|E
