500|$|The trio finally {{decide that}} {{kidnapping}} Hardenberg {{was wrong and}} take {{him back to his}} house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (Spezialeinsatzkommando) gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when <b>she</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: [...] "Manche Menschen ändern sich nie" [...] ("many people never change"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg's boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.|$|E

500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as I can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if <b>she</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E

When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house.

Panicked, she stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door opens. When she goes to push [...] the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now wearing a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears people outside banging violently against the walls of the house.|$|E

It is late evening on a Saturday, and Rita is {{alone at the}} diner. <b>She</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> clatter {{in the kitchen and}} goes to investigate. She is shocked to see that it is Angelo. He is no longer the mild, sweet man she knew. He paws her, and brandishes his handgun. She looks upon him both with affection and fear. Angelo reveals what he has planned to do: using his gun, he forces Rita up to Dino and Lana's apartment where he holds her as a hostage in wait for Lana and Luca's return.|$|E
50|$|However, after <b>she</b> <b>hears</b> <b>an</b> ailing Peter had {{donned a}} Spider-Man costume {{in order to}} save Betty Brant from Doctor Octopus, she {{develops}} a crush on him. By this time, however, Peter's interest has waned considerably, as he notes that Liz never showed any real interest in him until he began dating Betty Brant, and assumes that Liz's feelings are little more than a schoolgirl crush. Betty and Liz clash several times over Peter, as Betty mistakenly thinks that Peter reciprocates Liz's interest in him.|$|R

After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together. In the middle of their conversation, <b>she</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> voice she recognizes singing. When she looks at the stage, she sees that it is Charlie and realizes that she did not know everything about him. Michael is upset, thinking that she declined his offer for Charlie and is ready to go. After they leave, Charlie is auditioning for a music agent and is rejected. The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she [...] "wrote" [...] for him (which ends up being [...] "She Loves You", by The Beatles). She then goes to Richard to say goodbye, saying she wants to stop messing up her life and everyone else's since the reason Charlie stopped singing was her becoming pregnant right before they graduated. Richard proposes, but she refuses because she does not want to marry anyone and he has to be valedictorian. Confused, she visits her grandparents for her birthday.

60|$|Jeanne obeyed her breathlessly. At first <b>she</b> could <b>hear</b> nothing.

50|$|In 1991, a {{previous}} victim {{received a phone}} call from the perpetrator and spoke with him for one minute. She stated that <b>she</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> woman and children in the background, leading to suspicion that he had started a family.|$|R
60|$|He {{will not}} be called to; he {{will not be}} stirred. Sometimes the intent ear of Isabel in the next room, overhears the {{alternate}} silence, and then the long lonely scratch of his pen.

60|$|In this house, on the 8th of September, 1705, she {{was sitting}} alone in the forenoon, {{thinking}} over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself into a due resignation to providence, though her condition seemed hard. And, said she, I have been provided for hitherto, and doubt not but I shall be still; and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when it is most fit for me: and then took up her sewing-work, which she had no sooner done, but <b>she</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> knocking at the door.

6000|$|... "Much smart talk is indulged in," [...] so the sub-editor has explained. There is {{absolutely}} no need to ask for more than that. There is a Duchess who says improper things. Once she used to shock me. But I know her now. She is really a nice woman; she doesn't mean them. And when the heroine is in trouble, towards {{the middle of the}} book, she is just as amusing on the side of virtue. Then there is a younger lady whose speciality is proverbs. Apparently whenever <b>she</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> proverb she writes it down and studies it with the idea of seeing into how many different forms it can be twisted. It looks clever; as a matter of fact, it is extremely easy.|$|E
