5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the <b>structural</b> <b>design,</b> as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E

The aircraft had an inherently unsafe <b>structural</b> <b>design</b> as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} quickly {{caught on}} in Chicago. In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the <b>structural</b> <b>design</b> of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became {{in the first}} entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing in the steel frame design began to establish practices in Chicago.|$|E
40|$|Firms make {{substantial}} {{investments in}} advertising and personal selling {{to improve their}} performance, but {{it is unclear how}} returns on the promotional mix vary across different corporate-level organizational structures. This article identifies and integrates two <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> that foster customer alignment, namely, structural type (i. e., organizing corporate-level business units around customer instead of product groups) and structural granularity (i. e., dividing a firm into smaller business units), then investigates how these customer-aligned <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> moderate the effects of the promotional mix on firm performance. An analysis of 14 years of longitudinal, multisource, secondary data reveals that the performance effect of investments in advertising and personal selling are enhanced by customer-aligned <b>structural</b> <b>designs.</b> However, the synergistic effects of joint investments in advertising and personal selling get suppressed in customer-aligned structures because functional fragmentation results from internal inefficiencies and complexities. To specify the tensions involved across the different structures, the authors conduct a post hoc analysis and thereby derive organizational structure–specific guidelines. No Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's <b>structural</b> <b>design,</b> and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 {{construction}} again commenced on {{yet another}} variation on Bradfield's design. This involved the earlier route used towards Bondi Junction through Woolloomooloo, then an extension towards Kingsford with five extra stations at Charing Cross, Frenchmans Road, Randwick, University and Kingsford. The New South Wales Government awarded the contract for the civil and <b>structural</b> <b>design</b> to the successful Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. An official Legislative Assembly inquiry in 1976, however, recommended that costs on the project be cut, and the extension to Kingsford, a proposed station at Woollahra, {{and the expansion of}} concourse areas at Bondi Junction and Martin Place stations did not proceed. Nonetheless, it was resolved to fully integrate the railway with the Illawarra line. The Eastern Suburbs Railway opened between Central station and Bondi Junction on 23 June 1979. Initially trains ran as shuttle services between Central and Bondi Junction; it was not until a year later that work was finished to integrate the lines. A double-track junction with the Illawarra Line at Erskineville south of Illawarra Junction, twin single track tunnels connecting to the Eastern Suburbs Railway platforms at Central, a set of underground platforms at Redfern and a turnback tunnel at Martin Place opened to complete the project on 20 July 1980.|$|E
40|$|The design {{decision}} {{is usually a}} synthesis of various requirements to the construction object. The main difficulty is to approve the solution results of all the subtasks, because these various requirements often contradict each other. In the article the existing approaches to design solutions searching for steel <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> are considered, features of standard and individual design are specified. The associative method of choosing the {{design decision}} is offered. The process of search is directed {{in order to receive}} favorable coincidence of design situations, current and implemented earlier and to apply the approved decisions. In order to consider the greatest possible quantity of combinations of <b>design</b> solution for <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> in the article it is offered to create a tree of enumeration of possibilities for decisions, in case of which the possible values of decision parameters vary. The algorithm of searching the design decision is shown by a method of a tree of search creation. Three levels of solution for a problem of steel <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> are thus described. Also the question is raised of the effectiveness of padding expenses for creating the complete tree of search of options, their analysis and assessment...|$|R

40|$|This article compares, {{first of}} all, <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> of low head micro {{hydraulic}} power plants using Kaplan turbines. The authors have chosen this turbine class because siphon turbine systems suck the water {{up over the}} dams, can operate at temperatures below 0 °C and are associated with less capital costs than turbine systems of other types. Besides it, mobile micro power plants can be easily assembled in a modular way and be installed on floating platforms thus providing appeal to a growing market niche. The authors discuss the issue of identity of possible <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> of siphon micro hydraulic power plants {{in terms of their}} efficiency and selection of optimal pressure heads. They have developed a criterion of comparison of efficiency of various designs of siphon micro hydraulic power plants and provide evidence of virtual identity of selected <b>structural</b> <b>designs</b> with identical parameters in terms of efficiency. This criterion allowed them to make estimates in search for an optimal solution in terms of gross head (vertical distance between the highest and lowest water surface) versus net head (effective head available for power generation which is gross head less all the losses in the water conductor system including penstocks), which can be useful for designers of micro hydraulic power plants...|$|R
5|$|In a motte-and-bailey design, {{a castle}} {{would include a}} mound called a motte, usually artificially {{constructed}} by piling up turf and soil, and a bailey, a lower walled enclosure. A keep and a protective wall would usually be built {{on top of the}} motte. Some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight – this was called a garillum. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square structure that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy <b>structural</b> <b>design.</b> These wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the <b>structural</b> <b>design</b> loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
