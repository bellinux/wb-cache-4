500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Takahide Ishii. It opens with a couple arguing in a taxi, which later has them leaving the car and walk down the street. Behind them has Hamasaki {{sitting on a bench}} observing a puppet show, <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> the distance. The taxi driver questions her smiling, and looks at the show. It then shows several camera angles with Hamasaki singing the song, and then has the second verse with Hamasaki and a male companion as the marionette dolls. As marionette dolls, they both walk past each other in a dark atmosphere, whilst the chorus has Hamasaki singing the song again at the bench. [...] As the second chorus is about to begin, several children start to play with the dolls, to Hamasaki's delight. However, the children decide to purchase the male doll, and leaves the female doll (portrayed by Hamasaki) on the small puppet show's stage.|$|E

As Susan's vision went, and later as she was put into the MRI scanner, Woodburne portrayed real fear and panic". TV Week named Susan as their third [...] "Top Aussie TV Mum". They said [...] "strong-spirited Susan has always doted on her kids, even while putting up with cheating hubby Karl (Alan Fletcher). The modern mum has seen it all, and still comes up <b>smiling.</b> <b>In</b> 2010, Susan was voted the third [...] "Most Popular TV Mum" [...] in a survey carried out by Yahoo!. Susan was placed seventh in a similar survey carried out by Vouchercodes.co.uk, to find [...] "Britain's favourite television mother". They said [...] "viewers identified with love for her family". In April 2010, Sky included Susan in their feature on the twenty-five most memorable Neighbours characters. They stated, [...] "Kindly but strong matriarch Susan {{may not be the}} most medically robust woman (amnesia, multiple sclerosis, frequent questionable haircuts), but she gets by thanks to her family. She's so devoted, in fact, that after Malcolm, Billy and Libby (sort of) flew the nest, she went and inherited Zeke and Rachel from second husband Alex. Despite her big heart, she can be counted on to get fierce with anyone who tries to upset the Ramsay Street balance – her frequent fights with Izzy in the middle of the street over Karl cemented her reputation as everyone's favourite soap mum." ...|$|E

The Imperial Army imposed strict censorship. Any photographs with dead bodies couldn't get through. So photographers had to remove all the bodies before taking pictures of streets and buildings in the city (...) Even if the photos were not staged, the refugees {{had no choice but}} to fawn on the Japanese soldiers. Acting otherwise meant their deaths..." ...|$|E

Making the game even more remarkable {{was that it was}} [...] "Yogi Berra Day" [...] at Yankee Stadium. After a long feud with owner George Steinbrenner, Berra agreed to return to the stadium that day, and caught the ceremonial first pitch from fellow perfect game pitcher Don Larsen.

Wang is also known to make offhand and often humorous remarks in public. As the top {{economic}} official representing China at the 2013 U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Wang compared the relationship between China and the United States as that of a married couple. In a session with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Wang remarked [...] "I am aware that the US allows gay marriage, but I don't think Jacob and I have such intentions." [...] He later added that China and the United States should not [...] "choose the path of a divorce", stating, [...] "like that of Wendy Deng and Rupert Murdoch, it is just too expensive".|$|E
2500|$|McGraw {{believed}} {{that he had to}} eliminate any potential distractions that could cause his teams to lose. [...] For example, Casey Stengel, who played for the Giants from 1921 to 1923, recalled that McGraw would go over the meal tickets at the team hotel, and wasn't shy about telling his players that they weren't eating right. [...] For most of his tenure, he set a curfew for 11:30 pm. [...] According to Rogers Hornsby, who served as a player-coach for the Giants in 1927, either McGraw or one of his coaches would knock on the players' hotel room doors at 11:30 sharp—and someone was expected to answer. [...] He was known to be extremely competitive; he would fine players for fraternizing with members of other teams and would not tolerate <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> the dugout.

2500|$|A {{camera crew}} {{remained}} behind to film the participants as they carried out their survival challenges, {{some of which}} lasted several days. However, the camera crew was instructed not {{to interact with the}} participants. Several participants were also given hand-held video cameras and permitted to film their actions. A paramedic also was always on-site to provide emergency health care. Participants were forbidden to have any electronic devices with them, and could only speak to the producer or Stroud (who were both on-site). [...] Stroud says that the participants constantly played to the camera, positioned themselves at the right camera angle to achieve the best pose, and—even though they were forbidden to do so—talked to the cinematographers to try to put themselves in a good light. Several of the participants were upset at the way their videotaped comments appeared on television. Some also expressed shock and surprise at the things others said about them in privately videotaped moments which later aired during the series. For his part, Stroud purposefully adopted a serious demeanor that involved never <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> front of the participants. He later told TV Guide Canada that not providing suggestions, encouragement, or other assistance was difficult for him.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2006, The Sunday Times {{released}} a video it had obtained [...] "through a previously tested channel", purporting to show Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah recording a martyrdom message six years earlier at a {{training camp in}} Afghanistan. The video, bearing the date of January 18, 2000, is of good resolution but contains no sound track. Lip readers have failed to decipher it. Atta and Jarrah appear in high spirits, laughing and <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> front of the camera. They had never been pictured together before. Unidentified sources from both Al-Qaeda and the United States confirmed to The Times the video's authenticity. A separate section of the video shows Osama bin Laden addressing his followers at a complex near Kandahar. Ramzi bin al-Shibh is also identified in the video. According to The Sunday Times, [...] "American and German investigators have struggled to find evidence of Atta’s whereabouts in January 2000 after he disappeared from Hamburg. The hour-long tape places him in Afghanistan at a decisive moment {{in the development of}} the conspiracy when he was given operational command. Months later both he and Jarrah enrolled at flying schools in America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{criticized the}} film for not {{mentioning}} {{the history of}} repression, aggression, war crimes and the general state {{of human rights in}} Saddam Hussein's Iraq, nor Iraq's noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions. Hitchens writes, [...] "in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic." [...] While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests [...] "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation" [...] and that [...] "Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ... Indeed, they are the Minutemen. They're the staunch American revolutionaries." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, al-Qaeda's {{division}} in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Centered in Yemen, the group {{takes advantage of}} the country's poor economy, demography and domestic security. In August 2009, they made the first assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal dynasty in decades. President Obama asked his Yemen counterpart Ali Abdullah Saleh to ensure closer cooperation with the US in the struggle against the growing activity of al-Qaeda in Yemen, and promised to send additional aid. Because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US was unable to pay sufficient attention to Somalia and Yemen, which could cause problems in the near future. In December 2011, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the US operations against al-Qaeda [...] "are now concentrating on key groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa." [...] Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. The group released photos of Abdulmutallab <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> a white shirt and white Islamic skullcap, with the al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula banner in the background.
