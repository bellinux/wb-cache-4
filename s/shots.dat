5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of {{extremely}} short <b>shots,</b> {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking <b>shots,</b> including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide <b>shots</b> {{to create a sense}} of isolation.|$|E
5|$|Derek Meddings {{and a team}} of 28 {{technicians}} {{completed the}} special effects <b>shots</b> for the film in six months. Their main assignments included the Zero-X launches, re-shot, widescreen launch sequences for the Thunderbird machines, the car chase between Lady Penelope and Parker in FAB1 and the Hood, scenes at The Swinging Star, the Mars <b>shots</b> involving the MEV and the mysterious Rock Snakes, and the ultimate destruction of Zero-X in the climax. Over 300 effects shot were completed with scale models. The team made use of the extra space afforded to them by the new special effects building to experiment with floor-level <b>shots</b> and other more creative camera angles.|$|E
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle <b>shots.</b> Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include <b>shots</b> of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, <b>shots</b> through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E

5|$|For Batman Begins, Nolan {{preferred}} traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale {{models were}} used to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple. There were, however, several establishing <b>shots</b> that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, exterior <b>shots</b> of Wayne Tower, {{and some of the}} exterior monorail <b>shots.</b> The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.|$|E
5|$|Hitler invited Riefenstahl to {{film the}} 1936 Summer Olympics {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the inaugural torch relay and the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly's. This material became Olympia, a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She {{was one of the first}} filmmakers to use tracking <b>shots</b> in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its slow motion <b>shots.</b> Riefenstahl played with the idea of slow motion, underwater diving <b>shots,</b> extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial <b>shots,</b> and tracking system <b>shots</b> for allowing fast action. Many of these <b>shots</b> were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leniâ€™s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and is the reason why they are still used to this day. Riefenstahl's work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what later became famous footage.|$|E
5|$|ILM created 527 <b>shots</b> for the film, using {{programs}} such as Maya. Perception worked on over 125 <b>shots</b> for the film.

5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen <b>shots</b> were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between <b>shots</b> was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight <b>shots</b> on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight <b>shots</b> were recorded on the audio tape.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The PathÃ© camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead <b>shots</b> are most commonly used, with some medium <b>shots</b> and {{a small number of}} large <b>shots.</b>|$|E

5|$|In linking these <b>shots</b> together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three <b>shots</b> are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following <b>shots</b> show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E
