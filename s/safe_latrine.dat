40|$|In two Vietnam provinces, an {{international}} NGO (IDE) developed {{a range of}} low-cost sanitation options and stimulated a network of local masons to market and deliver them to the rural population. As a result, the sanitation access rate increased markedly in the area, even among the poor. This report outlines lessons learned {{in the process of}} creating the demand for sanitation and meeting this demand locally. Implementation experience and a recently completed project evaluation suggest that a market-based model was an appropriate strategy for bringing about rapid increases in rural household access to <b>safer</b> <b>latrines</b> and improved hygiene practices in the selected provinces in Vietnam...|$|R
50|$|Medair’s WASH {{programs}} {{focus on}} improving access to <b>safe</b> drinking water, <b>latrine</b> construction, and hand-washing and hygiene promotion. For example, after Cyclone Gafilo struck Madagascar in 2004, Medair conducted a rapid assessment and implemented an emergency WASH project {{to clean and}} disinfect 1,400 existing wells in {{a little over a}} week. The initially skeptical local residents quickly became impressed by Medair’s work, and started calling the Medair team, NGO “No Bla-bla.” These projects included significant beneficiary participation, with local residents assisting in all aspects. Medair also trained local residents in well and latrine construction and maintenance.|$|R
40|$|In many peri-urban {{areas of}} Kenya, potable piped water {{does not exist}} and where it does, it is rarely reliable. Thus, in such areas, {{residents}} heavily rely on groundwater sources for their daily survival. Therefore, {{it is common to}} find individual wells in each plot within such a peri-urban dwelling. Furthermore, in most cases, such dwellings lack municipal sewers, hence forcing residents to construct pit latrines at close proximity to their wells. Indeed, {{it is not uncommon to}} find a well located just a few metres from an un-lined pit latrine. A study was carried out on the well water contamination by pit latrines in Langas which is peri-urban settlement of Eldoret town, Kenya. The study sought to establish the safety (quality) of water in wells located near pit latrines on individual plots of the settlement. The results show that most wells were contaminated and posed a health risk to the dwellers of the settlement. From the results it is recommended that a <b>safe</b> well-pit <b>latrine</b> separation distance of 48 m be maintained which will avoid contamination of well water from pit latrines...|$|R

A Life Removed (Penguin 2004), explores the daily reality of {{refugees}} and displaced {{people in and}} from Liberia.The Big Necessity: the Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why it Matters (Metropolitan/Portobello 2008), addresses the world's most neglected public health crisis, that of the potentially toxic substance that is untreated human waste. Nearly half the planet's population lack the basic necessity of a <b>safe,</b> decent <b>latrine</b> and the consequences are deadly: diarrhoea kills more children under 5 than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or measles, or all those three things put together. The Big Necessity also travels to the [...] "plumbed and flushed" [...] richer countries of the world, and discovers crumbling infrastructure, water-borne disease and neglect. George travels into the sewers of London and the slums of Mumbai; she visits Japanese factories that produce the most advanced toilets in the world; and Star City in Moscow, whose astronauts use diapers on space walks. Her third book, Ninety Percent of Everything: Inside Shipping, the Invisible Industry That Puts Clothes on Your Back, Gas in Your Car, and Food on Your Plate, was released in August 2013. The UK title of this book is Deep Sea and Foreign Going: Inside Shipping, the Invisible Industry the Brings you 90% of Everything, also released August 2013.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Many {{communities}} in the Dominican Republic {{have little or no}} access to safe drinking water or sanitation. The recent introduction of cholera from Haiti further highlights these limitations and their impact on human health. This research focused on two communities; a rural mountainous village and a peri-urban batey, which is a settlement community constructed by sugar cane companies to house primarily Haitian immigrant laborers. The purpose of this project was to examine community attitudes and behaviors surrounding water access and sanitation, barriers to access, and how this impacts cholera control. Research methods included community observations, household interviews, and interviews with local leaders. The results showed two dramatically different types of water access and sanitation. The mountainous village had regular access to local springs, consistent piped water, functioning latrines, and low population density. Community members voiced no dissatisfaction with their water system or waste disposal and reported no diarrheal disease. In contrast, the batey reported chronic diarrheal disease, high population density, and inconsistent access to <b>safe</b> water or <b>latrines.</b> Residents in the batey voiced frustration with the water infrastructure, with their inability to mobilize as a community, and with government run water services. Local Public Health officials in turn voiced frustration with the community for continuing to engage in behaviors that spread cholera. Overshadowing all of this were issues of anti-Haitian sentiment, poverty, inequality, urbanization, and ineffective decentralized water and sanitation services. In conclusion, if the sparsely populated mountain community maintains existing water and sanitation practices and current population and watershed levels {{they should be able to}} avoid cholera and other waterborne diseases and have consistent access to safe water and sanitation. In contrast, the densely populated peri-urban batey will continue to suffer chronic diarrhea and cholera outbreaks in the face of increasing urbanization, inconsistent water access, poor sanitation, limited community cohesion, discrimination, and poorly managed provincial water systems...|$|R
40|$|Background: Taeniasis and {{cysticercosis}} are two diseases {{caused by}} Taenia solium, a parasite transmitted {{between humans and}} pigs, leading to considerable economic loss and disabilities. Transmission of the parasite is linked to environmental and behavioural factors such as inadequate sanitation and hygiene, poor pig management, and consumption of infected pork. This study used implementation research method to design a health education intervention strategy for reducing T. solium infections in Burkina Faso, a country endemic for the parasite. Methods: Eighteen group discussions were conducted with 8 - 18 participants each in three villages. In addition, structured interviews were conducted among 4 777 participants and 2 244 pig owners, who were selected through cluster random sampling in 60 villages of three provinces of Burkina Faso. Both approaches assessed knowledge and practices related to T. solium. The information obtained was used to develop a community-adapted health education intervention strategy to control taeniasis and cysticercosis in Burkina Faso. Results: The group discussions revealed that participants had a poor quality of life due to the diseases as well as inadequate access to <b>latrines,</b> <b>safe</b> water, and healthcare services. In addition, {{it was found that}} pig production was an important economic activity, especially for women. Furthermore, financial and knowledge constraints were important limitations to improved pig management and latrine construction. The survey data also showed that open defecation and drinking unboiled water were common behaviours, enhanced by a lack of knowledge regarding the transmission of the parasite, perceived financial barriers to the implementation of control measures, lack of public sensitization, as well as a lack of self-efficacy towards control of the parasite. Nevertheless, the perceived financial benefits of controlling porcine cysticercosis could be emphasized by an education program that discourages open defecation and encourages drinking safe water. The final intervention strategy included a Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) approach, as well as a 52 -min film and an accompanying comic booklet. Conclusions: The main problem in the study communities regarding the transmission of T. solium cysticercosis is the random disposal of human faeces, which can be contaminated with parasite eggs. Prevention of open defecation requires the building of latrines, which can be quite problematic in economically challenged settings. Providing the community with the skills to construct durable latrines using low-cost locally available materials would likely help to resolve this problem. Further studies are required to implement and evaluate the T. solium control strategy developed in this study...|$|R
