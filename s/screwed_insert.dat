40|$|A {{new process}} named as "Damper Cooling Tube method" has been {{proposed}} for semi-solid slurry production. The new process absorbs some characteristics of "new MIT method" and "Cooling Slope method", and makes improvement from these two methods. In particularly, the DCT has advantages in preparing magnesium semi-solid slurry. The semi-solid slurry is formed in a cooling tube therefore the exposure of magnesium to air is eliminated. This avoids the oxidation or inflammation of magnesium molten melt. In order to effectively control the cooling intensity and solid fraction of semi-solid slurry of Mg alloy, cooling and heating devices are designed around the tube, which facilitate to adjust the temperature inside the tube. Two kinds of damper are designed in the paper. One is sphenoid insert DCT. The sphenoid damper will mix the molten alloy uniformly. The other is <b>screw</b> <b>insert</b> DCT, {{in which there is}} a cone-shaped <b>screw</b> <b>insert</b> in the cooling tube. The <b>screw</b> <b>insert</b> can mix the semi-solid slurry uniformly. The semi-solid slurry produced from DCT devices can be directly used for rheo-casting or rheo-forming...|$|R

40|$|Study Design. In part 1 of the study, the morphometry of {{thoracic}} pedicles and bony landmarks for {{pedicle screw}} placement were evaluated. In part 2, pedicle <b>screws</b> were <b>inserted</b> in fresh cadavers, {{using a different}} entry point in {{the left and right}} pedicles. Objectives. To identify the safest entry point and screw orientation for pedicle screws in the thoracic spine. Summary of Background Data. A few morphometric investigations have been performed on thoracic vertebrae, but the safest technique for screw insertion in thoracic pedicles has not been analyzed. Methods. Mean, range, and standard deviations of pedicle transverse diameter and pedicle orientation were measured in 99 dried thoracic vertebrae. We evaluated the position of the bottom of the superior facet and that of the superior border of the transverse process in relation {{to the center of the}} pedicle. The relation between the pedicle axis and the superior facet in the frontal plane was also assessed. In part 2 of the study, pedicle <b>screws</b> were <b>inserted</b> in fresh cadavers at the intersection between the superior border of the transverse process and the middle of the superior facet (entry point A) and between the former and the lateral two thirds of the facet (entry point B). Results. The smallest transverse diameter was found at T 6 (mean 4. 3 mm) where pedicles measured less than 5 mm in 68 % of the specimens. In the frontal plane, the pedicle axis intersected the middle of the superior facet inn 15 % of specimens, the lateral two-thirds in 62 %, and the lateral border of the facet in 23 %. Of the 126 <b>screws</b> <b>inserted</b> in fresh human cadavers, 15 (24 %) of the <b>screws</b> <b>inserted</b> using entry point A and 10 (16 %) of those inserted using entry point B violated the pedicle cortex (P < 0. 05). Six (10 %) of the <b>screws</b> <b>inserted</b> using entry point A compared with no <b>screw</b> <b>inserted</b> using entry point B penetrated the anterior vertebral cortex (P = 0. 03). Conclusions. Pedicles between T 4 and T 8 may not be wide enough for screw fixation. An entry point for pedicle screws located at the intersection between the superior border of the transverse process and the lateral two thirds of the superior facet seems more likely to be line with the pedicle axis than do other entry points. In the lower thoracic vertebrae this entry point, in combination with insertion of the screws more medially oriented than the pedicle axis, significantly reduces the risk of violating the anterior vertebral cortex...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Internal fixators with angular {{stability}} {{have been}} developed to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. Angular and axial stability of a plate-screw construct can be achieved using a conically threaded screw head undersurface and a corresponding conically threaded plate hole. Furthermore, the insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. This is not always achieved in clinical practice and may result in screw loosening. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Methods: Locking <b>screws</b> were <b>inserted</b> in an isolated (Point Contact Fixator, PC-Fix) or combined (Locking Compression Plate, LCP 4. 5) locking hole with the use of an aiming device. The optimal insertion angle for these plates is perpendicular to the plate surface.

Results: Locking <b>screws</b> <b>inserted</b> in the isolated locking hole (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 [degrees] and 10 [degrees] angle.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effectiveness of the surgical torque limiter during operative use. The study also investigates the potential differences in torque between hand and drill-based screw insertion into locking plates using a standardised torque limiter. Methods: Torque for both hand and power screw insertion was measured through a load cell, registering 6. 66 points per second. This was performed in a controlled environment using synthetic bone, a locking plate and locking screws to simulate plate fixation. <b>Screws</b> were <b>inserted</b> by hand and by drill with torque values measured. Results: The surgical torque limiter (1. 5 Nm) was effective as the highest recorded reading in the study was 1. 409 Nm. Comparatively, there is a statistically significant difference between screw insertion methods. Torque produced for manually driven screw insertion into locking plates was 1. 289 Nm (95 % CI 1. 269 – 1. 308) with drill-powered screw insertion at 0. 740 Nm (95 % CI 0. 723 – 0. 757). Conclusions: The surgical torque limiter proved to be effective as per product specifications. <b>Screws</b> <b>inserted</b> under power produce significantly less torque when compared to manual insertion by hand. This is likely related to the mechanism of the torque limiter when being used at higher speeds for which it was designed. We conclude that <b>screws</b> may be <b>inserted</b> using power to the plate with the addition of a torque limiter. It is recommended that all <b>screws</b> <b>inserted</b> by drill be hand tightened to achieve adequate torque values. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Sclerostin is {{the product}} of the SOST gene. Loss‐of‐function {{mutations}} in the SOST gene result in a high‐bone‐mass phenotype, demonstrating that sclerostin is a negative regulator of bone mass. Primarily expressed by osteocytes in bone, sclerostin is reported to bind the LRP 5 / 6 receptor, thereby antagonizing canonical Wnt signaling and negatively regulating bone formation. We therefore investigated whether systemic administration of a sclerostin‐neutralizing antibody would increase the regeneration of traumatized metaphyseal bone in rats. Young male rats had a <b>screw</b> <b>inserted</b> in the proximal tibia and were divided into six groups given 25 mg/kg of sclerostin antibody or control twice a week subcutaneously for 2 or 4 weeks.
