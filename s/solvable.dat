5|$|One can {{ask whether}} the problem is at least <b>solvable</b> in a time {{arbitrarily}} highly dependent on G, but with a fixed polynomial dependency {{on the size of}} H.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} finding a homomorphism between given graphs is prohibitive in general, but a lot is known about special cases that are <b>solvable</b> in polynomial time. Boundaries between tractable and intractable cases have been an active area of research.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{research}} in parallel algorithms {{has studied the}} problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) {{has been shown to}} be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem is unlikely to be <b>solvable</b> within the parallel complexity class NC.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems <b>solvable</b> in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from <b>solvable</b> to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{existence}} of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along the spine of the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be <b>solvable</b> in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every planar graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a planar graph whose book thickness is exactly four.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a fixed graph H {{on the right side}} of each instance is also called the H-coloring problem. When H is the complete graph K'k, this is the graph k-coloring problem, which is <b>solvable</b> in polynomial time for k = 0, 1, 2, and NP-complete otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} <b>solvable</b> had the league achieved economic stability but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively lost more than US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given {{the prestige of the}} franchise.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} cellular automata rules that are reversible; these include the block cellular automaton method, in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block, and the second-order cellular automaton method, in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton. When an automaton is not defined by one of these methods, but is instead given as a rule table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is <b>solvable</b> for block cellular automata and for one-dimensional cellular automata, but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} ethical issues, it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be <b>solvable</b> by returning to traditional morality.|$|E

25|$|What central series do for {{nilpotent}} groups, Fitting series do for <b>solvable</b> groups. A {{group has}} a central series if {{and only if}} it is nilpotent, and a Fitting series {{if and only if}} it is <b>solvable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Corollary: There is no {{universal}} <b>solvable</b> word problem group. That is, if G is a finitely presented {{group that}} contains an isomorphic copy of every finitely presented group with <b>solvable</b> word problem, then G itself must have unsolvable word problem.|$|E
25|$|While Ruffini and Abel {{established}} that the general quintic could not be solved, some particular quintics can be solved, such as (x1)5=0, and the precise criterion by which a given quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be <b>solvable</b> or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was <b>solvable</b> or not was equivalent {{to whether or not}} the permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, whether or not it was a <b>solvable</b> group. This group was always <b>solvable</b> for polynomials of degree four or less, but not always so for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains why there is no general solution in higher degree.|$|E
25|$|The group G has <b>solvable</b> word problem.|$|E

25|$|Any simply {{connected}} <b>solvable</b> Lie {{group is}} isomorphic to a closed subgroup {{of the group}} of invertible upper triangular matrices of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. <b>Solvable</b> groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.|$|E

25|$|The {{successive}} quotients are abelian, {{showing the}} equivalence between being <b>solvable</b> {{and having a}} Fitting series.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetric}} group on {{five or more}} points has no Fitting chain at all, not being <b>solvable.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>solvable</b> group, or soluble group, is {{one with}} a {{subnormal}} series whose factor groups are all abelian.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} statement, one {{may say that}} {{whenever}} the classical equations of motion are integrable (e.g. rectangular or circular billiard tables), then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely <b>solvable.</b> When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly <b>solvable,</b> and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos.|$|E
25|$|Groups of 2-rank 0, {{in other}} words groups of odd order, which are all <b>solvable</b> by the Feit–Thompson theorem.|$|E
25|$|A general Lie {{group is}} a semidirect product of a <b>solvable</b> Lie group and a semisimple Lie group (the Levi decomposition). The {{classification}} of representations of <b>solvable</b> Lie groups is intractable in general, but often easy in practical cases. Representations of semidirect products can then be analysed by means of general results called Mackey theory, which is a generalization of the methods used in Wigner's classification of representations of the Poincaré group.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to realize that the word problem is in fact <b>solvable</b> for many groups G. For example, polycyclic groups have <b>solvable</b> word problems since the normal form of an arbitrary word in a polycyclic presentation is readily computable; other algorithms for groups may, in suitable circumstances, also solve the word problem, see the Todd–Coxeter algorithm and the Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm. On the other hand the fact that a particular algorithm does not solve the word problem for a particular group does not show that the group has an unsolvable word problem. For instance Dehn's algorithm does not solve the word problem for the fundamental group of the torus. However this group is the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups and so has a <b>solvable</b> word problem.|$|E
25|$|A {{connected}} Lie {{group is}} simple, semisimple, <b>solvable,</b> nilpotent, or abelian if {{and only if}} its Lie algebra has the corresponding property.|$|E
