40|$|Here several perfect {{simulation}} algorithms {{are brought}} {{under a single}} framework, and shown to derive from the same probabilistic result, called here the Fundamental Theorem of Perfect Simulation (FTPS). An exact simulation algorithm has output according to an input distribution π. Perfect simulations are a subclass of exact simulations where recursion is used either explicitly or implicitly. The FTPS gives two simple criteria that, when satisfied, give a correct perfect simulation algorithm. First the algorithm must terminate in finite time with probability 1. Second, the algorithm must be locally correct {{in the sense that}} the algorithm can be proved correct given the assumption that any recursive call used returns an output from the correct distribution. This simple idea is surprisingly powerful. Like other general techniques such as Metropolis-Hastings for approximate simulation, the FTPS allows for the flexible construction of existing and new perfect <b>simulation</b> <b>protocols.</b> This theorem can be used to verify the correctness of many perfect <b>simulation</b> <b>protocols,</b> including Acceptance Rejection, Coupling From the Past, and Recursive Bernoulli factories...|$|R

First, we performed several simulations investigating the handling of long-range interactions in GROMACS [1], a MD simulation package. Selection of <b>simulation</b> <b>protocols</b> such as handling of long-range interactions is often overlooked, sometimes to the significant detriment of the final result [2, 3, 4]. Ensuring that the chosen <b>simulation</b> <b>protocols</b> are appropriate is a critical step in computer simulation. Second, we performed MD simulations where water flowed between two reservoirs con- nected by a carbon nanotube. We analyzed 10 simulations where two types of changes were made to induce flow: The removal of water molecules from one reservoir and the addition of NaCl to one reservoir at one of two concentrations. We study the effects of these changes in isolation, cooperation and competition. [1] B Hess, C Kutzner, D van der Spoel, and E Lindahl.
