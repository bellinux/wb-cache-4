40|$|Artist Joy Gregory {{introduces}} a new {{body of work}} that looks at the wearing of the veil in Saudi Arabia. Joy Gregory's photographic practice addresses anthropological themes arising from her ongoing research interest in visual forms of documenting cultural differences in contemporary society. Previous work includes the video piece Gomera which engaged with the relationship between language and the environment with particular emphasis on issues around language endangerment. Another ongoing project, Sites of Africa is a photographic document of absent histories, tracing London's connections with the African continent today. The Clothes, Cloth & Culture Group is a monthly forum for creative practitioners and thinkers across the spectrum of artists, designers, curators, writers and activists working with cloth. <b>Setting</b> <b>cloth</b> into the wider contexts of material and visual culture, the Clothes, Cloth & Culture Group provides a space for conversations {{about the politics of}} cloth from a distinctively cross-cultural viewpoint. The conversations generated by the Clothes, Cloth & Culture Group will be primarily disseminated through the Iniva website via links to a podcast. The monthly meetings will culminate in a symposium to be held in 2015...|$|E
50|$|In Wells' terminology, this {{consists}} of the merger of the lexical <b>sets</b> <b>CLOTH</b> and NORTH. It may be present in old-fashioned Eastern New England accents, New York City speakers and also in some speakers in Jamaica and Guyana. The merger was also until recently present in the dialects of southern England, including Received Pronunciation—specifically, the phonemic merger of the words often and orphan was a running gag in the Gilbert and Sullivan musical, The Pirates of Penzance.|$|R

50|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{a highly}} efficient smoke producing agent, burning quickly and causing an instant bank of smoke. As a result, smoke-producing white phosphorus munitions are common, particularly as smoke grenades for infantry, loaded in defensive grenade dischargers on tanks and other armored vehicles, or {{as part of}} the ammunition allotment for artillery or mortars. These create smokescreens to mask movement from the enemy, or to mask his fire. As an incendiary weapon, WP burns fiercely and can <b>set</b> <b>cloth,</b> fuel, ammunition and other combustibles on fire. White phosphorus use is legal for purposes such as illumination and obscuring smoke, and the Chemical Weapons Convention does not list WP in its schedules of chemical weapons.|$|R
5000|$|One way to {{participate}} in precycling is to carry a [...] "precycling kit". Include a Tupperware or non-disposable container, silverware <b>set,</b> a <b>cloth</b> napkin or handkerchief, and a thermos or water-bottle within a cloth bag that can double as a grocery/shopping bag.|$|R

60|$|A {{large number}} of Flemings had settled in Wales, having left their own country in {{consequence}} of the constant troubles there; {{and many of these}} had <b>set</b> up <b>cloth</b> mills, at Welshpool and other places. Having suffered great destruction of property at the hands of Glendower, and seeing no hope of the insurrection being put down by the English, they resolved to take the matter into their own hands. Fifteen hundred of them gathered, secretly, and surrounded Glendower in one of his mountain intrenchments.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{aspect to}} {{consider}} when choosing between disposable diapers and cloth diapers is cost. [...] It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable diapers before being potty-trained. [...] In contrast, cloth diapers, while initially more expensive than disposables, cost as low as $300 for a basic <b>set</b> of <b>cloth</b> diapers, although costs can rise with more expensive options. [...] The cost of washing and drying diapers must also be considered. [...] The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} {{view of the}} dining room of the Potter Hotel, Santa Barbara, ca. 1915. At least four rows of circular tables <b>set</b> with table <b>cloths</b> and four place settings can be seen in a large room. Light bulbs emerge from the ceiling. Pillars are visible throughout the room, while doors can be seen at {{the far side of the}} room. Additional information: The Hotel was destroyed by a fire in 1921 and never rebuilt...|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} {{pleasant}} at night. Two tall, dark screens hid the two beds. In front, the piano {{was littered with}} music, the desk littered with papers. Lilly went out on to the landing, and set the chops to grill on the gas stove. Hastily he put a small table on the hearth-rug, spread it with a blue-and-white <b>cloth,</b> <b>set</b> plates and glasses. Aaron did not move. It was not his nature to concern himself with domestic matters--and Lilly did it best alone.|$|R
50|$|De la Court {{studied at}} Leiden University and {{completed}} his education with a Grand Tour through Europe in 1641 - 1643. He went to London, Saumur (France), Geneva and Basle. The diary he kept during his journey has been preserved and {{was published in}} 1928. After returning to Leiden, De la Court entered his father's profession and <b>set</b> up a <b>cloth</b> trading firm with his brother Johan. By 1650 the firm of the two brothers had evolved {{into one of the}} leading cloth operations in.|$|R
5000|$|West of the {{printing}} mill, the Quequechan Mill {{was built in}} 1826. It was called the [...] "New Pocasset" [...] and was leased for a yarn mill. Considered an extremely large mill for its time, it was a five story stone building that was 319 ft long and 48 feet wide. It contained 16,392 spindles and 492 looms. It was in the Quequechan Mill that Holder Borden <b>set</b> up the <b>cloth</b> printing business that would later become the American Print Works. This mill was demolished about 1880 for expansion of Pocasset Mills #2 and #3.|$|R
60|$|After he had eaten, {{he poured}} the sweetmeats into my lap; {{and the wine}} being out, he called his gentleman again {{to take away the}} table, who, at first, only took the cloth and the remains of what was to eat away; and, laying another <b>cloth,</b> <b>set</b> the table {{on one side of the}} room with a noble service of plate upon it, worth at least two hundred pistoles. Then, having set the two {{decanters}} again upon the table, filled as before, he withdrew; for I found the fellow understood his business very well, and his lord's business too.|$|R
60|$|From the church, {{a street}} {{leads to the}} market-place, in which I found a throng of men and women, it being market-day; wares of various kinds, tin, earthen, and <b>cloth,</b> <b>set</b> out on the pavements; droves of pigs; ducks and fowls; baskets of eggs; and a man selling quack medicines, recommending his nostrums {{as well as he}} could. The aspect of the crowd was very English,--portly and ruddy women; yeomen with small-clothes and broad-brimmed hats, all very quiet and heavy and good-humored. Their dialect was so provincial that I could not readily {{understand}} more than here and there a word.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 Ludwig Mueller {{purchased}} {{the building and}} <b>set</b> up a <b>cloth</b> mill. The whole process of production was brought together under one roof. Like most other regional mills Mueller offered coarse woollen cloth, loden and uniform cloth. The machinery - bought in the years around 1900 - and the new steam engine from 1903 set the production on a firm basis. This equipment never happened to be altered until the final shut down. After Mueller's death in 1929, his son Kurt Mueller led the mill. In 1961, the mill was finally closed, {{due to lack of}} orders.|$|R

60|$|Thus Sir Tristram made sport all one morning, in such {{an autumn}} season, and when noon had come he found himself to be anhungered. So he gave orders {{to those who were}} in {{attendance}} upon him that food should be spread at a certain open space in the forest; and therewith, in accordance with those orders, they in attendance immediately opened sundry hampers of wicker, and therefrom brought forth a noble pasty of venison, and manchets of bread and nuts and apples and several flasks and flagons of noble wine of France and the Rhine countries. This abundance of good things they <b>set</b> upon a <b>cloth</b> as white as snow which they had laid out upon the ground.|$|R
5000|$|In a large {{container}} combine the cornflour (or cornflour and grated cassava) {{with just enough}} warm water to dampen all of it. Mix well.

Fermentation may take longer than two days, especially in cool climates. (Note: a warmed oven is an oven that has been heated {{for a few minutes and}} turned off. The flour should ferment, not cooked [...] ). When it is properly fermented, it should have a slightly sour, but not unpleasant, aroma, like rising bread dough. Overly fermented cornflour will not taste right.|$|R
60|$|I advanced, {{and after}} a moment's pause, with the silver-broidered hem of the pall in my hands, I {{suddenly}} swept off that mantle of black <b>cloth,</b> <b>setting</b> up such {{a gust of wind}} as all but quenched the tapers. I caught up the bench on which I had been sitting, and, dragging it forward, I mounted it and stood now with my breast on a level with the coffin-lid. I laid hands on it and found it unfastened. Without thought or care of how I went about the thing, I raised it and let it crash over to the ground. It fell on the stone flags with a noise like that of thunder, which boomed and reverberated along the gloomy vault above.|$|R

[...] Then {{he goes to the}} table, <b>sets</b> the <b>cloth</b> {{straight}} mechanically, picks up the newspaper ANNA has let fall to the floor and sits down in the rocking-chair. He stares at the paper for a while, then puts it on table, holds {{his head in his hands}} and sighs drearily. The noise of a man's heavy footsteps comes from the deck outside and there is a loud knock on the door. CHRIS starts, makes a move as if to get up and go to the door, then thinks better of it and sits still. The knock is repeated--then as no answer comes, the door is flung open and MAT BURKE appears. CHRIS scowls at the intruder and his hand instinctively goes back to the sheath knife on his hip. BURKE is dressed up--wears a cheap blue suit, a striped cotton shirt with a black tie, and black shoes newly shined. His face is beaming with good humor.] ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} quarter of the century native Russian plays {{gradually}} increased their share. Maly performances included works by Vasily Zhukovsky, Alexander Griboyedov (Woe from Wit 1831 featuring both Shchepkin and Pavel Mochalov). Alexander Pushkin (Ruslan and Ludmila 1825, The Fountain of Bakhchisaray 1827, The Gypsies 1832) and lesser known, now forgotten authors. In three decades, from the 1820s to the 1840s, the theatre shed the over-dramatization of vaudeville and romanticism and replaced it with [...] "something approaching a realistic style that we would recognize today." [...] The former Vargin House was expanded to its present size by Konstantin Thon between 1838 and 1840. The new stage allowed use of elaborate box sets that became standard practice at Maly, while Bolshoy conservatively relied on primitive wing-and-border <b>cloth</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
50|$|He next awakes {{upon the}} shores of a mysterious river, naked and hairless. All around him are other people in a similar situation. Shortly after they awaken, a nearby structure, nicknamed a 'grailstone', causes food and other {{supplies}} {{to appear in the}} 'grails' bound to each individual. Burton quickly attracts a group of companions: the neanderthal Kazzintuitruaabemss (nicknamed Kazz), the science fiction author Peter Jairus Frigate, and Alice Liddell. Among these is the extraterrestrial Monat Grrautut, earlier part {{of a small group of}} beings from Tau Ceti who had arrived on Earth in the early 21st century. When one of their number was accidentally killed by humans, their spaceship automatically killed all the people on Earth. Frigate and others alive at the time confirm Monat's story. Retreating into the nearby woods for safety, Burton's party chew gum provided by their grails, and discover that this gum is a powerful hallucinogen. As days and weeks pass, people's physical wants are provided for by the grails, which eventually produce a <b>set</b> of <b>cloths</b> used for clothing. Rumors reach Burton's region that the river continues seemingly forever. One night, Burton is visited by a mysterious cloaked figure, whom Burton dubs 'The Mysterious Stranger', who explains that he is one of the beings who has constructed this world and resurrected humanity on its shores, and tells Burton to approach the headwaters of the river.|$|R
50|$|The Virgin {{seated on}} a cushion placed {{directly}} {{on the ground with}} the child standing on her lap, holds a vase in her left hand which contains roses and a lily, symbols of motherhood and purity. The Child, who is also holding a lily, rests his forehead on his mother's cheek. They are <b>set</b> under a <b>cloth</b> of honour made of gold and black embroidered brocade held by three angels, while two more angels are seated on the ground playing an organ and a lute. The monumental figures, the splendour of the clothes, the modulated light {{and the use of the}} blue colour place this panel in the purest fifteenth-century Italian style. The work has been identified as the one described by Giorgio Vasari in 1568 in the home of the Gondi family, in Florence, where it formed part of a polyptic.|$|R
5000|$|Livingston is {{currently}} a recurring character on Fox Network's new hit show Empire as Chicken, Hakeem's best friend and DJ. In 2009, Livingston appeared in the award-winning film Precious.

After her stint on Top Model, Livingston acquired a role on the gay television series, DTLA, which airs on OUTtv and Logo. Working alongside actresses Melanie Griffith and Sandra Bernhard, Livingston plays the role of Ricki, who is Griffith's girlfriend on the show.

5000|$|Homecoming week {{is full of}} {{tradition}} at HHSS. The week is designated spirit week with each day allowing the students to dress in a certain fashion not normally acceptable by rule (e.i.

The event starts with a parade down Dixieland Road featuring floats which representatives from participating clubs ride on. The parade {{is followed by a}} special homecoming pep rally. The night concludes with the traditional Burning of the [...] "HS" [...] by the Harlingen South FFA. A large steel [...] "HS" [...] is wrapped in <b>cloth</b> <b>set</b> up in a field near the school and set on fire.

25|$|As {{the sixteenth}} century drew to a close, and while the seventeenth was still young, the towns-folk of Leeds secured in the first {{instance}} at their own cost, in the second by a strictly limited Royal favour two important privileges—the right of electing their own vicar and of governing themselves in municipal affairs. In 1583 the town bought the advowson of the parish church from its then possessor, Oliver Darnley, for £130, and henceforth the successive vicars were chosen by a body of trustees—the most notably successful experiment in popular election which has ever been known in the National Church. In 1626, Leeds received its first charter of incorporation from Charles I. The charter, premising that Leeds in the County of York is an ancient and populous town, whose inhabitants are well acquainted with the Art and Mystery of making Woollen <b>Cloths,</b> <b>sets</b> up a governing body of one Alderman, nine Burgesses, and twenty Assistants. But the privilege for some years was a limited one: the Crown reserved to itself the rights of appointment to any of the thirty vacancies which might occur by death: popular election did not come for some time.|$|R
