5000|$|All {{crew members}} were rescued, and an attempt <b>to</b> <b>salvage</b> the <b>cargo</b> {{resulted}} in only about 20% being saved.

50|$|Wrecking in the Florida Keys was {{conducted}} from sailing vessels. Numerous vessels would patrol along the Florida Reef looking for wrecks. The wreckers would normally anchor {{at night in}} protected anchorages along the Keys, and then sail {{out in the morning}} to see if any ships had wrecked during the night. As a result, a ship that ran on the reef during the night might attract a dozen wreckers by the afternoon of the next day. The first wrecking captain to reach a stranded ship became the wreck master, determining how many wreckers he needed <b>to</b> help <b>salvage</b> the ship, and directing the operation. Wreckers had an obligation to save passengers and crew of the wrecked ship (for which they received no compensation), and <b>to</b> <b>salvage</b> as much of the cargo as possible, and the ship, as well. If the judge in Federal court decided that a wrecking crew had not done everything possible <b>to</b> <b>salvage</b> <b>cargo</b> and ship, he would reduce the award.|$|R

Their ship, the gasoline schooner Barbara Hernster, struck a reef near Providence Bay, Siberia, July 28, 1905, and the family reached shore by boat through heavy surf. The ship was subsequently refloated and beached, and Swenson contracted <b>to</b> <b>salvage</b> the <b>cargo</b> in exchange for a share.

25|$|Born {{and raised}} in Michigan, Swenson first reached the far north as a Nome {{prospector}} in 1901. The next year he signed on for a prospecting venture in Siberia, spending two summers and one winter on the Chukchi Peninsula. He returned to Siberia in 1905, this time {{with his wife and}} their infant son. His introduction to trading came when their ship was wrecked and he contracted <b>to</b> <b>salvage</b> <b>cargo</b> on a share basis. He continued to trade at Anadyr until 1911. In 1913, Swenson and C.L. Hibbard of Seattle formed the Hibbard-Swenson Company which operated trading schooners and steamers on the Siberian coast, buying furs and ivory and trading a variety of general merchandise until 1921. Swenson continued this business as Olaf Swenson & Co. until 1923 when the Bolshevik victory led to seizure of his business. Two years of negotiations led to a contract with the Soviet government to supply goods on a cost-plus basis and buy furs. This arrangement persisted through 1930. The difficulties of getting furs and personnel out of the Siberian Arctic led to the first commercial flights across the Bering Strait. The fourth such flight crashed in a Siberian winter storm, killing aviation pioneer Carl Ben Eielson and his mechanic in 1929. Swenson's memoir Northwest of the World contains observations on commerce, conditions, and native life in northeast Siberia and won critical praise for its direct style and vivid description.|$|R
