Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young <b>shoots.</b> <b>A</b> 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E

5|$|For the Meteora <b>shoots,</b> <b>a</b> Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E

However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael.

To afford Kartik's fees, Meghna <b>shoots</b> <b>a</b> lingerie advertisement; she is mentored by another aspiring model, Janet (Mugdha Godse). Meghna's lingerie photos appear {{on the cover of}} a magazine; her relatives in Mumbai see the cover and ask her to leave the house. She moves into an apartment with Maanav.

5|$|Before doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' {{house to}} try to {{convince}} Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and <b>shoots</b> <b>a</b> doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and lets him keep Shiloh.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{track down}} Weems, a {{handyman}} at an apartment building. He refuses {{to testify against}} Cutrona. Weems has a fascination with Rube Goldberg machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Scully concludes {{that there is no}} X-File, but Mulder believes that his luck is the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in an improbable cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom (when he forgot the car keys), he accidentally <b>shoots</b> <b>a</b> lamp that knocks over an ironing board, then trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder notes that Weems was the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.|$|E

5|$|Wood <b>shoots</b> <b>a</b> {{film with}} Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers from Outer Space would result in a box office success, and {{generate}} enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's stand-in for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol, Orson Welles. Filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of Plan 9, Wood and O'Hara go to Las Vegas to get married.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} {{development and}} pre-production which took four months for scripting, the film started the first schedule {{in the forests}} of Chalakudy in Kerala with Karthi, Reemma Sen and Andrea during October 2007. The project developed a reputation for its gruelling <b>shoots,</b> <b>a</b> novel concept in Tamil films, {{at an early stage}} of production. Thirty-five days into the shoot, Selvaraghavan gave a statement that the film was forty percent over and the film should release by May 2008 whilst also mentioning that rains in Kerala led to the budget going over expectations two months into the project. In January 2008, the unit moved to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to shoot in the deserts in the region, however they were delayed again by unseasonal rains. Missing its original release date, the film's progress carried on through 2008, with shooting occurring {{towards the end of the}} year inside sets at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. In the studios, choreographer Shivshankar composed a classical dance for Reemma Sen and Parthiepan, and the sequence was shot over twenty days. Shooting carried on in sets for three more months with second half scenes being recorded. Shoots in all regions were tough and demanding for the crew as the film featured more than three thousand junior artistes from a variety of unions across India, with the language barrier becoming a problem. The project, eighteen months into shoot, soon began to face questions about its progress, with the producer, Ravindran, having to complain to the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look for his next film, Paiyaa, following the long period he had spent with Aayirathil Oruvan. In February 2009, filming was completed after 263 days of shooting; therefore the producers signaled for a summer release but it was postponed by six months.|$|E
