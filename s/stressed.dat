5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables are <b>stressed,</b> while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. <b>Stressed</b> syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in <b>stressed</b> syllables are not. Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in <b>stressed</b> or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|First, short vowels {{lengthened}} {{in an open}} syllable in pretonic position (i.e. directly {{before the}} <b>stressed</b> syllable).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} rhythm, English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning {{that the amount of}} time between <b>stressed</b> syllables tends to be equal. <b>Stressed</b> syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{fundamental}} concept of <b>stress</b> is necessary due to {{it leads to}} comprehending deeply regarding what <b>stress</b> is. Principally, there models of <b>stress</b> confirm what <b>stress</b> is and how <b>stress</b> occurs on human. First, the stimulus model of <b>stress</b> is the treating environments that stimulate individual to perceive <b>stress.</b> Second, the response model of <b>stress</b> is a bodily reaction {{to the source of}} <b>stress.</b> Third, the transactional model of <b>stress</b> is the evaluation process to the sources of <b>stress</b> between person and treating environment. Accordingly, <b>stress</b> can occur when individual deals with the unexpected environments or threatening situations. <b>Stress</b> can become eustress (positive) or distress (negative) for someone who perceives <b>stress.</b> If the ability to deal with <b>stress</b> is not sufficient and demands are excessive, <b>stress</b> will increase continuously. Consequently, <b>stress</b> contributes negatively on physical and psychological health. Therefore, the awareness toward <b>stress</b> and its symptoms is likely to avoid from the negative consequence of <b>stress...</b>|$|R

5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are <b>stressed</b> on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is <b>stressed,</b> while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is <b>stressed.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>stress</b> {{placed on}} syllables within words is called word <b>stress</b> or lexical <b>stress.</b> Some {{languages}} have fixed <b>stress,</b> {{meaning that the}} <b>stress</b> on virtually any multisyllable word falls on a particular syllable, such as the first or the penultimate. Other languages, like English, have variable <b>stress,</b> where the position of <b>stress</b> in a word is not predictable in that way. Sometimes more than one level of <b>stress,</b> such as primary <b>stress</b> and secondary <b>stress,</b> may be identified. However, some languages, such as French and Mandarin, are sometimes analyzed as lacking lexical <b>stress</b> entirely.|$|R

5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is <b>stressed</b> in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is <b>stressed</b> in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E

Where applied initial <b>stress</b> (or fault strength) is high, <b>stress</b> perturbation caused by the mainshock is relatively negligible, and local <b>stress</b> tensor is consistent with regional <b>stress,</b> while in a region under low initial <b>stress</b> (or low fault strength), <b>stress</b> perturbation from the mainshock, relative to the initial <b>stress,</b> is large and the local <b>stress</b> tensor can deviate from the regional <b>stress.</b>|$|R

5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are <b>stressed</b> on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a <b>stressed</b> syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from <b>stressed</b> bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from <b>stressed</b> interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from <b>stressed</b> and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly <b>stressed</b> rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E
