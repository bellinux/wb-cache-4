40|$|Maternal {{immunity}} {{was shown}} to be an effector mechanism which does not include transfer of memory. 'Boosting' of maternal immunity <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> was not effective. Transferred maternal immunity negatively interfered with the induction of optimal protection <b>by</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Antibody formation was not observed after vaccination of maternally immune piglets. In contrast, induction of memory had occurred in animals under maternal immune suppression. Vaccination in young animals negatively interfered with or abrogated, effective maternal immune protection. There was no correlation between specific serum antibody titres in piglets and protection to PRV. Thus apart from protection provided by antibodies contributions of other soluble factors and the cellular immune compartment as represented in colostrum and/or milk were important for protection...|$|R
40|$|In {{the twentieth}} century vaccine {{development}} has moved {{from the use of}} attenuated or killed micro-organisms to protein sub-unit vaccines, with vaccine immunogenicity assessed by measuring antibodies induced <b>by</b> <b>vaccination.</b> However, for many infectious diseases T cells {{are an important part of}} naturally acquired protective immune responses, and inducing these <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> has been the aim of much research. The progress that has been made in developing effective T-cell-inducing vaccines against viral and parasitic diseases such as HIV and malaria is discussed, along with recent developments in therapeutic vaccine development for chronic viral infections and cancer. Although many ways of inducing T cells <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> have been assessed, the majority result in low level, non-protective responses. Sufficient clinical research has now been conducted to establish that replication-deficient viral vectored vaccines lead the field in inducing strong and broad responses, and efficacy studies of T-cell-inducing vaccines against a number of diseases are finally demonstrating that this is a valid approach to filling the gaps in our defence against not only infectious disease, but some forms of cancer. © 2011 The Author.

40|$|T-cell receptors (TCRs) {{govern the}} specificity, efficacy, and {{cross-reactivity}} of CD 8 T cells. Here, we studied CD 8 T-cell clonotypes from Mane-A* 10 + pigtail macaques {{responding to the}} simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag KP 9 epitope in a setting of vaccination and subsequent viral challenge. We observed a diverse TCR repertoire after DNA, recombinant poxvirus, and live attenuated virus vaccination, with none of 59 vaccine-induced KP 9 -specific TCRs being identical between macaques. The KP 9 -specific TCR repertoires remained diverse after SIV or simian-human immunodeficiency virus challenge but, remarkably, exhibited substantially different clonotypic compositions compared to the corresponding populations prechallenge. Within serial samples from individual pigtail macaques, only a small subset (33. 9 %) of TCRs induced <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> were maintained or expanded after challenge. Most (66. 1 %) of the TCRs induced <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> were not detectable after challenge. Our results suggest that some CD 8 T cells induced <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> are more efficient than others at responding to a viral challenge. These findings have implications for future AIDS virus vaccine studies, which should consider the “fitness” of vaccine-induced T cells in order to generate robust responses {{in the face of}} virus exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{antibody}} orienting {{effects of}} prior infections with antigenic variants of influenza viruses were confirmed by studies with monovalent adjuvant vaccines and with polyvalent aqueous and adjuvant preparations.

Moreover, the effects of exposure <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{were found to be}} durable and to constitute a foundation upon which future antibody dividends could be accumulated.

40|$|AbstractIt {{is unknown}} which HIV {{proteins}} to target <b>by</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{in order to}} generate the most effective CD 8 T-cell immunity. We recently immunized SIVmac 251 -infected pigtail macaques with Gag peptides or a cocktail of peptides spanning all SIV proteins, including SIV Env. High-level SIV Env-specific CD 8 T-cell responses were generated and 7 novel Env-specific CD 8 T-cell epitopes in 10 animals were mapped. Env-specific CD 8 T-cell responses were significantly inferior to Gag-specific responses, and no better than unvaccinated control animals, in the control of SIV replication and prevention of disease. Escape mutations emerged within several Env-specific CTL epitopes, suggesting at least some pressure imparted by the Env CTL responses, but this did not correlate with significantly reduced SIV replication.
