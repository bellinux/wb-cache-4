60|$|Your Lordships will {{observe that}} this new sale {{of the office of}} ministers succeeded to the sale of that of nabobs. All these varied and <b>successive</b> <b>sales</b> shook the country to pieces. As if those miserable {{exhausted}} provinces were to be cured of inanition by phlebotomy, while Cossim Ali was racking it above, the Company were drawing off all its nutriment below. A dreadful, an extensive, and most chargeable war followed. Half the northern force of India poured down like a torrent on Bengal, endangered our existence, and exhausted all our resources. The war was the fruit of Mr. Hastings's cabals. Its termination, as usual, {{was the result of the}} military merit and the fortune of this nation. Cossim Ali, after having been defeated toy the military genius and spirit of England, (for the Adamses, Monroes, and others of that period, I believe, showed as much skill and bravery as any of their predecessors,) in his flight swept away above three millions in money, jewels, or effects, out of a country which he had plundered and exhausted by his unheard-of exactions. However, he fought his way like a retiring lion, turning his face to his pursuers. He still fought along his frontier. His ability and his money drew to his cause the Subahdar of Oude, the famous Sujah ul Dowlah. The Mogul entered into these wars, and penetrated into the lower provinces on one side, whilst Bulwant Sing, the Rajah of Benares, entered them on another. After various changes of party and changes of fortune, the loss which began in the treachery of the civil service was, as I have before remarked, redeemed by military merit. Many examples of the same sort have since been seen.|$|E

50|$|Château de Curton {{remained}} {{the property of}} the Family Chabannes de Lapalice. In 1563, Curton Castle was made a marquisat for François de Chabannes. The castle was confiscated during the French Revolution and sold as national propert to Citizen Rabeau. From this time, it was passed on through <b>successive</b> <b>sales</b> and weddings.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, {{the yellow}} stamp made {{headlines}} {{when it was}} sold by David Feldman for 977,500 Swiss francs. It was resold in 1990 for over $1,000,000. Then, in 1996 it sold again for 2,880,000 Swiss francs. Each <b>successive</b> <b>sale</b> was a world record price for a postage stamp.|$|R
50|$|<b>Successive</b> land <b>sales</b> {{allowed the}} Newhalls to {{maintain}} their lifestyle, but William (who was known by his middle name Mayo), a graduate of Yale University, understood that they needed {{a better way to}} generate income. After a few more land sales, Mayo took the income and reinvested it into the land by developing agriculture. The land around their headquarters, the former Rancho San Francisco, was cleared for citrus trees, and lima beans were planted in the Sacramento Valley. The income from these crops allowed the company to grow in the 1920s. Additionally, one more land sale, a 38,000 acre (150 km²) parcel in 1922 to William Randolph Hearst for $1 million (to be paid in installments over ten years) helped fill the company's coffers.|$|R
40|$|In the EU {{the author}} of an {{original}} artwork enjoys 'Droit de suite', a right to an economic interest in <b>successive</b> commercial <b>sales</b> of that work. This is intended to ensure that artists benefit from successive 'exploitations' of their work. The ensuing royalty is {{a percentage of the}} sale price. It is argued that it worsens the position of contemporary artists, but diminishes trade in the tertiary art market, is detrimental to their position on the international art market for those states introducing it and is severely anti-redistributive. It diminishes purchasers' property rights, reducing the price of artworks. This most severely affects early career artists who value the ensuing marginal decreases in income most highly, but whose work has not yet reached the secondary market.

50|$|During the French Revolution {{the monks}} were {{expelled}} and the abbey was {{sold as a}} national property on 1 May 1791 to a Parisian named Chauffrey. In 1795, three <b>successive</b> <b>sales</b> dispersed the furniture and numerous paintings. In 1799 the abbey was acquired by Englishman William Russell, who lived there until 1814. He made the church, for a time, a Protestant temple.|$|E

50|$|The {{lands that}} now {{belong to the}} towns of El Palomar and Caseros, Buenos Aires were given by Juan de Garay to Captain Juan Ruiz in the second {{foundation}} of Buenos Aires Province on 1580, thus the locals called the place Cañada de Ruiz. There were two camps 1.600 yards wide; a league background starting in Río de las Conchas, now Reconquista River.

As Lenovo’s president and CEO, he oversaw the integration of the IBM PC Division, which the company purchased in 2005 for $1.75 billion. Lenovo, with 30,000 employees, experienced an annual revenue growth increase from $13 billion to $15 billion by 2008 under his leadership. During that period the company grew its brand internationally and, for seven <b>successive</b> quarters, had <b>sales</b> profits greater than the market.Amelio's three-year contract was not renewed after Lenovo posted a 2008 fourth quarter loss of $97 million.|$|R

The seller, Prospero Soynard, was an [...] "owner" [...] by profession, 4 rentier and investor, who had acquired five acres of agricultural land (about 1.75 ha) south of the road of Hortaleza and was dividing their property into small plots to sell. Since 1862, <b>successive</b> subdivision and <b>sale</b> of the surrounding land by the owners was giving the fledgling village {{of a large number of}} houses.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} from 1620 until the 1980s {{the seat of}} the Earls of Craven. William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608-1697) built a mansion there, {{originally}} intended as a residence for Charles I's sister, Elizabeth of Bohemia, although she died before construction began. It burnt down in 1718. The Cravens later expanded a hunting lodge to live in instead, and this still stands, privately occupied, in the centre of Hamstead Park. Until the mid-twentieth century the Craven family owned most of the village, but <b>successive</b> <b>sales</b> by the estate have made owner-occupancy slightly greater than the proportion of rented property.|$|E

40|$|Droit de suite (DDS) is the right, {{enjoyed by}} the author 1 of an {{original}} work of art, to an economic interest in its <b>successive</b> <b>sales.</b> According to the Directive of the European Parliament, 2 the right is supposed to ensure that artists benefit from successive "exploitations" 3 of their work. All EU countries have {{to comply with the}} Directive before January 1, 2006, though derogations are possible until January 2010. In principle, the right extends to all resales, with the exception of those effected between persons acting in their private capacity. The royalty is calculated {{as a percentage of the}} sale price, and not of the increase in value of works whose original value has increased. Economists who have analysed the economic consequences of DDS have generally reached the conclusion that it is inefficient. Those who are in favour of its introduction tend to concentrate upon the uneven bargaining position between the artist and the art dealer, and condemn the profits that the dealers and auction houses supposedly reap from the artist's labour. Whether or not these injustices can b...|$|E
40|$|If {{forecasts}} {{of economic activity}} are to rely on preliminary data, the predictable component of the data revisions {{should be taken into}} account. This paper applies the Kalman filter to improve the forecast accuracy of published preliminary estimates of retail <b>sales.</b> <b>Successive</b> estimates of retail sales are modeled jointly as a vector autoregressive process, incorporating panel rotation and calendar effects. Estimates of retail sales based on this model are then combined with the raw Census estimates via the Kalman filter. This technique, which may be applied to other bodies of data, yields a significant improvement in the efficiency of the raw Census data, reducing the mean-squared error by about 1 / 3.

40|$|Ethiopia is {{predominantly}} an agricultural {{country with the}} vast majority of its population directly involved in the production of crops and livestock. It contributes for about 46. 7 % of the GDP and provides employment for 85 % of the population (CSA, 2006). It also accounts for highest proportion of the export revenue and contributes significant amount in supply of raw materials requirements of the country’s industries. However, for various reasons Ethiopia’s agriculture is characterized by its subsistent nature. When the issue of economic growth and development of the country is raised, one has {{to take into account the}} performance of the smallholder farmers. Reducing the challenges they are facing and utilizing their potentials can help to accelerate the agricultural sector and economic development of the country as a whole. Agricultural cooperatives are an ideal means for self-reliance, higher productivity level and promotion of agricultural development. In Ethiopia many cooperative unions are being established to strengthen the existing primary level cooperatives by pooling their scarce resources and increasing their bargaining power. However, the union’s management lacks the required knowledge and training in managing their resources. Therefore, skill development training is also required in resource management, use of funds and conditions which will enable those unions to stand by themselves as competent entities. The development of an efficient and equitable grain marketing system is a critical component for improving food security in Ethiopia, increasing both food availability and food access. Well functioning grain markets benefit both producers and consumers by reducing marketing margins and the transaction costs. This research is conducted to assess grain marketing performance through Assosa woreda primary multi-purpose cooperative societies. Assosa woreda is selected for the study due to its greatest potential among other woredas of the region. Data were collected from two sources known as primary sources and secondary sources. Primary data were gathered through interviews using structured interview schedules and check lists. Secondary data were gathered to support the information collected from primary sources. These were from reports and records of the cooperative societies, regional and woreda agriculture and rural development bureaus, regional finance and economic development bureau, the statistics authority regional office etc. Tools used for collection of primary data were structured interview schedules. In addition, group discussions were conducted with the key communicators of the woreda. JMP 5 software was employed for analysis of primary data collected through interview schedules. According to the multivariate correlation test, education level and access to market information are positively correlated indicating that the higher the education level, the better would be the knowledge of the farmer to acquire news and education about the benefits of the cooperatives. This education level is also found to have a positive relationship with the farmer’s level of participation in his/her society. Multivariate Correlation test of farm size and marketed surplus has shown also a positive relationship. The positive relationship can indicate that an increase in one of the two could be an evidence for increase in the other. Size of family is found to have negative influence on marketed surplus. Through simple linear regression, it is found that an increase in family member by 1 brings a decrease in marketed surplus by 2. 11 quintals. Availability of market infrastructures, access to inputs and access to credit services are analyzed using rating scales and checklists. Grain varieties marketed through the cooperatives were Maize, Sorghum and Niger seed. The past three <b>successive</b> years’ <b>sales</b> data was taken from the sample societies’ records and analyzed to assess the year-to-year increase/decrease in annual gross sales and gross profit. Constraints of grain marketing performance were found to have two aspects. These are production constraints and marketing constraints. Under production constraints are farmland scarcity, soil degradation, weed and pests, lack of input supply, poor extension services and weather shocks etc. Marketing constraints include lack of capital, lack of timely and accurate market information, lack of storage facilities, poor roads & high transport costs, poor marketing management and lack of trainings on marketing and related business issues...|$|R
40|$|In Cannon Mills and Kannapolis, Tim Vanderburg {{critically}} {{examines the}} rise of the Cannon Mills textile company and the North Carolina community that grew up around it. Beginning with the founding of the company and the establishment of its mill town by James W. Cannon, the author draws on a wealth of primary sources to show how, under Cannon’s paternalism, workers developed a collective identity and for generations accepted the limits this paternalism placed on their freedom. After exploring the growth and maturation of Cannon Mills against the backdrop of World War I and its aftermath, Vanderburg examines the impact of the Great Depression and World War II and then analyzes the postwar market forces that, along with federal policies and unionization, set in motion the industry’s shift from a paternalistic model to bureaucratic authority. The final section of the book traces the decline of paternalism and the eventual decline of Cannon Mills when the death of the founder’s son, Charles Cannon, led to three <b>successive</b> <b>sales</b> of the company. Pillowtex, its final owner, filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated in 2003. [URL]...|$|E
