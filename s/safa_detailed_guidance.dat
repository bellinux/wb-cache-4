40|$|Today's {{software}} is often subject to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities. Since {{in the area}} of security, vulnerabilities are hard to find, quality assurance needs <b>detailed</b> <b>guidance.</b> Focusing on early quality assurance, we propose Security Inspection Scenarios as reading support for static quality assurance.

As the vulnerabilities are partly dependent on the operating system and programming language used, we need to build generic scenarios and instantiate them. In this paper, we show how to create Security Inspection Scenarios, accompanied by a short example demonstrating their usage. After an analysis of the possible benefits of our approach, a proposal for an evaluation is presented. We assume our scenarios support practitioners in a beneficial way and are applicable in most development lifecycles which are interested in security aspects...|$|R
