Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881. Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies. Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures. Individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.|$|E

Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E

At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>of</b> the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E

Pictures are not only a source of fascination for artists, who produce them, but also for scientists, who analyse the perceptual effects they induce. Illusions provide the glue to cement the art and science of vision. Painters plumb the art of observation itself whereas scientists peer into the processes of perception. Both visual artists and scientists have produced patterns that perplex our perceptions and present us with puzzles that we are pleased to peruse. Art and illusionists presents these two poles of pictorial representation as well as presenting novel ‘perceptual portraits’ of the artists and scientists who have augmented the art of illusion. The reader can experience the paradoxes of pictures as well as producing their own by using the stereoscopic glasses enclosed and the transparent overlay for making dynamic moiré patterns...|$|R
25|$|Georgescu {{points out}} that Earth is a closed system in the {{thermodynamic}} sense of the term: Earth exchanges energy, but not matter (practically) {{with the rest of}} the universe. Hence, mainly two sources of 'low entropy' are available to man, namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the Earth; and the flow of radiation, received from the Sun. Since the Sun will continue to shine for billions of years to come, the Earth's mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy. Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the crust of the Earth at a rate of our own choosing (practically), the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the Earth at a constant and fixed rate, beyond human control. This natural 'asymmetry' between man's access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life: The busy urban life, on the one hand, is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals; the tranquil rural life, on the other hand, is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy. Georgescu {{points out that}} this 'asymmetry' helps explaining the historical subjection of the countryside by the town <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>of</b> civilisation, and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this subjection properly into account in his theory of historical materialism.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 100 years, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>dawning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modernist {{era in the}} 19 th century, there have been major {{developments}} {{in the fields of}} art practice and theory, altering the course of art history. Changes that occurred in the late 1960 s saw the emergence of a conceptual era of art, in which the emphasis and value within art altered; an art object's value was no longer inherent within that object. Rather value was applied through cultural context and what the artworks means. This is particularly evident in the growing environmental art movement. Environmental art is an expansive movement that involves an artistic process or artwork where the artist actively engages with the environment. It is a widely diverse discipline encompassing small personal works, including earth/body art and performance, to permanent, large-scale works. Through specific themed chapters, this thesis aims to establish some of the ways the paradigm of environmental art has evolved since its beginnings in the 1960 s. This will be achieved through investigations of three dominant themes and forms of interaction, within environmental art. This thesis focuses on the areas of environmental art that clearly illustrate key concepts in the movement. It explores concepts within feminist art, linking with Ecofeminism; presents investigations into large-scale environmental projects, the most prominent examples of the movement, and lastly, examines works that interact with the idea of ephemerality and the changing role of the gallery.
