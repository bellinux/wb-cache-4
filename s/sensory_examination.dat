40|$|Abstract The genetic causes {{underlying}} epilepsy {{remain largely}} unknown, {{and the impact}} of available genetic data on the nosology of epilepsy is still limited. Thus, at present, classification of epileptic disorders should be mainly based on electroclinical features. Electro-clinical syndrome is a term used to identify a group of clinical entities showing a cluster of electro-clinical characteristics, with signs and symptoms that together define a distinctive, recognizable, clinical disorder. These often become the focus of treatment trials as well as of genetic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging investigations. They are distinctive disorders identifiable {{on the basis of a}} typical age onset, specific EEG characteristics, seizure types, and often other features which, when taken together, permit a specific diagnosis which, in turn, often has implications for treatment, management, and prognosis. Each electro-clinical syndrome can be classified according to age at onset, cognitive and developmental antecedents and consequences, motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>examinations,</b> EEG features, provoking or triggering factors, and patterns of seizure occurrence with respect to sleep. Therefore, according to the age at onset, here we review the more frequently observed paediatric electro-clinical syndrome from their clinical-EEG, genetic and therapeutic point of views. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{woman with}} wrist pain A woman {{presented}} with left wrist pain. The patient was the restrained driver in {{a motor vehicle}} accident. On examination, there was tenderness along the ulnar aspect of the distal forearm. Radial pulses were palpable, and motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>examinations</b> were intact. Radiographs were obtained (figures 1 and 2). Pronator quadratus fat pad sign. The pronator quadratus muscle connects the anterior distal radius and ulna. A layer of fat separates the muscle from the flexor digitorum profundus muscles. Normally, this fat plane appears as a thin radiolucency immediately adjacent and parallel to the radius on radiographs. In patients with distal forearm fractures, blood may displace the fat plane anteriorly and create the pronator quadratus fat pad sign (figure 1). 1 False-negatives occur if radiographs are poor quality or obtained before blood can accumulate, or if fractures are not under the pronator quadratus muscle. False-positives occur in some arthritides, infections and soft tissue injuries. Sensitivity and specificity of the sign are 26 – 65 % and 70 %, respectively. 1 2 Patients with a positive fat pad sign but other-wise normal radiographs may require additional imaging to assess for fracture.

40|$|In 60 {{cases of}} rectal cancer who {{underwent}} sphincter-preserving operations between 1962 and 1975, post-operative ano-rectal functions were examined {{by means of}} subjective symptoms, digital examination through the anal canal, the pressure inside the anal canal, electromyography of the external sphincter, anal canal <b>sensory</b> <b>examinations,</b> reflex of the internal sphincter and radiography of the rectum. In 28 cases of anterior resection, the post-operative ano-rectal functions were good {{as long as there}} was no stenosis in the junction part. In patients who underwent the invagination type operation, the ano-rectal functions were also good as in the anterior resection cases. In cases of the pull-through operation, the ano-rectal functions in the initial post-operative period were worse than those for the other types of operation. The reason for this is thought to be the loss of the internal sphincter reflex and the decrease in reservoir continence due to defective ampulla formation. However, two years after the operations, the ano-rectal functions of these patients showed considerable improvement. In particulart, ano-rectal functions were good when the post-operative ampulla formation was good even when there was no internal sphincter reflex but the functions were disturbed in some way if there was internal sphincter reflex but poor ampulla formation. From animal experiments, it was evident that rectal ampulla {{is an important factor in}} post-operative ano-rectal functions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Involvement of the {{peripheral}} nervous system in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) has been reported, but its prevalence in neurologically asymptomatic patients is not well known. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical and neurophysiological features of {{the peripheral}} nervous system in patients with primary SS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 39 (38 female) consecutive patients with primary SS, aged 20 - 81 years (mean 50), with a disease duration of 1 - 30 years (mean 8) were studied. The {{peripheral nervous system}} was evaluated by a questionnaire, physical <b>examination,</b> quantified <b>sensory</b> neurological <b>examination,</b> and neurophysiological measurements (nerve conduction studies). To assess autonomic cardiovascular function an orthostatic challenge test, a Valsalva manoeuvre, a forced respiration test, and pupillography were done. RESULTS: Abnormalities as indicated in the questionnaire were found in 8 / 39 (21 %) patients, while an abnormal neurological examination was found in 7 / 39 (18 %) patients. Abnormalities in quantified <b>sensory</b> neurological <b>examination</b> were found in 22 / 38 (58 %) patients. In 9 / 39 (23 %) patients, neurophysiological signs compatible with a sensory polyneuropathy were found.

The purpose of this study is to provide validation data for the Reitan-Klove Examination and evaluate an alternative standardized testing procedure which is based on subtests similar to the Reitan-Klove Examination. Procedure. Von Frey hairs, tuning forks, calipers, wire numbers, and raised designs were used for standardiza-tion. The control group consisted of 11 male and 23 female hospital staff members with a mean age of 40 years. The experimental group consisted of one female and 33 male brain-damaged patients with a mean age of 49 years. Findings. The procedures were compared on the occurrence of false positives and false negatives. Both procedures yielded no false positives and a small incidence (6 %) of false negatives; both procedures were valid. Sub-tests involving the same variables were then compared. The comparison revealed that in the area of tactile percep-tion and fingertip number writing perception, the discrimin-ative validity of these tests was increased by procedural standardization.

Mesial temporal lobe inflammation is a rare and under-recognized presentation of neurosyphilis that may mimic viral or limbic enceph-alitis. Concomitant HIV infection is common and may change the presentation of neurosyphilis. CASE REPORT A 51 -year-old right-handed Caucasian man presented with a 3 -week history of personality changes with deteriorating social interactions, progressive forgetfulness, and apathy. He complained of a new-onset worsening headache described as “a sledgehammer hit-ting both sides ” of his head. The patient denied consti-tutional symptoms and his prior medical history was unremarkable. He became disheveled, confused, and unable to care for his family and a successful business he had built.

40|$|Background: Many {{students}} find the peripheral <b>sensory</b> <b>examination</b> confusing. We {{set out to}} summarise the evidence base {{in order to provide}} guidance on the most useful manoeuvres. Methods: We performed a literature review starting with 5 secondary sources, supplemented by a literature search on MEDLINE. Results: A useful approach to neuropathy is to divide these into large fibre sensory neuropathy (LFSN) in which vibration and proprioception are affected, and small fibre sensory neuropathy (SFSN) in which pain and temperature are affected. Positive sensory symptoms such as burning, electric or sunburn pain point to a SFSN; negative symptoms such as loss of sensation, numbness or deep pain point to a LFSN. If LFSN is suspected, the most reproducible and best studied physical examination is a 10 g monofilament, but vibration sense is also useful. There is much less data on the best physical examination for a SFSN. The most appropriate diagnostic test for SFSN is quantitative sensory testing, whereas for LFSN a nerve conduction study is indicated.

40|$|In {{a global}} world, wineries have {{to satisfy the}} demand of {{consumers}} who wish to drink high quality wines from countries all over the world. To fulfill this request wines have to be transported, crossing thereby great distances from the place of production to the consumer country. At the Institute of Enology of Hochschule Geisenheim University examinations with White-, Rosé- and Red-Wines of different origins which had been transported over longer distances within Europe (Portugal, France, Italy to Germany) by trucks were carried out. Shipping of wines was simulated in a climatized cabinet to analyze the influence on wine quality during this way and conditions of transportation. Time and temperature profiles were based on real transport situtations which were recorded during shipping from Germany to Japan using data loggers. White, Rosé and Red wines were transported during 6 to 8 weeks and then were analytically and sensorically compared to those which were stored at a constant temperature of 15 [*]∘C. Besides the effect of temperature, the movements and vibrations encountered by the wines were also examined. Analytically wines were analyzed for general analytical parameters with Fourier-Transformation-Infrared-Spectroscopie (FTIR), Colour differences (Spectralphotometrie) and free and total sulfuric acid with Flow-Injection-Analysis (FIA). <b>Sensory</b> <b>examinations</b> with a trained panel were performed in difference tests in form of rankings and triangular tests. Summarizing {{the results from the}} different tests it could be found that transportation had an influence on the potential ageing of wines depending on the wine matrix. Especially high and varying temperatures during transportations over a longer distance and time had negative influences on wine quality. Also the movement of wine at higher temperatures had showed a negative effect whereas transport at cool temperatures even below 0 [*]∘C did not influence wine characteristics.

40|$|Neurotoxic {{substances}} {{affect the}} nervous system in a selective manner. One possible basis for this selectivity is blood vessel permeability. In general, {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nerve trunks have impermeable blood vessels, but in certain parts the capillaries are "leaky," allowing the passage of a plasma filtrate. Intravenously injected protein tracers rapidly reach nerve cells in these regions, with the implication that these nerve cells are also readily accessible to circulating neurotoxic substances. Some examples of neurotoxicity in the central nervous system show a selectivity that could be due to capillary permeability. In experimental methylmercury poisoning, cranial nerve V and sensory dorsal root ganglia, which lie in regions of vascular permeability, are particularly susceptible. A number of drug and chemically induced neuropathies are predominantly sensory, and may be due, directly or indirectly, to the accessibility of neurotoxic substances to <b>sensory</b> neurons. <b>Examination</b> of areas of potential vulnerability to circulating toxic substances may be of value in the experimental testing of substances for neurotoxicity, where pharmacological tests may be negative and clinical symptoms difficult to assess...|$|R

Methods: After institutional review board approval, ultrasound-guided, supraclavicular block was performed on 55 patients. Patients with neurologic dysfunction were excluded. Criteria for extraneural and intraneural stimulation were defined and assessed by independent experts. To determine success rate and any residual neurologic deficit, qualitative <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>examinations</b> were performed before and after block placement. At 6 month follow-up, the patients were examined for any neurologic deficit. Results: Thirty-nine patients met all set stimulation criteria. Median +/- SD (interquartile range) minimum stimulation threshold outside was 0. 60 +/- 0. 37 mA (0. 40, 1. 0) and inside 0. 30 +/- 0. 19 mA (0. 20, 0. 40). The difference of 0. 30 mA was statistically significant (P < 0. 0001). Stimulation currents of 0. 2 mA or less were not observed outside the trunk in any patient. Significantly higher thresholds were observed in diabetic patients. Success rate was 100 % after 20 min. Thirty-four patients had normal <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>examination</b> at 6 months. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study and the use of ultrasound, a stimulation current of 0. 2 mA or less is reliable to detect intraneural placement of the needle. Furthermore, stimulation currents of more than 0. 2 and no more than 0. 5 mA could not rule out intraneural position. (C) 2009 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc...|$|R
40|$|A 47 -year-old Hispanic woman {{presented}} to the emergency department for evaluation of a left frontal head mass she reported noticing in the previous month, which caused her localized dull discomfort. She denied any recent or past trauma, and denied any vision, speech, motor or <b>sensory</b> changes. Her <b>examination</b> was significant for a large, firm, non-tender exophytic left frontal mass, approximately 5 cm in diameter with normal scalp overlying it. Her neurological examination was completely normal. An MRI revealed a 10 x 6 x 4 cm area of expansion of the left frontal and parietal calvarium with a plaque-like dural based mass underlying the calvarial thickening, consistent with a meningioma with interosseous extension. There was moderate mass effect on the underlying left cerebral hemisphere with a 5 mm midline shift to the right (Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor (1, 3 -dioxo- 1 H-benz-de-isoquinoline- 2 (3 H) -acetic acid, AY- 22, 284, Alrestatin) on peripheral nerve function in diabetic polyneuropathy was assessed. Thirty patients with long-standing diabetes and slight to moderate neuropathy {{participated in the}} double-blind placebo trial. Clinical <b>examination,</b> <b>sensory</b> threshold determinations for vibratory, tactile and thermal stimuli, conduction velocity measurements and studies of automatic function were performed to evaluate the treatment. Significant differences favouring Alrestatin over placebo were found {{for many of the}} measured variables, whereas no changes occurred on placebo. The apparent improvement of neuropathy occurred despite persisting hyperglycaemia. The results indicate that aldose reductase inhibitor treatment may be of value in diabetic polyneuropathy, and provide support for the sorbitol pathway hypothesis of diabetic polyneuropathy...|$|R
