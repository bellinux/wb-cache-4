5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts <b>split</b> <b>between</b> 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs.

The other candidates included Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., son of former Congressman Brutus J.

The party was <b>split</b> <b>between</b> supporters of corporations, such as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and supporters of agrarian interests. Another split was between the more conservative Bourbon Democrats, who supported maintaining the gold standard, and more progressive Democrats, who called for the free coinage of silver. Agrarian voters were about equally <b>split</b> <b>between</b> Clay and Clardy, while Free Silver Democrats were about equally <b>split</b> <b>between</b> Hardin and Clardy. Having lived in the agrarian western part of the state for most of his life, and never having alienated the powerful Farmers' Alliance, Brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests, while the Louisville and Nashville Railroad felt he was a moderate on the issue of corporate regulation. Bourbon Democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand.|$|E

40|$|We present first {{results of}} {{calculations}} of masses {{of positive and}} negative parity excited baryons in lattice QCD using an O(a 2) improved gluon action and a fat-link clover fermion action in which only the irrelevant operators are constructed with fat links. The results are in agreement with earlier calculations of N ∗ resonances using improved actions and exhibit a clear mass <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the nucleon and its chiral partner. The results also indicate a <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the lowest JP = 1 − 2 states for the two standard nucleon interpolating fields. The study of different Λ interpolating fields suggests a similar <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the lowest two Λ 1 / 2 − octet states. However, the empirical mass suppression of the Λ ∗ (1405) is not evident in these quenched QCD simulations, suggesting an important role for the meson cloud of the Λ ∗ (1405) or a need for more exotic interpolating fields.

In particular, we observe an attractive interaction for colour anti-triplet states with a <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> spin 0 and spin 1 diquarks that can account for the mass <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the nucleon and the delta.

40|$|In {{short period}} pseudodirect GaAs/AlAs superlattices, the two {{radiative}} heavy exciton states exhibit {{a very small}} anisotropic splitting due to their coupling with light exciton states. They are dipole-active along the [110] and [1 (- 1) 0] directions in the layer plane. The splitting energy (a few µeV) is obtained from {{the period of the}} quantum beats between the two sublevels observed during the time decay of photoluminescence under excitation with light linearly polarized along [101] or circularly polarized. We report here on the variation of the quantum beats in a magnetic field. In a longitudinal field (parallel to the wave vector of light), we measure the <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the radiative states and obtain the hole longitudinal g-factor. In a transverse field, we observe two periods for the quantum beats. One corresponds to the <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the radiative states and the other to the <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> the radiative states and the non-radiative ones which become optically allowed in a transverse field.

5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|E
