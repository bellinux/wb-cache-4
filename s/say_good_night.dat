500|$|During the {{epilogue}} campaign, {{the combined}} forces of Kerrigan, Raynor and Artanis {{ventured into the}} void in order to rescue [...] "Tassadar" [...] (really Ouros) and encountered Narud, who was Ouros's jailer. After a difficult battle Narud's forces were overpowered and Narud was cornered by not only Artanis Kerrigan and Raynor, but Alexei Stukov, who called him [...] "Duran." [...] He asked Duran if he remembered {{what he had done}} to him, and Narud assumed Stukov was simply there to gloat. Stukov said [...] "No, I'm here to <b>say</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> you son of a bitch." [...] (an echo of the words Duran had said right before shooting him). He then shot Narud with a psychic blast, finishing him for good.|$|E
2500|$|Cope {{describes}} Mrs. Phillips' dinner, {{the fine}} {{house and its}} appointments. He thought Randolph was especially attentive to him at dinner and that Joe found him boisterous: [...] "He must have fancied me (from the racket I was making) {{as a sort of}} free-and-easy Hercules..., if not as the whole football squad rolled into one." [...] Cope tried not to shake Joe's hand too vigorously, but Joe [...] "took all I gave and even seemed to hang on for a little more."(63) He notices Joe indicate by glances to Mrs. Phillips that he is disappointed Cope does not sing on this occasion. Randolph walks Cope home and then ends the evening, in Cope's words, [...] "taking my hand to <b>say</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> and taking his own time in dropping it."(66) In a letter, Cope urges his friend Arthur Lemoyne to leave Winnebago and come to live with him: [...] "...we can go into quarters together: a real bed instead of an upholstered shelf and a closet big enough for two wardrobes."(67) Randolph visits Cope in his modest rooms and Cope finds him not at all judgmental. Cope returns the visit and they discuss the authors of Shakespeare's plays. Randolph takes Cope to dinner and the theater. When Cope declines alcohol, Randolph feels [...] "like a corrupter of youth,"(74) but he is pleased that Cope treats him as a peer and never calls him [...] "sir." ...|$|E

25|$|Gabe Kaplan did {{a comedy}} skit in the 1970s (also {{featured}} on his 1974 album Holes and Mellow Rolls), that had him impersonate a drunken Ed Sullivan on his final show, being nasty in general, and finally <b>saying</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> to the audience.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{all waiting}} for you. We've cut, {{and you and}} I are partners. Besides, Paula's making her sleep noise. So <b>say</b> <b>good</b> <b>night,</b> and let her go." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{talked on}} {{a few minutes before}} <b>saying</b> <b>good</b> <b>night.</b> He did not go home immediately; and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at a window and murmured: [...] "That date was with you, Ruth. I kept it for you." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Varnick, Harvey, and Vernon {{are arrested}} for animal abuse. The family is praised as heroes {{by the news}} and George takes a new liking to Beethoven.

5000|$|Hush is {{a real-life}} {{goldfish}} who was originally used to introduce show segments.

50|$|Beveril {{enters to}} {{introduce}} the entertainment. The entertainment begins. Lady Goldenfleece's former suitors enter, dressed as 'Fire' (Sir Gilbert Lambston), 'Air' (Weatherwise), 'Water' (Overdone) and 'Earth' (Pepperton). Rather than reciting the parts Beveril has composed, each suitor recites a speech insulting Lady Goldenfleece. When the entertainment is finished, the suitors reveal their true identities and exit, satisfied that they have fulfilled their vow to see Lady Goldenfleece disgraced. Beveril apologizes for the fiasco. Lady Goldenfleece forgives him. Lady Goldenfleece <b>says</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> to the wedding guests, who will {{spend the night at}} her house.|$|R
5000|$|Zappa {{wrote the}} song to parody his {{experiences}} playing with drunken lounge music bands {{in the early}} 1960s. The song combines a trite love song lyric with an equally cliched melody. The members of The Mothers perform the song in a very sloppy way on purpose. Many sound effects were creatively added to the recording to give it an authentic nightclub feel. At {{the end of the}} recording the audience sounds devolve into screams as lead vocalist Ray Collins <b>says</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> to the audience and tells them to [...] "drink it up, folks." ...|$|R
60|$|Bostil {{threw off}} the {{recurring}} gloom, {{and he was}} good-natured when Lucy came to his room to <b>say</b> <b>good</b> <b>night.</b> He knew {{she had come to}} say more than that.|$|E

5000|$|As well as {{appearing}} in ten episodes of her father's half-hour television programme, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Hitchcock {{worked on a}} few others, including Playhouse 90, which was live, directed by John Frankenheimer. Acting for her father, however, remained {{the high point of}} her acting career, which she interrupted to bring up her children. (Hitchcock has a small joke with her first appearance on his show - after <b>saying</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> and exiting the screen, he sticks his head back into the picture and remarks: [...] "I thought the little leading lady was rather good, didn't you?") ...|$|R
60|$|On <b>saying</b> <b>good</b> <b>night,</b> Terence {{insisted on}} Marie accepting, as a parting gift, {{his watch and}} chain. These were {{handsome}} ones, and of French manufacture, Terence having bought them from a soldier who had taken them {{from the body of}} a French officer, killed during Soult's retreat from Portugal. They could, therefore, be shown by her to her friends without exciting any suspicion that they had been obtained from an English source. Marie accepted them very unwillingly, and only after Terence declaring that he should feel very grieved if she would not take the one present he was capable of making.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (interrupting). She {{said she}} was quite sure that if we didn't go, you'd persuade Mrs. Tranfield {{to get up to}} <b>say</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> for the sake of politeness; so she went {{straight}} off.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl was}} full of enthusiasm, however, and now meant to untangle the mystery of Alora Jones if it were {{possible}} to do so, both to please Mary Louise and to enjoy the satisfaction of success. After <b>saying</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> to her friends, and before going to her own room, the girl wandered about the big hotel making casual inquiries and obtaining more or less useful information. Afterward, she sat in her room and arranged in her mind the complete history of Alora, so far as she was informed of it, and made notes of all facts which seemed to bear on the present problem.|$|R
