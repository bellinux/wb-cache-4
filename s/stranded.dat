40|$|The {{technique}} of image analysis {{has been used}} to assess the quality of model oriented <b>strand</b> board panels by investigating the relationships between shape and size of <b>strands,</b> the distribution of <b>strands</b> and bending properties. A batch of commercial <b>strands</b> was analysed by image analysis and the distribution of the shape and size of <b>strands</b> was quantified. The <b>strands</b> were categorised into five <b>strand</b> types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, <b>strand</b> shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in <b>strand</b> dimensions in commercial material. Bigger area <b>strands</b> had low aspect ratios and small <b>strands</b> had high aspect ratios. Half of the commercial <b>strands</b> were longer than 100 mm. Model OSB panels were manufactured in the laboratory by hot pressing <b>strand</b> mats formed from each of the five <b>strand</b> types. <b>Strands</b> were laid up by hand into the forming mat and following pressing the orientation and shape of <b>strands</b> was evaluated by image analysis and the panels were tested in a three point bending. Large area (type 3) <b>strands</b> with high aspect ratios produced model panels with optimum <b>strand</b> orientation and mechanical properties. Type 3 panels were also fabricated from <b>strands</b> dropped through a slotted forming device in order to simulate the delivery of <b>strands</b> to the forming line under factory conditions. As the height of <b>strand</b> delivery increased from 0 to 100 to 200 mm the disorientation of <b>strands</b> in the pressed panels progressively increased and as a result mechanical properties in bending were reduced. Image analysis is therefore a powerful tool for evaluating the distribution of commercial <b>strand</b> shapes and the relationship between <b>strand</b> geometry, <b>strand</b> orientation and the mechanical properties of oriented <b>strand</b> board...|$|R

40|$|Similar to {{in-plane}} <b>strand</b> deviations, <b>strand</b> undulation {{through a}} panel thickness could adversely affect the mechanical behavior and failure mechanism of a wood-strand panel subjected to compression loads and repeated moisture cycling. The {{goal of this}} study was to characterize the out-of-plane <b>strand</b> devia-tions in an oriented <b>strand</b> composite to better characterize its three-dimensional structure. The results indicate that random and incidental <b>strand</b> undulations in the longitudinal and transverse directions are significant; these inherent attributes of oriented <b>strand</b> composites influence the physical and mechanical behavior of composite panels. <b>Strand</b> orientations through the thickness of oriented <b>strand</b> panels in the longitudinal and transverse directions were quantified, and the effects of <b>strand</b> geometry and vane spacing on these out-of-plane deviations were investigated. Discrete Fourier expansions accurately rep-resented <b>strand</b> undulations through composite thickness. Location through composite thickness and length of a <b>strand</b> influence the distribution of undulation angles. <b>Strands</b> closer to the faces and shorter in length tend to result in larger undulation angles. In the transverse direction, <b>strand</b> deviation angles ranged between 0 and 60 degrees for the core <b>strands</b> and between 0 and 50 degrees for surface <b>strands.</b> Cumulative distribution plots indicate that smaller <b>strand</b> widths tend to result in higher percentages of larger undulation angles in the transverse direction for long <b>strands.</b> A two-parameter Weibull probability density function adequately fits both longitudinal and transverse direction <b>strand</b> undulation data...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the arrangement of wood <b>strands</b> at the surface of oriented <b>strand</b> board (OSB) by image analysis. Two-dimensional image analysis enables the number of <b>strands</b> and the area of each <b>strand</b> to be computed. In addition, the fiber direction of each <b>strand</b> may be measured manually by recording the acute angle between the fiber direction and the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The image analysis results suggest the following. the average <b>strand</b> area is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of <b>strands.</b> Samples containing many smaller <b>strands</b> exhibit a larger variation in <b>strand</b> size. The average <b>strand</b> area does not correlate with the distribution of the <b>strand</b> area represented by the coefficient of variation. However, there is a reasonable correlation between the number of smaller <b>strands</b> in the range 0 to 1 cm(2) and the coefficient of variation of <b>strand</b> area. At low average fiber orientations, i. e. better orientation with the principal panel axis, there is smaller variability in orientation. The upper side and lower side of OSB exhibit a different relationship between average fiber orientation and <b>strand</b> area. The upper side of the specimens contains larger <b>strands</b> and exhibits better fiber orientation than the lower side. This is thought to be a function of the production process. The lower side <b>strands</b> fall on a smooth moving substrate, whereas the upper side <b>strands</b> fall on a stable substrate of <b>strands.</b> The number of <b>strands</b> is lower on the upper side of the OSB panel because small size <b>strands</b> tend to migrate to the lower side of the OSB during production. The small particles tend to be vibrated through the <b>strand</b> mat to the lower face before pressing...|$|R

40|$|The in-situ elastic {{constants}} of a wood <b>strand</b> are affectcd by {{the physical}} changes that it experiences during the manufacturing process of a wood-strand composite. The hot-pressing conditions and the location in the mat govern the environmental conditions surrounding each <b>strand,</b> which in turn influence the adhesive cure and final <b>strand</b> density. Few studies have examined systematically the changes in <b>strand</b> elastic constants as influenced by <b>strand</b> density, location, and/or resin content.

40|$|The tight {{junction}} (TJ) <b>strand</b> is a linear proteinaceous polymer spanning plasma membranes, and each TJ <b>strand</b> associates laterally with another TJ <b>strand</b> in the apposing membranes of adjacent cells to form “paired” TJ <b>strands.</b> Claudins {{have been identified}} as the major constituents of TJ <b>strands,</b> and when exogenously expressed in L fibroblasts, they polymerize into paired <b>strands,</b> which are morphologically similar to paired TJ <b>strands</b> in epithelia.
