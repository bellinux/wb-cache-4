40|$|This paper aims to {{look back}} the three-step {{progresses}} of the <b>Surveying</b> and <b>Mapping</b> science and technology from traditional <b>surveying</b> and <b>mapping</b> to digital <b>surveying</b> and <b>mapping,</b> and then to informatization <b>surveying</b> and <b>mapping</b> which is also called Geomatics. It mainly discusses the changes and developments of the <b>surveying</b> and <b>mapping</b> science and technology {{in terms of the}} concept, theory, technology, method, application service and so on, with the evolution of the national needs and world science and technology developments. Besides, the way from <b>Surveying</b> and <b>Mapping</b> to Geomatics is also presented in detail, together with the changes of the concepts, disciplines and connotations in the <b>Surveying</b> and <b>Mapping.</b> Finally, the basic conceptions and definitions of digital <b>surveying</b> and <b>mapping</b> and Geomatics are given...|$|R
5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations of {{what could have been}} a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map.</b> Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century {{the growth of}} {{industry}} meant {{the majority of the}} area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The factory system was also introduced; in 1835 1,124people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used power looms. Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, Nankeens and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map</b> of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of silk, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. Many factory workers were children under 12years of age.|$|E
5|$|In 1908 Reading Central Goods {{railway station}} was {{opened on the}} Coley branch line {{diverting}} at Southcote Junction. During the first few decades of the 20th century, however, most of Southcote remained rural and undeveloped. An Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map</b> of 1914 shows the majority of land as agricultural (farms and nurseries) {{with a number of}} gravel pits and smithies. The 1930s saw the construction of the Southcote Park Estate, a housing estate built on land inherited after the death of William Berkeley Monck of Coley Park. An Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map</b> of 1938 shows greater provision for the population (as opposed to industry); some of the gravel pits no longer existed and Presentation College, a boys' school, had opened in two large Victorian buildings—Rotherfield Grange and Oakland Hall, the latter a suburban villa built in the 1870s. By the advent of World War II, Southcote had begun to experience urban sprawl from Reading and the land bordering the Great Western Railway had begun to be used for housing. Following the war, Denton's Field on the Bath Road in Southcote was used for celebratory events; Battle of Britain commemorative fêtes were held in September 1949 and 1950, and featured a performance by three Alsatians—Rocky, Lindy and Irma—to recognise their work in the war. Denton's Field gained reputation as a location for outdoor community events, and was comparable to places such as Caversham Park and Palmer Park.|$|E

5|$|The 1908 Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map</b> of Gibraltar reveals Flat Bastion Magazine {{within the}} east side of the bastion. The British version of the {{magazine}} dates back to at least 1873, as documented on a keystone above one of the magazine's doorways (pictured right). It is considered likely that a magazine was present at that site previously. The magazine was constructed on scree breccia, with underlying limestone bedrock. The road through the bastion is positioned just to the west of the magazine.|$|E
5|$|The current A20, {{which runs}} through the village, was once a turnpike, {{probably}} established between 1780 and 1820 to connect London with Dover. The Turnpike Act of 1744 required that Turnpike trusts set up milestones along these roads. A series of mileposts made in cast-iron appear on the stretch of road between Aylesford and Addington; at Ditton, Larkfield and Ryarsh. The one at Larkfield is shown on an 1862 Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map</b> and the Ditton post is shown on a similar map of 1869. Both the Larkfield and Ditton posts are classed as Class II listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist {{by the time of the}} first Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map,</b> {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E

5|$|Hengistbury Head forms {{part of the}} Christchurch Harbour Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and in May 1990 was {{declared}} a Local Nature Reserve. The head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight red data book species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces Christchurch Harbour, and is contiguous with the reed beds of Wick Fields. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the heathland on Warren Hill to freshwater ponds, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The woodland (known as Withybed Wood) is home to English oak and silver birch amongst many other trees, and is of particular interest, {{as it is the}} only such area to be shown on an 1811 Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map</b> of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area. In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as Barn Field. This, combined with gorse eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.|$|E
5|$|The Carrick Hotel is a two-storey brick {{building}} {{with an iron}} hip roof built in 1833. It is the only licensed premises in Carrick and has been operated as a hotel for the entire of its history. The hotel has been sold and the licence transferred numerous times, including the first instance from John Taylor to Thomas Archer on 12 August 1839, and was called the Hotel Marella from November 1945 to December 1952.John Rudge built the Plough Inn in 1841, though it was referred to in an 1842 <b>survey</b> <b>map</b> as the Carrick Inn. It is a two-story {{brick building}} with an iron roof and 12-panel windows. John Archer was the Inn's first licensee, but by 1863 {{it was no longer}} operating and the building was offered for lease. The last licensee was John Jordan in 1873; over time it {{has been used as a}} bakery, art gallery, hotel and private home.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>map.</b> The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
