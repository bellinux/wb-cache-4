5|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride.</b> By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride,</b> started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> and hot-pressed <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride.</b> In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Silicon</b> <b>nitrides</b> {{are often}} used as ladles, stalks, heater element {{protection}} tubes, etc., in the metal casting industry. A low wettability for molten metals is required for these purposes since wetting by molten metals leads to adhesion of solidified metals, which causes several problems. Surface structure is known to affect wettability. Thus, the present study attempts to fabricate <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides</b> with controlled surface structures. <b>Silicon</b> <b>nitrides,</b> whose surfaces were covered with ordered hemispherical protrusions, were fabricated by the slip-casting technique. The cast bodies were sintered, and subjected to wettability tests using molten metals. For comparison, <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides</b> with as-sintered and polished surfaces were also prepared. The surface with protrusions exhibited a lower contact angle compared to the as-sintered and polished surfaces. The contact angle depended on {{the diameter of the}} hemisphere; it was the largest at a diameter of 0. 3 mm...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} elevated-temperature, 'ultra'-fast fracture strengths of one alumina, two <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides</b> and one <b>silicon</b> carbide by using constant stress-rate ('dynamic fatigue') testing with a series of 'ultra'-fast test rates. Of the materials tested, the alumina exhibited a convergence of strength at stress rates below 3. 3 x 10 (exp 4) MPa/s. The strength approached approximately the room-temperature inert strength. By contrast, the <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides</b> and <b>silicon</b> carbide did not reveal a strength approach, but exhibited elevated-temperature strengths 10 and 20 % lower than their respective room-temperature strengths. Although the analytical results imply that the elevated-temperature 'inert' strength of a ceramic material can be obtained by using sufficiently high stress rates, the experimental testing rates were only sufficient to demonstrate convergence for the alumina...|$|R
5|$|Since <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. <b>Silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. <b>Silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> {{ball bearings}} {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. <b>Silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals.

In spark-ignition engines, <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{electronic}} structure and optical properties of Si 3 N 4 and Si 2 N 3 H in crystalline and amorphous phases by first-principles calculations. We find that besides structural disorder those matrix atoms with dangling and floating bonds contribute to energy levels close to the Fermi level. From a comparative analysis of calculated optical spectra we conclude that the difference in optical properties between crystalline and amorphous silicon nitrides—either hydrogenated or unhydrogenated—is only small. It is present mainly in the energy range close to the fundamental band gap. At larger energies the difference is negligible.

40|$|Six ceramic {{material}} types were considered within an experimental investigation {{to identify the}} erosion damage mechanisms resulting from cavitation exposure. These materials were a Y-TZP-type zirconia, different commercially available <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides,</b> a high-purity alumina and a hardened high-nitrogen stainless steel as reference. An ultrasonic transducer was utilised to produce cavitation conditions and the configuration was “static specimen method” using a 5 -mm diameter probe, 20 -kHz and 50 -μm amplitude. The exposure times were periods from 15 s to 3 h. Experimental methods employed to characterise wear mechanisms were light microscopy, scanning light interferometry and scanning electron microscopy. It {{was found that the}} zirconia and <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides</b> demonstrated evidence of local pseudo-plastic deformation or depression prior to more pronounced erosion damage by fracture. Zirconia showed evidence of delayed surface changes when the sample is at rest stored in air, possibly by spontaneous phase transformation after the completion of the erosion tests.

5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary nitrides are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) {{are also}} known: <b>silicon</b> <b>nitride</b> in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E

40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} of a {{total of}} 13 advanced monolithic ceramics including <b>silicon</b> <b>nitrides,</b> <b>silicon</b> carbide, aluminas, and glass ceramic was determined at ambient temperature by using both single edge precracked beam (SEPB) and single edge v-notched beam (SEVNB) methods. Relatively good agreement in fracture toughness between the two methods was observed for advanced ceramics with flat R-curves; whereas, poor agreement in fracture toughness was seen for materials with rising R-curves. The discrepancy in fracture toughness between the two methods was due to stable crack growth with crack closure forces acting in the wake region of cracks even in SEVNB test specimens. The effect of discrepancy in fracture toughness was analyzed in terms of microstructural feature (grain size and shape), toughening exponent in R-curve, and stable crack growth determined using back-face strain gaging...|$|R
