Solar cells with semitransparent contact have almost the same open-circuit voltages (V(oc)) as solar cells with grid contact and exhibit a higher fill factor (FF). However, solar cells with grid contact exhibit a higher maximum output power density (P(max)) than semitransparent contact due to their larger short-circuit current density (J(sc)). On the other hand, V(oc) and FF decrease significantly with increasing In content (beyond the decrease expected from the band gap of InGaN). By comparing the X-ray rocking curves, AFM images, dark current characteristics and <b>spectral</b> <b>responsivities,</b> it could be concluded that the deterioration of InGaN crystal quality with increasing In content is the dominant reason accounting for the strong decrease of V(oc) and FF.

40|$|The {{international}} standard IEC 62670 - 3 "Photovoltaic Concentrators (CPV) Performance Testing – Part 3 - Performance Measurements and Power Rating" sets {{the guidelines for}} power measurement of a CPV device, both under indoor and outdoor conditions. When measuring under outdoor conditions, the acquired data have to be filtered “a posteriori”, in order to select only those points measured with ambient conditions close to the Concentrator Standard Operating Conditions (CSOC). The most stringent requirement to be met {{is related to the}} three Spectral Matching Ratios (SMR), which have all to be within the limit of 1. 00 ± 0. 03. SMR are usually determined by the ratio of the currents of component reference cells set to monitor the outdoor spectral ratio conditions during the CPV device power measurements. Alternatively the SMR can be calculated from measured spectral irradiance if the <b>spectral</b> <b>responsivities</b> of the junctions are known. Experience demonstrates that obtaining real world data meeting these strict conditions is very difficult in practise. However, increasing the acceptable range would make the entire filtering process less appropriate from a physical point of view. Given the importance of correctly measuring the SMR, an estimate of their associated measurement uncertainties is needed to allow a proper assessment of the validity of the 3 % limit. In this study a Monte Carlo simulation has been used, to allow a preliminary estimation of the propagation of uncertainties for SMR measured with a calibrated spectroradiometer. The method consists of applying both random and wavelength correlated errors to the measured spectra and to the <b>spectral</b> <b>responsivities</b> of the three CPV cell junctions, accordingly to the measurement uncertainties of the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI).

Errors in these color rendering transformations can arise {{from a variety}} of sources, including (a) noise in the acquisition process (including photon noise and sensor noise) and (b) sensor <b>spectral</b> <b>responsivities</b> inconsistent with those of the human cones. These errors can be summarized by the mean deviation and variance of the reproduced values. It is desirable to select a color transformation that produces both low mean deviations and low noise variance. We show that in some conditions there is an inherent trade-off between these two measures: when selecting a color rendering transformation either the mean deviation or the variance (caused by imager noise) can be minimized. We describe this trade-off mathematically, and we describe a methodology for choosing an appropriate transformation for different applications. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to the problem of color filter selection (CMYG vs. RGGB) for digital cameras. We find that under moderate illumination conditions photon noise alone introduces an uncertainty in the estimated CIELAB coordinates on the order of 1 - 2 ∆E units for RGGB sensors and in certain cases even higher uncertainty levels for CMYG sensors.
