500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that <b>she</b> <b>gasped</b> at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. <b>She</b> <b>gasped,</b> [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{after seeing}} what alcohol {{has done to}} her life, Emily drives to a lake and tries to drown herself.

6000|$|NAPOLEON (holding out his hand). Yes: I am {{waiting for}} them. (<b>She</b> <b>gasps,</b> daunted by his {{ruthless}} promptitude into despair of moving him by cajolery; {{but as she}} looks up perplexedly at him, it is plain that she is racking her brains for some device to outwit him. He meets her regard inflexibly.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>gasped</b> {{and sank}} {{together}} on the seat {{as though she had}} been shot. Then I took up my parable.|$|E

5000|$|While {{driving for}} some time, he removes the blindfold. The car {{suddenly}} crashes and flips on its side. Tony frees himself, but Anne, strapped in {{a seat belt}} with her hands still bound, is unable to do the same. Tony climbs back and cuts the seat belt, pulls {{her out of the}} car, and onto the grass. While <b>she</b> <b>gasps</b> for air, Tony says, [...] "I saved your life. That means I own you." ...|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, both Pullo and Vorenus {{believe that}} Caesarion is {{actually}} Pullo's son, and Cleopatra herself soon confirms this. Vorenus manages to smuggle Caesarion {{out of the}} palace as Octavian takes over, knowing Octavian will murder the boy to cement his position as Caesar's heir. Cleopatra, realizing that Octavian only wants her as a trophy and will never let her keep her throne, foils him by allowing a venomous snake to bite her. [...] "You have a rotten soul," [...] <b>she</b> <b>gasps</b> to Octavian, and expires.|$|R
6000|$|... "Policeman!" [...] said Sam Twitter, {{looking up}} {{in the face of}} Number 666, with a piteous expression, and almost weeping with vexation, [...] "nobody will listen to me. I would go up myself, but the firemen won't let me, and my dear wife has such an idea of {{sticking}} to truth that when they ask her, `Is your baby up there?' she yells `No, not our baby,' and before she can explain <b>she</b> <b>gasps,</b> and then I try to explain, and that so bamboozles--" ...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{specific}} {{performances were}} reviewed very positively. Anne Hathaway's performance of ballad [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] {{was met with}} praise, with many comparing its showstopper-like quality to Jennifer Hudson's performance of [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] from Dreamgirls. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic wrote that [...] "Hathaway gives it everything she has, beginning in quiet sorrow before building to a woebegone climax: <b>she</b> <b>gasps,</b> <b>she</b> weeps, she coughs. If you are blown away by the scene—as many will be; it will almost certainly earn Hathaway her first Oscar—this may be the film for you." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post writes that [...] "The centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers". Joy Tipping of The Dallas Morning News described Hathaway's performance as [...] "angelic".|$|R

6000|$|... "Be not alarmed!" [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>gasping</b> for breath. [...] "They {{do it in}} mockery; 't is one {{of their}} wiles to mislead--but they cannot--no, they dare not harm a hair of thy head, Carlo!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate shrank from showing such a {{spectacle}} as her swollen, tear- stained, red-marbled visage. She was thoroughly sorry, and greatly ashamed; and <b>she</b> only <b>gasped</b> out, [...] "I can't, I can't; don't {{let me see}} anyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simple folk?" [...] <b>she</b> interrupted, <b>gasping.</b> [...] "By God, am I {{married to}} a ploughman? Am I Vicomtesse of Lavedan, or {{the wife of a}} boor of the countryside? And is the honour of your {{daughter}} a matter--" ...|$|R
