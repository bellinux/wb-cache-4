25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of sugar in the grape must. In the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar {{is the most common}} type of <b>sugar</b> <b>added,</b> although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|After distillation, the unaged brandy {{is placed}} into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and <b>sugar</b> <b>added</b> to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{sparkling}} wines, such as Champagne, {{are generally}} sold with 5 to 6 atmospheres of {{pressure in the}} bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German Sekt, Spanish Espumoso, Italian Spumante and French Crémant or Mousseux wines. Semi-sparkling wines are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German spritzig, Italian frizzante and French pétillant wines.

2500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 19th century Champagne {{was made}} sweet. The taste was {{pleasing}} to most wine drinkers and the added sugar helped winemakers to cover up flaws in the wine or poor quality from less desirable grapes. Champagne houses would use the dosage to tailor the sweetness to whatever style was in fashion in a particular market. The Russians preferred the sweetest level with as much as 250–330grams of <b>sugar</b> <b>added.</b> Scandinavia was next at around 200grams followed by France at 165grams, Germany with slightly more, and the United States preferring between 110–165grams. The English preferred the driest style at 22–66grams of sugar. Gradually tastes developed to favor less sweetness and higher overall quality in the Champagne. The first slightly dry Champagne to emerged was labeled demi-sec or [...] "half dry". The success of those wines prompted the introduction of sec or dry wines. [...] Other producers made wines with even less sugar and began to call these wines extra dry. In 1846, the Champagne house Perrier-Jouët introduced a wine that was made without any added sugar. This style was initially ill-received with critics calling this wine too severe, or -like. But over the next generation, this [...] "brut" [...] style with significantly less sugar than wines labeled extra dry became the fashion for Champagne and today is the modern style {{that the majority of}} Champagne is made in.|$|E
60|$|Opposed to this view, that {{aggregation}} {{is caused}} by the outward passage of fluid from the cells, are the following facts. There seems no close relation between the degree of increased secretion and that of aggregation. Thus a particle of <b>sugar</b> <b>added</b> to the secretion round a gland causes a much greater increase of secretion, and much less aggregation, than does a particle of carbonate of ammonia given in the same manner. It does not appear probable that pure water would cause much exosmose, and yet aggregation often follows from an immersion in water of between 16 hrs. and 24 hrs., and always after from 24 hrs. to 48 hrs. Still less probable is it that water at a temperature of from 125o to 130o Fahr. (51o.6 to 54o.4 Cent.) should cause fluid to pass, not only from the glands, but from all the cells of the tentacles down to their bases, so quickly that aggregation is induced within 2 m. or 3 m. Another strong argument against this view is, that, after complete aggregation, the spheres and oval masses of protoplasm float about in an abundant supply of thin colourless fluid; so that at least the latter stages of the process cannot be due to the want of fluid to hold the protoplasm in solution. There is still stronger evidence that aggregation is independent of secretion; for the papillae, described in the first chapter, with which the [page 57] leaves are studded are not glandular, and do not secrete, yet they rapidly absorb carbonate of ammonia or an infusion of raw meat, and their contents then quickly undergo aggregation, which afterwards spreads into the cells of the surrounding tissues. We shall hereafter see that the purple fluid within the sensitive filaments of Dionaea, which do not secrete, likewise undergoes aggregation from the action of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>sugars</b> <b>added</b> to foods {{have been}} {{featured}} in recent scientific research, including {{the publication of the}} World Health Organization recommendation to limit consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> based on studies on weight gain and dental caries. However, it is possible that there is evidence of an association between excessive consumption and other pathologies, but scientific studies have yet to investigate these associations. Moreover, there is no consensus on the descriptions and definitions of these sugars, with several terms and components used to designate them. In Brazil, there are few studies investigating <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> identifying a lack of discussion on this subject. This paper presents a literature review of <b>sugars</b> <b>added</b> to foods, from their definitions and classifications to the metabolism and health effects. The search was performed without limiting dates in the following databases: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and SciELO, as well as in national and international official sites. Keywords in Portuguese and English related to <b>sugars</b> <b>added</b> to foods were used, in combination with terms related to systematic review and meta-analysis studies, in order to find research linking <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption with health damage. The literature indicates that there is a relationship between excessive consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> and various health outcomes, including weight gain, type 2 diabetes Mellitus, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. The different descriptions of sugars in foods may confuse both food consumers and researchers, since each term includes different components. Thus, it is suggested to use the standardized term “added sugar” as the most suitable term for the broader population to understand, because it indicates that those sugars are not natural food components...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundReducing <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake {{is one of}} the Healthy People 2020 objectives. High <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake may be {{associated}} with adverse health consequences. ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n= 24, 967). MethodsThe outcome variable was <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in teaspoons per day. Added sugars intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. ResultsEstimated median <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake was 17. 6 tsp/d for men and 11. 7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake (men: 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp/d; women: 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake. Different patterns were found by sex. Non-Hispanic black men had lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake, whereas non-Hispanic black women had greater odds for being in the highest tertile.
