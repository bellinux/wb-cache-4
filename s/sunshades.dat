There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch <b>sunshades,</b> and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} design, {{presented to}} the public in 1994, consisted of unadorned glass cases over the theatres, and initially elicited criticisms from the public, including calling it [...] "two copulating aardvarks". Critics also accused that the design is insensitive to Singapore's location and climate as it would have created a greenhouse in the tropical climate of Singapore, but according to DPA director Vikas Gore some form of shading was always intended, and a cladding of aluminium <b>sunshades</b> was added to the final design. [...] The unique architectural design has been said to have an appearance similar to either a durian (a tropical fruit) or the eyes of a fly. Hence, the building is colloquially known to locals as [...] "the big durians".. More than 7,000 triangular aluminium <b>sunshades</b> that cover its two circular glass shell structures looked somewhat like spikes on two halves of the fruit. The structure wasn’t meant to be a durian; it ended up being like that because it seemed to the architects the most interesting way of doing <b>sunshades.</b> They wanted to use glass because the views from Esplanade are beautiful in all directions, but since Singapore is so close to the equator, the structure also had to be protected from the sunshine and heat radiation.|$|E

40|$|Geoengineering, {{intentional}} large-scale {{manipulation of}} the Earth-system, has been proposed {{as a means to}} ameliorate the impacts of global warming. There are two approaches; Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) geoengineering which would reduce C 02 concentrations and address the cause of climate change, and Solar Radiation Management geoengineering which would cool the planet by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the planet without affecting CO 2 concentrations. This thesis reviews geoengineering and investigates the direct and indirect climate effects of SRM geoengineering. The <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering scheme, which would reduce the solar insolation, is investigated in depth in this thesis. <b>Sunshade</b> gcoenginecring may be implemented at a range of C 02 concentrations and it would also offer control over the amount of insolation that reaches the planet. Both of these aspects of <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering are investigated using a climate model and it is found that <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering would ameliorate most of the effects of elevated C 02 but would cause heterogeneous changes in climate; globally reducing precipitation and leaving many regions with a climate markedly different from the pre-industrial. The regional climate effects of <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering are found to vary linearly with both the solar insolation reduction and the C 02 forcing applied. An off-line ice-sheet model is used to investigate the indirect climate effects of different strengths of <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering on the Greenland Ice-Sheet at quadrupled CO 2 levels, to determine whether <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering could stabilize the ice-sheet and reduce sea-level rise. It is found that the ice-sheet would eventually collapse at quadrupled C 02 levels but that strong <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering can stabilize the entire ice-sheet or at weaker implementations, part of the ice-sheet could be maintained. A comparison is made between the urban, crop and desert surface albedo geoengineering schemes, which would have a highly heterogeneous radiative forcing effect, and <b>sunshade</b> gcocngineering, which would have a more homogeneous radiative forcing effect. This comparison shows that regional geoengineering forcing, if it is relatively weak, may provide local and regional cooling and other benefits but for stronger land albedo forcing there are large shifts in precipitation, including substantial reductions in monsoon precipitation, which could prove to be more harmful than the effects of global warming. Finally, to determine the robustness of the results in this thesis, a perturbed parameter ensemble is developed, tested and then used to investigate the effects of parametric uncertainty on the <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering climate effects. The perturbed parameter results agree with much of what was found {{in other parts of the}} thesis about <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering but finds that there is uncertainty in the resid- ual warming at the poles, the magnitude of the northward shift of the ITCZ, and that the standard climate model may have overestimated the effectiveness of <b>sunshade</b> geoengineering at maintaining the Greenland Ice-Sheet. Overall, I find that SRM geoengineering could offer a considerable amelioration of the impacts of global warming; however, the climate would differ substantially from a low-C 02 climate, and there would be winners and losers as a result. Regional SRM geoengineering would have very heterogeneous climate impacts, potentially causing large problems but could offer a large degree of control over the climate. 'Whether the political risks that control over the climate could bring would outweigh the potential climate benefits, is an open question.
