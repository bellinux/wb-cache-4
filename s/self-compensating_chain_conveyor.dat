The main problem has been the increased resistance during removal of material from the underground hopper. Revealed resistances against material movement were not considered in the original design at all. In the next step, structural modifications of problematic nodes were made. For example, the following changes have been made: reduction of storage space or installation of passive elements into the interior of the underground hopper. These modifications made were not effective enough, so the type of the conveyor was changed from a drag <b>chain</b> <b>conveyor</b> to a belt conveyor. The simulation of the material extraction using a belt conveyor showed a significant reduction in resistance parameters while maintaining the required transport performance...|$|R
