5|$|On {{the evening}} of April 6, 2002, a grease fire {{broke out in the}} Hardee's {{restaurant}} at the Belle Plaine service plaza. Exacerbated by heavy winds, the fire destroyed the building, which also contained a travel information center. Four fire departments responded to the scene. The assistant fire chief and fire chief of the Wellington Fire Department gave conflicting statements on whether the unavailability of the Wellington water tower, which had been emptied while it was being repainted, had hampered efforts to extinguish the blaze. The fire burned for three hours, with hot spots still <b>smoldering</b> the following day. No injuries were reported. The fire caused $2 million in damages. The service plaza was rebuilt, with a reopening celebration occurring on July 24, 2003.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is conducted {{to investigate the}} <b>smolder</b> initiation behavior of horizontally oriented flexible Polyurethane foams under natural convection. This study mainly aims to explore the controlling factors affecting the <b>smolder</b> initiation time of polyurethane foams under natural convection. Different ignition powers are tested for the investigation of its influence on the <b>smolder</b> initiation time. It is found that the <b>smolder</b> initiation time decreases with the ignition power. In order to shed some insight {{on the effect of}} retardant additives on the <b>smolder</b> initiation, both fire retarded and non-fire retarded polyurethane foams are addressed for comparison. The experimental results suggest that the <b>smolder</b> initiation time of the fire retarded foams is longer than that of the non-fire retarded foams at a higher ignition power. At a lower ignition power, an inverse result is observed. Besides the ignition power and the retardant additives that show effects on the <b>smolder</b> initiation of the polyurethane foam, it is also found that the <b>smolder</b> initiation time increases with the foam length...|$|R

40|$|<b>Smolder</b> spread {{experiments}} for a thin horizontal cellulosic {{powder bed}} of high bulk density {{were conducted with}} an air stream over the bed. In the experiments, achievement of a two-dimensional structure of the <b>smolder</b> zone was attempted, and spread rate, cross-sectional views, and temperature profiles of the <b>smolder</b> zone were examined. It was observed that for forward <b>smolder</b> spread as the air stream velocity increases, the dependence of the spread rate on the air stream velocity increases at first, but above a critical air stream velocity the spread rate becomes almost independent of the air stream velocity and ultimately complete extinction of the <b>smolder</b> zone occurs. This variation is closely related with the variation {{of the structure of}} the <b>smolder</b> zone as seen in cross-sectional views. From the comparison of experimental data, it is inferred that the heat balance around the intersection between the exposed, inclined surface of the char oxidation zone and the top surface of the virgin part of the bed is very important to the <b>smolder</b> spread behavior in a thin and high density fuel layer. The aerodynamic effects in the boundary layer over the <b>smolder</b> zone surface control the spread behavior through heat transfer processes. Key Words...|$|R
5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} <b>smoldering</b> logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E
5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes <b>smoldering,</b> or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E
5|$|Picking {{up where}} Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle {{deep in the}} catacombs with Radu's mother, who brings her son {{back from the dead}} with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left <b>smoldering</b> and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{buoyancy}} on {{the rate of}} spread of a concurrent <b>smolder</b> reaction through a porous combustible material is investigated theoretically and experimentally. In the experiments, buoyant forces are controlled by varying the density difference, and the <b>smolder</b> rate spread through porous alpha cellulose (0. 83 void fraction) is measured {{as a function of}} the ambient air pressure. The <b>smolder</b> velocity is found to increase with the ambient pressure; extinction occurs when the buoyancy forces cannot overcome the drag forces, indicating that diffusion by itself cannot support the spread of a <b>smolder</b> reaction. Theoretical predictions are found to be in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to study the ignition of both forward and opposed <b>smolder</b> of a high void fraction, flexible, polyurethane foam in a forced oxidizer flow. Tests are conducted in a small scale, vertically oriented, combustion chamber with supporting instrumentation. An electrically heated Nichrome wire heater placed between two porous ceramic disks, {{one of which is}} in complete contact with the foam surface, is used to supply the necessary power to ignite and sustain a <b>smolder</b> reaction. The gaseous oxidizer, metered via mass flow controllers, is forced through the foam and heater. A constant power is applied to the igniter for a given period of time and the resulting <b>smolder</b> is monitored to determine if <b>smolder</b> is sustained without the assistance of the heater, in which case <b>smolder</b> ignition is considered achieved. Reaction zone temperature and <b>smolder</b> propagation velocities are obtained from the temperature histories of thermocouples embedded at predetermined positions in the foam with junctions placed along the fuel centerline. Tests are conducted with oxygen mass fractions ranging from 0. 109 to 1. 0 at a velocity of 0. 1 mm/s during the ignition period, and 0. 7 or 3. 0 mm/s during the self-sustained propagation period. The results show a well defined <b>smolder</b> ignition regime primarily determined by two parameters: igniter heat flux, and the time the igniter is powered. These two parameters determine a minimum igniter/foam temperature, and a minimum depth of <b>smolder</b> propagation (char), which are conditions required for ignition to occur. The former is needed to establish a strong <b>smolder</b> reaction, and the latter to reduce heat losses from the incipient <b>smolder</b> reaction to the surrounding environment. The ignition regime is shifted to shorter times for a given igniter heat flux with increasing oxygen mass fraction. A model based on concepts similar to those developed to describe the ignition of solid fuels has been developed that describes well the experimental ignition results...|$|R
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a <b>smoldering</b> skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

40|$|Results {{from two}} forward forced-flow <b>smolder</b> tests on {{polyurethane}} foam using air as oxidizer conducted aboard the NASA Space Shuttle (STS- 105 and STS- 108 missions) {{are presented in}} this work. The two tests provide the only presently available forward <b>smolder</b> data in microgravity. A complimentary series of ground-based tests were also conducted to determine, by comparison with the microgravity data, the effect of gravity on the forward <b>smolder</b> propagation. The objective {{of the study is}} to provide {{a better understanding of the}} controlling mechanisms of <b>smolder</b> for the purpose of control and prevention, both in normal- and microgravity. The data consists of temperature histories from thermocouples placed at various axial locations along the fuel sample centerline, and of permeability histories obtained from ultrasonic transducer pairs also located at various axial positions in the fuel sample. A comparison of the tests conducted in normal- and microgravity indicates that <b>smolder</b> propagation velocities are higher in microgravity than in normal gravity, and that there is a greater tendency for a transition to flame in microgravity than in normal gravity. This is due primarily to the reduced heat losses in the microgravity environment, leading to increased char oxidation. This observation is confirmed through a simplified one-dimensional model of the forward <b>smolder</b> propagation. This finding has important implications from the point of view of fire safety in a space-based environment, since <b>smolder</b> can often occur in the forward mode and potentially lead to a smolder-initiated fire.

40|$|Coal {{temperatures}} {{affect the}} burn properties of cigarettes. Thermal imaging {{was used to}} determine the average maximum surface coal temperatures during <b>smolder</b> of cigarettes of different tobacco types. The thermal imaging camera was calibrated against a reference blackbody. An emissivity correction was necessary since the set point temperatures of the reference blackbody did not correspond to the measured temperatures of the reference blackbody. A 0. 87 camera emissivity was applied to provide accurate coal temperatures at a corrected emissivity of approximately 1. The average maximum surface coal temperatures during <b>smolder</b> of unfiltered single-tobacco-type cigarettes and a commercial blend cigarette were determined (with the camera lens focused parallel to the cigarette), and no discernible differences among them were found. The calculated average maximum surface coal temperature during <b>smolder</b> for all cigarettes was 584 AA± 15 °C. During <b>smolder,</b> thermocouples were used to measure the temperature of the gas phase (along the central axis of coal), and the thermal imaging camera was used to measure the temperature of the solid phase of the coal's surface. Using thermocouples, the peak coal temperatures {{in the center of the}} coal during <b>smolder</b> for three filtered single-tobacco-type cigarettes were 736 - 744 °C. Peak coal temperatures, measured by thermal imaging, on the surface of the coal (with the camera lens focused coaxially with the coal and the ash removed) for the same three single-tobacco-type cigarettes had a range of 721 - 748 °C. There was good correspondence between the two techniques. These results confirm that during <b>smolder</b> the gas-phase temperature inside the coal (as measured with the thermocouple) and the solid-phase temperatures beneath the ash (as measured with the camera) are in near thermal equilibrium. With proper calibration, a thermal imaging system is a good alternative to thermocouples for measuring cigarette coal temperatures...|$|R
