5000|$|These western sediments {{accumulated}} as nearshore {{and coastal}} sands and silts as well, and are counterparts to the Dakota Formation {{on the eastern}} side of the Seaway. However, these counterpart sediments originated from the other side of the sea and were carried by rivers flowing in opposite directions. These western sediments are equivalent to the Dakota Formation of the Great Plains, but are not exactly the same strata. Individual formations in the western Dakota Group have local names. In Wyoming, the term Cloverly Formation has been expanded by some authors to include sediments formerly placed within the Dakota Formation. Along the Colorado Front Range, the lower, terrestrial beds, or facies, of the Dakota Group are sometimes called the Lytle Formation, and near-shore marine facies are called the South Platte Formation. In eastern Utah and western Colorado, Young introduced the term Naturita Formation for a series of facies in the larger [...] "Dakota Group".

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{controlling}} a team of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles to perform agile maneuvers while holding a fixed relative formation, as well as transitioning between a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>formations.</b> The objective is to coordinate the quadrotors to fly in intricate interlaced patterns, similarly to an air show demonstration team. The paper proposes a new abstraction, called a Virtual Rigid Body, which allows the quadrotors to hold relative positions while executing agile maneuvers as a group. By planning trajectories for the Virtual Rigid Body in SE(3), trajectories for each quadrotor are obtained {{in order to maintain}} the desired forma-tion during the maneuver. The paper also proposes {{a method for}} sequencing a series of Virtual Rigid Body formations, and automatically designing collision free transitions between successive formations, while the team simultaneously executes a trajectory in SE(3). The resulting <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>formations</b> and transitions gives trajectories that weave intricate designs while avoiding collisions.

40|$|Abstract—Historically, footprint-bearing localities {{in eastern}} and western North America and {{southern}} Thuringia and northern Bavaria have played pivotal roles in Triassic archosaur footprint research. In a nearly complete <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>formations</b> and footprint-horizons in the Moenkopi Group (U. S. A.), Newark Supergroup (U. S. A. and Canada), and Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk, and Keuper groups (Olenekian to Norian-Rhaetian) of central Europe, the principal morphs of archosaur footprints are represented by Rotodactylus, Synaptichnium, Isochirotherium, Brachychirotherium, Chirotherium, Sphingopus, Parachirotherium, Atreipus, and Grallator. Additionally, the temporal and, in principal, the evolutionary “root ” is documented by Protochirotherium from the early Olenekian of Hessen. Of utmost significance is the evolutionary succession from Chirotherium to Grallator. Therein, the development of two key features seen in the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs – tridactyl foot-morphology and the bipedal gait – is documented between the Olenekian and Norian. The strati-graphic distribution of these forms and their potential for biochronology yields a biochronological sequence we sketch out as follows: For the Triassic we discriminate six successive biochrons (I-VI).

40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} {{and age of}} a sauropod nesting ground {{containing the}} first definitive em-bryonic remains of sauropods preserved inside their eggs is analyzed. The fossil locality, called Auca Mahuevo, occurs in the Anacleto Member of the Rı́o Colorado Formation in Neuquén Province, Argentina. The 5 m thick interval of overbank mudstones containing the fossilized eggs and embryos occurs near {{the middle of a}} 35 m sequence of thin, fluvial, concretionary sandstones and thicker units of silty sandstone. Flooding of shallow stream channels deposited overbank silt and mud on the eggs, killing the embryos and initiating the process of fossil-ization. Egg fragments containing patches of fossilized integument were found as float weath-ering out of the mudstone on local flats. Complete eggs containing embryonic bones and teeth were quarried from a steep ridge where the mudstone was exposed. Twelve paleomagnetic samples collected throughout the lower 30 m of the section establish the presence of a Reverse geomagnetic polarity interval.

40|$|A {{combined}} {{field and}} laboratory {{investigation of the}} primarily volcanic Roskruge range, Pima County, Arizona, produced the following results: The rocks in the area fall into three major and several minor divisions. The major groups are: (1) The pre-Laramide dark-colored andesites and sediments that floor the range. A K-Ar date {{on one of the}} andesites produced a number, 108 m. y., on a whole rock analysis. (2) The brightly colored and widespread Laramide volcanics and an associated hypabyssal pluton at Cocoraque Butte, which gave K-Ar mineral ages in the 74 m. y. to 66 m. y. spread. (3) The mid-Tertiary potassic basaltic andesites found on an eroded plain that is cut into the Laramide volcanics. These dark-colored extrusives were dated at 23 m. y. by whole rock K-Ar. Amongst the minor units in distribution is the petrographically unusual Recortado ash flow, a small 13 m. ye old unit that preserves a vitrophyre just above its base. Also included in the miscellaneous group of units are the post-orogenic true basalts, which appear as dikes and as a flow(?) at Brawley Wash and which gave whole rock K-Ar dates of about 10 m. y. Initial strontium 87 / 86 ratios indicate that the Laramide and mid-Tertiary rocks (including the Recortado ash flow) have values ranging from. 7056 to. 7092, while the Brawley Wash basalt has a true deep-seated basalt ratio of. 7038.

30|$|The {{study of}} the maximum {{displacements}} of basic modules as constituent elements of VG at incipient collapse may help appreciate {{the essence of the}} proposed procedures. Two local deformability conditions affect the global displacements of the vierendeel frame. Depending upon their location, neighboring modules can deform and rotate either in the same or opposite directions. Module rotations are caused due to changes in plastic curvatures or as dictated by the boundary support conditions. The numerals 1 and 2 in the purely sway collapse mechanisms of Fig.  4 refer to the <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the plastic hinges. The dashed lines of Figs.  1 e, 4 c, d represent specific locations where the curvature tends to reverse direction. The dashed line elements tend to remain elastic and render the modules effectively fix ended. For fixed end modules, the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the hinges depends on the over-strength factor λ as well as the relative stiffness ρ of the module. In case of modules of US, i.e., λ =  1, plastic hinges can form at the four corners simultaneously.|$|R

30|$|Hence, an {{observed}} assertion {{was made}} that points of inflections of all members of VG of US occur at their mid spans during the elastic as well as plastic stages of loading. This is an acceptable presumption with inconsequential margins of error since the solution becomes more accurate and eventually exact as plasticity spreads over {{all members of the}} structure. These observations form the essence of the optimization philosophies that lead to the minimum weight design of regular moment frames including parallel chord VG. Likewise, the indispensible association of the mid-span points of inflection with the exact minimum weight design conditions immensely facilitates the comprehension and mathematical formulation of the problem. In addition, an observation has been made that in almost all types of traditionally designed frameworks, the drift angle due to racking effects is generally a maximum near the supports and a minimum near the location of maximum displacement (Taranath 1998). This suggests that it would be prudent to first alleviate the possibility <b>of</b> premature <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> plastic hinges within the first and last bays of the frame, minimize large drift angles near the supports and then work sideways to control the displacements of the remaining bays or modules. The anticipated single collapse mechanisms of structures of US have more than one degree of kinematic freedom and can be construed as being composed of several merging failure patterns. Structures of US almost invariably fail through a state of over-complete collapse. The likelihood of over-complete collapse, suggests that the <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> the plastic hinges may be controlled {{in such a way as}} to prevent the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> plastic hinges in the vertical members until the first sets of hinges form in the desired locations of the horizontal elements. Similarly it would be possible to delay the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> plastic hinges at the critical ends of the horizontal members until the complete failure of all vertical members. Moment control technologies, such as added flange plates and/or reduced beam sections can be employed to induce any mode <b>of</b> collapse and <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> plastic hinges, without noticeably affecting the ultimate load carrying and/or displacement development capacity of the structure.|$|R
