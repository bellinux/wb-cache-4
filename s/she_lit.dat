25|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Empedocles {{postulated}} that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that <b>she</b> <b>lit</b> {{the fire in the}} eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.|$|E
25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that <b>she</b> <b>lit</b> a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so he knew that she was waiting for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while <b>she</b> <b>lit</b> a cigarette, and it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible. Like Antony and Cleopatra, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, {{and in the same}} unhappy theater.|$|E

60|$|The waiter {{was busy}} {{now with the}} removal of their luncheon. To Arnold, the {{necessary}} exchange of commonplaces was an immense relief.

25|$|The woman's pearl {{necklace}} probably {{relates to}} pearls as ancient symbols of virginity, according to Cant.

60|$|She {{stood in}} her white dress, wondering, {{down there in the}} barge. The lean man sitting near to her watched {{her as if she were}} a strange being, as if <b>she</b> <b>lit</b> up his face. His eyes smiled on her, boldly, and yet with {{exceeding}} admiration underneath.|$|E
60|$|Then she rose--wretched, broken, terrified--but {{nevertheless}} {{resolved to}} put all selfish fears aside and to ascertain {{the full extent of}} the tragedy which had been enacted outside her door. <b>She</b> <b>lit</b> the storm-lantern, then, with it in her hand, she went through the tap-room and opened the front door.|$|E
