5000|$|Back <b>siphonage</b> is a {{plumbing}} term {{applied to}} the reversal of normal water flow in a plumbing system due to sharply reduced or negative pressure on the water supply side, such as high demand on water supply by fire-fighting; {{it is not an}} actual siphon as it is suction. [...] Back <b>siphonage</b> is rare as it depends on submerged inlets at the outlet (home) end and these are uncommon. Back <b>siphonage</b> is {{not to be confused with}} backflow; which is the reversed flow of water from the outlet end to the supply end caused by pressure occurring at the outlet end.|$|E
50|$|Backflow occurs {{for one of}} two reasons, either back {{pressure}} or back <b>siphonage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Back <b>siphonage</b> is {{the result}} of supply {{pressure}} being lowered below that of the system. This may occur when a supply is interrupted or drained down.|$|E
5000|$|Excessive {{negative}} air pressure, {{behind a}} [...] "slug" [...] {{of water that}} is draining, can siphon water from traps at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a toilet outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced <b>siphonage.</b> An empty trap can allow noxious sewer gases to enter a building.|$|E
50|$|The {{double check}} valve {{assembly}} is suitable for prevention of back pressure and back <b>siphonage,</b> but is not suitable for high hazard applications. It is commonly used on lawn irrigation, fire sprinkler and combi-boiler systems. If the hazard is higher, even a relatively low hazard such as using antifreeze in the fire sprinkler system, then a more reliable check valve such as a reduced pressure zone device may be mandated.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} loop, {{though not}} {{often used in}} plumbing practice, is an arrangement of pipes formed into a vertical loop to prevent backflow of water within the plumbing potable water system. Since a siphon has a maximum height that it can work (about 33 feet), a hydrostatic loop is built higher than 33 feet. There {{are several ways to}} prevent <b>siphonage</b> and an undesirable backflow of the water in a plumbing system.|$|E
5000|$|A simple {{example is}} the space between a wall mounted faucet and the sink rim (this space is the air gap). Water can easily flow from the faucet into the sink, {{but there is no}} way that water can flow from the sink into the faucet without modifying the system. This {{arrangement}} will prevent any contaminants in the sink from flowing into the potable water system by <b>siphonage</b> and is the least expensive form of backflow prevention.|$|E
50|$|<b>Siphonage</b> enlarges {{the effect}} of {{centrifugal}} filtration and siphon chamber is used for backwashing to avoid the loading of filter cloth. To ensure non-vibration filtration, filtering speed can be controlled. Once high G and siphon effect are combined, powerful dewatering, greatly saving on energy are possible at the drying stage. Fast cake raking minimizes loss of time and driving power as well. And siphon mechanism makes the cleaning operation various and cleaning time and liquid are saved.|$|E
50|$|Back <b>siphonage</b> may be {{prevented}} {{by use of}} a vertical air gap. This may be a small gap, such as provided by a tundish (a combined overflow spout and catch funnel) or a large gap, such as a basin tap being above the maximum level {{of the water in}} the basin. Standards for these air gaps group them by the amount of separation that they provide and their acceptability for the various risk categories. The size of the acceptable gap also depends on the capacity of the incoming supply, such that a stuck-open flow cannot overfill the cistern and close the gap.|$|E
50|$|If {{the outlet}} {{of the line}} is {{at a higher level}} than the tank of the pump, a check valve is often fitted at the outlet of the pump so that liquid cannot flow {{backwards}} into the pump's tank. If the outlet is below the tank level, <b>siphonage</b> usually naturally clears the output line of all liquid when the pump is deenergized. In cold regions of the world, it is important that condensate lines that are exhausted outside be carefully designed so that no water can remain in the line to freeze up; this would block the line from further operation.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the first}} to use spinal {{anesthesia}} in the United States in 1889, the developer of the intravenous drip technique, of suction, of <b>siphonage</b> in abdominal operations, and the first to surgically repair aneurysms. Furthermore, he {{was the first}} to perform a Kondoleon operation for elephantiasis in the US. Many of his publications continue to be cited through the 2000s. William Osler called him the [...] "Father of Vascular Surgery." [...] He was a founding member of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, and a member of its first council in 1917, serving as its third President in 1919. During World War I, he led the United States School for War Fractures.

5000|$|Building codes often contain {{specific}} {{sections on}} back <b>siphonage</b> {{and especially for}} external faucets (See the sample building code quote, below). Backflow prevention devices such as anti-siphon valves are required in such designs. The reason is that external faucets may be attached to hoses which may be immersed in an external body of water, such as a garden pond, swimming pool, aquarium or washing machine. In these situations the flow is not actually a siphon but suction due to reduced pressure on the water supply side. Should the pressure within the water supply system fall, the external water may be returned by back pressure into the drinking water system through the faucet. Another possible contamination point is the water intake in the toilet tank. An anti-siphon valve is also required here to prevent pressure drops in the water supply line from suctioning {{water out of the}} toilet tank (which may contain additives such as [...] "toilet blue") and contaminating the water system. Anti-siphon valves function as a one-direction check valve.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Johannesburg {{appointed}} a city manager {{to reshape the}} city's ailing financial situation. The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called [...] "iGoli 2002". This was a restructuring plan {{to be completed in}} 2002, that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. While strongly opposed by unions who feared a loss of jobs, the plan went into effect and returned some sectors into [...] "cash cows" [...] that helped support the city in general. Although some jobs were lost, there were no mass firings, as agencies used attrition to remove excess staff. The plan took the city from near insolvency to an operating surplus of R 153 million (US$23.6 million).Following the relative success of iGoli 2002, the city undertook a number of initiatives both to help equalise municipal services benefits, such as the water utility's Free Basic Water policy, and to curb fraud and increase payment percentages, such as the water utility's Operation Gcin'amanzi to repipe areas to eliminate <b>siphonage</b> and to install water meters for excess use. Nonetheless, according to the opposition party, fraud, theft and non-payment still remained problems [...] In fiscal year 2011, the city's audit had R 45,796 million chalked up to fraudulent activities. In 2013, the city admitted that it would be unable to collect two-thirds of the R 18 billion in outstanding billings.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} irrigation through burr hole with <b>siphonage</b> drainage on chronic subdural hematoma(CSDH). Methods The clinical data of 139 patients with CSDH(89 males and 50 females,aged from 48 to 87 with mean of 66. 4 years) hospitalized from Jan. 2006 to Dec. 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients were finally diagnosed by radiology,and divided into 3 groups according to the operative method,i. e. parietal burr hole irrigation with drainage group(group A,n= 47),parietal burr hole irrigation and aspiration group(group B,n= 41),and frontal burr hole irrigation with <b>siphonage</b> drainage group(group C,n= 51). All the patients were treated with closed drainage for 2 - 6 days. The activity of daily living(ADL) scores was measured before and 7 days after operation in all patients. The patients were followed-up for 12 - 36 months to observe the treatment results. Results No death occurred in the 3 groups during the follow-up period. The improvement of ADL was markedly better in group C than in group B(P 0. 05). Conclusion The frontal burr hole irrigation with <b>siphonage</b> drainage has a definite treatment effect for CSDH with a low recurrence rate and less complications,and is appropriate to use in most of CSDH patients...|$|E
30|$|Treatment of {{raw water}} {{will result in}} a {{decrease}} in microbial load, with many distribution systems later experiencing an increase in bacterial numbers with distance away from the point of treatment. The deterioration in water quality occurs either because of regrowth of microorganisms in biofilms, which are formed on interior surfaces of water pipes, or because of back <b>siphonage</b> of contaminated water. Biological activity in biofilms is controlled by nutrient content of water, temperature and residual chlorine (Gatel et al. 2000).|$|E

40|$|Absorption {{of calcium}} was {{measured}} by direct intubation and perfusion of the small intestine in 10 volunteer normal adult subjects, two adults with celiac-sprue, and one with a parathyroid adenoma. A total of 60 studies were completed using one of two different levels, duodenojejunum or ileum. Solutions containing stable calcium, radiocalcium 47, and a nonabsorbable dilution-concentration marker, polyethylene glycol, were infused at a uniform rate via the proximal lumen of a triple-lumen polyvinyl tube. The mixed intraluminal contents were continuously sampled by <b>siphonage</b> from two distal sites, 10 and 60 cm below the point of infusion.

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{explaining}} {{testing procedures}} {{used to evaluate}} the potential of natural ventilation and daylighting applications to passive design of housing in Ghana. The objectives of research were to reduce energy costs and increase the sustainability of housing. From the results of these experiments actual and potential designs are illustrated and discussed. Mass housing results in multi-storey buildings which require substantial artificial lighting and ventilation. Also, with the increasing usage of glass for windows and doors in Ghana, even the shaded depths of buildings require additional daylight usually resulting in more energy consumption. By supplementing the internal lighting levels with daylight, reducing the internal heat load by shading windows to direct radiation and the utilization of natural ventilation over air conditioning where possible, significant energy savings are could be achieved. The research proposes mass housing design changes such as: delivering daylight above the suspended ceiling into the depths of the building by horizontal light pipes and natural ventilation, utilizing stack effect and wind <b>siphonage,</b> etc...|$|E
40|$|Dental-unit {{water systems}} (DUWS) harbor {{bacterial}} biofilms, which {{may serve as}} a haven for pathogens. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the microbial load of water from DUWS in general dental practices and the biofouling of DUWS tubing. Water and tube samples were taken from 55 dental surgeries in southwestern England. Contamination was determined by viable counts on environmentally selective, clinically selective, and pathogen-selective media, and biofouling was determined by using microscopic and image analysis techniques. Microbial loading ranged from 500 to 105 CFU · ml− 1; in 95 % of DUWS water samples, it exceeded European Union drinking water guidelines and in 83 % it exceeded American Dental Association DUWS standards. Among visible bacteria, 68 % were viable by BacLight staining, but only 5 % of this “viable by BacLight” fraction produced colonies on agar plates. Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., Candida spp., and Pseudomonas spp. were detected in one, five, two, and nine different surgeries, respectively. Presumptive oral streptococci and Fusobacterium spp. were detected in four and one surgeries, respectively, suggesting back <b>siphonage</b> and failure of antiretraction devices. Hepatitis B virus was never detected. Decontamination strategies (5 of 55 surgeries) significantly reduced biofilm coverage but significantly increased microbial numbers in the water phase (in both cases, P < 0. 05). Microbial loads were not significantly different in DUWS fed with soft, hard, deionized, or distilled water or in different DUWS (main, tank, or bottle fed). Microbiologically, no DUWS can be considered “cleaner” than others. DUWS deliver water to patients with microbial levels exceeding those considered safe for drinking water...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Using an {{electrical}} technique we estimated {{the thickness of}} the unstirred layer in the human jejunum during kinetic studies of electrogenic glucose absorption. The unstirred layer in seven healthy volunteers (632 + 24,um: mean + SEM) was significantly thicker than in 10 patients with active coeliac disease (442 + 23,um) but not significantly different in seven patients who had responded to treatment by gluten withdrawal (585 + 49,um). There were similar differences in the values of 'Apparent Km ' for electrogenic glucose absorption between healthy control subjects (36 + 6 mM) active coeliac patients (11 1 mM) and treated coeliac patients (31 + 5 mM). The changes in PDmax however, showed a different pattern. The PDmax in the active coeliac group (6 f 8 + 0 7 mV) was lower than in controls (7 - 6 + 0 - 6 mV) but not significantly so, while the PDmax in the treated coeliac group (10 - 6 + 0 9 mV) was significantly higher than in both the active coeliac and control groups. It should be noted that both operational kinetic parameters obtained in the present study are much lower than those obtained previously (Read et al., 1976 b) because of the use of <b>siphonage.</b> Analysis of the results using a computer simulation indicates that the reduction in Apparent Km in active coeliac disease can be caused by the interaction of the decreased maximal absorption rate for glucose (Jmax) with the attenuated unstirred layer. In these circumstances it i...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{organization}} of water supply to and on ships differs considerably {{from that of}} water supply on land. Risks of contamination can arise from source water at the port or during loading, storage, or distribution on the ship. The {{purpose of this article}} is to review documented outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with passenger, cargo, fishing, and naval ships to identify contributing factors so that similar outbreaks can be prevented in the future. METHODS: The authors reviewed 21 reported outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with ships. For each outbreak, data on pathogens/toxins, type of ship, factors contributing to outbreaks, mortality and morbidity, and remedial action are presented. RESULTS: The findings of this review show that the majority of reported outbreaks were associated with passenger ships and that more than 6, 400 people were affected. Waterborne outbreaks due to Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, noroviruses, Salmonella spp, Shigella sp, Cryptosporidium sp, and Giardia lamblia occurred on ships. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was the pathogen most frequently associated with outbreaks. One outbreak of chemical water poisoning also occurred on a ship. Risk factors included contaminated port water, inadequate treatment, improper loading techniques, poor design and maintenance of storage tanks, ingress of contamination during repair and maintenance, cross-connections, back <b>siphonage,</b> and insufficient residual disinfectant. CONCLUSIONS: Waterborne disease outbreaks on ships can be prevented. The factors contributing to outbreaks emphasize the need for hygienic handling of water along the supply chain from source to consumption. A comprehensive approach to water safety on ships is essential. This may be achieved by the adoption of Water Safety Plans that cover design, construction, operation, and routine inspection and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|The {{most serious}} and fatal {{operative}} complications of the closed heart surgical procedures are massive hemorrhage from an accidental left atrial tear unexpectedly. In these cases, had been equipped for elecktlically induced ventricular fibrillation, the blood loss {{might have been}} mininal and facilitated exposure to permit rapid suturing of the defect, so I would like to emphasize to the usefulness of induced vontricular fibrillation in the control of massive hemorrhage from the heart. So I had been carried on laboratory studies to induced ventricular fibrillation in normothermic dogs and obtained the following results. 1) Continuing the ventricular fibrillation for over 5 minutes duration, there were no surviveddogs, but all survived to the cirrulatory arrest within 4 minutes, three of the 4 dogs died but only I dog stayed alive between 4 to 5 minutes. It has been showed that in dog the safe length of circulatory arrest inducing ventricular fibrillation under normothermic conditions is 4 minutes. 2) Incising left atrium, the mean blood loss was 120 ml per minute, equal to 15 ml prokilogramm per minute. Inducing ventricular fibrillation soon after atriotomy, the mean blood loss was 80 ml, equal to 12 ml prolkilogramm per minut. The mcan blood loss was 50 ml in atriotomy under induced ventricular fibrillation, equal to 4 ml prokilogramm per minut, it was effective in reducing blood loss compared with the former. 3) Blood pressure almost dropped to Zero under ventricular fibrillation but there {{was not able to}} provide a dry operative field in the results of persistent venous return secondary to <b>siphonage</b> effect. Induced ventricular fibrillation definitly facilitates the intracardiac procedures and prevent air embolism from the removal of loose intracardiac thrombi...|$|E
