5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were <b>set)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E

5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes <b>set</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E

He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture.

The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye. On April 18, he met Sharon Kinne when {{she bought a}} Ford Thunderbird from his dealership {{using some of the}} insurance payout from her husband's death, and the two began an affair shortly thereafter. Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined to go on a trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly <b>set</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E
5|$|Development of Dark Forces {{was led by}} Daron Stinnett. The {{programming}} was led by Ray Gresko, and {{the graphics}} and storyline by Justin Chin. Production began in September 1993, {{at a time when}} the first-person shooter genre was very popular. The idea of creating a first-person shooter in the Star Wars universe was inspired by fan mods of Doom which had levels <b>set</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Death Star. The developers of Dark Forces wanted to adapt the FPS format into an adventure game. To do this they introduced puzzles and strategy, along with a Star Wars plot. Originally Luke Skywalker was intended to be the main character in the game, however the developers realized that this would add constraints to gameplay and storyline. Instead a new character, Kyle Katarn, was created.|$|E

5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the <b>set</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} March 2008, and later {{finished}} on August {{in the same}} year. Before principal photography commenced, director Colm McCarthy participated in helicopter shots over London. In each block of episodes, {{the cast and crew}} would often film all scenes held in certain locations at once, for instance all scenes <b>set</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Grid, although taking place in different parts of each episodes, would all be filmed together before moving on to another set. However, the cast had trouble following the storylines with this method. A different Director of Photography was hired in each episode. Because of this, the filming style inside the Grid set changed in every episode. To film public shots, a small filming crew were used as to not attract too much attention from passers by. However, by using the small crew, they and the actors generally film the scenes unnoticed by the public, which the producers felt gave the characters such gravitas.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of the High Seas Fleet {{at the end of}} the war, Princess Royal and the 1st BCS made up part of the guard force in Scapa Flow.

She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922. She was sold for scrap in December 1922 to meet the tonnage limitations <b>set</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy by the Washington Naval Treaty, and arrived at the breakers on 13 August 1923.|$|E
