40|$|Food habits were {{examined}} for the spottail shiner, Notropis hudsonius, in Indiana waters of Lake Michigan from June to October, 1973. Insects {{were the primary}} volumetric component of the diet. Chironomus spp. larvae and chironomidae pupae {{were the most important}} insect food items consumed. The most important zooplankton organism consumed was the benthic cladoceran Eurycercus lamellatus. Alewife, Alosa pseudoharenqus, eggs were the only other significant food consumed. A monthly comparison of food items taken by spottails showed that Chironomus spp. larvae was an important food item in all months and the primary item in September and October. Chironomidae pupae were important from June through September with greatest percent volume consumed in July, The cladoceran, Eurycercus lamellatus was an important food from July through September, reaching its highest percent volume of the diet in August. Alewife eggs were the major food of spottails in June but were also important in July. Young-of-the-year spottails fed primarily on zooplankton for the first month of their existence, but their diet changed in succeeding months and was {{similar to that of the}} adults. Analysis of competition between spottail <b>shiners,</b> yellow <b>perch</b> and alewives revealed important overlap in food items in June, August, September and October. Competition in June was between spottail <b>shiners</b> and yellow <b>perch</b> (100 - 250 mm) for alewife eggs. In August, the spottail shiner and alewife (140 - 220 mm) competed for chironomids and the spottail <b>shiner</b> and yellow <b>perch</b> competed for Eurycercus lamellatus. September competition was between spottail <b>shiner</b> and yellow <b>perch</b> (26 - 100 mm) for chironomids and between yellow perch (26 - 100 mm) and alewives (140 - 220 mm) for alewife larvae.

40|$|Student paper, BIOL 3811, 2011 Fish use {{a number}} of methods to avoid {{detection}} by predators and survive.

We proposed to test the responses of Notropis heterolepis (Blacknose Shiners) {{to each of these}} stimuli given by predator Yellow Perch, Perca flavescens. We predicted that shiners would increase activity in response to the visual stimulus, and would decrease activity in response to the kairomone stimulus.

Alewife, spottail <b>shiner,</b> yellow <b>perch</b> and round goby were the prevailing larval species. Alewives dominated the catch and were in highest abundance near East Chicago. In general, night catch rates were greater when compared to day catch rates, suggesting a diurnal difference in trawl susceptibility. Stratified larval trawling was subsequently conducted during June and July 2011 to detect whether diurnal vertical migration existed, potentially affecting day and night catch rates. Vertical migration was not detected in the stratified larval sampling, eliminating it {{as a factor in}} higher nighttime catch rates. Further, the most common fish, alewife, was measured (TL) to determine whether size was a factor in trawl avoidance and to provide information regarding trawl selectivity. Night trawls yielded larger size classes of alewife, potentially explaining higher nighttime catch rates. These data suggests a size bias of our larval trawl exists when comparing day and night samples, as well as the limited efficiency of our trawl to catch larger larval size classes.

40|$|Population density {{might be}} an {{important}} variable in determining the degree of multiple paternity. In a previous study, {{a high level of}} multiple paternity was detected in the <b>shiner</b> <b>perch</b> Cymatogaster aggregata, a species with high population density and a high mate encounter rate. The tule perch Hysterocarpus traski is phylogenetically closely related to C. aggregata, but it has relatively lower population density, which may result in distinct patterns of multiple paternity in these 2 species. To test the hypothesis that mate encounter rate may affect the rate of successful mating, we used polymorphic microsatellite markers to identify multiple paternity in the progeny arrays of 12 pregnant females from a natural population of tule perch. Multiple paternity was detected in 11 (92 %) of the 12 broods. The number of sires per brood ranged from 1 to 4 (mean 2. 5) but with no correlation between sire number and brood size. Although the brood size of tule perch is considerably larger than that of <b>shiner</b> <b>perch</b> (40. 7 vs. 12. 9, respectively), the average number of sires per brood in tule perch is much lower than that in <b>shiner</b> <b>perch</b> (2. 5 vs. 4. 6, respectively).

Nevertheless, this pond is not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel, though not abundant, are its chief boast. I have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds: a long and shallow one, steel-colored, most like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with greenish reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common here; and another, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a trout. The specific name reticulatus would not apply to this; it should be guttatus rather. These are all very firm fish, and weigh more than their size promises. The <b>shiners,</b> pouts, and <b>perch</b> also, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond, are much cleaner, handsomer, and firmer-fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds, as the water is purer, and they can easily be distinguished from them. Probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are also a clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few mussels in it; muskrats and minks leave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it. Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the morning, I disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the night. Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall, the white-bellied swallows (Hirundo bicolor) skim over it, and the peetweets (Totanus macularius) [...] "teeter" [...] along its stony shores all summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fish hawk sitting on a white pine over the water; but I doubt if it is ever profaned by the wind of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most, it tolerates one annual loon.

While previous work has shown that both intrinsic (e. g. size, shape) and extrinsic (e. g. temperature, hypoxia) factors can affect escape performance, the possibility that behavioural asymmetry may affect timing and locomotor performance in startled fish is largely unexplored. Numerous studies have found a relationship between brain lateralization and performance in several cognitive tasks.

Escape responses were elicited by mechanical stimulation and recorded using high-speed video (250 Hz).

A lateralization index was obtained by testing the turning preference of each subject in a detour test. While lateralization {{had no effect on}} escape directionality, strongly lateralized fish showed higher escape reactivity, i. e. shorter latencies, which were associated with higher turning rates and longer distances travelled.

The article is copyrighted by the 	American Fisheries Society and published by Taylor & Francis. It can be found at: [URL] estuarine habitats, such as salt marshes, seagrass beds, and oyster reefs, are recognized as critical nurseries for juvenile fish and crustaceans. Estuarine habitat usage by fish, including juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., was characterized by sampling with a modified tow net in Willapa Bay, Washington, where 20 % of the intertidal area is utilized for shellfish aquaculture and thus is difficult to sample with conventional gear. Our goal was to compare fish use of relatively undisturbed habitats (open mudflat, seagrass, and channel habitats) with the use of nearby oyster culture habitat. Although many species showed significant temporal and spatial trends within the estuary, only <b>Shiner</b> <b>Perch</b> Cymatogaster aggregata exhibited a significant association with habitat. Juveniles of three salmonid species exhibited few associations with the low intertidal habitats over which they were captured or in the prey types they consumed there. Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha, likely hatchery-released ocean-type fish, were the most common salmonid captured, and they utilized low intertidal areas throughout the summer as their mean size increased from 85 to 100 mm FL. Diets consumed by these larger juvenile Chinook Salmon were not associated with benthic habitat but instead consisted primarily of (1) insects from nearby marsh or terrestrial habitats and (2) planktonic prey, like decapod larvae and tunicate larvaceans. Juvenile Coho Salmon O. kisutch and Chum Salmon O. keta were captured earlier (April and May) and fed on a slightly different suite of prey taxa, which were also primarily pelagic rather than associated with the intertidal benthos. Our findings suggest that in this relatively shallow coastal estuary, the role of benthic habitat is not closely linked to its value as a source of food for large juvenile salmon out-migrants utilizing the low intertidal areas where aquaculture occurs...|$|E
