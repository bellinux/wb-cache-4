50|$|The {{property}} that secures the principal debt {{is referred to}} as the <b>security</b> <b>object.</b> The security parties are the debtor, known as the secured party, and the creditor, known as the security holder. Real security rights give the security holder the power to prevent the secured party from disposing of it, as well as a right of preference (ius praeferendi). Where the secured party is unwilling to repay the principal debt, or is insolvent, the security holder may, after the <b>security</b> <b>object</b> has been attached and sold in execution, claim the proceeds from that sale before any other creditor. Real security rights are limited real rights (or iura in re aliena, or rights in someone else’s property). They confer limited and specific entitlements on their holders and are enforceable against third parties.|$|E
50|$|The {{security}} agreement {{is not sufficient}} {{for the creation of}} a real security right. For the right to exist, the parties must comply with the publicity principle which holds that limited real rights are perfected by due publicity. Thus, the right must be publicised, although the manner will differ depending on whether the <b>security</b> <b>object</b> is movable (in which case it must be delivered to the security holder) or immovable (in which case it must be registered in the Deeds Registry). Once publicity has taken place, a real security right will vest in the security holder.|$|E

A Student of the Master Program in Notary, Faculty of Law, Sebelas Maret University Year 2015. This thesis {{research}} and writing are aimed at determining the resulting legal consequences in case of the transfer of fiduciary <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> done by the Debitor as the Fiduciary Provider without obtaining {{the approval of the}} Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient and the legal grounds why the Creditor shall receive legal protection in case of the transfer of fiduciary <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> done by the Debitor as the Fiduciary Provider without obtaining the approval of the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient as well as the legal protection given to the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient in case of the transfer of fiduciary <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> done by the Debitor as the Fiduciary Provider without obtaining the approval of the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient. The normative legal research method was employed in this legal research using secondary data consisting of primary, secondary and tertiary legal materials. The obtained data were analyzed using the normative juridical analysis. The research findings suggest that the transfer of fiduciary <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> done by the Debitor as the Fiduciary Provider without obtaining the approval of the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient will bring legal consequences, i. e. the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient may sue the Debitor as the Fiduciary Provider to completely repay its debts, and the legal protection given to the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient may be either in the form of preventive actions done previously or repressive actions done after the transfer of fiduciary <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> without obtaining the approval of the Creditor as the Fiduciary Recipient has been undertaken. The suggestions which the author can offer is that the Notary prior to the issuance of the Fiduciary Security Deed should provide legal counseling regarding matters which do not conform with the Law on Fiduciary Security to the parties intending to make a deed.

40|$|In {{sociology}} {{the understanding}} of the essence of operation security’s concept is inextricably linked with the concepts of «uncertainty», «risk», «challenge», «threat», «danger». The logical ordering of these concepts will allow characterizing the layered structure of the phenomenon of operating security, revealing the specific state of the object of operating security and evaluating the degree of influence of destabilizing factors. Uncertainty should be viewed as trends in the state of an object over time. Uncertainty as such is closely linked with the concept of risk. Reduction of the risk is necessary for minimization of the ignorance and uncertainty. The risk determines the probability of damage to the operating <b>security</b> <b>object,</b> which {{is in a state of}} dynamic equilibrium and is constantly changing. The challenge is a minimal risk, it is distinguished by the presence of the imaginary readiness to prevent the damage of the <b>security</b> <b>object.</b> The threat is characterized by realism, a focus on a high degree of readiness to prevent the damage of the <b>security</b> <b>object.</b> Danger is the combination of factors that can have a negative impact on nature, human society, technological systems. The risk is characterized by the hypothetical absence of the addressee, which is aimed at its impact. The differences between the concepts of «uncertainty», «risk», «challenge», «threat», «danger» have been revealed through the subjective intention and objective capabilities, which characterize objects’ and subjects’ security. The greatest risk is associated with the presence of threats, which are characterized by the presence of two components at one time. A high or medium level of risk is determined by the presence of at least one component. Whereas minimal risk is the absence of a component in a specific point in time, but with the possibility of one of them in future. Analysis of the concepts led to the conclusion that all these concepts are related to one another by the degree of damage to the individual, society and state. The use of these categories will allow ranking the range of possible threats to the security of life and will contribute to the development of adequate, appropriate technologies to combat it, to minimize their negative effects and, consequently, will improve the current system of ensuring safety of personality, society and state...|$|E

This study presents two interrelated findings: 1) state <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> "impress" and mediate citizen movements, and 2) a dual masculinity of offensive and defensive emerges around compassionate actions toward or distancing actions from migrants in need of aid or assistance. Drawing on Slavoj Žižek, this dissertation explores the border-as-parallax-object to reveal the ways that the border is inscribed beyond the material fence. In this way, this dissertation connects disparate literature within human geography concerning materiality and psychoanalytic theory. By psychoanalytically reading and coding research interviews, this dissertation also develops the concepts of the face-of-the-state and ambivalent citizenship to elucidate the impact of <b>security</b> <b>objects</b> on citizen practices. The findings build toward a new subfield in political geography: emotional border studies...|$|R
40|$|The use of body {{scanners}} for {{border security}} purposes allows for their conceptualization as <b>security</b> <b>objects.</b> But body scanners {{are not only}} material <b>objects</b> of <b>security</b> per se: they are also instruments enabling the transformation of human subjects into ‘immaterial security objects’, i. e. anonymized digital body images. This objectivation can be explained {{as a reaction to}} legal frameworks for the protection of privacy and personal data that grant a special status to any data relating to identifiable subjects. By breaking the formal links between digitized images and individuals to which they relate, the legal operation at the heart of privacy and personal data protection is radically obstructed. This paper critically discusses this practice, describing how the use of body scanners reduces subjects to mere bodies, virtualizes them and renders them non-identifiable to facilitate their treatment as <b>security</b> <b>objects.</b> Furthermore, it analyses how control over such practice becomes a legal and technological battlefield in which different programs and settings tend to hijack each other. The paper draws on, and questions, Latour’s insights, and reviews other theoretical attempts to conceptualize politics of security’s focus and action on individuals, mainly the (post) foucaldian and deleuzian approaches adopted by Agamben, Bigo, Haggerty and Ericson...|$|R
