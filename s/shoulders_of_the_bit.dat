25|$|<b>The</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> is a {{tapered screw}} thread. This screws {{into the wood}} as <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> is turned, and pulls <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> into <b>the</b> wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> into <b>the</b> workpiece, only the torque to turn <b>the</b> <b>bit.</b> This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to <b>the</b> pitch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central screw for each rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit.</b> To pull <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> from <b>the</b> hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> must be reversed.|$|R

30|$|Equation (3) can {{be derived}} from Eq. (2). From Eq.

(3) by n, then <b>the</b> size m <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> vector V can be obtained. In other words, as long as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> elements, false positive rate, and hash function is determined, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> vector V can be determined accordingly.|$|R

25|$|The body rotates {{about its}} long axis with every arm stroke so that <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{recovering}} arm {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pushing/pulling arm. This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the need to turn the head to breathe. As one <b>shoulder</b> is out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the arm at end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> push to leave the water.|$|R

5000|$|The curb chain applies {{pressure}} to the curb groove under a horse's chin when <b>the</b> curb rein <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> is used. When the curb rein is pulled, <b>the</b> shank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> rotates back towards <b>the</b> chest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse and the cheek (upper shank) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> rotates forward (since it is a lever arm). The curb chain {{is attached to the}} rings at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheek, so, as the cheek moves forward, the chain is pulled and tightened in the curb groove. Once it comes in contact with <b>the</b> curb groove <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse it acts as a fulcrum, causing <b>the</b> cannons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> mouthpiece to push down onto the horse's bars, thus amplifying <b>the</b> <b>bit's</b> pressure on <b>the</b> bars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse's mouth.|$|R
