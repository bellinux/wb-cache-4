5|$|In early 2005, the Grantham Canal Partnership {{appointed}} a full-time Grantham Canal restoration manager, Kevin Mann, for an initial 18-month trial period. He {{would be responsible}} for planning and managing funding schemes for the restoration, identifying development opportunities and the promotion and interpretation of the canal. The trial proved to be successful, as he was <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> the job in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E

5|$|In 1800 he was <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> {{engineering}} work for his former employers, who were beset with manufacturing problems and {{a shortage of}} engine-erectors. He was also running his own business engaged in general millwrighting and was still called upon by various Manchester engine owners who preferred to use his services for their machine erection and maintenance needs than those of Boulton and Watt. He had moved to New Street, Hanover Street and in December 1799 {{was appointed to the}} position of conductor of firemen and inspector of engines by the Manchester police commissioners, positions which effectively put him in charge of the fire brigade. One source– the one considered unreliable by Chaloner– has stated that he had held the position for 20 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{or twenty}} barges were still using {{the river in}} the 1880s, {{although}} the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were {{the owners of the}} railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the gasworks continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring pleasure craft by 1903, and the company was <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> so in the 1990s.|$|E

She was selected by movie viewers and online from more than 100 countries. She is the only Filipino actress to be shortlisted and won this award.|$|E
25|$|The French {{presence}} {{encouraged by}} Phaulkon, however, stirred the resentment and suspicions of the Thai nobles and Buddhist clergy. When word spread that Narai was dying, a general, Phetracha (reigned 1688–93) stage a coup d'état, the 1688 Siamese revolution, seized the throne, killed the designated heir, a Christian, and had Phaulkon {{put to death}} along {{with a number of}} missionaries and expelled the remaining foreigners. Some studies said that Ayutthaya began a period of alienation from western traders, while welcoming more Chinese merchants. But other recent studies argue that, due to wars and conflicts in Europe in the mid-eighteenth century, European merchants reduced their activities in the East. However, it was apparent that the Dutch East Indies Company or VOC was <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> business in Ayutthaya despite political difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays {{they are}} a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 {{professional}} chindon'ya (puro no chindon'ya) still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby chindon'ya (shirōto chindon'ya) performing at festivals. In recent years, however, {{there seems to be}} a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke nostalgia. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, chindon'ya hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, Chindon Tsūshinsha (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group Adachi in Fukuoka was formed five years ago and is <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> a good business, including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the unicycle, or displaying juggling, and balloon modelling performances.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Benn {{said in his}} diaries that [...] "Today I had {{the idea}} that I would resign my Privy Councillorship, my MA and all my honorary doctorates in order to strip myself of what the world had to offer".

[...] In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to [...] "Tony Benn". Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that [...] "Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie {{in the case of the}} tabloids, for years to come (some older Tories were <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> so three decades later)." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerning {{the anniversary}} edition, Yudell and Desalle thought it strange that nothing worth adding had {{happened}} in 25 years: the book remained a primary text, and Wilson's failure to develop it weakened the edition's impact. The early chapters still seemed a [...] "lucid and engaging" [...] introduction to population biology, {{but much of the}} rest seemed after 25 years to lack [...] "methodological breadth", given that it did not cover the new fields that had emerged; while barely mentioning the growing importance of phylogenetic systematics seemed [...] "curious". They pointed out that comparing human and [...] "animal" [...] social evolution [...] "is tantamount to making homology" [...] claims, but Wilson had said nothing about the need for a methodology to test behavioural homology. The reviewers were also troubled by Wilson's attitude to the debate, remaining [...] "contemptuous of his anti-sociobiological opposition" [...] and [...] "opprobrium towards Marxism" [...] (especially Gould and Lewontin). Yudell and Desalle noted the irony that Wilson despised Marxism but advocated an [...] "aggressive paradigm ... seeking to blaze an historical path towards the future" [...] (as Marxism did). They argued that by demonising his opponents in this way, Wilson created support for Sociobiology [...] "not necessarily sustainable by his data and methodologies." [...] He was <b>still</b> <b>doing</b> that 25 years on, stated the reviewers.|$|E
