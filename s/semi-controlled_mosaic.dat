40|$|The Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) {{acquired}} 128 high-resolution images (< 1 km/pixel) of Mimas {{during its}} tour through the Saturnian system since 2004. We combined new images from orbit 249 (Nov. 2016) and orbit 259 (Jan. 2017) with the high-resolution global <b>semi-controlled</b> <b>mosaic</b> of Mimas from 2012. This global mosaic is the baseline {{for the new}} high-resolution Mimas atlas that still consists of three tiles mapped at a scale of 1 : 1, 000, 000 [1].

40|$|The Cassini Imaging Science Sub-system (ISS) {{acquired}} many high-resolution im-ages of Iapetus {{during the}} new year flyby in 2004 / 2005 and during the targeted flyby in September 2007.

40|$|A {{combination}} of satellite interferometry and altimetry {{was used for}} generating and upgrading elevation and evolution models of the Northern Glacial Complex in Novaya Zemlya, measuring heights of ice divides and ice coasts, detecting, measuring, interpreting and mapping glacier changes in linear, areal and volumetric terms, and estimating glacier mass balance on a regional scale. Spatial asymmetry in the present glacier regime was deduced and explained. Six ERS- 1 / 2 overlapping SAR interferometric models were orthorectified and assembled into a <b>semi-controlled</b> seamless <b>mosaic</b> covering a land area of approx. 18, 000 km and containing 8 information layers.

40|$|The Amazon Radar Project (Projeto Radar na Amazônia - RADAM), {{was created}} in October, 1970, and its {{priority}} was {{to collect data on}} mineral resources, soils, vegetation, land use and cartography of the Amazon and adjacent areas of the Northeast Region. In July, 1975, the radar mapping was expanded to the remainder of the national territory, with the aim of an integrated mapping of the natural resources and had its name changed to RADAMBRASIL Project (Projeto RADAMBRASIL). As end products for the RADAM and RADAMBRASIL projects, 551 <b>semi-controlled</b> radar <b>mosaics</b> were made available to the public at a scale of 1 : 250. 000, which were edited on common and photographic paper, and organized according to the References of Map Indexing (Mapa Índice de Referência - MIR) from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). This project RADAM-D deals with the preservation of original SLAR image negatives and diafilms through data scanning and digitization. The project works with the inventary of available material, organization of radar strips, high resolution image scanning, composition of final images and its publication and application.
