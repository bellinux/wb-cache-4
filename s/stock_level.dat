40|$|Modular {{production}} and component commonality are two widely used {{strategies in the}} manufacturing industry to meet customers growing needs for customized products. Using these strategies, companies can enhance their performance to achieve optimal safety <b>stock</b> <b>levels.</b> Despite the importance of safety stocks in business competition, {{little attention has been}} paid to the way to reduce them without affecting the customer service levels. This paper develops a mathematical model to reduce safety <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> in organizations that employ modular production. To construct the model, we take advantage of the benefits of aggregate inventories, standardization of components, component commonality, and Group Technology philosophy in regard to <b>stock</b> <b>levels.</b> The model is tested through the simulation of three years of operation of two modular product systems. For each system, we calculated and compared the safety <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> for two cases: (1) under the only presence of component commonality and (2) under the presence of both component commonality and Group Technology philosophy. The results show a reduction in safety <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> when we linked the component commonality with the Group Technology philosophy. The paper presents a discussion of the implications of each case, features of the model, and suggestions for future research...|$|R

30|$|A {{nonlinear}} percentile regression {{was calculated}} for the remaining two variables, richness and density, to provide {{an estimate of the}} maximum production for different levels of richness and density. Maximum basal area production is observed at medium levels of richness (between 18 and 25 species per ha) and density (between 15 and 30  m 2 per ha). Highest gross basal area productivity levels were sustained in forest parcels/plots with the highest basal area <b>stocking</b> <b>levels</b> (those with the highest basal area accumulation over the preceding period; Seydack 2000). This is congruent with Assmann (1970) who stated that high absolute productivity of mixed stands is usually associated with high growing <b>stock</b> <b>levels.</b> When using basal density classes reflecting the situation {{at the beginning of the}} increment period (initial basal area) about 25  years ago, as in this study, particularly plots with initially high basal area <b>stocking</b> <b>levels</b> turned into phases of growing stock reduction caused by the mortality of larger trees. This would explain the lower maximum productivity <b>levels</b> at initial <b>stocking</b> <b>levels</b> above 30  m 2 per ha (Fig.  4). This is also in agreement with Midgley & Seydack (2006) who found that gross production and <b>stocking</b> <b>levels</b> per plot were positively correlated, whereas net production per plot was not correlated with density.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a mathematical model, called MOD-METRIC, for the control of a multi-item, multi-echelon, multi-indenture inventory-system for recoverable items, that is, items subject to repair when they fail. Discussion is limited to two-echelon multi-item systems in which an item may be demanded at any one of several locations called bases; in turn, these bases receive inventory from a central location called a depot. The objectives of the model are to describe the logistics relationship between an assembly and its subassemblies, and to compute spare <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> for both echelons for the assembly and subassemblies with explicit consideration of this logistics relationship. In particular, the model is used to determine the base and depot spare <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> which minimize total expected base backorders for the assembly subject to a system investment constraint. An example is given showing how the model can be used to calculate spare engine and engine module <b>stock</b> <b>levels.</b> MOD-METRIC has been implemented by the Air Force as the method for computing recoverable spare <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> for the F- 15 weapon system. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} several independent {{decision makers}} who stock expensive, low-demand spare parts for their high-tech machines. They can collaborate by full pooling of their inventories via free transshipments. We examine {{the stability of}} such pooling arrangements, and we {{address the issue of}} fairly distributing the collective holding and downtime costs over the participants, by applying concepts from cooperative game theory. We consider two settings: one where each party maintains a predetermined <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> and one where base <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> are optimized. For the setting with fixed <b>stocking</b> <b>levels,</b> we unravel the possibly conflicting effects of implementing a full pooling arrangement and study these effects separately to establish intuitive conditions for existence of a stable cost allocation. For the setting with optimized <b>stocking</b> <b>levels,</b> we provide a simple proportional rule that accomplishes a population monotonic allocation scheme if downtime costs are symmetric among participants. Although our whole analysis is motivated by spare parts applications, all results are also applicable to other pooled resource systems of which the steady-state behavior is equivalent to that of an Erlang loss system. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
