5000|$|With {{the drop}} in price came a drop in quality. Grey Gull had also {{introduced}} its Radiex Records label, and it too offered low-priced records. Boston department store Raymond's advertised Radiex records for 40 cents each, or two for 75 cents, in a Boston Globe ad (30 July 1922, p. 10) and in 1924, a Los Angeles department store was advertising Radiex records at 47 cents each, or three for $1.35 (Los Angeles Times, 21 September 1924, p. B26). Grey Gull also pressed client labels, such as Oriole for the McCrory chain, and later pressed by the Plaza Music Company, and Amco, Nadsco, and Globe, the latter possibly a continuation of an earlier label of that name.Grey Gull used primarily their own recordings during 1922 and 1923, although some were leased from other companies such as Plaza, Emerson Records, and the New York Recording Laboratories (Paramount Records et al.). Some sides emanate from unknown sources, including one ("Draggin' the Dragon") which is probably from Black Swan Records. From late 1923 until early 1926, Grey Gull seems to have used material recorded by Emerson, carrying control numbers in a 3xxx series instead of Emerson's own 4xxxx numbers. At the same time, Grey Gull began the practice of using [...] "B" [...] sides credited to [...] "house composers" [...] (who {{may or may not}} have actually existed). Further, Grey Gull was still using some [...] "out-sourced" [...] sides, which bore control numbers with a letter prefix indicating the <b>source</b> <b>company</b> (i.e. [...] "Y" [...] for NYRL).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Strategic Information Systems and the definitive published version is available at [URL] sourcing – the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing jobs to marginalized individuals – is an important emerging social innovation in the outsourcing industry. The impact sourcing model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus {{has led to the}} ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce research about how impact <b>sourcing</b> <b>companies</b> emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact <b>sourcing</b> <b>companies</b> and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of impact <b>sourcing</b> <b>companies,</b> the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It also emphasizes the role of ‘social’ encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which impact <b>sourcing</b> <b>companies</b> are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of {{open source software}} has gone from a model characterized by skilled software developers that developed open source software for their own interest and their own needs to a model that is more business friendly and more attractive for companies and organizations. One new business model for open source software is the professional open source software model or OSS 2. 0. The business model includes three roles: the open source project, the professional open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> and the user. This dissertation studies {{the relationship between these}} three roles and focuses on the {{development of}} the user role and how it may develop for a new user in a specific OSS ecosystem. The roles in the eco system that has been studied are taken by the open source project Alfresco, the professional open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> Redpill and a user from a large international company, without any previous experience of open source software or the business model of professional open source. The result of the study showed a well developed eco system between the open source project and the professional open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> but a need of more information about the user’s role in it. Open source software is still seen by the user as an unsafe and unsecure alternative to the proprietary software available and more information about the business model of professional open source software and how the user can interact and influence the eco system is still needed...|$|E
40|$|From a {{commercial}} open source company's point of view, open source is ideally {{the ultimate in}} “grass roots" marketing where people learn by word-of-mouth about the project and where they volunteer their time and effort, resulting in a vibrant community that benefits the company in many ways. This enables an open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> to enjoy major advantages that do not normally accrue to proprietary software companies e. g. {{they do not need}} to spend resources on traditional marketing activities and furthermore, having this community support can help ensure the longevity of the project and company. While this ideal may apply to a handful of open source projects, where they achieve a large critical mass of a community which lends itself to a natural form of monetization, {{for the vast majority of}} open source companies, it is not the case of “build it and they will come”. Instead, most open source companies need to understand who comprises their community so they can formulate a viable business model. In particular, they need to understand that communities are comprised of heterogeneous types of people, each of which have their own interests, motivation, needs and ability to be monetized. Open source companies need to identify the subgroups in their community, decide which ones to deliberately focus on, and choose the best way to leverage them. This is indispensable for determining how best to monetize the interest in their software, ideally without ruffling the community spirit that differentiates their software from proprietary offerings. And this is where “old fashioned” marketing can help. This means understanding your user base and what makes them tick, determining their needs, and formulating products and services that people are willing to pay for. The sooner an open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> understands that it needs to practice traditional marketing techniques such as segmentation and target marketing, the faster they will hit on the business model formula that enables their company to succeed. These techniques need to be adapted for the open source world, which requires the blending of traditional marketing techniques and community relations. The risk of treating one's community in an undifferentiated manner and applying a generic, formulaic business model is that a company will fail to generate significant revenue as well as alienate a community that could abandon them. As a community is perhaps the most distinctive asset of an open <b>source</b> <b>company,</b> losing its community is tantamount to death. If the community is not properly nurtured and leveraged, an open source company's potential will not be realized. This paper aims at describing, through case study research, a generic approach for how commercial open source companies can segment their community to aid in their formulation of a business model and marketing plans to reach their potential. It is for anyone who works in an open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> or project who is trying to determine a viable business model. The paper is structured in three parts: the first part outlines the research question and methodology. The second part proposes a way that an open <b>source</b> <b>company</b> can segment its community. The final part analyzes the Funambol experience, describing how the company segmented its community and created open source programs to nurture and leverage it. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{adopts a}} {{multilevel}} comparative approach to investigating {{the degree to}} which Japanese work systems are implemented and internalized in the UK business system. The focus is on the limits to accepting the continuous improvement schemes of Japanese multinational corporations. The article addresses national and local institutional factors and firm-level organizational factors affecting implementation and internalization. Using case studies of the adoption of Japanese work systems in two UK subsidiaries and in an Anglo-Japanese technical collaboration, it concludes that firms face a double barrier to the internalization of work systems in the form of, first, institutional embeddedness at national and local level, and second, embeddedness of tacit work systems at firm level.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{international}} technology transfer has been widely studied its management still encounters many difficulties. To fully understand {{the issues that are}} relevant to the process of transferring production technology, it is necessary to determine the important factors that influence this process. Learning curves are often used as a means of determining the time required to become familiar with a transferred technology. The cases discussed in this paper have all employed learning curves, which were established {{at the outset of the}} transfer process and which turned out to be incorrect. As a consequence the envisaged efficiencies were not obtained. This phenomenon is partly due to {{the fact that}} when technology is transferred to a relatively inexperienced 'destination company', the curve is established based on the circumstances of the 'source company'. The case study findings lead to the conclusion that to establish a realistic curve a more comprehensive method is required than simply basing anticipated performance on that achieved at the <b>source</b> <b>company...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} proposes {{revisions to}} the Spectrum Management Class 2 PSD template.
