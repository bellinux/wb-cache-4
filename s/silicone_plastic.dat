50|$|Other {{plastics}} may {{be successfully}} engraved, but orderly experimentation on a sample piece is recommended. Bakelite {{is said to}} be easily laser-engraved; some hard engineering plastics work well. Expanded plastics, foams and vinyls however are generally candidates for routing rather than laser engraving. Plastics with a chlorine content (such as vinyl, PVC) produce corrosive chlorine gas when lasered, which combines with Hydrogen in the air to produce vaporized hydrochloric acid which can damage a laser engraving system.

5000|$|People {{have been}} using natural organic {{polymers}} for centuries {{in the form of}} waxes and shellac which is classified as a thermoplastic polymer. A plant polymer named cellulose provided the tensile strength for natural fibers and ropes, and by the early 19th century natural rubber was in widespread use. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics. Plastics are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Polymers which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include carbon-based polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethane, and polycarbonates, and silicon-based <b>silicones.</b> <b>Plastics</b> are generally classified as [...] "commodity", [...] "specialty" [...] and [...] "engineering" [...] plastics.|$|R

40|$|Mobile phones, {{especially}} {{ones with}} internet capabilities, have recently entered {{our lives and}} become essential parts of our daily lives. As a result, they have become {{an important factor in}} the spread of pathogens, especially among teenagers. The aim of this research is to compare smartphone case materials and the glass back of the phone (Apple iPhone 4 S®), based on their contamination by bacteria after 1 week of usage. The research question of this investigation is: “How do the leather, <b>silicone</b> and <b>plastic</b> smartphone cases and the glass back of the phone without any case differ in terms of total bacteria count, measured using the viable cell counting method after a timespan of one week with daily usage of exactly one charge cycle?” The method used to investigate the research question is the viable cell counting method. The case is first disinfected and used everyday until the phone battery runs out. Culture is taken from the case by a cotton swab after 1 week and then is serial diluted up to the factor of 105. All dilution factors are incubated in LB agar plates for 24 hours at 37 ºC. Bacterial colonies are counted, and the dilution factor with colony count between 30 - 300 bacteria is used in data analysis. The mean results of viable bacteria number per ml of culture (in CFU/ml) are as follows: 8. 86 x 105 for leather, 7. 28 x 105 for silicone, 6. 32 x 105 for plastic and 4. 42 x 105 for glass. ANOVA tests proved that there is indeed significant difference between test groups (p = 0. 015114832). The conclusion is that all smartphones get contaminated by bacteria, but the glass has the lowest bacteria count showing that smartphone cases should be avoided for hygiene as much as possible.

5000|$|In 1972, a {{group of}} private volunteers {{decided it was time}} to {{establish}} a permanent marine biology learning center in the Clearwater area. They were incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization under the name Clearwater Marine Science Center (CMSC). In 1978, the city of Clearwater agreed to donate the aquarium's current facility, an abandoned water treatment plant, to CMSC. With its huge holding pools and bayside location, the building was a perfect fit for a marine facility's needs. In 1979, marine biologist Dennis Kellenberger was hired as CMSC's Executive Director. Kellenberger's main duties were teaching summer camp classes for children and spearheading a massive remodeling effort of the facility. Gradually, the cement and steel building was modified for aquarium purposes and in 1980 was granted a USDA Research Facility permit, allowing it to prepare two 65,000 gallon pools for the rehabilitation of dolphins and sea turtles. In 1981, the first exhibit room was opened to the public. The room featured old exhibits from the Sea-Orama, a mounted fish exhibit which was formerly on display at the Clearwater Marina. Over the next few years, thanks to individual and corporate donations and immense volunteer efforts, CMSC continued to grow. In 1984, CMSC rescued a stranded Atlantic bottlenose dolphin named [...] "Sunset Sam". This was the first dolphin in Florida to survive a beaching. However, due to chronic liver problems, Sunset could not be released into the wild and became CMSC's first resident dolphin. Sunset Sam was taught how to paint as a form of animal enrichment, and the sales of his paintings were used to fund the CMSC's operations and stranding program. In the 1990s, as renovations continued to provide more public area and education programs, the facility's name was changed to Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA) to reflect the increasing level of community interaction. In 2005, CMA's most famous permanent resident, a bottlenose dolphin named Winter, was rescued by CMA after being discovered entangled in the ropes of a crab trap. The ropes cut off the blood supply to the dolphin's tail, and resulted in its loss. To give Winter the ability to swim normally, CMA worked with a team of experts to create a prosthetic <b>silicone</b> and <b>plastic</b> tail for her. Winter's story brought international recognition to CMA and inspired two major films, Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2, each of which was partially filmed at the aquarium.|$|R

40|$|The organotin {{dibutyltin}} (DBT) {{is used as}} biocide and as stabilizer in {{the manufacture}} of <b>silicones,</b> polyvinyl chloride <b>plastics,</b> polyurethanes and polyester systems. Although the immuno- and neurotoxicity of DBT has been recognized, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear and the impact of DBT on microglia cells has not yet been established. We now used cultured mouse BV- 2 cells as a model of activated microglia to investigate the impact of DBT on oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. DBT, at subcytotoxic concentrations, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial ROS, and the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NADPH-dependent oxidase- 2 (NOX- 2). ATP levels were decreased by DBT, followed by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Moreover, DBT potentiated the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). Inhibition of NOX- 2 diminished both ROS production and induction of IL- 6 expression. The DBT-mediated increase in NF-κB activity and subsequent up regulation of IL- 6 was abolished by co-treatment with a NF-κB inhibitor. Treatment of cells with pharmacological inhibitors indicated a role for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), PI 3 K/Akt, protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase C (PLC) in the DBT-induced toxicity. Finally, the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM diminished oxidative stress and induction of IL- 6 expression, indicating the involvement of increased intracellular calcium in the enhanced microglia activity upon exposure to DBT. Together, the results suggest that a potentiation of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in microglia cells contribute to the toxicity of DBT in the CNS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} analysis of wall thickness of medical balloons and tubing of all sizes using a revolutionary white light interferometry system. Measurements can be taken at all critical dimensions of medical balloons including the balloon sleeves, main balloon body, the shoulder or cone. For main body and tube thickness, values are given for both top and bottom walls, outside and inside diameter. In operation, infrared light (1310 nm) is directed through a measurement probe via optical fiber to the material to be measured. At each juncture of refractive index, some portion of the transmitted light will be reflected back into the probe and some portion will continue through the material. In {{the case of a}} catheter, some IR energy will be reflected back to the device at the top and bottom surfaces of the tubing walls, generating measurements of not only the thickness of the walls themselves, but also the inside diameter distance between the walls. Accurate measurements can be obtained from almost any flat or formed material that allows passage of 1310 nm infrared light. Glass, <b>plastic,</b> <b>silicone,</b> or molded parts that are clear, translucent, dyed, and possibly opaque are good candidates for this measurement approach. This presentation will illustrate advances in measurement of thinner materials than previously reported and discuss measurement of various medical and industrial components such as silicone implants, medical adhesives, capillary flow cells, and medical liquid (blood, saline, etc.) handling bags that can benefit from this new technology.

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to discuss the {{phenomenon}} of the ethos of affective sexual experience of transvestites at the interface with modeling one’s body. A changing reality, the body in contemporary society is a kind of merchandise - a product entitled to minor repairs and predetermined duration. It was also observed the construction of identities and subjectivities based on artifacts established under or on the skin: piercings, tattoos, scarification, silicone, hormones, body building, crossdressing – which have turned the body into a means of affirmation of the self. The use of <b>silicone,</b> hormones and <b>plastic</b> surgery to achieve the ideal body modeling by transvestites has become commonplace among this population leading to an issue of public health due to the injuries, deformities and even death that often result from such practices. The phenomenological method was chosen to analyze, understand and interpret the speeches of three transvestites belonging to social classes C and D; aged between 20 and 30 years on the meanings they attribute to the process of modeling their body and the affective sexual practices arising from such transformation. The results obtained from the analysis of the three interviews led to three categories: "The dream of beauty and a perfect body"; "Pain and the recovery process as a rite of passage"; and "Change in behavior / personality resulting from the applications". In their search of the perfect body they dare and cross the ethical boundaries of aesthetics and health. They subvert the sense of self-care to meet the market logic. The transvestites mutilate and shape their bodies; they shape a sui generis body that seeks balance between the feminine and the masculine and also claims the existence of a particular ethos...|$|R
40|$|The glaucomas are {{potentially}} treatable diseases, either by medication or surgery. Ab externo Er:YAG-laser sclerostomy, {{as an alternative}} surgical glaucoma therapy, produces a drainage canal from the anterior chamber into subconjunctival space. The procedure by itself did not achieve the desired success, as postoperative scarring of episcleral tissue often resulted in occlusion of the canal. The implant concept introduced in this study modifies the Er:YAG-lasersclerostomy procedure. The aim is to obtain an intact corneoscleral canal during the postoperative inflammatory period by implanting a non-draining stent into the canal as a placeholder. This should make for more favourable conditions for long-term functionality of the drainage canal after explantation of the stent. To avoid the necessary explantation procedure of the <b>silicone</b> stent, biodegradable <b>plastics</b> were tested for applicability as a possible stent-material, as {{the second part of}} this study. The silicone implant consists of a 300 µm pim which bottoms out into a small flag. After conduction of the laser-sclerostomy the stent was implanted into four chinchilla-rabbits. Six weeks after implantation two animals were enucleated with stent in situ to evaluate the sclerostomy-morphology around the stent as well as subconjunctival reactions to the stent site. Two further animals underwent stent-explantation at the same time, enucleation was conducted 14 weeks after stent explantation. Bulbi were histologically processed. Analysis of the biodegradable glycolid-copolymers and of multiblockcopolymer oligo(p-dioxanon) diol, oligo(alkylen-glykoladipat) diol and diisocyanat (PDA) included processing, degradation in phosphate buffer, degradation in L 929 -conjunctival fibroblast culture, and biocompatibility testing for multiblockcopolymer PDA, consisting of EB/FDA vital staining, BrDU-, WST- 1 -elisa and cellmorphologic analysis of L 929 -fibroblasts. Surgical practicability of stent implantation was documented as well as high acceptance of subconjunctival tissue for the silicone stent. Histology showed fibrocellular connective tissue in the canal with the stent luxated from the canal. A pronounced fibrocellular sheathing was seen around the stent flag. The implant could not be found in one eye. Only minor inflammation was persistent 14 weeks after explantation, with fibrocellular occlusion of the canal. Iris incarceration occured in one eye after stent explantation without further complications. In the course of material analysis the glycolid-polymers turned out to be unemployable for stent construction due to missing elasticity and acidic degradation. Multiblockcopolymer PDA showed comparable results as biofilm-reference for all cytotoxicity testings. The results of degradation analysis were linear degradation without noticeable loss of elasticity and a less pronounced pH-value decrease. Modification of the lasersclerostomy-procedure by stent implantation could serve as a method to ameliorate postoperative conditions for a functioning drainage canal. The surgical procedure is easy to do and requires little complexity. Implantation of the non-degradable implant would be possible, following a concise explantation procedure in local anesthesia. Application and evaluation of the degradable PDA-stent in an animal model would be the next step, thus avoiding the traumatising explantation of the permanent silicone stent. The main aim is to avoid a remaining immunogenic foreign body in subconjunctival space. The labelled aspects should be subjects of further research...|$|R
