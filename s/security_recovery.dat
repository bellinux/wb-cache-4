40|$|This book {{examines}} an area {{of personal}} injuries law that has been largely neglected by other writers, but which is of vital importance in practical terms when establishing quantum of damages for personal injuries. It provides detailed coverage of the law as it works in practice, but also important insights into the underlying legal principles and policy. There is comprehensive analysis of the rules relating to the deduction of social security benefits, including the Social <b>Security</b> (<b>Recovery</b> of Benefits) Act 1997 and the new rules concerning recovery of NHS costs from insurers. The book also explains in detail how the deduction of private insurance payments, gifts and charitable payments, benefits relating to employment, benefits related {{to the cost of}} care, and benefits accruing to dependants all impact upon the awards made by the Courts...|$|E
40|$|Protection of the {{national}} infrastructure is {{a high priority for}} cybersecurity of the homeland. Critical infrastructure such as {{the national}} power grid, commercial financial networks, and communications networks have been successfully invaded and re-invaded from foreign and domestic attackers. The ability to re-establish authentication and confidentiality of the network participants via secure channels that have not been compromised would be an important countermeasure to compromise of our critical network infrastructure. This paper describes a concept of operations by which the NASA Tracking and Data Relay (TDRS) constellation of spacecraft in conjunction with the White Sands Complex (WSC) Ground Station host a <b>security</b> <b>recovery</b> system for re-establishing secure network communications {{in the event of a}} national or regional cyberattack. Users would perform security and network restoral functions via a Broadcast Satellite Service (BSS) from the TDRS constellation. The BSS enrollment only requires that each network location have a receive antenna and satellite receiver. This would be no more complex than setting up a DIRECTTV-like receiver at each network location with separate network connectivity. A GEO BSS would allow a mass re-enrollment of network nodes (up to nationwide) simultaneously depending upon downlink characteristics. This paper details the spectrum requirements, link budget, notional assets and communications requirements for the scheme. It describes the architecture of such a system and the manner in which it leverages off of the existing secure infrastructure which is already in place and managed by the NASAGSFC Space Network Project...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a Web-based architecture and user interface for archiving and manipulating results of numerical simulations being generated by the UK Turbulence Consortium on the United Kingdom's new national scientific supercomputing resource. These simulations produce large datasets, requiring Web-based mechanisms for storage, searching and retrieval of simulation results {{in the hundreds of}} gigabytes range. We demonstrate that the new DATALINK type, defined in the draft SQL Management of External Data Standard, which facilitates database management of distributed external data, can help to over-come problems associated with limited bandwidth. We show that a database can meet the apparently divergent requirements of storing both the relatively small simulation result metadata, and the large result files, in a unified way, whilst maintaining database <b>security,</b> <b>recovery</b> and integrity. By managing data in this distributed way, the system allows post-processing of archived simulation re-sults to be performed directly without the cost of having to rematerialise to files. This distribution also reduces access bottlenecks and processor loading. We also show that separating the user interface specification from the user interface processing can provide a number of advantages. We provide a tool to generate automatically a default user interface specification, {{in the form of an}} XML document, for a given database. The XML document can be customised to change the appearance of the interface. Our architecture can archive not only data in a distributed fashion, but also applications. These applications are loosely coupled to the datasets (in a many-to-many relationship) via XML de-fined interfaces. They provide reusable server-side post-processing operations such as data reduction and visualisation...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{statutes}} in the UK which {{have established a}} system for recovering from damages in tort certain state benefits obtained {{by those who have}} suffered personal injury. These state benefits may take the form of social security monies or health care services. These are "collateral benefits" to the award of damages. The focus is upon the Social <b>Security</b> (<b>Recovery</b> of Benefits) Acts 1989 and 1997 which radically revised the previous haphazard system whereby some, but not all, benefits were set off by defendants {{to reduce the amount of}} damages that they had to pay, and yet the state failed to recover any of the monies it had paid claimants. Now we have a Government agency which is able to recover these benefits and return them to the public purse. Defendants are no longer subsidised by the state, and claimants are less likely to be over-compensated by receiving monies from both public and private sources. However, the state has acquired a direct interest in all personal injury claims. Tort law has thus been entrenched in our compensation system in spite of the many criticisms that could be made of it by supporters of a more inclusive welfare state. The article traces the origin of these arguments about what should be the relationship between the two systems of compensation. It looks at the debates concerning the future of the law of tort following the considerable increase in the scope of welfare provision after 1945. The potential overlap could have led to the entire replacement of tort law for personal injury. The post-war legislature and later the judiciary had to consider what role tort should play following the increase in state benefits. Compromises were reached in the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 which allowed tort not only to continue, but later to flourish. The recovery of benefits statutes are placed here in their wider policy context. In particular, the political climate which led to their enactment is considered. The often uneasy relationship between tort law and the welfare state is discussed. The question posed in the title to this article in effect asks whether the reforms merely made provision for the two systems of compensation to operate more effectively together, or whether they enabled tort to become entrenched at the expense of a welfarist approach which would have laid more emphasis upon community responsibility for injury rather than the wrongdoing of individuals...|$|E
