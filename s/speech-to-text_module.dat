40|$|Now-a-days to lead {{our life}} {{we had to}} run with our fast materialistic world. To express our thoughts, we {{communicate}} with different people in different languages and in different ways. But, {{it is difficult for}} the dumb, blind and people who are affected by paralysis to convey what they think. The dumb people and the paralysis affected people, feel extremely difficult to express their ideas. The blind people face difficulties in writing their exams. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop a platform for those people who are physically challengeable. An Embedded device shall address the above said problems. (1) The paralysis affected people by wearing a glove made up of flex sensors can convey their ideas; (2) By pressing the keypad (buttons) in the device, dumb people can express their basic needs with the text-to-speech IC. (3) When the blind people speak, <b>speech-to-text</b> <b>module</b> converts it and viewed in a display. All of these techniques work in a single embedded device by the control of an ARM 7 Processor. By using this device, PWD (People With Disabilities) can easily communicate their basic needs with the society and they can lead their life independently in a peaceful way...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{methodology}} {{employed in the}} creation of an aligned speech-to-text Romanian Corpus. The corpus uses recordings from the AMPER-ROM and AMPRom projects as well as ad-hoc recordings of continuous speech. The protocol for speech recording and labelling, as well as the manual annotation procedure, are described. The corpus is intended to be used for training a speech segmentation module and an automatic <b>speech-to-text</b> aligner <b>module...</b>|$|R
