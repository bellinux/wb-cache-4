40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of joint implantation of straight silicon tube and <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube in treatment of post-operative patients with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis. METHODS:Forty-nine patients(50 eyes) with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis who had treated with straight silicon tube or <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube were implanted with straight silicon tube combined with <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube. Patients were followed up for 1 a {{to observe the}} curative effect. RESULTS:The operation was invalid in 5 cases(5 eyes) as their rigation of lacrimal passage was failure. The remaining 45 eyes in 44 cases were cured with no epiphora. The cure rate was 90 % at 1 a after the tubes were extracted. CONCLUSION:The joint implantation of straight silicon tube and <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube is an effective and safe technique in treatment of post-operative patients with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis,and worthy of widely use in patients with chronic dacryadeitis {{who have never been}} treated with surgeries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{roughness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters in grinding, which directly affects the quality of the processed surface and has quite a lot of effect on the shape and position accuracy, installation accuracy of the workpiece. In the grinding process, the surface roughness is formatted from the abrasive which effects on the surface of <b>spherical</b> <b>head,</b> and is the result of mutual interference between abrasive and <b>spherical</b> <b>head.</b> Many factors affect the surface roughness, such as the shape and size of contact roller, abrasive morphology, grinding method, the stiffness of machine tool and workpiece, abrasive wear and vibration in the machining process. All of these have an impact grinding surface roughness. In this paper, analyzed the belt speed, workpiece speed, abrasive size, workpiece diameter, sand-planting density on the surface roughness of <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> in experimental. And the effect trend of factors on surface roughness of workpiece was analyzed. Some valuable information was provided for selecting suitable parameter in <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> grinding. Introductions Surface roughness is a micro-geometry features which formed by Peaks and valleys and the smaller spacing on the machining surface. It is a micro geometry error.

The location errors are obtained utilizing a local linearization, which is validated with a Monte Carlo simulation.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a three-shell <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> model versus the {{performance of}} a realistic head model is investigated when solving the inverse problem with a single dipole, in the presence of noise. This is evaluated by calculating the average dipole location error for 1000 noisy scalp potential sets, originating from the same test dipole and having the same noise level. The average location errors are obtained utilizing a local linearization, which is validated with a Monte-Carlo simulation. When the difference between the average location error utilizing a spherical and a realistic head model, represented by DeltaR, is large for a large number of test dipoles, then it is worth using the more computationally demanding realistic head model. However, if DeltaR is small for a large number of test dipoles, then it does not matter which model is used. For 27 electrodes, an electroencephalogram (EEG) epoch of one time sample and spatially white Gaussian noise, we found that the importance of the realistic head model over the <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> model reduces by increasing the noise level. We further found that increasing the number of scalp electrodes from 27 to 44 has limited impact on the importance of the realistic head model over the <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> model in EEG dipole source analysis. By increasing the number of time samples to six, the performance of the realistic head model in the inverse calculation gains importance compared with the three-shell <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> model. Finally, we used spatially and temporally correlated background EEG instead of Gaussian noise. The advantage of the realistic head model over the <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> model is reduced when applying correlated noise compared to Gaussian noise. (C) 2002 IPEM.
