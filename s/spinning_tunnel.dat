50|$|From this result, it is {{apparent}} that, given that E/D is much smaller than 1 by construction, the quantum <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling</b> splitting becomes suppressed {{in the limit of}} large spin S, i.e., as we move from the atomic scale towards the macroscopic world. Interestingly, the magnitude of the quantum <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling</b> splitting can be modulated by application of a magnetic field along the transverse hard axis direction (in the case of Hamiltonian 1, with D<0 and E>0, the x axis). The modulation of the quantum <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling</b> splitting results in oscillations of its magnitude, including specific values of the transverse field at which the splitting vanishes. This accidental degeneracies are known as diabolic points.|$|R
40|$|An {{electro-optical}} spin {{measurement system}} for a spin model in a <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> includes a radio controlled receiver/transmitter, targets located on the spin model, optical receivers mounted {{around the perimeter of}} the <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the base of the <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> for receiving data from the targets, and a control {{system for a}}ccumulating data from the radio controlled receiver and receivers. Six targets are employed. The spin model includes a fuselage, wings, nose, and tail. Two targets are located under the fuselage of the spin model at the nose tip and tail. Two targets are located on the side of the fuselage at the nose tip and tail, and a target is located under each wing tip. The targets under the fuselage at the nose tip and tail measure spin rate of the spin model, targets on the side of the fuselage at the nose tip and tail measure angle of attack of the spin model, and the targets under the wing tips measure roll angle of the spin model. Optical receivers are mounted at 90 degree increments around the periphery of the <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> to determine angle of attack and roll angle measurements of the spin model. Optical receivers are also mounted at the base of the <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> to define quadrant and position of the spin model and to determine the spin rate of the spin model...|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, a 'Fairy Land' {{section was}} {{developed}} {{adjacent to the}} Fairy Castle. The following year, the pirate ship play area was redesigned as 'Pirate Cove', with two new pirate ships, and surrounded by other smaller themed buildings, a pirate shooting gallery, and 'The Sailors Return', in which visitors walk through a <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> of lights designed to disorientate.|$|E
50|$|Another type of <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> is the {{stationary}} LED tunnel. Instead of {{the tunnel}} spinning around the bridge, LEDs that are imbedded in {{the walls of the}} tube are programmed to turn on and off in sequence, presenting the illusion of movement. While the method of visual presentation is different—light is transmitted directly to the eyes rather than reflected off a liner—the effect is the same.|$|E
50|$|Spinning tunnels—which {{are also}} known as vortex tunnels or {{rotating}} tunnels—are devices used at haunted attractions and amusement parks. When people walk {{through the center of}} a <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> they can experience vertigo and a loss of equilibrium as their brains receive conflicting signals from their bodies and senses. A prominent manufacturer of the attraction, GEP Productions, registered the trademark Vortex Tunnel®, and has subsequently defended the trademark vigorously.|$|E
40|$|A semiempirical {{method is}} {{presented}} for {{the estimation of}} aerodynamic forces and moments on a steadily rotating airplane model in a <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The approach {{is based on the}} application of strip theory to determine a part of the aerodynamic coefficient (including rotational velocity) and then estimation of increments to these coefficients because of rotational flow over the stalled airplane. The theory is applied to a light, single-engine, general aviation airplane and the results are compared with the corresponding <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> rotary balance test data...|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s NASA {{used its}} <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> at the Langley Research Center to {{investigate}} the spinning characteristics of single-engine general aviation airplane designs. A 1/11-scale model was used with nine different tail designs.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling</b> of spin- 1 Bose-Einstein condensates in a linearly sweeping magnetic {{field with a}} mean-field treatment. We focus on the two typical alkali Bose atoms $^{ 87 }Rb$ and $^{ 23 }Na$ condensates and study their tunnelling dynamics according to different sweeping rates of external magnetic fields. In the adiabatic (i. e., slowly sweeping) and sudden (i. e., fast sweeping) limits, no tunnelling is observed. For the case of moderate sweeping rates, the tunnelling dynamics {{is found to be}} very sensitive on the sweeping rates with showing a chaotic-like tunnelling regime. With magnifying the regime, however, we find interestedly that the plottings become resolvable under a resolution of $ 10 ^{- 4 }$ G/s where the tunnelling probability with respect to the sweeping rate shows a regular periodic-like pattern. Moreover, a conserved quantity standing for the magnetization in experiments is found can dramatically affect the above picture of the <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling.</b> Theoretically we have given a reasonable interpretation to the above findings and hope our studies would bring more attention to <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling</b> experimentally.

50|$|The {{base of the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{holds the}} guide wheels that the tunnel rings rest and roll on. The drive motor for the tunnel that has the drive motor driving the guide wheels will also be {{installed}} on this framework. The tunnels that have a drive motor above the tunnel will have a vertical framework that {{is attached to the}} base. The guide wheels can be bicycle rims or pulleys which also hold the tunnel in place as it spins. Tunnels that use the hard rubber wheels will have an extra set of horizontal wheels at both ends, attached to the bridge, to keep the tunnel from wandering off the guide wheels. The bridge is also mounted to the base.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel is {{constructed}} {{of a series}} of two to eight rings, usually eight to ten feet in diameter to allow headroom for the people using the tunnel. The vertical rings are connected to horizontal braces forming a cylinder similar in shape to a large coffee can with the ends removed. The interior of the <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> is lined with fabric or plastic sheeting with secured to the rings and braces in whatever manner is expedient to the builder or designer of the tunnel. Velcro straps, duct tape, and staples are used in different constructions. The liner can be printed or decorated with images or abstract designs that draw the eye and further the optical illusion fostered by the rotating liner. The use of flourescent inks or paint and black lighting can add to the enjoyment of the attraction by creating a spooky, darkly lit environment. Music or other sound effects help to mask the sound of the rotating tunnel and the operation of the drive motor.|$|E
50|$|Spinning tunnels {{depend upon}} {{creating}} sensory confusion between the kinesthetic system, the vestibular {{system and the}} visual system. The body's sense of the motion and {{the position of the}} limbs is provided by sensors in the joints, the semicircular canals within the inner ears provide sensory data for the head's position relative to the ground, and the eyes provide input concerning where the body is in relationship to its external environment. The <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> creates an optical illusion affecting the visual system that is in conflict with the other two sensory systems. Because vision is the most developed of the human senses, the visual system overrides the other sensory systems, causing the brain to believe that the bridge is moving. This belief interfers with the sense of balance and induces dizzyiness and vertigo. Aristotle noted the effect while observing a waterfall, noticing that over time the water seemed to stop moving and the rocks protruding through the waterfall seemed to be moving upward. This phenomenon {{has come to be known}} as the waterfall illusion.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> and at a catapult launch facility of a 1 / 60 -scale dynamic model to determine the spin-entry characteristics of a large supersonic bomber. Catapult tests indicated that spin-entry motions were obtainable for a center-of-gravity location of 0. 21 mean aerodynamic chord but were not obtainable at a center-of-gravity location of 0. 25 mean aerodynamic chord. Deflected ailerons were effective in promoting or preventing the spin- entry motion and this effect was qualitatively {{the same as it}} was for the fully developed spin. Varying the configuration had little significant effect on the spin-entry characteristics. Brief tests conducted with the model in the Langley <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> indicated that fully developed spins were obtainable at the forward center-of-gravity location and that spins were highly unlikely at the rearward center-of-location...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Langley Research Center has {{initiated}} a broad general aviation stall/spin research program. A rotary balance system {{was developed to}} support this effort. Located in the Langley <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel,</b> this system {{makes it possible to}} identify an airplane's aerodynamic characteristics in a rotational flow environment, and thereby permits prediction of spins. This paper presents {{a brief description of the}} experimental set-up, testing technique, five model programs conducted to date, and an overview of the rotary balance results and their correlation with <b>spin</b> <b>tunnel</b> free-spinning model results. It is shown, for example, that there is a large, nonlinear dependency of the aerodynamic moments on rotational rate and that these moments are pronouncedly configuration-dependent. Fuselage shape, horizontal tail and, in some instances, wing location are shown to appreciably influence the yawing moment characteristics above an angle of attack of 45 deg...|$|R
50|$|The car {{goes through}} a single set of doors and enters a crooked hallway. Bill Tracy's rides often {{included}} a crooked hallway or two. As the vessel moves forward into the room, it is tilted to an angle, giving the feeling of falling. This is achieved by placing a raised tire-track {{on one side of}} the car's path, while leaving the other side flat. The guide-rail hinge allows for the body of the vessel to tip to the side while safely maneuvering the uneven grade. This room also takes the vessel up a small incline, which is crucial in allowing the next gag the proper floor space. After coming through a set of doors at the end of the hallway, the vessel enters a <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel.</b> At the end of the tunnel is a full-scale replica of a coffin-shaped vessel, just like the one the riders are in. This replica spins 360 degrees in sync with the tunnel; along with another crooked grade it gives the illusion of being pulled into a swirling vortex. The cars are actually heading through an elevated bridge-like tunnel, with the barrel surrounding them. The barrel itself was installed by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} of spinning tunnels {{depends upon the}} circumstances of the location. It has been recommended that the tunnel be installed in a dark location. The illusion of a <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> works best if there are no external points of reference. The inside of a permanent structure has the benefit of protection from the elements as well as darkness. A tarp-covered enclosure is also a good method for covering the tunnel. Both of these methods also offer protection to patrons from the moving parts, such as the drive motor and the cylinder itself. Another consideration is the entrance and exit. One method of installation is to put the tunnel in a pit equal to the height of the bridge so that patrons can step directly {{into and out of the}} tunnel. This is an especially safe method for the exit as the patrons are usually disoriented by the attraction. If the tunnel is installed on a level surface, a ramp should be used, again to provide safety for the user. Steps can be used if space is limited, but lighting should be provided to illuminate the steps for the patrons' safety. The ends of the tunnel need to be enclosed to prevent light entering and to help control the flow of patrons through the attraction. This can be something as simple as plastic or canvas sheets slit like the entrance to a tent or like a coldroom, or is can consist of walls with doors decorated to look like the entrance to a funhouse or a cave.|$|E

The {{results of the investigation}} indicated that modifications that aid not appreciably alter the basic design aid not appreciably improve the spin and recovery characteristics. In this instance it appears that the sweptforward wing is the cause of unsatisfactory spin and recovery characteristics...|$|E

The magnetization dynamics of sufficiently small nanomagnets at low temperatures, typically single-molecule magnets, presents quantum phenomena, such as macroscopic <b>spin</b> <b>tunnelling.</b> At larger temperatures, the magnetization undergoes random thermal fluctuations (superparamagnetism) which present a limit {{for the use of}} nanomagnets for permanent information storage.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests {{was made in the}} N. A. C. A. free <b>{{spinning}}</b> <b>tunnel</b> to find the effect upon spinning characteristics of systematic changes in tail arrangement. The tests were made with a 1 / 16 -scale made of a low-wing monoplane of modern design. The changes consisted of: (1) variation of the fuselage length; (2) variation of the fore-and-aft location of the vertical surfaces; and (3) variation of the vertical location of the horizontal surfaces. The spinning characteristics of the model, including the number of turns required for recovery, were found to vary systematically and regularly with systematic changes in the tail arrangement. The following changes in tail arrangement had harmful effects upon the recovery characteristics (which originally were excellent) : (1) shortening the fuselage; (2) placing the vertical surfaces directly above the horizontal surfaces as compared with locations either fore or aft of this position; (3) moving the horizontal surfaces downward from their original location {{at the top of the}} fuselage...|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of tests of a 1 / 10 -scale model of the XN 2 Y- 1 airplane tested in the NACA 5 -foot vertical wind tunnel in which the six components of forces and moments were measured. The model was tested in 17 attitudes in which the full-scale airplane had been observed to spin, {{in order to determine the}} effects of scale, tunnel, and interference. In addition, a series of tests was made to cover the range of angles of attack, angles of sideslip, rates of rotation, and control setting likely to be encountered by a spinning airplane. The data were used to estimate the probable attitudes in steady spins of an airplane in flight and of a model in the free-spinning tunnel. The estimated attitudes of steady spin were compared with attitudes measured in flight and in the <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The results indicate that corrections for certain scale and tunnel effects are necessary to estimate full-scale spinning attitudes from model results...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free <b>spinning</b> <b>tunnel</b> to study the relative behavior in descent {{of a number of}} homogeneous balsa bodies of revolution simulating anti-personnel bombs with a small cylindrical exploding device suspended approximately 10 feet below the bomb. The bodies of revolution included hemispherical, near-hemispherical, and near-paraboloid shapes. The ordinates of one near-paraboloid shape were specified by the Office of the Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army. The behavior of the various bodies without the cylinder was also investigated. The results of the investigation indicated that several of the bodies descended vertically with their longitudinal axis, suspension line, and small cylinder in a vertical attitude,. However, the body, the ordinates of which had been specified by the Office of the Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army, oscillated considerably from a vertical attitude while descending and therefore appeared unsuitable for its intended use. The behavior of this body became satisfactory when its center of gravity was moved well forward from its original position. In general, the results indicated that the descent characteristics of the bodies of revolution become more favorable as their shapes approached that of a hemisphere...|$|E
