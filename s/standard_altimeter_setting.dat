50|$|Data from a {{barometric}} pressure sensor {{are used to}} calculate QNH <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting.</b> Pilots rely on this value to determine their altitude. To ensure safe separation from terrain and other obstructions, high degree of accuracy and reliability is required from a pressure sensor.|$|R
5000|$|At 00:51, winds at Bradley were {{measured}} as 170° at 25 kn, gusting to 40 kn, with an <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> of [...] and falling rapidly.

50|$|The {{investigation}} cited several {{causes for}} this accident. It faulted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for designing {{the approach to}} runway 15 without taking the ridgeline into consideration. The new approach, which factors in the terrain, has increased the MDA to 1320 ft. However it cited pilot error as the primary cause due to an incorrect <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> combined with the crew's failure to level off at the MDA. The report also noted since pressure was falling rapidly, the crew should have requested a more recent <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> from the tower—the ATIS broadcast is normally updated hourly or whenever weather conditions change, and the first officer had noted that the ATIS recording was over 90 minutes old. While turbulence, heavy rain and wind shear affected the aircraft, the crew continued {{to allow it to}} descend while searching for the airport.|$|R
50|$|QFE is the {{barometric}} <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> {{that causes}} an altimeter to read zero when at the reference datum {{of a particular}} airfield (in practice, the reference datum is either an airfield center or a runway threshold). In ISA temperature conditions the altimeter will read height above the airfield/runway threshold {{in the vicinity of}} the airfield.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{aviation}} {{weather stations}} use two (required for an AWOS) or three independent pressure transducers. The transducers {{may or may}} not share their associated tubing and external ports (designed to minimize effect of wind/wind gusts). Should the reported pressures differ by more than a preset maximum, the pressure values are discarded and <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> is not reported or is reported as [...] "missing." ...|$|R
50|$|In a mode C reply, the {{altitude}} is encoded by a Gillham interface, Gillham Code, which uses gray code. The Gillham interface {{is capable of}} representing {{a wide range of}} altitudes, in 100 ft increments. The altitude transmitted is pressure altitude, and corrected for <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> at the ATC facility. If no encoder is attached, the transponder may optionally transmit only framing pulses (most modern transponders do).|$|R
5000|$|Class A {{airspace}} {{extends from}} 18000 ft {{mean sea level}} MSL to FL600 (approximately 60000 ft MSL) throughout the continental United States and Alaska. Unlike the altitude measurements used in other airspace classes, the FLnnn flight levels used in class A airspace are pressure altitudes referenced to a standardized <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> of 29.92" [...] Hg and thus the true altitudes depend on local atmospheric pressure variations.|$|R
5000|$|Pressure {{altitude}} is {{the elevation}} above a standard datum air-pressure plane (typically, 1013.25 millibars or 29.92" [...] Hg). Pressure altitude {{is used to}} indicate [...] "flight level" [...] which is the standard for altitude reporting in the U.S. in Class A airspace (above roughly 18,000 feet). Pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> is 29.92" [...] Hg or 1013.25 millibars.|$|R
2500|$|Wind {{at speeds}} of 20 knots were present at an {{altitude}} of approximately 500 feet. [...] At 02:12, when the observer of the U. S. Weather Bureau was notified, the weather conditions as follows were recorded: [...] "Indefinite 200-foot variable ceiling; visibility 3/4 mile variable, fog; temperature 45°; dewpoint 45°, wind south-southeast 8 knots; <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> 29.84; ceiling 100 feet variable to 300 feet, visibility 1/2 mile variable to one mile." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the lowest}} {{forecast}} value of QNH for an <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> region {{is called the}} [...] "Regional Pressure Setting" [...] and {{may be used to}} ensure safe terrain separation when cruising at lower altitudes.

5000|$|The term [...] "error" [...] {{is defined}} as any action or {{inaction}} leading to deviation from team or organizational intentions. Error stems from physiological and psychological human limitations such as illness, medication, stress, alcohol/drug abuse, fatigue, emotion etc. Error is inevitable in humans and is primarily related to operational and behavioural mishaps. Errors can vary from incorrect <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> and deviations from flight course to more severe errors such as exceeding maximum structural speeds or forgetting to put down landing or takeoff flaps.|$|R
5000|$|Pilots can {{estimate}} height {{above sea}} level with an <b>altimeter</b> <b>set</b> to a defined barometric pressure. Generally, the pressure used to <b>set</b> the <b>altimeter</b> is the barometric pressure that would exist at MSL in the region being flown over. This pressure {{is referred to as}} either QNH or [...] "altimeter" [...] and is transmitted to the pilot by radio from air traffic control (ATC) or an automatic terminal information service (ATIS). Since the terrain elevation is also referenced to MSL, the pilot can estimate height above ground by subtracting the terrain altitude from the altimeter reading. Aviation charts are divided into boxes and the maximum terrain altitude from MSL in each box is clearly indicated. Once above the transition altitude, the <b>altimeter</b> is <b>set</b> to the international standard atmosphere (ISA) pressure at MSL which is 1013.25 hPa or 29.92 inHg.|$|R
50|$|QFF is a Q code. It is the MSL {{pressure}} {{derived from}} local meteorological station conditions {{in accordance with}} meteorological practice. This is the <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> that is intended to produce correct altitude indication (i.e., no error) on an altimeter at the actual sea level elevation, while QNH is intended to have no error at the station elevation (or, especially when applied within a region with a relatively small range of surface elevations, at the altitudes {{close to the surface}} elevation within the region).|$|R
50|$|Flight 1572 was {{scheduled}} to depart from O'Hare at 21:25 Eastern Standard Time. However, because of bad weather and delayed connecting passengers, the flight was delayed and did not depart until 23:05. While en route to Hartford, the flight crew received an ACARS printout for the weather at Hartford. It noted an <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> (reference atmospheric pressure) of , adding that pressure was falling rapidly in the area. The flight cruised uneventfully from Chicago to Hartford, other than changing from 33000 ft to 35000 ft to avoid reported turbulence.|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} altitude (TA) is the altitude {{above sea level}} at which aircraft change {{from the use of}} local barometer derived altitudes to the use of flight levels. When operating at or below the TA, aircraft <b>altimeters</b> are usually <b>set</b> to show the altitude above sea level. Above the TA, the aircraft <b>altimeter</b> pressure <b>setting</b> is normally adjusted to the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 hectopascals (millibars) or 29.92 inches of mercury and aircraft altitude will be expressed as a flight level.|$|R
40|$|Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS) {{collect and}} {{disseminate}} weather data to various {{sources for the}} primary purpose of enhancing the safety of aircraft operations in Iowa’s air transportation system. A network of 41 AWOS systems is maintained by the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT), and strategically located at airports around Iowa to provide both geographic and airport-specific coverage. AWOS enhances aviation safety by providing critical airport weather information to pilots to be used for flight planning and in-flight decision making. The system provides real-time weather observations, including wind, visibility, current weather, sky conditions, temperature, dew point, <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting,</b> and remarks, such as density altitude and local airport conditions...|$|R
5000|$|During final {{approach}} to Santa Maria Airport, {{the air traffic}} controller instructed the crew to descend to 3000 ft for an ILS approach to runway 19. During that transmission, a trainee controller had also transmitted an incorrect QNH (barometric <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting)</b> that was 9 hPa too high. The approach instructions were not fully heard since the pilot had re-keyed his microphone to acknowledge the new QNH, and likely did not hear the second repeat of the 3,000 ft safe altitude, declaring: [...] "We’re re-cleared to 2,000 feet..." [...] (610 m). Although the first officer questioned the barometric altitude, the captain agreed that the first officer had heard the read-back correctly.|$|R
