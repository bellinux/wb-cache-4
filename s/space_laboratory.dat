25|$|The {{second phase}} of the Project 921 started with Shenzhou 7, China's first spacewalk mission. Then, two crewed {{missions}} were planned to the first Chinese <b>space</b> <b>laboratory.</b> The PRC initially designed the Shenzhou spacecraft with docking technologies imported from Russia, therefore compatible with the International Space Station (ISS). On September 29, 2011, China launched Tiangong 1. This target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station.|$|E
25|$|The Tiangong-1 was {{launched}} September 2011 with an intended two year service span. After the last crew departed the module in June 2013 {{it was put}} into sleep mode and it was intended that it would remain in orbit for some time, allowing China {{to collect data on}} the longevity of key components before being commanded to gradually re-enter the atmosphere. On 21 March 2016 the Manned Space Engineering Office announced that they had disabled data service, since the space station had operated two and half years longer than its intended two-year service plan. According to the office, the <b>space</b> <b>laboratory</b> is under continued and close monitoring until it finally burns up in the earth atmosphere. Its orbit will descend gradually in the coming months, and the <b>space</b> <b>laboratory</b> will eventually be destroyed by heat in Earth's atmosphere between the October 2017 and April 2018 Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, among others, told The Guardian that parts of the craft such as the rocket engines are probably too dense and tough to be burnt up upon re-entry and may result in chunks of debris up 100kg in weight falling to the Earth's surface, with little possibility of predicting where they may crash.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{intentional}} deorbiting of Mir on 23 March 2001, the ISS {{became the only}} space station in orbit around Earth. It retained that distinction until the launch of Chinese Tiangong-1 <b>space</b> <b>laboratory</b> on 29 September 2011. [...] Mirs legacy lives on in the station, bringing together five space agencies {{in the cause of}} exploration and allowing those space agencies to prepare for their next leap into space, to the Moon, Mars and beyond.|$|E
500|$|The {{experimental}} rocket-powered aircraft programs {{started by}} NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This {{was followed by}} a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal [...] "of landing a man on the Moon by the end of , and returning him safely to the Earth." [...] This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary <b>space</b> <b>laboratory,</b> and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, [...]|$|E

5000|$|Originally, China {{planned to}} simply dock Shenzhou 8 and Shenzhou 9 {{together}} to form a simple <b>space</b> <b>laboratory.</b> However, it was decided to abandon that plan and launch a small <b>space</b> <b>laboratory</b> instead. In 2007, plans for an 8-metric ton [...] "space laboratory" [...] being launched in 2010 under the designation of Tiangong 1 were made public. This would be an eight-ton <b>space</b> <b>laboratory</b> module with two docking ports. Subsequent flights (Shenzhou 9 and Shenzhou 10) will dock with the laboratory.|$|E
