40|$|The {{identification}} of Salmonella enterica serotypes remains a highly important public health concern for microbiological analysis of foods, feeds, and clinical samples.

40|$|Most of the {{bacterial}} typing {{methods used}} to discriminate isolates in medical or food safety microbiology are based on genetic markers used as targets in PCR or hybridization experiments. These DNA typing methods are important tools for studying prevalence and epidemiology, for conducting surveillance, investigations and control of biological hazard sources. In that perspective, {{it is crucial to}} insure that the chosen genetic markers have the greatest specificity and sensitivity. The wealth of whole-genome sequences available for many bacterial species offers the opportunity to evaluate the performance of these genetic markers. In the present study, we have developed GTEvaluator, a bioinformatics workflow which ranks genetic markers depending on their sensitivity and specificity towards groups of well-defined genomes. GTEvaluator identifies the most performant genetic markers to target individuals among a population. The individuals (i. e. a group of genomes within a collection) are defined by any kind of particular phenotypic or biological properties inside a related population (i. e. collection of genomes). The performance of the genetic markers is computed by a distance value which takes into account both sensitivity and specificity. In this study we report two examples of GTEvaluator application.

40|$|Salmonella {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} enteropathogenic bacteria. It is responsible for about 5000 reported cases of human gastroenteritis each year in Sweden. Salmonellosis is a zoonotic disease, and the bacterium has the ability to infect a variety of both domestic and wild animal species. In studies of Swedish wild bird populations, we found that Black-headed gull may be the main reservoir for Salmonella in birds, and that Salmonella infection is expressed as carriage with no obvious disease manifestations. Black-headed gull is a migratory bird and can transport strains of Salmonella with virulence traits like antibiotic resistance, from sources outside Sweden. Genetic molecular methods, PFGE and IS 200, also demonstrate that Black-headed gull play a role in the transmission chain of Salmonella in Sweden. In a study of the Swedish Peregrine Falcon population, Salmonella amager and Campylobacter jejuni were found. There were indications, based on <b>serotyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> and genetical typing by PFGE of Campylobacter that these isolates were transmitsted to the falcons from a human or domestic animal source. This bird of prey has sparse contact with humans but may be infected by Salmonella of human origin by feeding on other birds, like gull. Salmonella was found in penguins, albatrosses and mainly in seals in a study in Antarctica. Several features of the Salmonella serotypes found indicate a human source for Salmonella infection in these animals, and also a spread of Salmonella within and between animal species in Antarctica.

Bacteriol. 92 : 1177 – 1187. 1966. —Labeled globulin {{fractions of}} flagellar (H) antisera, prepared against 20 frequently occurring Salmonella serotypes belonging to five major somatic (O) groups, were characterized for O and H immunofluorescence and for O and H agglutinin titers against 32 serotypes. The feasibility of immunofluorescent identification of both somatic and flagellar antigens was enhanced by staining formaldehyde-treated organisms in suspension. Relationships between homologous, partial, and unrelated antigen-antibody systems were then analyzed, {{and a high}} degree of correlation was shown between the results obtained by the two serological procedures. Flagellar staining was highly specific, and was bright, faint, or inapparent, depending on the relationship between the antigen-antibody systems involved. Somatic staining was also specific, but somewhat more difficult to interpret, because cells in the same preparation might exhibit a mixture of bright, faint, or no fluorescent intensities. Correlation was shown between the percentage of brightly staining cells found in these preparations and the agglutination titers of the comparable antigen-antibody systems. The phenomenon of a “percentage” reaction was unexplained. Absorption studies further confirmed the specificity of reactions.

Regional differences in performance were observed, with laboratories in Central Asia and the Middle East performing less well overall than those in other regions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nontyphoidal {{salmonellosis}} {{continues to}} pose a global threat to human health, primarily by causing food-borne illnesses, and food-producing animals are the principal reservoirs of many pathogenic serovars. To identify key control points and generate information that may enable future estimation of the transmission routes between the environment, animals, and humans, we examined data on Salmonella isolates in South Africa. METHODS: Samples were obtained from livestock and poultry on farms, meat at abattoirs, raw materials at feed mills, animal feed, and environmental sources (eg, poultry houses, abattoirs, feed mills, water) from 2012 to 2014 in compliance with each establishment's protocols conforming to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (ISO/TS 17728, ISO 18593 : 2004 and ISO 17604 : 2003) standards. Isolation and <b>serotyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> were performed according to the scope of accreditation of the respective laboratories conforming to ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 standard techniques. RESULTS: Salmonella was isolated from 9031 of 180 298 (5. 0 %) samples, and these isolates were distributed among 188 different serovars. Salmonella Enteritidis was the most frequent isolate, with 1944 of 180 298 (21. 5 %) originating from poultry on farms, poultry meat, and poultry houses, followed by Salmonella Havana, with 677 of 180 298 (7. 5 %), mostly from environmental samples. Serovars that are uncommonly associated with human disease (Salmonella Idikan, Salmonella Salford, and Salmonella Brancaster) were isolated at higher frequencies than Salmonella Typhimurium, a common cause of human illness. Environmental samples accounted for 3869 of 9031 (42. 8 %) samples positive for Salmonella. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the frequent isolation of Salmonella {{of a wide variety}} of serovars, from an array of animal feeds, food animals, and food animal environment. As prevention of human salmonellosis requires the effective control of Salmonella in food animals, these data can be used to facilitate Salmonella control in food animals and thereby prevent human infections...|$|E
40|$|<b>Serotyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> {{has been}} an {{invaluable}} subtyping method for epidemiologic studies for more than 70 years. The technical difficulties of serotyping, primarily in antiserum production and quality control, can be overcome with modern molecular methods. We developed a DNA-based assay targeting the genes encoding the flagellar antigens (fliC and fljB) of the Kauffmann-White serotyping scheme. Fifteen H antigens (H:a, -b, -c, -d, -d/j, -e,h, -i, -k, -r, -y, -z, -z 10, -z 29, -z 35, and -z 6), 5 complex major antigens (H:G, -EN, -Z 4, - 1, and -L) and 16 complex secondary antigens (H: 2, - 5, - 6, - 7, -f, -m/g,m, -m/m,t, -p, -s, -t/m,t, -v, -x, -z 15, -z 24, -z 28, and -z 51) were targeted in the assay. DNA probes targeting these antigens were designed and evaluated on 500 isolates tested in parallel with traditional serotyping methods. The assay correctly identified 461 (92. 2 %) isolates based on the 36 antigens detected in the assay. Among the isolates considered correctly identified, 47 (9. 4 %) were partially serotyped because probes corresponding to some antigens in the strains {{were not in the}} assay, and 13 (2. 6 %) were monophasic or nonmotile strains that possessed flagellar antigen genes that were not expressed but were detected in the assay. The 39 (7. 8 %) strains that were not correctly identified possessed an antigen that should have been detected by the assay but was not. Apparent false-negative results may be attributed to allelic divergence. The molecular assay provided results that paralleled traditional methods with a much greater throughput, while maintaining the integrity of the Kauffmann-White serotyping scheme, thus providing backwards-compatible epidemiologic data. This assay should greatly enhance the ability of clinical and public health laboratories to serotype Salmonella...|$|E
