5|$|Abrahams Creek is a {{perennial}} stream with relatively poor water quality. However, {{it is not}} considered to be impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} {{attempted}} formulations {{for the total}} <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> carried in water. These formulas are designed largely for sand, as (depending on flow conditions) sand often can be carried as both bed load and suspended load in the same stream or shoreface.|$|E
25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E
40|$|Efforts {{to protect}} water quality while {{managing}} national forests for logging purposes are currently constrained by limited {{information on the}} application, interpretation, and validation of <b>sediment</b> <b>loading</b> models. For years, these models {{have been used to}} predict the impacts of logging, road-building, and fires on <b>sediment</b> <b>loading</b> to streams.

40|$|Soil {{erodibility}} (K factor) is {{the most}} important tool for estimation the erosion. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the soil erodibility in Sanganeh area located in Naderi Kalat, Khorasan Razavi Province of northeastern Iran. The <b>sediments</b> <b>load</b> collected during the 17 rainfall events were measured at the end of 12 plots during 2009 - 2012. The K factor was calculated according to the USLE for each plot and rainfall event. The relationships between K factor and measured <b>sediments</b> <b>load</b> with soil attributes were studied. The results showed that calcium carbonate, SAR (sodium absorption ratio), silt, clay contents, and SI (structural stability index) were the most effective soil attributes for estimating the <b>sediments</b> <b>load</b> and OM (organic matter), sand, SI and calcium carbonate, silt, clay contents, and SI for K factor. The results of stepwise regression equations showed that the precision of regression equation derived from PCA for estimating the K factor and <b>sediments</b> <b>load</b> were more than ones derived from correlation test.

40|$|The role of {{externally}} imposed sediment supplies on {{the evolution}} of meandering rivers and their floodplains is poorly understood, despite analytical advances in our physical understanding of river meandering 1, 2. The Amazon river basin hosts tributaries that are largely unaffected by engineering controls and hold a range of <b>sediment</b> <b>loads,</b> allowing us to explore the influence that sediment supply has on river evolution. Here we calculate average annual rates of meander migration within 20 reaches in the Amazon Basin from Landsat imagery spanning 1985 – 2013. We find that rivers with high <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> experience annual migration rates that are higher than those of rivers with lower <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> Meander cutoff also occurs more frequently along rivers with higher <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> Differences in meander migration and cutoff rates between the study reaches are not explained by differences in channel slope or river discharge. Because faster meander migration and higher cutoff rates lead to increased sediment-storage space in the resulting oxbows, we suggest that sediment supply modulates the reshaping of floodplain environments by meandering rivers. We conclude that imposed <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> influence planform changes in lowland rivers across the Amazon...|$|R

Quantitative approaches to link <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> from catchments to metrics of downstream marine ecosystem state {{are required to}} calculate the cost effectiveness of taking conservation actions on land to benefits accrued in the ocean. Here we quantify the relationship between <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> derived from landscapes to habitat suitability of seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We use the following approach: (1) a catchment hydrological model generates sediment loads; (2) a statistical model links <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> to water clarity at monthly time-steps; (3) a species distribution model (SDM) factors in water clarity, bathymetry, wave height, and substrate suitability to predict seagrass habitat suitability at monthly time-steps; and (4) a statistical model quantifies the effect of <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> on area of seagrass suitable habitat in a given year. The relationship between <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and seagrass suitable habitat is non-linear: large increases in sediment have a disproportionately large negative impact on availability of seagrass suitable habitat. Varying the temporal scale of analysis (monthly vs. yearly), or varying the threshold value used to delineate predicted seagrass presence vs. absence, both affect the magnitude, but not the overall shape, of the relationship between <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and seagrass suitable habitat area.

25|$|After {{the first}} stage of {{aggradation}} and sediment transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily erodible sediment upstream, thus decreasing its <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and increasing its load carrying capacity downstream. With more capacity downstream, the river began to incise into the alluvial fan it previously created, moving sediment stored for a long time on its original floodplains to newer floodplains even further downstream.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the river}} was {{actively}} dredged by Boral Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river bed material by dredges has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature {{of the river and}} the generally muddy nature of the sands removed by dredging created a woefully sludgy clayey <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> in the river which did not clear.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{soil erosion}} and {{landslides}} in its upper catchment {{have produced a}} silt yield of about 19m3/ha/year (10cuyd/acre/yr), {{one of the highest}} in the world. Of major tributaries, the Arun brings the greatest amount of coarse silt in proportion to its total <b>sediment</b> <b>load.</b> The river transports sediment down the steep gradients and narrow gorges in the mountains and foothills where the gradient is at least ten metres per km. On the plains beyond Chatra, the gradient falls below one metre per km to as little as 6cm per km as the river approaches the Ganges. Current slows and the <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> settles {{out of the water and}} is deposited on an immense alluvial fan that has grown to an area of about 15000km2. This fan extends some 180km from its apex where it leaves the foothills, across the international border into Bihar state and on to the Ganges. The river has numerous interlacing channels that shift laterally over the fan from time to time. Without channelisation, floods spread out very widely. The record flow of 24200m3/s is equivalent to water a metre deep and more than 24km wide, flowing at one metre per second.|$|E

40|$|Climate change {{characterized}} by increasing temperature {{is able to}} affect precipitation regime and thus surface hydrology. However, {{the manner in which}} river <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> respond to climate change is not well understood, and related assessment regarding the effect of climate change on <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> is lacking. We present a quantitative estimate of changes in <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> (from 1. 5 Gt yr- 1 pre- 1990 to 0. 6 Gt yr- 1 from 1991 - 2007) in response to climate change in eight large Chinese rivers. Over the past decades, precipitation change coupled with rising temperatures has {{played a significant role in}} influencing the sediment delivery dynamics, although human activities, such as reservoir construction, water diversion, sand mining and land cover change, are still the predominant forces. Lower precipitation coupled with rising temperatures has significantly reduced <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> delivered into the sea in semi-arid climates (4 - 61 %). In contrast, increasingly warmer and wetter climates in subtropical zones has yielded more sediment (0. 4 - 11 %), although the increase was offset by human impact. Our results indicate that, compared with mechanical retention by reservoirs, water reduction caused by climate change or human withdrawals has contributed more sediment reduction for the rivers with abundant sediment supply but limited transport capacity (e. g., the Huanghe). Furthermore, our results indicate that every 1 % change in precipitation has resulted in a 1. 3 % change in water discharge and a 2 % change in <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, every 1 % change in water discharge caused by precipitation has led to a 1. 6 % change in <b>sediment</b> <b>loads,</b> but the same percentage of water discharge change caused largely by humans would only result in a 0. 9 % change in <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> These figures can be used as a guideline for evaluating the responses of <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> to climate change in similar climate zones because future global warming will cause dramatic changes in water and sediment in river basins worldwide at rates previously unseen. © 2013 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.

The current study evaluates the changing trends and regime shifts in runoff and <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> at both the annual and monthly time scales. The associated spatial and temporal variations are analyzed by a sequential t-test analysis of the regime shifts (STARS) approach and the “breaks for additive seasonal and trend” (BFAST) model using hydrological data at eight stations from the 1950 s to 2011. Both runoff and <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> exhibit significant declines (p < 0. 05), except in {{the upper reaches of the}} river near the Tangnaihai station. The regime shifts detected by the STARS approach are not completely consistent with the results from the BFAST method. In most cases, the regime shifts occurred in 1969 and 1986, due to the construction of large reservoirs. Climate change and other human activities, such as large-scale soil and water conservation measures, can result in abrupt changes in hydrological series at some stations. The trapping effects of reservoirs not only cause regime shifts of runoff and <b>sediment</b> <b>loads,</b> but also adjust their inter-annual and seasonal distributions. Various soil and water conservation measures are responsible for the significant reduction in runoff and <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> in the mid-lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin. In addition, water withdrawals from both river runoff and ground water play a critical role in the changing trends in runoff and indirectly alter the <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> The findings provide a good reference for the effective promotion of climate change adaptation, water resources planning and river basin management...|$|R

Suspended sediment is pollutant of primary concern to the river that results in adverse environmental effect. Detention pond becomes a practical approach to this problem. Suspended sediment that settled in stormwater detention pond, can bring effect to the detention pond functions.

Secondly the question was what the sediment accumulation be in the next 100 years.

Predict accumulated <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth from MUSLE over 10 - 100 years. Analyze the uncertainties of <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) combining normal distribution. Obtain the maximum probability of occurrence of <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth in the detention pond. Approach: Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and Trap Efficiency (TE) Method was applied to predict sediment accumulation. This uncertainty of <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth was carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) Method. The water samples were collected for suspended solids data and other water quality parameters at Ledang Heights, Nusajaya, Johor and University Technology Malaysia (UTM), Johor. Sampling station were randomly selected at the inlet and outlet of the detention pond. The hydrological parameters such as flow and velocity were also collected.

The maximum occurrence of predicted <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and <b>sediment</b> depth using MUSLE method for Ledang Height was 77. 8 tons (16. 8 %) and 7. 5 mm (26. 8 %) respectively.
