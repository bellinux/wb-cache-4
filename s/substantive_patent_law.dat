40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>law</b> is {{certainly}} a specialized field but I didn’t {{think it would be}} a cult. The term ‘invention’ appears in many critical statutory locations. Yet we have been taught, perhaps brainwashed, to give the term zero substantive import. Substantive use of the invention has been purged from patent doctrine. Instead every <b>substantive</b> question in <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> is answered by reference to the claims, the legal descriptions of the ‘metes and bounds’ of a patent’s exclusionary reach. Despite its promise of precision and uniformity, our modern invention-less system is anything but precise and uniform. This article argues that the trouble stems from this trivial vision of the invention. It leads to meaningless claim interpretation, to an incomplete vision of the disclosure requirements, and to a system that regularly violates one of <b>patent</b> <b>law’s</b> few constitutional limitations. Correctly viewed, invention is a substantive concept. The invention is simply the inventor’s own solution to some technical problem. In patent jargon, the invention is the set of embodiments conceived and disclosed by the inventor in enough detail such that they are capable of being reduced to practice. The purpose of the patent system is to secure exclusive rights in that invention if it is patentable. Claims still matter but only as tools that aid in administering that system. The patent system that embodies this substantive vision of the invention is not only the system I think Congress intended but it is also a more precise and stable system than the one we are using today...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the permanence of the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s retreat to the peripheries of <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> after {{the creation of the}} Federal Circuit, and explores the roles that the Supreme Court might imagine for itself in contemporary <b>patent</b> <b>law.</b> For discussion purposes, the article describes two hypothetical models for Supreme Court decisionmaking in patent cases: an aggressive interventionist model and an extreme non-interventionist model. After considering the shortcomings of both models, the article proposes an intermediate, managerial model. The managerial model rejects the proposition that the Court should intervene in patent cases to correct perceived substantive errors in Federal Circuit decisions. Instead, the model encourages the Court to manage disputes over the appropriate allocation of power among institutions of the patent system. Accordingly, the Court should intervene in patent cases that present such issues, and should direct its opinions towards resolving such issues, leaving the elaboration of detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> doctrine to the Federal Circuit...|$|R

40|$|This short Article digests {{what the}} Author {{see as the}} most {{important}} substantive criticism and proposes specific solutions {{in the form of the}} 2 ̆ 2 guts 2 ̆ 2 of a new patent statute. Its statutory proposal tracks the current statute 2 ̆ 7 s organization and has numerous annotations explaining what is the same, what is changed and why, and what never-before-codified principles of judge-made law are explicitly codified. Among the proposed statute 2 ̆ 7 s fundamental changes are: (1) explicit restrictions on patentable subject matter to avoid patents on bare abstractions; (2) adoption of a first-to-file system requiring worldwide novelty; (3) abolition of the doctrine of constructive reduction to practice (with exceptions for reasonable simulation of costly-to-build inventions); and (4) replacement of the troublesome criterion of 2 ̆ 2 nonobviousness 2 ̆ 2 with economic criteria that real investors actually use when deciding whether to invest in risky technology development. An introduction to the proposed, annotated statutory language explains its basic principles. They include: (1) recognizing invention as an economic and commercial process, rather than a single, abstract act of conception, (2) reducing blockage of future innovation by discouraging patents on abstract, early-stage research, and (3) changing the <b>substantive</b> focus of <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> from abstract semantics to practical economic and commercial criteria amenable to adjudication...|$|R

[...] Justice Story also upheld Justice Washington's decision to bar questions regarding whether Daniel Stouffer (the inventor of the Stouffer hopperboy) had paid Evans for a license, since Stouffer was not on trial. [...] He additionally upheld the decision to refuse to allow Evans to object to an affidavit submitted by the defendant, on the same grounds that the court had subsequently allowed the defendant to challenge an affidavit submitted by Evans, because Evans had already allowed the affidavit to be entered into evidence.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> {{issue in}} the case was the degree of {{specific}} utility a claimed invention must have {{in order to qualify}} for patenting. Andrew Manson applied for a patent on a novel process for making a form of dihydrotestosterone, a known steroid chemical. A specific use for the product was not known or disclosed by Manson, although it was hypothesized that it could be screened for possible anti-cancer utility. Other steroids of similar chemical structure were known to inhibit tumors in mice. The Patent Office took the position that a process for making a known product could be patented only if the product had a known utility, while Manson argued, and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals subsequently agreed, that it was sufficient for the process to be useful in making the product regardless of whether the product itself had any particular utility. The Patent Office refused to allow Manson to proceed. He appealed, and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed the Patent Office, saying that [...] "where a claimed process produces a known product, {{it is not necessary to}} show utility for the product" [...] so long as the product [...] "is not alleged to be detrimental to the public interest." [...] The Office then sought review in the Supreme Court.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the last}} four years, {{multiple}} institutional actors that have largely remained dormant in the scope of innovation policy and patents have undertaken a surprisingly interventionist reform of <b>patent</b> <b>law.</b> Congress, administrative agencies, and the Supreme Court have all recently shaped <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> to be more pragmatic and less overtly formalistic. Conversely, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has staunchly defended a formalist approach to <b>patent</b> <b>law,</b> advocating consistently for bright-line rules. The Federal Circuit {{has been charged with}} bringing predictability to <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> since its creation in 1982. The Federal Circuit attempts to bring predictability and uniformity through a largely rule-based formalist approach. Empirical evidence shows that the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s rule formalism has actually decreased the predictability of <b>patent</b> <b>law.</b> The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent interventions into <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> show they are in favor of a more pragmatic approach, favoring policy considerations over the adoption of bright-line formalist rules. The history of the Federal Circuit shows it was designed to be an institutional body of expertise in <b>patent</b> <b>law.</b> This expertise was meant to serve two purposes, the first was to bring predictability and uniformity to <b>patent</b> <b>law.</b> The second was to be a body with not only the power to shape <b>patent</b> <b>law,</b> but the knowledge to shape it in accordance with the goals and policies inherent in the Patent Act. This comment explains how recent Supreme Court precedents regarding patent-eligible subject matter create a framework for inculcating pragmatic, policy intensive arguments into traditionally rigid, formalistic Federal Circuit jurisprudence. The framework becomes a vehicle for the Federal Circuit to shape <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> in alignment with the pragmatic and social considerations derived from innovation policy. This comment then illustrates how that framework can be applied to bring predictability to other key areas of uncertainty in <b>patent</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Duke Law Journal’s Forty-Sixth Annual Administrative Law Symposium {{addresses}} the timely and important topic of patent exceptionalism. Administrative law exceptionalism—the misperception {{that a particular}} regulatory field is {{so different from the}} rest of the regulatory state that general administrative law principles do not apply—is by no means unique to patent law. Scholars, attorneys, and agency officials in various regulatory fields ranging from immigration to tax have sought, contrary to the Supreme Court’s general guidance, “to carve out an approach to administrative review good for [the regulatory field’s] law only. ” This Essay focuses on one of the main debates from the Symposium: whether courts should apply Chevron deference to interpretations of <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> advanced by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Part I frames the debate about whether Chevron deference should apply, contrasting the positions taken by Stuart Benjamin and Arti Rai on the one hand, and John Golden on the other. After agreeing with Professors Benjamin and Rai that certain PTO interpretations of <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> are probably eligible for Chevron deference, Part II outlines how a stronger case could be made for why it is worth the PTO’s time and energy to seek Chevron deference from the Supreme Court. Among other reasons, the PTO and its U. S. Department of Justice lawyers should request such deference to weaken the Federal Circuit’s control over <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> and reverse an era of patent stare decisis. The Essay concludes by urging patent law scholars to play a more active role in urging courts to abandon patent exceptionalism...|$|E

40|$|On 18 November 2014, Advocate General Bot {{delivered}} his {{opinion on the}} Spanish action against Regulation No. 1257 / 2012 on Unitary Patent Protection. Among other things, Spain claims that the Regulation is not capable of guaranteeing unitary patent protection as required by Article 118 (1) TFEU since, pursuant to the conflict-of-law rule contained in Article 5 (3), it leaves this question to the national law of the participating Member States. AG Bot rejected this claim by arguing that, under the EU principle of sincere cooperation, the participating Member States are under an obligation to ratify the Unified Patent Court (UPC) Agreement, which contains uniform rules on the scope of such patents. The legislative history shows {{that most of the}} <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> provisions that were included in the Commission Proposal for the UPP Regulation were ultimately transferred to the UPC Agreement as part of a political compromise that attempts to exclude the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) for these rules. Hence, following the reasoning of AG Bot, the conflict-of-law rule of Article 5 (3) is not designed to solve a conflict of laws, but only aims to insulate the UPC Agreement against claims that its uniform <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> provisions are nevertheless part of EU law and, therefore, ought to be interpreted by the CJEU. This, however, gives rise to three constitutional concerns that are not addressed by AG Bot, namely, (1) a conflict with the principle of democracy as a fundamental value of the Union, (2) a circumvention of the fundamental rights of the European Union, which would otherwise guide the interpretation of the <b>substantive</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> provisions, and (3) a curtailment of effective judicial control as an expression of the rule of law. In sum, the opinion of AG Bot comes as a clear disappointment and should not be followed by the CJEU...|$|E
