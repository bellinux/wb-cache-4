In nine hours the water had risen to its customary level--that is to say, it was within twenty-three feet of the top. We put in a little iron pump, one of the first turned out by my works near the capital; we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the well-chamber and inserted a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> pipe that was long enough to reach {{to the door of the}} chapel and project beyond the threshold, where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time.|$|E

40|$|Cross {{sections}} for {{the elastic}} scattering of 88. 03 keV gamma rays through 125 degrees by aluminium, gold, lead and bismuth have been {{measured with a}} semiconductor detector. Simultaneously information has been obtained regarding resonance Raman scattering and Compton scattering {{in the case of}} bismuth, and K shell photoeffect cross sections in the case of gold and lead. Values accurate to about 8 % were determined {{with the help of a}} normalization technique relying on a comparison with the Compton scattering counts from the low atomic number aluminium target. The elastic scattering cross section of aluminium at the chosen photon energy, which is far above the aluminium K shell threshold, is in reasonable accord with form factor and S matrix calculations based on the independent particle approximation. For gold, 7. 3 keV above its threshold, the experiment agrees with the S matrix prediction. However, for lead some 25 eV above threshold, the experimental value is about 40 % larger than predicted; while for bismuth (2. 5 keV below threshold), experiment lies 70 % above theory. The measured K shell photo effect cross <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> is within 10 % of the prediction based on the independent particle approximation...|$|E

40|$|The MUSE- 4 {{program is}} a series of zero-power {{experiments}} carried out at the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique Cadarache MASURCA nuclear facility from 2001 to 2004 to study the neutronics of accelerator-driven systems (ADSs). The program has investigated the coupling of a multiplying medium to neutron sources of 2. 6 or 14 MeV provided by an accelerator (GENEPI) via D(d,n) 3 He or T(d,n) 4 He nuclear fusion reactions, respectively. The fuel was UO 2 -PuO 2, the simulated coolant was sodium or lead, and the multiplication factor keff ranged from 1 to 0. 95. The aim of the experiment was to develop new measurement techniques specific to ADSs and to test the performances of neutronic calculations codes for such systems. The interpretation of the MUSE- 4 experiment has shown that the physical parameters of the system are globally well reproduced by calculations performed with the ERANOS code system, which proves good agreement with both the measurements and the reference Monte Carlo calculations; this concerns the critical mass, the delayed neutron fraction, the fission rate shapes, and the spectral indices. This is a particularly remarkable issue for ERANOS and its associated libraries, which had never been tested for such situations. Concerning the nuclear data, JEF-based cross sections provide a better agreement on critical mass than other libraries. A sensitivity of several measured parameters to the elastic and inelastic cross <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> have been demonstrated, and possible biases on these cross sections have been indicated. We have shown that several methods based on deterministic or stochastic calculations allow us to relate the experimental neutron population decay after a source pulse with the reactivity of the system; these reactivity determination techniques are in good agreement with standard reactivity measurement techniques...|$|E

During mine dewatering operations, approximately 132, 650 liters per minute of acid mine water was released into the Parker Run tributary draining into Leading Creek. The 24. 2 -km <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Leading</b> Creek was heavily impacted eradicating most aquatic organisms.

40|$|The accelerator-driven {{transmutation}} {{of waste}} (ATW) {{system has been}} proposed for transmuting the long-lived radioactive nuclei of high-level waste to stable or short-lived species. In recent ATW design concepts, lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE), consisting of 44. 5 % Pb and 55. 5 % Bi by weight is used as the spallation target, system coolant, and reflector. Because of the excellent neutron reflection properties of LBE, the subcriticality level of ATW is quite sensitive to the cross <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> and bismuth. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the effects <b>of</b> these cross <b>sections</b> on subcriticality and other core characteristics of ATW and to compare the results obtained using cross sections in different evaluated nuclear data files. The effects <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> and bismuth cross sections on the core characteristics of ATW were studied using 33 group cross section sets derived from the ENDF/B-VI, ENDF/B-V, JENDL- 3. 2, and BROND- 2. 2 nuclear data.
