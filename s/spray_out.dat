5|$|In Boston, a visibly {{sick man}} from the Netherlands arrives at an office building, only to {{collapse}} and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing the witnesses, another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to leave the building, only to be stopped by Walter (John Noble), who sees the man <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> blood and realizes there is a contagion. The building is quarantined with Walter's son Peter (Joshua Jackson), FBI agent Olivia (Anna Torv), {{and the rest of}} the witnesses still inside.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, this systems uses {{a set of}} nozzles to help reduce and prevent the {{likelihood}} of cavitation in propellers. This system was developed by Samsung Shipping {{which is based in}} South Korea. In order to reduce the possibility of cavitation happening in marine propellers, a set of nozzles are placed on the hull of the ship {{directly in front of the}} propeller. These nozzles <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> compressed air over the propeller that creates “a macro bubble”. This bubble completely encompasses the propeller that is in operation. With the differing characteristics of the seawater outside of the bubble and the air inside, a zone develops that has the ability to reduce the “resonance frequency”. Due to this reduction, cavitation is less likely to occur during operation of a marine propeller.|$|E
25|$|A {{brand new}} Godzilla suit was {{designed}} for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance. Outside of the suit, a meter high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had a nozzle in the mouth to <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film. These cut scenes {{can be seen in}} the Japanese theatrical trailer. Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The tail prop would be swung offscreen by a stage hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Domesticity!" [...] said Fleur, and blotted {{herself against}} the {{hawthorn}} hedge. The blossom <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> above her head, and one pink cluster brushed her cheek. Jon put up his hand jealously to keep it off.|$|R
50|$|Road spray or tire kickup is road debris (usually liquid water) {{that has}} been kicked up, pushed <b>out,</b> or <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> from a tire. In 2004, a AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study {{revealed}} that vehicle-related road debris caused 25,000 accidents and nearly 100 deaths a year.|$|R
50|$|At {{a roller}} unit, the truck places {{each set of}} wheels on the rollers as it leaves the plant. At this point the washing process is {{automatically}} triggered. While the wheels of each axle are rotated automatically, water is <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> from strategically placed nozzles to clean the tires, wheel wells and mud flaps.|$|R
2500|$|A soda geyser (alternatively Diet Coke and Mentos geyser or Mentos eruption) is a {{reaction}} between the carbonated beverage Diet Coke and Mentos mints {{that causes the}} beverage to <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> of its container. The gas released by the candies creates an eruption that pushes most of the liquid {{up and out of}} the bottle. Lee Marek and [...] "Marek's Kid Scientists" [...] were the first to demonstrate the experiment on television in 1999. Steve Spangler's televised demonstration of the eruption in 2005 went viral on YouTube, launching a chain of several other Diet Coke and Mentos experiment viral videos.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, {{she would}} start by {{embedding}} knives, razor blades, scissors, eggbeaters, baby-doll arms, and other household items in plaster covering a large board, along with bags filled with colorful paints, cans of spray paint, {{and sometimes a}} tomato. In addition, she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint {{in front of the}} white-painted assemblage. She would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol, rifle, or miniature cannon, causing the liquids to [...] "bleed" [...] or to <b>spray</b> <b>out.</b> Her first staged public shooting event was in February 1961, attended by Jean Tinguely, Daniel Spoerri, and Pierre Restany, among others. As founder of the Nouveau réalisme ("New Realist") movement, Restany asked Saint Phalle to join this group of French artists upon seeing her performance; she was the only female member of this group.|$|E

50|$|Never Bind - <b>spraying</b> <b>out</b> his sticky mucus {{all over}} the place, a {{chemical}} reaction within the substance and Nenchaku Banchou's sweat causes the mucus to quickly harden. The more the opponent coated in it moves, {{the more difficult it}} becomes to move freely. This can even go so far that breathing becomes impossible.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a decarbonator, used in reverse osmosis systems to limit the {{concentration}} of gases in the water, the air is the scrubbing fluid and the sprayed liquid is the polluted stream. As the water is <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> of the scrubber, the air strips the aqueous gasses out of the water, to be treated in another vessel.|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "powered" [...] or {{pressurized}} inhaler {{was invented}} in France by Sales-Girons in 1858. This device used pressure to atomize the liquid medication. The pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump. When the pump is pulled up, it draws liquid from the reservoir, and upon {{the force of the}} user's hand, the liquid is pressurized through an atomizer, to be <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> for inhalation near the user's mouth.|$|R
60|$|It is indeed, {{a fearful}} place. The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a {{tremendous}} abyss, {{from which the}} spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. The shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. The long sweep of green water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamor. We stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, {{and listening to the}} half-human shout which came booming up with the <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> of the abyss.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{watched her}} with eyes half-closed {{to keep the}} <b>spray</b> <b>out,</b> which had a portentous glint in them. This was a moment {{for which he had}} waited long months, and now his turn had come. If Jordan were right--and the fact that the Adelaide was there to leeward of him with engines useless {{certainly}} suggested it--he had only to play his cards well and deal the man who had ruined his father a crushing blow. He set his lips tight as he remembered that when it fell the man's daughter must bear it too, for he was bound by every honorable tie to do what he could for the men who had entrusted him with the Shasta. That fact, he felt, must stand first with him; but he was also a seaman, and could not stand by while a costly vessel drove ashore as the result of an infamous conspiracy. While he waited, grim-faced, with his wet hand clenched on the telegraph, a string of flags fluttered up between the other steamer's masts, and he laughed harshly as he turned to Lindstrom, who had come up again with a brush and a strip of board.|$|E
60|$|He {{made two}} dives into the air, {{and the next}} one missed us by a yard, and showed his great, glistening, striped body, thick as a barrel, and curved with terrible speed and power, right {{alongside}} the cockpit. He passed us, and as the boat answered to the wheel and turned, almost at right angles, the swordfish sheered too, and he hit us a sounding thud somewhere foreward. Then he went under or around the bow and began to take line off the reel for the first time. I gave him up. The line caught all {{along the side of the}} boat. But it did not break, and kept whizzing off the reel. I heard the heavy splash of another jump. When we had turned clear round, what was our amaze and terror to see the swordfish, seemingly more tigerish than ever, thresh and tear and leap at us again. He was flinging bloody spray and wigwagging his huge body, so that there was a deep, rough splashing furrow in the sea behind him. I had never known any other fish so fast, so powerful, so wild with fury, so instinct with tremendous energy and life. Dan again threw all his weight on the wheel. The helm answered, the boat swung, and the swordfish missed hitting us square. But he glanced along the port side, like a toboggan down-hill, and he seemed to ricochet over the water. His tail made deep, solid thumps. Then about a hundred feet astern he turned in his own length, making a maelstrom of green splash and white <b>spray,</b> <b>out</b> of which he rose three-quarters of his huge body, purple-blazed, tiger-striped, spear-pointed, and, with the sea boiling white around him, he spun around, creating an indescribable picture of untamed ferocity and wild life and incomparable beauty. Then down he splashed with a sullen roar, leaving a red foam on the white.|$|E

60|$|The traffic stopped, and the sun, {{no longer}} <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> by the breeze, became almost too hot. But the {{procession}} passed; the banners glittered --far away down Whitehall; the traffic was released; lurched on; spun to a smooth continuous uproar; swerving round {{the curve of}} Cockspur Street; and sweeping past Government offices and equestrian statues down Whitehall to the prickly spires, the tethered grey fleet of masonry, and the large white clock of Westminster.|$|R

50|$|Allard de la Court also {{commissioned}} van Mieris {{a fountain}} piece, again {{in collaboration with}} Filips van der Mij. The sculpture has been destroyed, but the receipts of the purchase give {{a detailed description of}} the work: Hercules strangling the head of a serpent while holding it up. The water <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> of the serpent’s mouth 11. However, the fountain has not come down to us, making the vases the only pieces of sculpture by Willem van Mieris that we can admire today.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the army}} of Ras Nasibu disintegrated, it was not destroyed. Unlike {{some of the other}} Ethiopian armies bombed or <b>sprayed</b> <b>out</b> of existence, Nasibu's army slipped out of the country or melted into the {{mountains}} to become the seeds for later resistance. But {{it may have been the}} overcast skies more than a change of heart on Graziani's part that saved the withdrawing Ethiopians from the Italian Royal Air Force. [...] Ras Nasibu himself went into exile with the Emperor.|$|R
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then <b>sprays</b> <b>out</b> of the geyser vent.|$|R

25|$|Sound {{designer}} Mark Mangini {{stated that}} he viewed the War Rig as an allegory for Moby-Dick with Immortan Joe {{playing the role of}} Captain Ahab. As such, the mechanical truck sounds were layered with whale calls to provide a more animal-like quality to the truck. When the tank is pierced with harpoons and milk <b>sprays</b> <b>out,</b> the sound of whale blow-holes were used. For the final destruction of the War Rig, the only sounds used were slowed down bear growls to symbolise the death of the truck as a living creature.|$|R
500|$|As {{a fairly}} rare phenomenon, the {{formation}} of geysers is due to particular hydrogeological conditions that exist {{in only a few}} places on Earth. Generally all geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma. Generally, surface water works its way down to an average depth of around [...] where it contacts hot rocks. The resultant boiling of the pressurized water results in the geyser effect of hot water and steam <b>spraying</b> <b>out</b> of the geyser's surface vent (a hydrothermal explosion).|$|R

50|$|However, {{pressurized}} {{systems were}} also more complex, and far more susceptible to damage - as the cooling fluid was under pressure, even minor damage in the cooling system like a single rifle-calibre bullet hole, would cause the liquid to rapidly <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> of the hole. Failures of the cooling systems were, by far, {{the leading cause of}} engine failures.|$|E
50|$|Himel (1974) made a {{distinction}} between exo-drift (the transfer of <b>spray</b> <b>out</b> of the target area) and endo-drift, where the active ingredient (AI) in droplets falls into the target area, but does not reach the biological target. Endo-drift is volumetrically more significant and may therefore cause greater ecological contamination (e.g. where chemical pesticides pollute ground water).|$|E
