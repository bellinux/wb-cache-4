25|$|In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of {{publishing}} pseudonymous {{letters to the}} editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E
25|$|Following two {{high-profile}} shows which {{failed to}} perform in the ratings, UMTV hired Terry Wogan and Evans' former Big Breakfast co-host Gaby Roslin to host a weekday morning magazine show, The Terry and Gaby Show. Evans <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> that if this show failed he would set up a market stall. Despite critical acclaim the audience numbers never took off and Channel 5 axed the show after its year-long run, citing its high cost as a reason. True to his word, Evans was pictured {{at the end of}} the final show with a market stall and later he opened it for real at Stables Market, Camden.|$|E
25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest {{he knew what was}} in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only have come from the SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.|$|E

25|$|On March 11, 2008, Obama won the Mississippi primary. CNN.com, March 11, 2008 There, Obama won {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} the black vote, compared to Clinton's 70 percent majority of white voters. On March 11, 2008, David Axelrod demanded that Clinton sever ties with Geraldine Ferraro, a top Clinton fundraiser and 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> that Obama was a major presidential contender only because he is a black man. Obama widened his lead over Clinton in the overall delegate count when he was declared the winner of the March 4 Texas caucuses on March 12, 2008. Obama and Clinton would both statistically tie McCain in a general election matchup, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released March 18, 2008. The National Archives on March 19, 2008, released more than 11,000 pages of Clinton's schedule when she was first lady. Obama's campaign had pushed for release of the documents, arguing that their review was necessary to make a full evaluation of Clinton's experience as first lady. Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, released their tax returns from 2000 to 2006 on his campaign web site March 26, 2008, and he challenged Clinton to release hers.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Blaine revived his old {{idea of an}} {{international}} conference of western hemisphere nations. The result was the First International Conference of American States, which met in Washington in 1890. Blaine and Harrison had high hopes for the conference, including proposals for a customs union, a pan-American railroad line, and an arbitration process to settle disputes among member nations. Their overall goal was to extend trade and political influence over the entire hemisphere; {{some of the other}} nations understood this and were wary of deepening ties with the United States to the exclusion of European powers. Blaine <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> that his only interest was in “annexation of trade," [...] not annexation of territory, but privately he wrote to Harrison of a desire for some territorial enlargement of the United States: ...|$|E

500|$|Four {{days after}} the attack, Obama <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> that Abdulmutallab's ability to board the {{aircraft}} {{was the result of}} a systemic failure that included an inadequate sharing of information among U.S. and foreign government agencies. He called the situation [...] "totally unacceptable." [...] He ordered that a report be delivered detailing how some government agencies had failed to share or highlight potentially relevant information about the suspect before he allegedly tried to blow up the airliner. Two days later Obama received the briefing, which included statements that information about the suspect had failed to cross agency lines, and that the failures to communicate within the U.S. government had led to the threat posed by Abdulmutallab not being known by certain agencies until the attack. Obama said he would meet with security officials and specifically question why Abdulmutallab was not placed on the U.S. no-fly list, despite the government having received warnings about his potential al-Qaeda links.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, set {{photos of}} Robert Downey Jr. driving {{a new model}} Acura were {{published}} online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, [...] "As you may know, Acura {{has been in the}} Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D.

500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had <b>said</b> <b>publicly</b> that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large {{worldwide}} tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably {{going to do it}}, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E

2500|$|According to Jeff Kaye's {{interpretation}} of a “Memorandum of Conversation” from the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) dated July 6, 1953 (and declassified and released by the CIA in 2006), the U.S. protestations at the United Nations did not mean the U.S. was serious about conducting any investigation into biological warfare charges, despite what the government <b>said</b> <b>publicly.</b> The reason the U.S. didn’t want any investigation was because an “actual investigation” would reveal military operations, “which, if revealed, could do us psychological as well as military damage.” The memorandum, which {{had been sent to}} CIA director Allen Dulles, specifically stated as an example of what could be revealed “Eighth Army preparations or operations (e.g. chemical warfare).” ...|$|E
