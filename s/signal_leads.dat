2500|$|Synapses may be {{electrical}} or chemical. [...] Electrical synapses make direct {{electrical connections}} between neurons, but chemical synapses {{are much more}} common, and much more diverse in function. [...] At a chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic. [...] Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. [...] The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles, packed with neurotransmitter chemicals. [...] When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated, and cause {{the contents of the}} vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic cleft. [...] The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to enter an activated state. [...] Depending on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example, release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell. [...] The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic <b>signal</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of a memory trace).|$|E

So in one frame the phase of the colorburst leads and in the second frame the phase of the color <b>signal</b> <b>leads.</b> However, if there is DP distortion in the system, the shift caused by DP has always the same polarity, thus the overall shift is more than the original in one frame and less than the original in the second frame by the same amount.

5000|$|Long-term resistance, or {{systemic}} acquired resistance (SAR), involves {{communication of}} the damaged tissue {{with the rest of}} the plant using plant hormones such as jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid or salicylic acid. The reception of the <b>signal</b> <b>leads</b> to global changes within the plant, which induce genes that protect from further pathogen intrusion, including enzymes involved in the production of phytoalexins. Often, if jasmonates or ethylene (both gaseous hormones) is released from the wounded tissue, neighboring plants also manufacture phytoalexins in response. For herbivores, common vectors for disease, these and other wound response aromatics seem to act as a warning that the plant is no longer edible (source?). Also, in accordance with the old adage, [...] "an enemy of my enemy is my friend," [...] the aromatics may alert natural enemies of the plant invaders to the presence thereof.|$|E

50|$|Strain gauge {{load cells}} convert the load acting on them into {{electrical}} signals. The gauges themselves are bonded onto a beam or structural member that deforms when weight is applied. In most cases, four strain gauges {{are used to}} obtain maximum sensitivity and temperature compensation. Two of the gauges are usually in tension can be represented as T1 and T2,and two in compression can be represented as C1 and C2, and are wired with compensation adjustments. The strain gauge load cell is fundamentally a spring optimized for strain measurement. Gauges are mounted in areas that exhibit strain in compression or tension. When weight {{is applied to the}} load cell, gauges C1 and C2 compress decreasing their resistances. Simultaneously, gauges T1 and T2 are stretched increasing their resistances. The change in resistances causes more current to flow through C1 and C2 and less current to flow through T1 and T2. Thus a potential difference is felt between the output or <b>signal</b> <b>leads</b> of the load cell. The gauges are mounted in a differential bridge to enhance measurement accuracy. When weight is applied, the strain changes the electrical resistance of the gauges in proportion to the load. Other load cells are fading into obscurity, as strain gauge load cells continue to increase their accuracy and lower their unit costs.|$|E
50|$|In vivo, PD1 {{is mainly}} {{produced}} {{as a response}} to inflammatory signals and it is found in various tissues, such as the retina pigment epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neural tissues. Studies in PBMC have shown that endogenous DHA, the main precursor of PD1, is released by the activity of phospholipase A2. According to these studies, PD1 is preferentially synthesized in PBMC cells skewed to the Type 2 T helper cell phenotype (TH2). This suggests that T-cell differentiation {{plays an important role in}} the activation of the PD1 biosynthetic pathway. The interaction of PBMC with interleukin 4 (IL-4), a potent inflammatory <b>signal,</b> <b>leads</b> to the differentiation of PBMC to TH2 type lymphocytes. In addition, activated TH2 cells further release IL-4, leading to the up-regulation of the enzyme 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1). 15-LO-1 is a non-heme iron-carrying dioxygenase that adds oxygen atoms in a stereospecific manner on free and esterified ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA. Overall, the biosynthesis of PD1 proceeds through three distinct steps throughout which the activity of 15-LO-1 is essential. In the first step of the biosynthetic pathway, the binding of 15-LO-1 to its substrate (DHA) leads to the formation of the (17S)-hydro(peroxy)-DHA intermediate. This intermediate is rapidly processed to form a 16(17)-epoxide-containing molecule, which is the second intermediate. Finally, in the third step of the pathway, enzymatic hydrolysis of the 16(17)-epoxide-containing intermediate leads to the formation of PD1.|$|E
