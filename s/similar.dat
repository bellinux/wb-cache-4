5|$|In morphology, {{analogous}} traits {{arise when}} different species live in <b>similar</b> ways and/or a <b>similar</b> environment, and so {{face the same}} environmental factors. When occupying <b>similar</b> ecological niches (that is, a distinctive way of life) <b>similar</b> problems can lead to <b>similar</b> solutions. The British anatomist Richard Owen {{was the first to}} identify the fundamental difference between analogies and homologies.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build <b>similar</b> to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a <b>similar</b> growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is <b>similar</b> to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} <b>similar</b> sites along the Swahili Coast. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana {{at the mouth of}} the Tana River, which was <b>similar</b> in size to Gedi. However, compared to sites <b>similar</b> in size, Gedi had one of the more densely populated urban centers.|$|E

40|$|Data {{for this}} study were {{collected}} in two parts. In the first, 70 Ss responded to a list of stimuli in seven tasks of restricted association. The second part of the study employed stimuli consisting of 11 of these original stimuli plus their primary responses in each of the seven tasks. These were given to 50 new Ss under the same seven task instructions. The seven tasks were Superordinates, Coordinates, <b>Similars,</b> Contrasts, Functions, Qualities, and Parts. The main analysis of data was the derivation of matrices of response overlap for the seven semantic relationships corresponding to the restricted-association tasks. Primary interest centered on similarity relationships. High overlap along the diagonal of the response-overlap matrix characterized the <b>Similars.</b> Overlap in five of these diagonal cells was found to discriminate <b>Similars</b> from the other relationships. A measure of the degree of Restricted-Association Similarity (RAS) was derived, based on this discriminating overlap...|$|R

5|$|As colonies {{closer to}} each other are more genetically <b>similar,</b> {{independent}} colony foundation is most likely associated with nuptial flight if they disperse far from genetically <b>similar</b> colonies they originate from. Inseminated queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out, known as the nest-site limitation hypothesis. Some queens could even try {{to return to their}} nests that they came from after nuptial flight, but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will be <b>similar</b> to the queens birth nest.|$|E

Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries <b>similar</b> to the one made in Cannibal Holocaust. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of <b>similar</b> content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings.
