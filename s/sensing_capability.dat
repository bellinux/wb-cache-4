50|$|The {{structure}} of any situation is built upon four components, Behavior functions, Sensors, States, and Event Rules. Behavior functions represent what the characters behaviors {{are specific to}} the situation. Sensors are the <b>sensing</b> <b>capability</b> for agents to see and respond to events. States are the different motions and state transitions used only for the local behaviors. Event rule {{is the way to}} connect different events to their specific behaviors. While a character is being put into a situation, these four components are considered at the same time. For spatial situations, the components are added when the individual initially enters the environment that influences the character. For non-spatial situations, the character is affected only once the user assigns the situation to the character. The four components are removed when the agent is taken away from its situations region or the situation itself is removed. The dynamic adding and removing of the situations lets us achieve scalable agents.|$|E
