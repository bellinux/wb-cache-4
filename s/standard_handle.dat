[...] Knoxville was initially lukewarm to the idea, but agreed to accept Mechanicsville as its Ninth Ward on January 1, 1883. [...] At {{the time of}} its annexation, Mechanicsville reported a population of just over 2,000, three churches, two schools, six general stores, and a greenhouse. [...] Along with Knoxville Iron, factories located in and around Mechanicsville during this period included the Knoxville Brewing Company (on McGhee), the <b>Standard</b> <b>Handle</b> Company, the W. H. Evans and Son marble company, the Knoxville Car and Wheel Company, and the Greenleaf Turntable Manufactory.|$|E
5000|$|A veneer hammer {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with hot hide glue in applying veneer to a substrate. The term [...] "veneer hammer" [...] is somewhat misleading, as the [...] "hammer" [...] is used more like a squeegee than a hammer. The hot hide glue is applied to the substrate, then the veneer is laid onto the glued surface. The hammer itself has a dull blade, approximately three inches wide, {{on one side of the}} head, and a square shaped face on the other side. This head is connected to a <b>standard</b> <b>handle,</b> much like a regular hammer. The small square face is designed to push down on, exerting force to the blade side of the head.|$|E
40|$|DHHS publication; no. (NIOSH) 97 - 137 Handles for {{squeegees}} {{were evaluated}} {{to identify the}} ergonomic hazards associated with use of hand tools in the screen printing industry. Working in the screen printing industry exposed workers to wooden handled squeegees used to force ink through a screen and into a substrate. Studies by NIOSH indicated that redesigning the squeegee handle can significantly reduce hand pain and fatigue. Squeegee handles for manual screen print workers should be designed {{to conform to the}} shape of the hand when in a somewhat relaxed and open position. The handle surface should make full contact with the fingers and surface of the palm of the hand. The diameter of the grip should be at least 18 % wider than the grip diameter of the industry <b>standard</b> <b>handle.</b> Padding the handle with a compressible surface reduces hand pain and fatigue significantly. Standard squeegee handles can be modified by adding compressible rubber grips which should be available in varying widths and diameters to accommodate workers with different hand sizes.

5000|$|... "The {{history of}} the Multiplying Ball effect isn’t as ancient as one might believe, but {{it is all the}} more messy. The origin has been tracked back to Buatier de Kolta, who in 1875, for the first time ever, {{performed}} an effect where one ball magically was produced, and then multiplied into three balls. However, the choreography was quite different from what is considered standard today. In de Kolta’s original, the balls were held together in one hand, from underneath - the hand acting almost as a basket for the balls, while all the magic was performed with the other hand. As noted by Tommy Wonder, the original effect was both more elegant and clearer than the versions known today. But where has today’s <b>standard</b> <b>handling</b> appeared from?
