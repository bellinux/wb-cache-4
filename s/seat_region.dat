40|$|An {{analysis}} of Transparent Combustion Chamber (TCC 3) engine Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) result {{was carried out}} to investigate Cycle-to-Cycle Variation (CCV) correlation between in-cylinder swirl ratio and flow in the valve <b>seat</b> <b>region</b> of the intake port to address a challenging question on “What causes CCV of in-cylinder flow”. Polar Velocity (PV) profile, mean velocities normal to a ring-shaped cutting surface in the valve <b>seat</b> <b>region,</b> is calculated to depict intake port flow. A Net Polar Velocity (NPV) can be defined by performing the vector sum of the polar velocity around the intake valve. A standard deviation of PV is also calculated from azimuthal distribution of PV magnitudes relative to its mean value. The {{analysis of}} 18 LES cycles of TCC 3 engine with a two-valve, pancake-shaped combustion chamber shows that similar CCV of in-cylinder swirl ratio patterns are observed at different crank angles from Intake Valve Opening (IVO) to Exhaust Valve Opening (EVO). Further analysis shows clear correlations of CCV between in-cylinder swirl ratio and NPV magnitude and the standard deviation of PV at selected crank angles from IVO to EVO. The correlations get significantly better with the ring-shaped cutting surface moves from up-stream to downstream of the valve-seat region. This study reveals that the CCV of in-cylinder swirl ratio is built up gradually from upstream to downstream in the intake port and valve-seat region. Further evaluation of the analysis method is planned for a four-valve engine as an evaluation metric for better engine intake port design and combustion chamber optimization...|$|E
40|$|Future regulations, {{such as the}} ultra low {{emissions}} vehicle (ULEV) {{specified by}} the California Air Resources Board (CARB), are placing stricter limits on the allowable hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and make {{the understanding of the}} sources of HC emissions of considerable importance. Previous researchers have identified six sources of hydrocarbon emissions: oil layers, deposits, liquid fuel, quenching, crevices, and exhaust valve leakage. The objective of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the liquid fuel contribution to hydrocarbon emissions. The purpose of this work was to develop a fundamentally based description of liquid fuel transport into the engine cylinder of a port fuel injected, gasoline fueled, SI engine, and to develop a method of quantifying the liquid fuel contribution to HC emissions. To simulate the liquid fuel flow from the valve <b>seat</b> <b>region</b> into the cylinder, a specially designed injector probe was constructed and used to inject controlled amounts of liquid fuel onto the port wall close to the valve seat. By fueling the engine on a gaseous fuel, either propane or pre-vaporized Indolene, and injecting liquid fuel close to the valve seat, we can examine the effects of liqui...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the thermal loading of a modern 1. 975 1, four-cylinder petrol engine operating at engine speeds of up to 100 rev/s. The effects of engine speed and load, mixture strength, ignition advance, compression ratio, coolant tempera-ture and pressure, antifreeze, detonation, olefin content of fuel, and a piston modification on the local heat fluxes and metal temperatures have been determined and the maximum levels established. The methods of temperature measurement were fixed and traversing thermocouples for the cylinder head and liner, fixed thermocouples for the valve seats and spark plug, disappearing-filament optimal pyrometer and hardness recovery for the exhaust valve, differential thermocouples for the gross heat losses, and intermittent-contact fixed thermocouples for the piston. The greatest heat fluxes occurred at the centre of the combustion chamber, in the valve bridge and exhaust-valve <b>seat</b> <b>region,</b> and decreased towards the outside of the combustion chamber and down the cylinder liner.

40|$|Valve {{systems in}} rocket {{propulsion}} systems and testing facilities are constantly subject to dynamic events {{resulting from the}} timing of valve motion leading to unsteady fluctuations in pressure and mass flow. Such events can also be accompanied by cavitation, resonance, system vibration leading to catastrophic failure. High-fidelity dynamic computational simulations of valve operation can yield important information of valve response to varying flow conditions. Prediction of transient behavior related to valve motion can serve as guidelines for valve scheduling, which is of crucial importance in engine operation and testing. In this paper, we present simulations of valve motion utilizing a multi-element unstructured computational approach that permits the use of variable grid topologies, thereby permitting solution accuracy and resolving important flow physics in the <b>seat</b> <b>region</b> of the valve. The approach {{is based on a}} mesh library strategy in which generalized mesh movement is applied between a sequence of meshes and the solution is transferred between meshes at specific valve positions pre-defined in the library. We discuss important valve flow characteristics such as valve response to variable plug control speeds as part of our simulations. Furthermore, we present an alternative methodology that utilizes a single grid that deforms and adapts during valve motion. I...|$|E
40|$|Solenoid valve of the {{injector}} flow shows {{characteristics of}} bubbly flow. In the valve <b>seat</b> <b>region</b> of solenoid valves {{the expansion of}} fuel flow from high pressure to low pressure regions creates bubbles. Two-phase flow characteristics of ball type solenoid valve for diesel common rail injectors are modelled with mixture model approach, which is suited for bubble–liquid flow. The cavitation model {{is based on the}} Rayleigh–Plesset equation. The flow pattern of valve geometry can be considered as high speed jet flow which occurs after throttling of high pressure fuel. The SST turbulence model is used to handle vortex formation. In solenoid valves the mass flow rate control with a throttling pipe and then expansion of jet flow in a diffuser cause bubble generation due to flow detachment and vortex formation, where pressure drops below vapour pressure of fuel. This results in cavitation erosion damage. The quantification of the erosive potential of collapsing vapour structures is done with a cavitation erosion index based on work hardening process. The pressure rise due to the impact of a microjet is estimated from classic water hammer approach. It is shown that cavitation model is very sensitive to condensation rate constant and density ratio of diesel and diesel vapour...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{framework for}} analysis of complex valve systems supports testing of propulsive systems by simulating key valve and control system components in the test loop. In particular, {{it is designed to}} enhance the analysis capability in terms of identifying system transients and quantifying the valve response to these transients. This system has analysis capability for simulating valve motion in complex systems operating in diverse flow regimes ranging from compressible gases to cryogenic liquids. A key feature is the hybrid, unstructured framework with sub-models for grid movement and phase change including cryogenic cavitations. The multi-element unstructured framework offers improved predictions of valve performance characteristics under steady conditions for structurally complex valves such as pressure regulator valve. Unsteady simulations of valve motion using this computational approach have been carried out for various valves in operation at Stennis Space Center such as the split-body valve and the 10 -in. (approx. 25. 4 -cm) LOX (liquid oxygen) valve and the 4 -in. (approx. 10 cm) Y-pattern valve (liquid nitrogen). Such simulations make use of variable grid topologies, thereby permitting solution accuracy and resolving important flow physics in the <b>seat</b> <b>region</b> of the moving valve. An advantage to this software includes possible reduction in testing costs incurred due to disruptions relating to unexpected flow transients or functioning of valve/flow control systems. Prediction of the flow anomalies leading to system vibrations, flow resonance, and valve stall can help in valve scheduling and significantly reduce the need for activation tests. This framework has been evaluated for its ability to predict performance metrics like flow coefficient for cavitating venturis and valve coefficient curves, and could be a valuable tool in predicting and understanding anomalous behavior of system components at rocket propulsion testing and design sites...|$|E
40|$|The near nozzle exit {{flow and}} spray {{structure}} generated by an enlarged {{model of a}} second generation pintle type outwards opening injector have been investigated under steady flow conditions {{as a function of}} flow-rate and needle lift. A high resolution CCD camera and high-speed video camera have been employed in this study to obtain high-magnification images of the internal nozzle exit flow in order to identify the origin of string ligaments/droplets formation at the nozzle exit. The images of the flow around the nozzle seat area showed clearly that air was entrained from outside into the nozzle seat area under certain flow operating conditions (low cavitation number, CN); the formed air pockets inside the annular nozzle proved to be the main cause of the breaking of the fuel liquid film into strings as it emerged from the nozzle with a structure consisting of alternating thin and thick liquid filaments. As the flow rate increased, the air pockets were suppressed, reduced in size and pushed towards the exit of the nozzle resulting in a smoother spray. The results showed that the number of strings increased linearly, within the measured range, with liquid exit velocity and that the spray cone angle was smaller or larger than the nominal value depending on the attachment of air pockets to the cartridge or needle surfaces, respectively; these two distinct small and large cone angles were found to be dominant at low and high lifts. Increasing the flow rate further so that CN exceeds the critical value, gave rise to pockets of vapour that started to emerge in the nozzle <b>seat</b> <b>region</b> and disintegrated rapidly as they were convected towards the nozzle exit. The analysis of the near nozzle flow visualizations has shown the existence of air entrainment and cavitation as two different phenomena occurring under different operating condition...|$|E
