40|$|This {{clinical}} study, {{carried out}} from 1996 to 1999, {{was aimed at}} assessing the effect of varicoceletomy on the <b>spermogram</b> of patients with subclinical varicocele. A total of 142 patients (Mean age 28. 1 ± 4. 3) with varicocele (63 with subclinical) {{took part in the}} study. All individuals were informed and were satisfied to get involve in the study. Two spermograms were recorded one at the beginning and the second one two weeks later in both study patients and control groups. Three to six months after varicoceletomy (High ligation of the internal spermatic vein) two other <b>spermogram</b> with the interval of two weeks were performed on all individuals. The spermogram’s results before and after operation were compared among the individuals of each group. While the results of <b>spermogram</b> of the patients with subclinical varicocele did not showed a significant change after operation, the <b>spermogram</b> of those with clinical varicocele improved significantly after operation. On the other hand bilateral and right varicocele in the patients with subclinical symptom was more prevalent than the other group. Secondary infertility in the patients with subclinical varicocele compare to the other group was much higher. As a result, operation on the patients with subclinical varicocele did not show a significant change compare to the patients who suffered from clinical varicocele (Result of <b>spermogram</b> before and after operation). This study guides us to select other methods of treatment rather than surgical operation in subclinical varicocele patients. So we recommend checking other infertility causative factors such as hormonal abnormality, internal urogenital abnormality, and immunological disorders before deciding to perform varicoceletomy in this group.

Patient's age, medical history, testicular volume, <b>spermogram,</b> genetic testing, endocrinologic results, biopsy results and clinical pregnancy information were collected. From the 113 men included, {{it was possible to}} retrieve spermatozoa in 79. 6 % of the cases, which resulted in 58 fertilisations and 22 clinical pregnancies. Retrieving viable spermatozoa on biopsy was associated with the identification of spermatozoa in the <b>spermogram</b> (100. 0 % versus 74. 4 %; P = 0. 010), diseases causing obstructive infertility (100. 0 % versus 79. 2 %; P = 0. 036) and no genetic causes detected (82. 4 % versus 54. 5 %; P = 0. 030).

Methods: the <b>spermograms</b> of 43 non-diabetic subjects and 12 diabetic patients (type 1 and 2) aged 20 - 60 years were compared. Spermiological findings in diabetic patients were compared with those of normal individuals of the same age. Serum testosterone, prolactin, follicle-stimulant hormone, luteinizing hormone, glucose and glycosilated hemoglobin were assayed in diabetic patients. Rresults: Six diabetic patients (four type 1 and two type 2) presented chronic complications attributed to neuropathy and vascular insufficiency. No difference was observed in the semen characteristics (odor, color, viscosity and pH) between the control group and the diabetic patients. There were no differences between seminal concentrations and percentage of motile spermatozoa during the first hour of observation in the two groups (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Background Clinical {{signs of}} cryoglobulinemia {{syndrome}} depend on localization of affected vessels, and vascular pathology {{is a frequent}} cause of sexual disorders. Thus, the article presents correlation between cryoglobulinemia and spermatogenesis impairment. Aims The aim of our investigation was to study reference between cryoglobulinemia and spermatogenesis impairment. The method of intradermal autoleukocyte immunization was used for inhibition of cryoglobulin synthesis. Methods The research involved patients with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and various severe forms of infertility, when cryoglobulinemia of the 2 nd and 3 rd types was detected. Leukocytes for immunization were isolated from plasma of a patient’s heparinized venous blood by centrifuging at 400 g for 8 minutes, after that the residue was resuspended in 1 – 1. 5 ml of own blood serum and injected intradermally in 0. 1 ml dose into the back. <b>Spermogram</b> indices were compared before and in 10 – 15 days after immunization. Results In most patients (75. 0 per cent) with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and cryoglobulinemia, <b>spermogram</b> indices completely returned to norm due to inhibition of cryoglobulin synthesis. In men with severe forms of infertility, elimination of cryoglobulins also had {{a positive impact on}} spermatogenesis (100 per cent), which resulted in normalization of <b>spermogram</b> indices and improved the conditions for assisted reproductive technologies. Conclusion The results of investigation indicate that a considerable reduction of cryoglobulinemia has a positive impact on spermatogenesis. Therefore, it is expedient to include the method for detection of cryoglobulins into methodical recommendations/instructions for examination of patients with impairment of male fertility.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Human {{infertility}} is {{a common}} condition secondary to many primary or secondary causes. As for these latter, different seasonal and climatic patterns have been hypothesized to play a role. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the presence of a possible seasonal pattern in the functional parameters of semen samples maintained in a large tertiary center database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The reports of <b>spermograms</b> of 5188 consecutive subjects, collected at the Center for Reproductive Incapacity of the University Hospital of Parma during a 11 -year period (2003 - 2014), were retrospectively analyzed. The reports included sperm motility, volume, and number, as well as pH, swelling and eosin tests. Data of different parameters were analyzed by season of sample collection. The ANOVA test was used for the evaluation of continuous variables, after Log transformation in case of a non-normal distribution, while χ(2) test was used for categorical variables. Moreover, logistic regression analysis was performed, to identify factors independently associated with normal sperm motility. RESULTS: Compared with the other seasons of the year, a higher sperm motility was found during the summer. Moreover, the prevalence of samples with a normal sperm pH (7. 2 - 8) was higher during the spring, whilst the volume of sperm was higher in winter.

40|$|Klinefelter {{syndrome}} and Y-chromosomal microdeletion analyses were once {{the only two}} genetic tests offered to infertile men. Analyses of aurora kinase C (AURKC) and DPY 19 L 2 are now recommended for patients presenting macrozoospermia and globozoospermia, respectively, two rare forms of teratozoospermia particularly frequent among North African men. We carried out genetic analyses on Algerian patients, to evaluate the prevalence of these syndromes in this population and to compare it with the expected frequency of Klinefelter {{syndrome and}} Y-microdeletions. We carried out a retrospective study on 599 consecutive patients consulting for couple infertility at the assisted reproduction unit of the Ibn Rochd Clinique, Constantine, Algeria. Abnormal sperm parameters were observed in 404 men. Fourteen and seven men had typical macrozoospermia and globozoospermia profiles, respectively. Molecular diagnosis was carried out for these patients, for the AURKC and DPY 19 L 2 genes. Eleven men with macrozoospermia had a homozygous AURKC mutation (79 %), corresponding to 2. 7 % of all patients with abnormal <b>spermograms.</b> All the men with globozoospermia studied (n = 5), corresponding to 1. 2 % of all infertile men, presented a homozygous DPY 19 L 2 deletion. By comparison, we would expect 1. 6 % of the patients in this cohort to have Klinefelter syndrome and 0. 23 % to have Y-microdeletion. Our findings thus indicate that AURKC mutations are more frequent than Klinefelter syndrome and constitute the leading genetic cause of infertility in North African men.

40|$|Abstract: Background & Aims: Recent evidences {{indicate}} that {{parts of the}} immunoregulation system such as CD 4 +CD 25 +Tcells (Treg) and Th 2 cells and Th 1 cells, play very important roles in the maintenance of pregnancy. The deficiency in proper recognition of fetal alloantigen by the maternal immune system is associated with recurrent pregnancy failure. Here, we investigate the proportional changes of CD 4 +CD 25 +Tcells in peripheral blood of women with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion in comparison to women with normal pregnancy by using flowcytometry. Methods: The case group was comprised of 24 women who had at least three successive miscarriages with unexplained etiology. They had normal karyotypes, anticardiolipin and prolactin and their husbands had normal <b>spermograms.</b> The percentages of TCD 4 +CD 25 +cells in peripheral blood of these patients were {{compared with those of}} 21 women who had normal pregnancy with no history of pregnancy loss. Anti-CD 4, anti-CD 25 and anti-CD 3 antibodies were added to lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. Then samples were incubated, centrifuged and washed. Finally cells were analyzed using FACS Caliber system and data of the two groups were compared. Results: Mean percentage of CD 4 +CD 25 +bright T cells in peripheral blood in case group was significantly lower compared to the control group (P= 0. 000). Mean percentage of CD 4 -CD 25 bright cells in the CD 4 +Tcell peripheral blood was significantly higher in case group campared to the control group (P= 0. 021). Conclusion: Decrease of CD 4 +CD 25 bright T cells {{plays a major role in}} tolerating conceptus antigens and cytokine and might contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy. Inadequate CD 4 +CD 25 +Tcells or their functional deficiency may link with miscarriage. Therefore, alteration of CD 4 +CD 25 +T cells can be used as an immunologic marker for monitoring of patients with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion.

40|$|Objective : To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} anthropometric indices on seminal parameters. Methods : Men who underwent treatment for conjugal infertility {{during the period of}} October, 2011, to March, 2012, were randomly selected. Patients with any prior diseases related to sperm alterations were excluded. Patients were submitted to an anthropometric evaluation to obtain body mass index, and the seminal analysis was made through a <b>spermogram.</b> Two anthropometric methods of classification were used: body mass index (normal and altered) and abdominal circumference (94 cm). Data were analyzed by statistical tests. Results : The group with the altered body mass index presented lower volumes of ejaculated volume and a larger percentage of patients with abdominal circumference < 94 cm presented with progressive forms of spermatozoa below reference values. However, in the statistical tests, there was no significant difference. Conclusion : No significant difference was found in the sperm quality relative to the body mass index or abdominal circumference...|$|E
40|$|Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) {{is part of}} the {{microbiota}} of {{the male}} genitourinary tract, sometimes it has been considered as possible pathogenic microorganism. In the 5 th version of sperm manual (WHO, 2010) sperm morphology criterion is very restricted to 4 % of normal heads whereas David’s criterion evaluates several spermatic forms. The abnormalities of sperm forms were evaluated according to criteria of spermatic morphology: WHO and David in semen samples with bacterial concentrations ≤ 103, 104 and ≥ 105 CFU/mL of CoNS as of other bacteria. <b>Spermogram,</b> sperm culture and antibodies anti-Chlamydia trachomatis IgA detection in 281 semen samples men were performed. CoNS was the most frequent germ isolated in pure culture (9. 25 %). Semen samples with CoNS showed higher round cells and microcephalus forms by means of David’s criterion. CoNS in higher concentrations than 104 CFU/mL may {{have a negative impact on}} sperm cellularity, sperm head and probably on fertility...|$|E
40|$|Background: Globozoospermia {{is a rare}} (incidence of 0. 1 % among andrological pa-tients) {{and poorly}} {{understood}} condition, but a severe disorder in male infertility. This case report detailed the course of treatment and protocol of a patient with type 1 globozoospermia using Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) and oocyte activa-tion by calcium ionophore, which yielded conception and birth of a healthy baby af-ter six previous unsuccessful attempts, using ICSI alone. Case Presentation: A 39 -year-old male with normal findings on routine examina-tion presented to TDV 29 Mayis Hospital, Assisted Reproduction Unit (ART) with his 37 -year-old wife. Her examination was also within normal limits and ovulatory cycle was regular. The male’s diagnostic screening revealed normal karyotype (46, XY) and no Y-microdeletion. However, the <b>spermogram</b> was abnormal; sperm count of 14 million/ml with 35 % active motility and 100 % morphologically abnormal sperm, indicating globozoospermia. Ovarian stimulation was provided using classic long down-regulation protocol and 13 MII oocytes were collected. Next, calciu...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{androgen}} receptor is encoded by a single-copy gene {{located in the}} long arm of the X chromosome (Xq 11 - 12); it consists of eight exons and encodes an intracellular transcription factor that belongs to the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily. Disturbances in {{the function of the}} {{androgen receptor}} can lead to several forms of male pseudohermaphroditism, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome, which can lead to infertility. Infertility affects around 20 % of couples, and in half of the cases it is a male problem. Seventy male patients with idiopathic infertility were selected; data were obtained on age, drinking and smoking habits, occupation, and family history. The mean age of the patients was 37 years old (standard deviation = 12. 3); 44 % were azoospermic, 33 % were oligozoospermic and 24 % did not have alterations in the <b>spermogram.</b> Our objective was to evaluate a possible association between male infertility and mutations in the androgen receptor gene based on the presence or absence o...|$|E
30|$|Before the {{sterilization}} was reversed, a <b>spermogram</b> {{was performed}} on male patients and routine infertility diagnostic procedures were performed on female patients (gynecological examination, ovarian reserve test, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy during reversal) during the follicular phase of the women’s cycle {{to rule out the}} presence of infertility causes other than that of sterilized tubes. In addition to that, blood tests were performed to screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and fasting glucose, and complete blood count (CBC) and a chest X-ray were performed. Six patients {{were not included in the}} study because the requirements for tubal reversal were not met during the laparoscopy performed on 39 women. The healthiest looking tube carrying the requirements for anastomosis was chosen for unilateral reversal of the sterilization. The criteria for anastomosis were an isthmic segment of a minimum length of 2 – 3  cm, starting from the cornual end, the presence of both parts of the ampullar and fimbrial ends of the fallopian tube, a length of tube of more than 4  cm remaining after the operation, and healthy looking fimbria.|$|E
40|$|Eighty {{patients}} (mean age 33. 0 ± 6. 2 years) with idiopathic pathospermia {{were enrolled}} in the investigation. The infertility period averaged 18. 8 ± 3. 9 years. The patients were made up of two groups: 1) 51 patients who had the signs of small pelvic varices (SPV) (a study group) and 2) 29 patients with no signs of SPV (a comparison group), and 34 healthy volunteers also participated in the investigation. The study group was randomized to 2 subgroups: 1) phlebotropic therapy only (n = 26); 2) phlebotropic therapy in combination with AndroDoz (n = 25). The comparison group used AndroDoz only. The treatment cycle was 3 months. Analysis was made by the results of a <b>spermogram,</b> biochemical examination of the ejaculate, resistive index, pulsatility index, peak blood flow velocity in the intraprostatic arteries, diameter of small pelvic veins, and their reflux. Subgroup 1 of the study group showed statistically significant differences in all parameters, other than hemodynamic ones. The greatest changes were noted in subgroup 2 of the study group; there were significant changes in all the parameters. </em...|$|E
40|$|The rate of male {{infertility}} {{is about}} 40 % {{and has a}} recent upward trend. Male infertility is a multifactorial disorder. There have been recently {{a great number of}} medicaments used to treat male infertility. The investigation was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Selzinc plus used in the combination therapy of idiopathic male infertility. The paper gives the results of therapy with Selzinc plus (a tablet b. i. d. for 3 months). The trace elements as the drug’s components have different positive effects and can improve the key parameters of a <b>spermogram.</b> Our investigation has confirmed the efficacy of Selzinc plus in the combination therapy of patients with idiopathic infertility. Therapy with Selzinc plus is safe even if it is given in a double daily dose. The results of this investigation and their comparability with the data available in the foreign literature enable us to recommend Selzinc for clinical application in the combination therapy of male infertility and in the programs of assisted reproductive technologies. </em...|$|E
40|$|Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a pro-oxidant enzyme {{contained}} in and released by neutro- phils during degranulation or after lysis. Post-thaw semen contains MPO, and concen- tration of this enzyme {{is associated with}} decreased motility. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine kinetics of MPO concentration during freezing, its origin, and its impact on frozenethawed semen. Forty ejaculates were used. Semen was frozen using the classical freezing procedure. MPO concentrations were assayed in fresh semen, after centrifuga- tion, and after cooling down to 4 C. Post-thaw MPO assay results and <b>spermogram</b> characteristics were determined. MPO immunocytochemistry was performed on 4 different ejaculates at each step of freezing procedure. MPO concentration increased after cooling down to 4 C and thawing compared with fresh semen. As temperature decreased, MPO was higher or tended to be higher in post-thaw poor quality samples. Nonsperm cells showed various degrees of MPO immunostaining and were observed as epithelial cells with nuclear pyknosis and keratinization. MPO immunostaining increased in medium and decreased in nonsperm cells during freezing. Our study shows that MPO concentration in equine semen increases when temperature decreases. We hypothesize that nonsperm cells present in fresh semen could release MPO. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Breeding boars {{used for}} semen production. This is {{conditioned}} by many factors. The research {{aim was to}} assess the some indices of <b>spermogram</b> (volume, mobility, concentration, total sperm / ejaculate) at 21 boars, the breeds Large White, Landrace, Duroc and Pietrain in relation with some factors of influence: the race, age, individual and harvesting season. The age of boars was between 8 months and 30 months. The rhythm of harvesting was following: one harvesting followed by the five days break. Depending on the breed, were differences for volume (183, 5 ± 4, 88 ml at Pietrain boars and 256 ± 5, 3 ml at Landrace boars) and for concentration (309, 7 ± 6, 0 millions/ml at Duroc boars and 430, 7 ± 9, 3 millions/ml at Pietrain boars). In function on the season, semen volume varied insignificant between summer (minimum values: 188. 4 ± 5. 6 ml) and winter (maximum values: 222. 1 ± 6. 6 ml). The spermatozoon concentration was insignificantly influenced by the season (371. 6 ± 11. 7 million/ml - summer; 399. 4 ± 12. 6 million/ ml – autumn). The greatest differences for all indices of semen analysis were in function on individual. The results show that the indices analyzed are strongly influenced by internal environmental factors (breed, individual) and are less conditioned by environmental factors such as the season...|$|E
