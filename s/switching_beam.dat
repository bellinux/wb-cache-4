40|$|AbstractThe Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF 2) is an {{extension}} of the ATF beamline extraction featuring an ILC-type ﬁnal focus system. Among the project's major purposes are establishment of hardware and beam handling technologies aimed at transverse focusing of ATF's electron beam to below 40 nm in the vertical. A laser-interferometer type high resolution beam size monitor named the “Shintake Monitor” is installed at ATF 2 's virtual interaction point, and plays a crucial role in achieving this aim. A laser interference fringe is formed by crossing two coherent laser rays. This functions as an interaction target for probing the electron beam. Beam size sensitivity of the monitor depends on the pitch of the interference fringe, and maximizes at about one ﬁfth of the pitch. The Shintake Monitor at ATF 2 is designed to be capable of measuring beam sizes ranging from 6 μm down to 20 nm in the vertical. A vertical beam size of approximately 300 nm has been measured during the run of May 2010. For this running period, ATF 2 operated under a special optics conﬁguration with ten times the nominal IP beta function. For the most recent run, due to <b>switching</b> <b>beam</b> optics back to nominal, BG levels rose about 10 times from May. Shintake Monitor had been proven in May to fulﬁll expectations provided BG is low. However with high BG, its accuracy decreased, which makes low S/N a major concern.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical study of transverse exciton-polariton patterns in semiconductor quantum-well microcavities. These patterns are initiated by directional instabilities in the uniform pump-generated polariton field and are measured as optical patterns in a transverse {{plane in the}} far field. Based on a microscopic many-particle theory, we investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the formation, selection, and optical control of these patterns. An {{emphasis is placed on}} a previously proposed low-intensity, all-optical switching scheme designed to exploit these instability-driven patterns. Simulations and detailed analyses of simplified and more physically transparent models are used. Two aspects are studied in detail. First we study the dependencies of the stability behaviors of various patterns, as well as transition time scales, on parameters relevant to the switching action(the degree of built-in azimuthal anisotropy in the system and the <b>switching</b> <b>beam</b> intensity). It is found that if the parameters are varied, the pattern system undergoes abrupt transitions at threshold parameter values which are accompanied by multiple-stability and hysteresis behaviors. Moreover, during a real-time switching action, the transient dynamics of the system may depend significantly on the proximity of unstable patterns. The second aspect is a classification and detailed analysis of the polariton scattering processes contributing to the pattern dynamics, giving us an understanding of the selection and control of patterns as results of these processes' intricate interplay. The crucial role played by the relative phases of the polariton field in determining the gains or losses of polariton densities in various momentum modes is highlighted, and interpretation of the actions of the various processes in terms of concepts commonly used in classical pattern-forming systems is given.

Moreover, for efficient M 2 M communication, both one dimensional (1 -D) and two dimensional (2 -D) <b>beam</b> <b>switching</b> is highly needed for high data-rate wireless radio links.

This thesis proposes a new technique of achieving simple and cost effective 2 -D <b>beam</b> <b>switching</b> array antenna at 28 GHz for 5 G wireless system. The technique involves lateral cascading of Butler matrix (BM) beamforming network (BFN). However, designing a planar BM at 28 GHz that will allow K-connector is not a trivial issue because the distances between the ports are X/ 4 electrical length apart. Nevertheless, two branch line coupler (BLC) with unequal ports separation at 28 GHz on a single substrate are designed and applied to design 1 -D <b>switched</b> <b>beam</b> antennas based on BLC and 4 * 4 BM. Then two of these antennas are laterally cascaded to achieve 2 -D <b>beam</b> <b>switching</b> antenna. This novel concept {{is the basis for}} choosing BM BFN in the design. The proposed 1 -D array antennas on BLC and BM have wide measured impedance bandwidth of 18. 9 % (5. 3 GHz) and 21. 7 % (6. 1 GHz) and highest gain of 14. 6 dBi and 15. 9 dBi, respectively.
