40|$|In {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} laboratory, {{the effect of}} fungicides, <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> adjuvants and storage time in the control of Drechslera teres in seeds of barley cultivar BRS Elis, with 58 % incidence, was quantified. Fungicides indicated by barley research (carboxin + thiram, difenoconazole and triadimenol) compared with the mixture carbendazim + iprodione were tested. As <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> adjuvants, water (500 m mL/ 100 Kg) and a polymer (150 mL/ 100 Kg) were used. Treated seeds were stored in paper bags and kept in the refrigerator at 5 ºC. At 30 -day intervals during six months, seeds were plated on semi-selective Reis's medium (1983). The best control was obtained by the mixtures carboxin + thiram and carbendazim + iprodione and the polymer as <b>seed</b> <b>dresser.</b> The control efficiency was improved by the storage time without negatively affecting seed germination. Due to the transmission efficiency, the fungus eradication in seeds should be pursued...|$|E
40|$|Imidacloprid is a {{neonicotinoid}} insecticide {{that has}} been used for controlling sucking pests of cotton. This study showed the efficacy of the imidacloprid insecticide, Gaucho 70 WS as <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> against aphids, whiteflies and thrips incidences on CB 3 cotton cultivar. At the same time, inhabitants of the predators (ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphids and spiders) and yield of the crop were evaluated. Fuzzy and delinted cotton seeds treated with imidacloprid reduced pest population compared to untreated control or foliar spray of monocrotophos 40 WSC at 1120 ml ha- 1, and being the highest efficacy at 5. 5 g kg- 1 fuzzy seed. Cotton plants grown with imidacloprid treated seeds have abundances of ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphids and spiders. The cotton cultivar produced significantly higher yield when seeds were treated with imidacloprid at 5. 5 g kg- 1 fuzzy seed. Therefore, use of imidacloprid, Gaucho 70 WS as a <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> may be an option for controlling sucking pests of cotton under field conditions...|$|E

40|$|Seed {{treatment}} ofroot parsley {{was done}} to protect Petroselinum santivum seedlings against damping off. Fungicides used as <b>seed</b> <b>dressers</b> were applied in 3 doses: 3, 5 and 10 g/kg. Seeds were treated with 7 dressers (Table l) used separately and in mixture with 3 g/kg of Rovral 50 WP (50 % iprodione) and 1 g/kg of Apron 35 SD (35 % metalaxyl). Two seed samples of Berlińska cultivar were used: first sample was strongly infected by Alternaria petroselini and A. radicina both 27, 6 % and also by Fusarium spp. 5, 4 % (Test I), and second sample revealed lower percentage of infection 4, 6 % and 1, 2 %, respectively (Test II). The experiments were conducted under laboratory, glasshouse and field conditions. Complete seedlings protection in all experiments was achieved for treatments when fungicide mixture {{was used in the}} highest dose (10 g/kg). Decrease of fungicides concentrations were connected with lower effectiveness of disease control. No phytotoxic effects of the tested fungicide mixtures were observed under the glasshouse or field conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSweet or {{bell pepper}} {{is a member}} of the Solanaceae family and is {{regarded}} as one of the most popular and nutritious vegetable. Blight, in the form of leaf and fruit blight, has been observed to infect bell pepper crops cultivated at the horticulture farm in Rajasthan College of Agriculture, Udaipur, India. Based on disease severity, we attempted to curb this newly emerged problem using different fungicides, plant extracts, bio-control agents, and commercial botanicals against the fungus in laboratory and pot experiments. Bio-control agent Trichoderma viride and plant growth promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) isolate Neist- 2 were found to be quite effective against bell pepper blight. All evaluated fungicides, botanicals, commercial botanicals, and bio-control agents in vitro were further studied as <b>seed</b> <b>dressers</b> and two foliar sprays at ten days interval in pot experiments. The combinations of Vitavax, PGPR isolate Neist- 2, and Mehandi extract were found to be very effective against bell pepper blight followed by Vitavax, T. viride, and Mehandi extract used individually. All treatments in the pot experiments were found to significantly reduce seedling mortality and enhance plant biomass of bell pepper. Thus, these experimental findings suggest that a better integrated management of bell pepper blight could be achieved by conducting field trials in major bell pepper- and chilli-cultivated areas of the state. Besides fungicides, different botanicals and commercial botanicals also seem to be promising treatment options. Therefore, the outcome of the present study provides an alternate option of fungicide use in minimizing loss caused by Drechslera bicolor...|$|R
40|$|Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) such as DDT and HCH, have stable {{chemical}} properties and less biodegradability. As {{a kind of}} persistent organic pollutants, they have high risk {{to the environment and}} human health. Organochlorine pesticide have been used in Uttar Pradesh in agriculture as a <b>seed</b> <b>dresser,</b> in sanitation, in malaria control programme and in livestock to combat ectoparasites. The pesticides applied drift to areas where cattle graze and plant grow. Because of their chemical stability, they accumulate in the lipid-rich tissue of the body. In the body they circulate throughout all compartments and accumulate in adipose fat. Milk can be used as an evaluation index of environmental contamination by these insecticides, although the main objective of this analysis is to monitor the levels of OCPs in animal’s & human’s milk of rural areas. The levels of the DDT and HCH residues in animal’s & human’s milk collected from rural areas having intensive sugarcane, wheat & paddy cultivation in Lakhimpur Kheeri were analysed All samples contained detectable quantities of DDT, HCH and its metabolites. Total HCH residues were high than those of DDT in all the samples. The total concentration of DDT was found lower than the previous studies carried out in India. These results indicate that the overall DDT levels in Lakhimpur Kheeri region is slightly degrading...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse {{experiments}} were conducted over two cropping cycles {{to investigate the}} effect of fungicide seed treatment and fungal root rot pathogens on nodulation and dry matter accumulation of selected food legumes. The legumes were common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. variety GLP 2), green gram (Vigna radiata L. variety M 66) and lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) while the pathogens were Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli, Macrophomina phaseolina, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani. Treatments consisted of inoculation of legume seeds with appropriate rhizobia alone, rhizobia together with fungicide, rhizobia together with pathogen and a combination of rhizobia, fungicide and pathogen. Fungicide copper oxychloride {{was used as a}} <b>seed</b> <b>dresser.</b> Rhizoctonia solani and S. sclerotiorum were more pathogenic and showed significantly increased seedling mortality and greater reduction in seedling emergence, number of nodules and root dry matter. Fungicide seed dressing significantly increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality. However, fungicide seed dressing alone and in combination with pathogen depressed nodulation in all the legumes. Inoculation with F. oxysporum and M. phaseolina had no significant effect on nodulation in common bean. All the treatments had little or no significant effect on shoot dry matter. The results suggest that fungicide seed treatment in combination with rhizobia inoculation is beneficial in management of root rot and enhancement of nodulation in food legumes...|$|E
40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economic crop which is attacked by serious diseases such as Fusarium root rot. In this study, the efficacy of Trichoderma viride and T. koningii were evaluated for the suppression of Fusarium oxysporum causing root rot of beans in vitro and disease control under greenhouse condition. Three food carriers - broken dehulled rice grain, sorghum seeds, and vermiculite were also evaluated for suitability as growth and delivery media for Trichoderma isolates as determined by the sporulation ability and root rot control respectively. In vitro studies resulted in effective suppression of F. oxysporum by the two Trichoderma isolates. Saprophytic growth on rice and sorghum was good at two weeks but poor on vermiculite. T. viride in half broken dehulled rice produced excellent bean root rot control as measured by disease severity at 7 th week and was significantly (P≤ 0. 05) better than standard <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> Murtano (20 % Thiram and 20 % Lindane); T. koningii and T. viride in sorghum, and T. koningii in rice had moderate disease control whilst the two Trichoderma isolates in vermiculite had poor disease control. There was some positive correlation between saprophytic growth of Trichoderma isolates in different carriers in the laboratory and their suppression of Fusarium root rot in the greenhouse. The results of this study indicates that potential exist for management of Fusarium root rot in beans by antagonistic Trichoderma isolates in their respective carriers and may form part of IPM for bean root rot...|$|E
