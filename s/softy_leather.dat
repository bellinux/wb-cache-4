CSM 0 A 0 was the control sample wherein neither melamine formaldehyde based nor polyacrylate based syntan was added. CSM 3 A 0 and CSM 0 A 3 had 3 % melamine formaldehyde based and 3 % polyacrylate based syntan, respectively {{in addition to}} the other common auxiliaries used in all three samples. Other unit operations (physical and chemical) for manufacturing leather were maintained same in all the three samples. Thermal, mechanical and hydrodynamic swelling behavior of these three samples was studied, and tried to be correlated with the crosslinking densities of the samples. The hydrodynamic swelling behavior was studied in three different solvents (e. g. water, toluene and xylene) assuming definite solvent-bovine collagen interaction parameters, and crosslink densities were evaluated by applying the Flory-Rehner equation. While studying the mechanical behavior, some distinguished theoretical models (e. g. Mooney-Rivlin, Flory, and Martin, Roth & Stiehler (MRS)) were tried to be fit with the experimental results obtained in stress-stain analyses. In this process, few constants for cow Cr tanned leather were derived as value of constant A in MRS equation remained in the range of 0. 9 - 1. 0 and value of constant B in Flory’s equation remained in the range of 0. 001 - 0. 003, which were earlier not reported in the literature.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} finding the competition of paint substance which optimal applied for <b>softy</b> sheep <b>leather</b> for lady’s bags manufacturing. Materials {{used in this study}} were 27 pieces of pickled sheep stock and simple factorial 3 x 3 was use for the research plan, the treatment of which is combination binder RU 3989 (150 gram, 200 gram, 250 gram) and pigment (75 gram, 100 gram, 125 gram) for 1, 000 gram paint solution. The research result indicates that the proportion of paint substance composition optimal applied to sheep which are tanned to be softly leather for lady’s bags manufacturing is the combination of 250 gram binder RU 3989 and 75 gram pigment in 1, 000 gram paint solution, and the test result fulfil the requirements of sheep garment leather quality...|$|R
