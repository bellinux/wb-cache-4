5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers to the <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north</b> were somewhat lower than those {{to the east and}} west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north,</b> each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

5|$|Amylostereum chailletiiz {{is common}} in the {{temperate}} regions of North America and Eurasia. A.laevigatum can be also found in temperate Eurasia, but {{it is unclear how}} broadly this species is distributed in North America. A.areolatum is originally native in North Africa and Eurasia; it was however distributed through the 20th century in Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa as well as in <b>South</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> America.

Pockets of Republican strength are in the central areas along the I-495 crescent, Hampden County, and communities on the <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north</b> shores, but {{the state as a}} whole has not given its Electoral College votes to a Republican in a presidential election since Ronald Reagan carried it in 1984. Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins of victory in both the 1980 and 1984 elections.|$|E

5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 <b>South</b> <b>and</b> <b>north</b> of Co Roc Ridge, {{across the}} border in Laos, the North Vietnamese established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming {{into the path of}} a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north,</b> leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|Initial extrapolations placed Cooper's {{landing zone}} within an {{area on the}} southernmost {{outreach}} of Mount St. Helens, a few miles southeast of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River. Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz Counties, encompassing the terrain immediately <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north,</b> respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. FBI agents and Sheriff's deputies from those counties searched {{large areas of the}} mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the route}} that {{eventually}} became the Victoria line {{date from the}} 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking north-east London with the centre {{was included in the}} County of London Plan in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north</b> or north-east London. Each of these connected the three main line termini at King's Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>north.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a basic}} L-shaped tower {{built from}} tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was {{extended}} in a southerly direction {{by the addition of}} a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century.

Replacement entrances were installed and the original first-floor doorway was closed off.
