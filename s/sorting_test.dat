5|$|Chapters on {{methodology}} {{comprise a}} third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object <b>Sorting</b> <b>Test</b> (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object <b>Sorting</b> <b>Test</b> showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E
40|$|Immediate {{emergence}} of equivalence classes {{has been documented}} in <b>sorting</b> <b>tests</b> in two experiments. Discordant findings — showing that classes documented by <b>sorting</b> <b>tests</b> immediately after the training of baseline relations cannot always be defined as equivalence classes — have also been identified. To investigate these types of discordant findings further, we reviewed 25 articles. The reviewed articles were selected from searches in PsycINFO and by examining the reference lists in the already identified articles. The inclusion criterion was whether <b>sorting</b> <b>tests</b> were used in relation to MTS-based training or a similar procedure to establish conditional discrimination. Studies that met the criterion were quantified and evaluated along a number of dimensions related to parameters and variables in procedures. We employed Chinese characters as compound stimuli to investigate the variables influencing attending behavior in matching-to-sample (MTS) and <b>sorting</b> <b>tests.</b> The Chinese characters were used with and without the radical. Twenty participants were assigned to two sequences of experimental conditions, participants in both sequences were exposed to pre-sorting of stimuli, first without, then with the radical, and subsequently exposed to a hybrid MTS (H-MTS) training in which the compound stimuli included identical radicals and therefore were only partly arbitrary. After training the baseline relations, the participants in Sequence 1 had the <b>sorting</b> <b>tests,</b> without and with the radical, followed by a H-MTS test, with the radical, and finally they had the post-sorting of the stimuli without and with the radical. In Sequence 2 participants conducted the H-MTS test after training of baseline relations then the <b>sorting</b> <b>tests</b> and finally the H-MTS test with the radical. The immediate {{emergence of}} all stimulus classes was seen in seven of the ten participants in both sequences, whereas for the compound stimuli without radicals, it was only seen {{in two of the}} ten participants in Sequence 1 and one of the ten in Sequence 2...|$|R

25|$|Standardized neuropsychological tests : These tasks {{have been}} {{designed}} so the performance on the task {{can be linked to}} specific neurocognitive processes. These tests are typically standardized, meaning that they have been administered to a specific group (or groups) of individuals before being used in individual clinical cases. The data resulting from standardization are known as normative data. After these data have been collected and analyzed, they are used as the comparative standard against which individual performances can be compared. Examples of neuropsychological tests include: the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Boston Naming Test, the Wisconsin Card <b>Sorting</b> <b>Test,</b> the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association. (The Woodcock Johnson and the Nelson-Denny are not neuropsychological tests per se. They are psycho-educational batteries of tests used to measure an individual's intra-disciplinary strengths and weakness in specific academic areas (writing, reading and arithmetic)).|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2007 {{presentation}} at an American Academy of Neurology meeting, hormone therapy taken soon after menopause may help protect against dementia, but {{it raises the}} risk of mental decline in women who do not take hormone replacement until they are older. Dementia risk was 1% in women who started HRT early, and 1.7% in women who didn't, (i.e. women who didn't take hormone replacement seem to have had—on average—a 70% higher relative risk of dementia than women who began HRT {{around the time of}} the beginning of menopause). This suggests that there may be a [...] "critical period" [...] during which time taking HRT may have benefits, but if HRT is initiated after that period, it will not have such benefits and may cause harm.

40|$|In 2011, TriQuint {{introduced}} a new Dual-Band Transmit module to the handset market containing a GaAs-based high throw count switch [1, 2]. Initial pre-production yields were below expectations where the switch {{was found to be}} the cause. Stringent application-specific DC die <b>sort</b> <b>test</b> requirements, increased process complexity and switch design topology employing a high gate density were all factors in the depressed yield. Failure analysis showed {{that for the first time}} at TriQuint, an RF product was yield-limited due to process defects, rather than parametric variation. Reducing defects to enable high yield and reliability has long been critical for Silicon manufacturing, however, for GaAs manufacturing, parametric failures are often on top of the yield Pareto. This paper will first outline the development of a DC die <b>sort</b> <b>test</b> methodology which not only assured high final test yield but also prevented test escapes due to limitations in the measurement of IMD 2 and third-order Harmonics in the production test. Failure analysis results, which were integral to the discovery of a defect-driven yield loss mechanism, will be covered. As a preview, Figures 1 and 2 included here show a die sort wafer map of failing die and the ultimate root cause of the failure identified in a focused-ion beam cross-section in Figure 2.
