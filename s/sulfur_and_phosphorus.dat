5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, <b>sulfur,</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, <b>sulfur</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as <b>sulfur</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E

Dalton provided no indication {{in this paper}} how he had arrived at these numbers but in his laboratory notebook, dated 6 September 1803, is a list in which he set out the relative weights of the atoms {{of a number of}} elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, etc. by chemists of the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{planetary}} {{core of the}} IIABs {{was rich}} in <b>sulfur</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus.</b> This special chemical composition caused the magma to split into two separate liquids while cooling. The concentration of sulfur is estimated to have been about 5%. For this reason the metallic magma reached the liquidus curve (a point where solids coexist with a liquid) of the iron + liquid field. This led to the crystallization of the IIAB meteorites. The remaining liquid was trapped in cavities of the IIABs and crystallized once the temperature reached the eutectic point. At this temperature the remaining magma crystallized schreibersite and iron, thereby forming the IIG meteorites.|$|E
500|$|In 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, England, Abraham Darby {{began to}} fuel a blast furnace with coke instead of charcoal. [...] Coke's initial {{advantage}} was its lower cost, mainly because making coke required much less labor than cutting trees and making charcoal, but using coke also overcame localized shortages of wood, especially in Britain {{and on the}} Continent. [...] Metallurgical grade coke will bear heavier weight than charcoal, allowing larger furnaces. [...] A disadvantage is that coke contains more impurities than charcoal, with <b>sulfur</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> being especially detrimental to the iron's quality. [...] Coke's impurities were {{more of a problem}} before hot blast reduced the amount of coke required and before low ash and low sulfur coal was used and manganese was added to tie up sulfur.|$|E

The iron-containing rocks are a less important component. [...] The whole rock falls into the calc-alkaline class of volcanic rocks. The andesites contain plagioclase clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and phenocrysts of magnetite. Magnetite, and in lesser measure hematite, are the most abundant iron minerals; anhydrite, diopside, goethite, limonite, maghemite, pyrite, and diadochite are also found.

High oxygen-18 amounts in the Laco magmas indicate either crustal contamination or isotopic effects during fractional crystallization.

500|$|Helium has a valence of {{zero and}} is {{chemically}} unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As {{with the other}} noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, <b>sulfur,</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and [...] have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts.

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method to}} separate anion complexes of <b>sulfur,</b> iodine, <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> to enable determination by radiochemical techniques. This method involves ion chromatographic separation of the anion complexes from other highly emitting radioactive species such as cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 which interfere with radiochemical analysis. We essentially use the ion chromatograph as a sample pretreatment method. The samples are injected onto a cation exchange column which allows the anions to pass through while retaining the positively charged species. These anions are collected in the column effluent and measured by nuclear counting methods. The method was developed to enable measurement of trace radionuclides in radioactive waste and in environmental samples. Trace radionuclides which are present in concentrations {{of only a few}} hundred disintegrations per minute per milliliter can be separated and then analyzed using liquid scintillation counting analysis. This paper establishes the separation and collection protocol, collection efficiencies for <b>sulfur,</b> iodine, <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> anion standards, <b>and</b> overall efficiencies and detection limits for the separation and subsequent radiochemical analysis of iodine- 129 from both environmental level and high salt waste samples...|$|R

2500|$|All {{phosphate}} fertilizers {{are obtained}} by extraction from minerals containing the anion PO43−. [...] In rare cases, fields {{are treated with}} the crushed mineral, but most often more soluble salts are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals. [...] The most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as phosphate rock. [...] The main minerals are fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F (CFA) and hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH. [...] These minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with sulfuric or phosphoric acids. The large production of sulfuric acid as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer. The global primary uses for both <b>sulfur</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> compounds relate to this basic process.|$|E
