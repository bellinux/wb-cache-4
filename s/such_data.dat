5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on <b>such</b> <b>data,</b> five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{although}} already timetabled to be retired, a Sea Harrier {{was modified}} with an 'Autoland' system {{to allow the}} fighter to perform a safe vertical landing without any pilot interaction.

5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages. The {{delimitation}} of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. <b>Such</b> <b>data</b> might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was among}} the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. <b>Such</b> <b>data</b> was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. <b>Such</b> <b>data</b> would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot {{be used to identify}} them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; <b>such</b> <b>data</b> have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect <b>such</b> <b>data</b> from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, <b>such</b> <b>data</b> structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E
