40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} finite element (FE) study {{to assess the}} {{behavior}} of a flexible <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall.</b> The effect of excavation and backfilling process on the behavior of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> have been thoroughly investigated and the results are presented in terms of the wall deformations and bending moments, developed anchor forces, and the earth pressures developed on both active and passive side of the wall. Development of failure mechanism in terms of soil displacements and incremental deviatoric strains, slip lines and plastic points formations have been illustrated. Such structures in the field are often associated with high water table, which renders significant hindrance in the construction of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall,</b> and hence, dewatering is adopted in such cases. The dewatering scheme substantially alters the stress conditions on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall,</b> and if not accommodated in the design, might render the behavior as unrealistic.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel sheet pile walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel sheet pile walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall.</b> This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel sheet pile with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made {{of steel}} sheet pile walls for soil and/or water retaining constructions. High demands are made {{with respect to the}} deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> composed of so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of that, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called oblique bending, and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. Oblique bending goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> relative to the soil body. Oblique bending might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation of the sheet pile. Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces oblique bending. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model {{is made of}} a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall</b> with a dry excavation in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks.

In addition a quay wall combined only from sheet piles, without a relieving platform is also analysed. 1) The <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> <b>wall,</b> in Part A, is analysed by three different approaching theories of Blum. The fixity of the end point of the sheet piling is considered once as completely free and in the other two as fully fixed.

Among the main factors which influence this are the soil friction in the interlocks and the transmission of longitudinal shear forces in the interlocks of the <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> In the field, the soil–interlock interaction depends mainly on the installation method and the soil properties. The aim of this research was to study the dependencies between the applied forces and the friction in the interlocks by full-scale physical modeling during press-in by taking the pile–pile and interlock–soil interactions into account. The results of the on-site full-scale tests as well as the laboratory physical modeling of U-profile piles in different soil conditions are presented in the paper. Using the data obtained, “force–displacements” diagrams were constructed to assess the influence of soil friction and resistance in the interlocks. The calculation model was improved based on the results to provide a more reliable numerical modeling and design of the “sheet pile–soil media” system. The physical modeling clearly shows the influence of soil behavior on the interlock between <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> {{especially in the case of}} saturated sand...|$|R
