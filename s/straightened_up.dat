25|$|The second New York City Hall, {{erected in}} 1700 and torn down in 1816, {{stood on the}} site of present-day Federal Hall National Memorial and {{occupied}} the eastern side of present-day Nassau Street, which, historically, curved around the City Hall. It was <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> after the demolition of the second City Hall, but its early track was retained in the placement of the corner buildings (including the Gillender Building but not the 14 Wall Street) which were set back from the street, providing a wider than usual sidewalk. In 1816, the corner lot was owned by Charles Gardner, who sold the property in 1817 for $11,200; it was further resold in 1835 for $47,500 and in 1849 for $55,000. Charles Frederick Briggs and Edgar Allan Poe operated the offices of the Broadway Journal on this site from 1844 until 1845. From 1849 until December 1909, the lot remained {{in the hands of a}} single family. Adjacent lots were owned by the Sampson family since 1840; in 1880, this property was developed into a seven-story Stevens Building.|$|E

All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E

The horses were picqueted and the men turned in about 23:00. Next morning the whole camp was pitched, the field ambulance erecting their hospital and operating tents, and horse lines were put down and everything was <b>straightened</b> <b>up.</b> The weather was still very hot but the daily early morning parade continued, followed by all the horses being taken to water. It was necessary to go about , to water and back, through terrible dust, which naturally the horses churned up {{so that it was}} difficult to see the horse in front. The men wore goggles and handkerchiefs over their mouths to keep out some of the dust, but it was a long, dusty, hot trip.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin knew he {{was going}} to be killed. According to Rachel Plummer's account, Benjamin {{returned}} to the fort, after his first talk with the war party, and told his brother and father that he believed they would all be killed, and that they should run swiftly to the woods. Silas again argued with him, telling him they should push the big gate shut, and man the walls. Ben pointed out, rightly, Rachel said, that there was no time, and their [...] "course was decided." [...] He told her, [...] "run little Rachel, for your life and your unborn child, run now and fast!" [...] She said he then <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and went back outside. She recounted how Silas told her to watch the front gate, after Benjamin had gone out to talk to the Indians the second time, when she herself wanted to flee, while he ran for his musket and powder pouch. “They will kill Benjamin,” she reported her Uncle Silas saying, “and then me, but I will do for at least one of them, by God.” At that moment, she said she heard whooping outside the fort, and then Indians were inside.|$|E
40|$|Asthma {{cannot be}} cured, {{but it can}} be managed. Asthma {{management}} is a public health issue that is complex. Medication, asthma triggers, age, and the environment are all factors that impact asthma management. There is a gap in research in terms of what lifestyle characteristics need to be in place in order for adults to manage asthma. Shaw found that posture care is a lifestyle variable that should be explored as it relates to asthma management in older adults. The Life University Clinic (Marietta, GA) sees asthmatic patients daily and teaches them about a posture care routine through a program called <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up.</b> Based on the health belief model, this study explored how the <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up</b> routine exercises impacted asthma management in adult asthmatic patients with severe asthma (n = 304). Ordinal regression and logistic regression was used to analyze the relationships between using the <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up</b> posture exercises (independent variable) for 3 months with 3 dependent variables: patients 2 ̆ 7 sleep patterns (night time awakenings due to asthma), use of quick relief medication, and hospitalizations (ER Visits) due to asthma. <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up</b> posture exercises reduced night time sleep interruptions, but not hospitalizations due to asthma or the use of quick relief medications. For persons with asthma, <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up</b> could be an additional tool to manage their asthma and reduce the known impacts of sleep deprivation including accidents, memory loss, and heart disease. For organizations who serve asthmatics, <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up</b> could be an additional resource to share with the population they serve. As a result of this study, <b>Straighten</b> <b>Up</b> exercises are recommended for adult asthmatics with severe asthma as part of their asthma management plan...|$|R
