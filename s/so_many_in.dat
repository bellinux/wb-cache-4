However, the predominant political movement in the Valley of Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir National Conference) was secular and was allied with the Indian National Congress since the 1930s. <b>So</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> India too had expectations that Kashmir would join India.

500|$|For {{almost a}} century, Compsognathus longipes {{was the only}} {{well-known}} small theropod species. This led to comparisons with Archaeopteryx and to suggestions of an especially close relationship with birds. In fact, Compsognathus, rather than Archaeopteryx, piqued Huxley's interest in the origin of birds. The two animals share similarities in shape and proportions, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> fact that two specimens of Archaeopteryx, the [...] "Eichstätt" [...] and the [...] "Solnhofen", were for a time misidentified as those of Compsognathus.

500|$|Likewise {{a number}} of English words have been {{borrowed}} from Nahuatl through Spanish. Two {{of the most prominent}} are undoubtedly chocolate and tomato (from Nahuatl tomatl). Other common words such as coyote (from Nahuatl coyotl), avocado (from Nahuatl ahuacatl) and chile or chili (from Nahuatl chilli). The word chicle is also derived from Nahuatl tzictli [...] "sticky stuff, chicle". Some other English words from Nahuatl are: Aztec (from aztecatl); cacao (from Nahuatl cacahuatl 'shell, rind'); ocelot (from ocelotl). In Mexico many words for common everyday concepts attest to the close contact between Spanish and Nahuatl, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> fact that entire dictionaries of [...] "mexicanismos" [...] (words particular to Mexican Spanish) have been published tracing Nahuatl etymologies, as well as Spanish words with origins in other indigenous languages.

500|$|On his death, Glyn Daniel {{described}} Lethbridge as [...] "a colourful, stimulating, {{provocative and}} often controversial figure in British archaeology", who represented [...] "one {{of the last}} of that invaluable band of dilettante scholars and devoted amateurs of whom we have had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> Britain". Although stating that Lethbridge only emerged as a [...] "semi-professional" [...] for a [...] "short time", he praised much of Lethbridge's writing for its [...] "freshness and an eager restless sense of enquiry". An anonymously authored obituary in The Antiquaries Journal referred to [...] "the strength and honesty of Lethbridge's character as a man, and the singleness of purpose that united all his work, as experimental testing of what he found by observation", seeing these as the unifying characteristics behind his divergent research interests. According to the historian Ronald Hutton, as a result of both his unorthodox ideas and his [...] "contempt for professionalism in all fields", Lethbridge's [...] "status as a scholar never really rose above that of an unusually lively local antiquary". His books continue to be largely ignored by academics into the 21st century.|$|E

Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging.

She had no friends. But she never resisted, she was obedient. Being protective, my father earned the reputation of being domineering". Dilip Kumar added: [...] "She was extremely popular... and I think the only star for whom people thronged outside the gates. Very often when shooting was over, there’d be a vast crowd standing at the gates just to have a look at Madhu... It wasn’t so for anyone else. That was her personal effect on fans. Her personality was vivacious." [...] But, [...] "She was aware of her beauty," [...] reminisces B. K. Karanjia, former Filmfare editor and a close friend of both Madhubala and her father, [...] "and because there were <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> love with her, she used to play one against the other.
