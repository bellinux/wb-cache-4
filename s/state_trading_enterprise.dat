While the use of state trading was modified by China's accession to the WTO, it remains a dominant feature for some commodities, even though there have been recent attempts to diminish its importance. In this article, we review the role that the <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprise</b> (STE), China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Company (COFCO), continues to play in the importing and exporting of some agricultural commodities. We then review the economic theory that has been developed to measure the tariff equivalent of importing STEs. Finally, we apply that theory through a calibration exercise to measure the tariff equivalent of COFCO in China's import market for wheat.

40|$|This study tested if the {{exclusive}} procuring and pricing policies of two <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises</b> (STEs) in international malting barley markets {{could be used}} in a strategic trade context. The research provided four key findings. First, the global malting barley market operated in a quantity-setting oligopolistic structure during the study years. Second, both STEs and other exporting countries were in Cournot competition and thus made available strategic trade possibilities. Third, initial commodity payments were too high to generate a rent-shifting outcome. Fourth, product differentiation was confirmed, which may have dampened the desire/ability of STEs to pursue a rent-shifting objective. Key words: market structure, product differentiation, <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises.</b> As early as 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and <b>Trade</b> (GATT) acknowledged <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises</b> (STEs) as legiti-mate participants in international trade.

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier tariff rate import quota system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the <b>State</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Enterprise,</b> the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the tariff quota system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the tariff quota (the in-quota tariff versus the out-of-quota tariff versus the quota) and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. tariff rate quota, strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|E

I provide an overview of recent economic literature on <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises</b> (STEs) and examine the WTO’s approach to regulating the behaviour of STEs. The Canada-Wheat panel was the first WTO panel to consider Canada’s single-desk marketing system for Western Canadian wheat and barley and was the first test of the WTO’s regulation of STEs under GATT Article XVII. The panel rejected the American argument, opting for a line of reasoning that highlights the rules of non-discrimination while maintaining some of the ambiguity of Article XVII. I conclude by examining the competitive pressures that exacerbate trade frictions between North American wheat producers. From a legal perspective, this panel decision is significant because it clarifies the WTO’s position on STEs, to a certain extent. In the context of continental politics, however, the ruling will likely have little impact on Canada/U. S. trade relations because it must be analyzed in relation to the domestic demands that arise from ongoing structural adjustment in both nations’ agricultural sectors. agricultural exports, Canadian Wheat Board, dispute settlement, <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises,</b> World <b>Trade</b> Organization, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade, Political Economy,...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the market structure of the differentiated world malting barley market in which two STEs (the Canadian Wheat Board and the Australian Barley Board) maintain jointly a very large share of the export market. In particular, this study focuses on the exclusive procuring and pricing policies used by both STEs to test if these intra-country mechanisms can generate leadership and shift rent from other exporting countries. A conceptual and empirical framework is also provided to test if STEs set their initial payments at optimal levels. The study suggests that two STEs and other exporting countries were in Cournot competition. While some distortionary impacts from the STE prepayment systems are possible, it does not appear to be a tool that either STE employs. Empirical results from the precommitment stage show that the two STEs did not set their initial payments low enough to maximize their profits. malting barley, market structure, prepayment system, product differentiation, rent shifting, <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises</b> (STEs). ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to empirically examine the impacts that the presence of a <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprise</b> (STE) has in the international wheat market. There are numerous types of STEs that function in different ways to achieve many different types of policy objectives which are often unique to a particular STE. Although the existence of a STE is justified by the countries involved using numerous policy rationales, the fear that they are used as a front for trade protectionism is a prevalent concern. One specific aspect of a STE that often brings this concern to the forefront {{is whether or not the}} STE has the exclusive privilege of monopoly status. The empirical objective of this thesis was to determine specifically if the use of a STE exporter has had a positive impact on world wheat trade over the 1970 – 2005 period and if the use of a STE importer has had a negative impact. In addition, the marginal impact of the STE having monopoly status was tested. In all cases, the designation of STEs and their monopoly status is based on WTO notification documentations. To secure econometrically robust results, a modified conventional gravity model was chosen. This model was estimated using pooled OLS and fixed effects, the latter consisting of both time and country pair fixed effects. The data that was constructed was a large panel data set of bilateral wheat trade spanning from 1970 to 2005. The model was also tested on a number of subsamples representing countries at different stages of development and in different income categories to isolate potential differences in STEs objectives and impacts. In virtually all models, the presence of a STE exporter had a strongly significant and positive effect on the value and volume of wheat exports from the country with the STE exporter.

U. S. grain producers could benefit from {{the removal of the}} CWB as the United States could become more competitive in export markets. However, elimination of the CWB could also result in an increase in Canadian wheat exports to the United States as Canadian producers near the border could sell directly to the United States to take advantage of market opportunities. The net effect is difficult to quantify. The net benefits may be significant in the short run, but reduced significantly in the long run. Similarly, if Canada reforms its wheat board by eliminating trade-distorting subsidies, the United States may increase its exports and Canadian exports to the United States may increase. The net benefits from reforming the CWB could be greater than those from eliminating it. However, the United States could benefit the most from complete elimination of <b>state</b> <b>trading</b> <b>enterprises</b> (STEs), since they have elements distorting trade flows and the United States competes with several STEs in the world wheat market.
