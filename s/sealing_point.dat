40|$|A {{dual stage}} seat valve head {{arrangement}} is described {{which consists of}} a primary <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> located between a fixed orifice seat and a valve poppet, and a secondary <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> between an orifice poppet and a valve poppet. Upstream of the valve orifice is a flexible, convoluted metal diaphragm attached to the orifice poppet. Downstream of the valve orifice, a finger spring exerts a force against the valve poppet, tending to keep the valve in a closed position. The series arrangement of a double seat and poppet is able to tolerate small particle contamination while minimizing chatter by controlling throttling or metering across the secondary seat, thus preserving the primary sealing surface...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{work on a}} new glass-ceramic/alloy for {{pyrotechnic}} components is discussed. A {{newly developed}} family of austenitic stainless steels has been hermetically sealed to a widely used lithia-alumina-silica (LAS) glass-ceramic. These alloys, originally developed for high oxidation resistance, contain 4 - 5 wt% Al. The presence of Al offers several advantages from a glass or glass/ceramic <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> of view: presence of a tenacious, stable oxide (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) on the alloys` surface {{as well as the}} fact that they can be strengthened during sealing via precipitation of a secondary phase, NiAl. In addition these new alloys offer lower material and machining costs and improved weldability compared to the widely used Ni-base superalloys...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of {{completion}} of an ultra-deep well newly drilled in the Yuanba Gasfield, Sichuan Basin, long-section and large-scale deformation occurred in the heavy casing section and nickel base alloy casing section of the sealing Triassic limestone interval, so a new hole had to be sidetracked, which impels us to rediscover the applicability of conventional drilling and completion technology in ultra-deep wells. In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: ① when downhole sealing casing operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or perforated hole, the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; ② the downhole <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the <b>sealing</b> <b>point</b> had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical bridge plug. This paper finally points out that good cementing quality {{plays an important role in}} preventing this type of casing deformation...|$|E

40|$|Percolation is {{a concept}} widely used in many fields of {{research}} and refers to the propagation of substances through porous media (e. g., coffee filtering), or the behaviour of complex networks (e. g., spreading of diseases). Percolation theory asserts that most percolative processes are universal, that is, the emergent powerlaws only depend on the general, statistical features of the macroscopic system, but not on specific details of the random realisation. In contrast, our computer simulations of the leakage through a seal [...] -applying common assumptions of elasticity, contact mechanics, and fluid dynamics [...] -show that the critical behaviour (how the flow ceases near the <b>sealing</b> <b>point)</b> solely depends on the microscopic details of the last constriction. It appears fundamentally impossible to accurately predict from statistical properties of the surfaces alone how strongly we have to tighten a water tap to make it stop dripping and also how it starts dripping once we loosen it again.

Body color is whiter and {{brighter}} than on a seal-point cat. One distinction between the chocolate <b>point</b> and <b>seal</b> <b>point</b> is the color of their paw pads.

40|$|During cuffed intubation, {{damage to}} the trachea is least likely when the lateral wall {{pressure}} exerted by the cuff does not exceed the mean capillary perfusion pressure of the mucosa. A study was carried out of eight different types of endotracheal tubes. At the <b>seal</b> <b>point</b> the traditional red rubber tube and the armoured latex and Softway tubes exerted pressures above the mean systemic arterial pressure. Although the Portex and Mallinckrodt tubes exerted pressures close to the mean capillary perfusion pressure, much higher pressures resulted if they were overinflated. The Lanz tube, however, with its over-pressure safety balloon, maintained a lateral wall pressure below the mean capillary perfusion pressure even when inflated considerably beyond the <b>seal</b> <b>point.</b> Endotracheal cuffs are often overinflated in clinical practice. Since cuff-induced tracheal damage is most influenced by the lateral wall pressure, {{these results suggest that}} the use of Lanz-type tubes should be mandatory in intensive care units or when a cuffed tracheostomy tube is required and they should also be considered for use in more routine anaesthetic practice...|$|R
