5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Hughes, in a {{short story}} {{published}} in 1864, described a fictional game of Forfeits involving the song: A cry for forfeits arose. So the party sat down round Mabel on benches brought {{out from under the}} table, and Mabel began, --The first day of Christmas my true love <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> a partridge and a pear-tree;The second day of Christmas my true love <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The third day of Christmas my true love <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> three fat hens, two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The fourth day of Christmas my true love <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> four ducks quacking, three fat hens, two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The fifth day of Christmas my true love <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> five hares running, four ducks quacking, three fat hens, two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree.And so on. Each day was taken up and repeated all round; and for every breakdown (except by little Maggie, who struggled with desperately earnest round eyes to follow the rest correctly, but with very comical results), the player who made the slip was duly noted down by Mabel for a forfeit.|$|R

25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a script.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E
25|$|When General Bell first <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to}} the perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, {{his mother}} {{died at the age}} of 43. The {{following}} year, Pacino's grandfather James Gerardi, also died.

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> through the scripts and stuff, they <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|In early January 1942, the Dinara Division {{was formed}} after Đujić was {{contacted}} by the Chetnik supreme commander Mihailović, via a courier. The Chetnik commander Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin {{played a central role}} in organizing the units of Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia, Lika, and northern Dalmatia into the Dinara Division and dispatched former Royal Yugoslav Army officers to help. Đujić was designated the commander of the division with a goal of the [...] "establishment of a Serb national state" [...] in which [...] "an exclusively Orthodox population is to live". Đujić says the Dinara Division was [...] "under Draža's command, but we received news and supplies for our struggle from Ljotić and [...] Nedić. [...] Nedić's couriers reached me in Dinara and mine reached him in Belgrade. He <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> military uniforms for the guardists of the Dinara Chetnik Division; he <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> ten million dinars to obtain for the fighters whatever was needed and whatever could be obtained." ...|$|E

At performances of the oratorio [...] "Ruth" [...] he would sing (an octave down) the Alto aria [...] "I went out full, and the Lord hath <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> home again empty".

500|$|Narendranath was {{interested}} spiritually {{from a young}} age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Naren was naughty and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, [...] "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> one of his ghosts".|$|E
500|$|To me it wasn't a {{song about}} romance, it was about me and Jim Steinman. We'd had a load of {{problems}} with managers in the early '80s {{and all of a}} sudden after five years we started to communicate. After I'd been to his house, he <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the song, and it was [...] "It's All Coming Back To Me Now". Not the line 'When you kiss me like that', but the emotional connection. It doesn't have to be literal.|$|E

He was quoted in Kerrang! in 1984 as saying, [...] "I looked at the cover and puked." [...] In an interview supporting Deep Purple's reformation in 1984, he stated of Born Again, [...] "They had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a box of records. And, when I saw the cover, and heard the mix, I smashed {{every single one of}} them to pieces." ...|$|E

500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

500|$|Moore {{considered}} {{the writing of}} Blood to be harder compared to previous OSI albums. Previously, Matheos would send Moore guitar parts to work with, allowing Moore to [...] "work with editing them, pitching them, and fucking about them different ways, and then programming drums and keyboards." [...] When working on Blood, Matheos also provided programming, keyboard and drum parts. [...] "If he <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts, and it wasn't a complete idea, I {{had to figure out}} a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there," [...] Moore said.
