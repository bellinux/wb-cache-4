50|$|Tethers may break {{by various}} means; if a tether is a signal, then {{interruption}} by signal barriers breaks the tether. If the tether is a cord or rope, then upon reaching the breaking {{strength of the}} tether, the tether fails in its function. Failure modes for tethers are considered when designing arrangements where a tether is needed. When a tether or line breaks suddenly, backlash of the segments may cause severe damage or loss of life. Safety links are sometimes used to prevent excessive tension in a tether involved in towing objects or persons, like in the towing of sailplanes; the <b>safety</b> <b>link</b> in a tether is thus a tether itself.|$|E

Rather than continue to attack the defenseless opponent, however, the Rose family pitted Bulldog Breed 3 to spare it damage from the house robots, and Hypno-Disc was put through to the Series Semi-Finals once more.

This action would not only disconnect the cage from the winding rope but also prevent the cage from falling back down the shaft. The device was patented in 1867 and is manufactured today. It is believed that the lives of many miners have been saved by its use and it has never failed in service.|$|E

40|$|Safety {{management}} in the supply chain is an interesting topic. The existence of unexpected supply chain events makes supply chain decision making difficult. To improve their response to unexpected events such as natural disasters or workplace accidents, managers are beginning to examine the link between information technology (IT) and safety in the supply chain. This dissertation examines the IT and <b>safety</b> <b>link</b> in three main ways. First, in the chapter entitled, "IT Investment and Safety: An Examination of The Impact of Information Technology on Safety Performance in a High Reliability Organization," drawing upon the work of Bharadwaj (2000), a theoretical model that links a firm's investment in IT resources to safety is developed. This model is empirically tested. A key finding is that physical IT resources, human IT resources, and growth in IT resources do contribute to safety performance. The second way that the IT and <b>safety</b> <b>link</b> is examined is through a U. S. Department of Transportation sponsored survey. In the chapter entitled, "Technology Adoption Patterns in the U. S. Motor Carrier Industry," a national survey is conducted to examine the safety technology adoption practices of larger trucking firms. The survey consists of twenty-six leading-edge safety technologies. A key finding is that larger trucking firms and firms that travel long distances are leaders in IT investment. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm (RBV), the third way that the IT and <b>safety</b> <b>link</b> is examined is in the chapter entitled "Driving for Safety: An Examination of Safety Technology Adoption and Firm Safety Performance in the U. S. Motor Carrier Industry. " The RBV framework describes how a firm's internal resources {{may be used to}} improve firm performance. Based on an over 50 % survey response rate, a key finding is that safety technology resources do contribute to safety performance. It is also discovered that if the firm's top management team is knowledgeable about safety technology practices, the effect of safety technology resources on safety performance increases. Similarly, if the firm's IT staff has technology project management skills, the effect of safety technology resources on safety performance increases...|$|E

When viewing the terrain they were observed deficiencies: considerable areas of poorly maintained cycling carriageway area degraded or insufficient transparency of the crossing of bike routes and paths through the roads and in the integration of bicycle lanes on the carriageway, together with other motorized traffic.

In order to predict and identify hazardous weather (e. g. in view of aviation <b>safety)</b> <b>linked</b> to MCS, numerical weather forecast and active/passive remote sensing products are currently the most useful tools. A major obstacle to increasing the accuracy of those tools {{is the fact that}} cumulonimbus clouds in MCS are composed of liquid droplets and ice hydrometeors (ice crystals); the latter have complex shapes based on diffusional growth, aggregation, and riming, which complicates the interpretation of remote sensing products and increases the uncertainties in numerical weather forecast. In this context, the study presented here investigates the properties of ice hydrometeors in MCS as a function of temperature and horizontal distance from the convective core. For this purpose, ice hydrometeor images, bulk TWC, and simultaneously measured radar reflectivity factors from three airborne campaigns in tropical MCS have been used. The underlying scope of producing these results is to improve the retrieval of MCS microphysical properties from satellite products and also improve cloud parameterizations in numerical weather prediction models...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacies {{permeate}} and interconnect various actions {{developed in}} different sectors within the complex {{process of the}} use of drugs in a hospital. Dispensing failures mean that a breach has occurred in one of the last <b>safety</b> <b>links</b> in the use of drugs. Although most failures do not harm patients, their existence suggests fragility in the process and indicates an increased risk of severe accidents. Present concepts on drug-related incidents may be classified as side effects, adverse effects, and medication errors. Among these are dispensing errors, usually associated with poor safety and inefficient dispensing systems. Factors associated with dispensing errors may be communication failures, problems related to package labels, work overload, the physical structure of the working environment, distraction and interruption, the use of incorrect and outdated information sources and the lack of patient knowledge and education about the drugs they use. So called banal dispensing errors reach significant epidemiological levels.

40|$|Soil is, {{due to its}} heterogeneity, the {{beholder}} of life, particularly microscopy life in all its diversity. Hence, the quality of soil must {{be defined as the}} capacity of the matrix to support current forms of life and be a site of genomic new life. Two lines of actions are suggested. First, communication about soil to the public must focus on the various roles of soil. This way, the general public must become much more aware of the intrinsic value of soil. Secondly policy making about soil should take the full biological diversity into account, without becoming 'ecotopia'. It is proposed that time has come to establish sites where soils, both natural and man-made, are preserved as a genuine patrimony. It is also argued that we should steer away from practices such as landfilling and vaguely defined 'natural attenuation' approaches.
