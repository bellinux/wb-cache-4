50|$|A {{central figure}} in Romanian {{literature}} {{for much of his}} life, Bogza took special interest in the works of other writers, and contributed to establishing their reputation. During his early period at Urmuz, he actively encouraged various avant-garde trends, and his eclectic interests, as well as his calls to intellectual rebellion {{played an important role in}} <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and activity of both Constructivists and Surrealists. Among the most noted writers whom he aided to express themselves freely were his co-contributors Tristan Tzara, Stephan Roll and Ilarie Voronca, and he was also noted for being the first to publish Urmuz's Fuchsiada (a few years after its author committed suicide). Max Blecher also expressed gratitude to Geo and Ecaterina Bogza for helping him complete and publish Întâmplări din irealitatea imediată.|$|E

5000|$|Elgar was not {{the first}} {{composer}} to think about setting John Henry Newman's poem [...] "The Dream of Gerontius". Dvořák had considered it fifteen years earlier, and had discussions with Newman, before abandoning the idea. Elgar knew the poem well; he had owned a copy since at least 1885, and in 1889 he was given another copy as a wedding present. This copy contained handwritten copies of extensive notes that had been made by General Gordon, and Elgar is known to have thought of the text in musical terms for several years. Throughout the 1890s, Elgar had composed several large-scale works for the regular festivals that were a key part of Britain's musical life. In 1898, based on his growing reputation, he was asked to write a major work for the 1900 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. He was unable to start work on the poem that he knew so well until the autumn of 1899, and did so only after first considering a different subject.Composition proceeded quickly. Elgar and August Jaeger, his editor at the publisher Novello, exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters, which show how Jaeger helped in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment. By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master and his replacement by an elderly musician who found the music beyond him. The conductor of the premiere, Hans Richter, received a copy of the full score only {{on the eve of the}} first orchestral rehearsal. The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene. The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice. Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, [...] "I have allowed my heart to open once - it is now shut against every religious feeling & every soft, gentle impulse for ever." [...] However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in Britain once it had had its first London performance in 1903, at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.|$|E
40|$|Using {{cultivation}} theory, this {{qualitative study}} analyzed {{the influence of}} television in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> ethic {{among members of the}} baby boom generation. It also probed the role of social, cultural and historical events, as well as personal experience, in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> ethic and career paths. The results showed some cultivation effects, particularly in the definitions respondents held of the work ethic, and in feelings of low self worth during periods of unemployment. The study also found a strong cultivation effect in the childhood occupational dreams respondents had. The study found limited resonance effects based on the impact of the social upheaval televised in the 1960 s and 1970 s, but did find mainstreamed memories of those events, based on images broadcast on TV. Other findings included some conflicted feelings about the role of education in career success, and fairly consistent feelings of job insecurity and disappointment with retirement benefits...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses micro {{data from}} the Brazilian PNAD between 1981 and 2002 to {{ascertain}} the role that local labor demand – proxied by male adult employment {{in the area of}} residence - plays in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and schooling decisions of children aged 10 - 15. Contrary to the widespread view that child labor is procyclical, we find evidence that employment (schooling) falls (increases) among young children (aged 10 - 12) when local labor demand is stronger. This result is consistent with the view that children's work is to a large extent the result of poverty, and that parents want to protect their children from child labor and do so if offered the opportunity. ...|$|E

40|$|This study explores a {{specific}} {{way of thinking about}} history and its use: the idea of history as magistra vitae. It aims to uncover the previously underexplored influence that an emulative understanding of ancient history had in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of certain key modem political thinkers. Its specific focus is, however, narrower: the lessons from history centred on the individual, and only those: examples which further greatness. For authors adopting such an idea of history, the emulation of great examples from the past is taken as the key to the conduct of one's own life and, more importantly, as indispensable for men who lead a vita activa. The main interest of this work is turned towards the view of history as an inducement for action: as a stimulus to strive for a vita activa of great political accomplishments, providing the reader also with a lesson about how to achieve them.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the professional development}} of L 1 and L 2 teachers from a comprehensive theoretical perspective that focuses on literacy as a critical social practice, the construction of student/teacher knowledge, and institutional forces that support and/or constrain the academic literacy development of L 2 students in the United States. The authors begin with an articulation of the theoretical framework guiding this discussion. Next, they describe how this perspective was enacted in a graduate program designed to support K- 12 teachers in developing an understanding of theories, research, and practices that form a critical approach to L 2 academic literacy development. Last, following Hyland (2003, 2007), the authors reflect on the challenges, and ultimately the necessity, of critically reconceptualizing L 1 and L 2 teacher education to include greater attention to genre theory and genre-based pedagogies. This call for a reconceptualization of teacher education in the United States is warranted because of the combined impact of economic, demographic, and educational policies <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of teachers and the literacy practices of L 2 students...|$|E
40|$|Screenwriting as a {{research}} practice is rapidly emerging in the academy, extending {{the boundaries of the}} discipline beyond its history in vocational training. Offering a space in which new and established practitioners can incubate ideas and processes in ways that might otherwise not be possible - particularly in mainstream industry contexts, where writing can often be in service of production - {{a research}} environment offers academic stimulation that encourages innovative methodologies of creative practice to develop. In this way, the screenwriter becomes a practitioner- researcher who, through deep reflection on previous works and experiences and creative-critical engagement with new ideas and concepts, is able to develop new screenplays that are writer- and research-oriented. In this paper we discuss the role that academic research can play in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the screenwriter. Through personal case studies and reflections, we explore how practice can be rewritten, remade and rediscovered in the academy. There has been very little written about the phenomenon of screenwriting {{as a research}} practice, therefore we hope this paper will contribute important and timely insights into this emergent discipline...|$|E
40|$|If we think, for a moment, {{of screen}} {{producers}} as being like publishers, {{in the sense}} that they bring to the attention of publics the work of other creative authors, whether or not they play an active creative role in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> And if we consider that producers, like publishers may operate as a one-person firm or occupy a highly specialised position within a large institution, then we can easily see how similar the complex of values and forces and structures that condition the work of the publisher are to those that condition the work of the producer. They are both operating within a specific field which is part of the larger field of cultural production, a field which deals in the production and exchange of symbolic objects which, while exchangeable for material value, cannot be reduced to a material process. Similarly they are both practices which involve a high degree of implicit as well as explicit knowledge {{in the sense that}} both require the exercise of sophisticated social and cultural perceptions and values in order to successfully identify what is called ‘talent’, to distinguish betwee...|$|E

The second half then turns to identify the appropriate strategy for this crucial new phase of work, arcicIII (2011 -present). Throughout the essay clear recognition is given to the fact that arcicIII is operating in a very different ecumenical context and in relation to a different set of challenges to those which prevailed when the classical arcic strategy was devised and as such requires a fresh strategic approach. The approach to contemporary ecumenical engagement and learning known as Receptive Ecumenism is presented here as providing this needed fresh strategy...|$|E
40|$|Research {{that focuses}} on people’s work values {{generally}} considers how values are related to affective and behavioural outcomes. Values research often includes how people’s own work values fit with the values of their group, their manager or their organisation. Practitioners often focus on how to influence people’s values {{in an effort to}} capture the benefits of linking people’s values with outcomes, or reap the reported advantages of having groups of people with congruent values. A question not often considered is the ethical implications of influencing people’s work values. Values are people’s core beliefs about what is important. They shape their understanding of work and how they interact with other people. In posing this question we consider the impact of trying to shape different people’s values and the impact that this may have on individuals and the community more broadly. We ask the question of what responsibility do employers have in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> values of people who will in all likelihood move through a number of positions in their working life.
