25|$|Cabooses {{were used}} on every freight train until the 1980s, when safety laws {{requiring}} {{the presence of}} cabooses and full crews were relaxed. Developments in monitoring and <b>safety</b> <b>technology</b> such as lineside defect detectors and End of Train Device resulted in crew reductions and the phasing out of caboose cars. Nowadays, they are generally only used on rail maintenance or hazardous materials trains, or on heritage and tourist railroads.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Proton has {{announced}} their partnership with LG Electronics {{in the development}} of autonomous <b>safety</b> <b>technology.</b> In September 2014, Proton previewed an Iriz prototype with LG's Advanced Drive Assistance System (ADAS). With the LG ADAS implementation, new autonomous safety features like Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Cross Traffic Assist (CTA), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) and High Beam Assist (HBA) can be incorporated into Proton's future offerings. The inclusion of autonomous safety features has become a necessary prerequisite for a full 5-Star Euro NCAP and ANCAP rating.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} {{emphasize that}} the system is not a performance enhancement nor a replacement for safe driving practices, but rather a <b>safety</b> <b>technology</b> to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe hydroplaning scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be in contact with the road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is {{a process}} used to {{evaluate}} the clinical effectiveness and costeffectiveness of health technologies by a systematic review of clinical, economic, and utilization research. Despite widespread investment in patient <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> in the U. K., U. S., and elsewhere, little HTA has been done to establish the clinical or cost-effectiveness of these technologies. The HTA and patient safety literature suggests there are four categories of patient safety HTA, including HTA for existing <b>safety</b> <b>technologies,</b> underutilized <b>safety</b> <b>technologies,</b> emerging <b>safety</b> <b>technologies,</b> as well as <b>safety</b> aspects of <b>technologies</b> with a non-safety primary purpose. Recent HTA and other research, including a 2002 evidencebased evaluation of patient <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> from the U. S. Agency for Health Research and Quality, provide an important foundation for a more comprehensive approach to patient safety HTA. However, HTA programs must address prioritization, methodology, and dissemination challenges introduced by patient <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> before significant progress can Te made...|$|R
40|$|New vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> {{continue}} to be developed. This report aims to assess the future impact of light vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> in Australia over the next 30 years. This report includes a literature review, consultation with experts regarding the possible trend in injury reduction over the next 30 years from AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) and V 2 V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication). The experts suggested {{that the most important}} emerging vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> are primary <b>safety</b> systems that provide increasing levels of autonomy, driver warnings and driver monitoring. AEB was consistently identified as having the most potential in the near future, and this was confirmed in the review of literature. Results demonstrated the importance of introducing new <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> as early and as quickly as possible. The experts suggested this could be achieved through mandating the installation of <b>safety</b> <b>technologies,</b> reducing insurance premiums for vehicles with <b>safety</b> <b>technologies,</b> and encouraging their uptake through consumer information and new vehicle assessment programs.

2500|$|Until the 1980s, {{laws in the}} United States and Canada {{required}} all freight {{trains to}} have a caboose and a full crew, for <b>safety.</b> <b>Technology</b> eventually advanced such that the railroads, {{in an effort to}} save money and reduce crew members, stated that a caboose was unnecessary, since bearings were improved and lineside detectors were used to detect hot boxes, and better-designed cars avoided problems with the loads. The railroads also claimed a caboose was also a dangerous place, as slack run-ins could hurl the crew from their places and even dislodge weighty equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Current active <b>safety</b> <b>{{technology}}</b> {{relies on}} vehicle-based radar and vision systems. [...] For example, this technology can reduce rear-end collisions by tracking obstructions in front or behind the vehicle, automatically applying brakes when needed. This technology is somewhat limited {{in that it}} senses only the distance and speed of vehicles within the direct line of sight of cameras and the sensing range of radars. It is almost completely ineffective for angled and left-turn collisions [...] It may even cause a motorist to lose control of the vehicle {{in the event of}} an impending head-on collision. [...] The rear-end collisions covered by today's technology are typically less severe than angle, left-turn, or head-on collisions. Existing technology is therefore inadequate for the overall needs of the roadway system.|$|E

40|$|How {{should we}} {{evaluate}} the welfare implications of improvements to <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> {{in the presence}} of offsetting behavior?

For mandatory <b>safety</b> <b>technologies,</b> the direction of the welfare effect depends on whether the externality between players is positive or negative, and on whether the improved technology increases the individually optimal activity level, taking the activity of other players as given. For <b>safety</b> <b>technologies</b> that individuals can choose whether to employ, we show that an individual will generally expend too much on reducing the size of loss but, depending on conditions that we specify, either {{too much or too little}} on features that reduce the individual's probability of loss...|$|R
