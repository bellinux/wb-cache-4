500|$|A {{team lead}} by Johannes Krause managed the first {{reliable}} sequencing of the genomes of 90 mummified individuals in 2017. Whilst not conclusive, {{because of the}} non-exhaustive time frame and restricted location that the mummies represent, their study nevertheless showed that these ancient Egyptians [...] "closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations, {{especially those in the}} Levant, and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa. What's more, the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers—including Nubians, Greeks, and Romans—conquered the empire." [...] Later, however, <b>something</b> <b>did</b> alter the genomes of Egyptians. Some 15% to 20% of modern Egyptians’ DNA reflects sub-Saharan ancestry, but the ancient mummies had only 6-15% sub-Saharan DNA.|$|E
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{described}} the premise as the traditional 'Doctor Who' thing of taking something omnipresent {{in your life}} and making it sinister, if <b>something</b> <b>did</b> get in the Wi-Fi, we'd be kind of screwed. Nobody had really done it before, so I thought, 'It's time to get kids frightened of Wi-Fi!' [...] However, he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology, but rather tell an adventure story about a [...] "new way [...] to invade" [...] based on something viewers were familiar with. Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E

500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that <b>something</b> <b>did</b> go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but those who read ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin." ...|$|E
500|$|After announcing {{he would}} not run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Gore {{endorsed}} Vermont governor Howard Dean in December 2003, weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. He was criticized for this endorsement by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate Joe Lieberman (Gore preferred Dean over Lieberman because Lieberman supported the Iraq War and Gore did not). Dean's campaign soon became a target of attacks and eventually failed, with Gore's early endorsement being credited as a factor. In The New York Times, Dean stated: [...] "I actually do think the endorsement of Al Gore began the decline." [...] The Times further noted that [...] "Dean instantly amplified his statement {{to indicate that the}} endorsement from Mr. Gore, a powerhouse of the establishment, so threatened the other Democratic candidates that they began the attacks on his candidacy that helped derail it." [...] Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, also stated that after Gore's endorsement of Dean, [...] "alarm bells went off in every newsroom in the country, in every other campaign in the country", indicating that if <b>something</b> <b>did</b> not change, Dean would be the nominee. Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6 million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid. Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{versions}} of why Horne ended the hunger strike. Mann writes that Horne called it off without explanation two days after being moved back to prison, and was promptly returned to the hospital. The media reported that a Labour MP had arranged for Michael Banner, {{the chair of the}} Animal Procedures Committee, to agree to attend a meeting with Ian Cawsey, head of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Animal Welfare, to discuss animal testing practices in the UK. This was interpreted by Horne as a concession {{on the part of the}} government, and he agreed to start eating again on 13 December 1998. His friends suspect that something happened to him during the two days he was back in Full Sutton out of contact with them. Mann writes: [...] "Whatever happened to him between leaving the hospital and returning to prison may never be known, but all those close to him suspect <b>something</b> <b>did</b> and he was never the same again." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{included}} a rigid {{adherence to the}} protocol of the test, so that the subjects {{would not be allowed}} to change it in the midst of the run. This had been the modus operandi of Uri Geller while being tested at Stanford Research Institute; whenever <b>something</b> <b>did</b> not work, he simply did something else instead. The researchers then reported this as a success, when in fact the original test had failed. Other suggestions included having only one object of study at any time, permanently marking the object or objects used so they could not be switched, and having as few people in the room as possible to avoid distractions. Randi also offered his services to watch the experiments as a control, noting that a conjurer would be an excellent person to look for fakery. Phillips did not take Randi up on the offer because of the skeptic's reputation of being [...] "a showman rather than an unprejudiced critic" [...] and his perceived hostility towards psychic claimants. In his letters, Randi even told the researchers that the subjects were fake, but the researchers did not check out their backgrounds.|$|E
