5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was <b>sucked</b> through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was <b>sucked</b> through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being <b>sucked</b> through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E

5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is <b>sucked</b> into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is <b>sucked</b> in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
40|$|Nutritive and non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> was {{studied in}} 9 preterm infants with {{postmenstrual}} ages ranging from 28 to 33 weeks and postnatal ages ranging from 0 to 8 weeks. During nutritive <b>sucking,</b> <b>sucking</b> bursts were longer than <b>sucking</b> pauses. During non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> the opposite was seen. The <b>sucking</b> rate was lower during nutritive <b>sucking.</b> During nutritive <b>sucking</b> the respiratory rate was higher during the pauses {{than during the}} bursts. During non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> the respiratory rate was higher during <b>sucking.</b> It is concluded that non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> cannot {{serve as a model}} for studying feeding mechanisms in the preterm infant. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The <b>sucking</b> {{habits of}} infants are {{described}} in the literature as being of two types: non-nutritive and nutritive. Finger <b>sucking,</b> thumb <b>sucking,</b> and <b>sucking</b> on a pacifier (dummy, comforter) are considered non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> habits. Breastfeeding and bottlefeeding are considered nutritive <b>sucking</b> habits.|$|R
30|$|A {{questionnaire}} in {{the form}} of a structured interview was applied with mothers or guardians in order to find out about nutritive <b>sucking</b> habits (breastfeeding and bottlefeeding), non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> habits (pacifiers and finger <b>sucking),</b> and the presence of malocclusions. The data collected included the presence and the duration of non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> habits and, if the child had <b>sucking,</b> any type of non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> habits: pacifier-sucking habit and digit <b>sucking.</b>|$|R

40|$|Nutritive <b>sucking</b> was {{studied in}} 18 preterm infants. Differences in feeding {{efficiency}} {{could not be}} explained by differences in <b>sucking</b> rate. Quick efficient drinking, however, was characterized by long <b>sucking</b> bursts and by {{a large amount of}} milk intake during each <b>sucking</b> movement. Slow inefficient drinking was characterized by short <b>sucking</b> bursts and by a small amount of milk intake during each <b>sucking</b> movement. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Coordinating <b>sucking,</b> {{swallowing}} {{and breathing}} to achieve effective <b>sucking</b> {{is a complex}} process and even though <b>sucking</b> is essential for nutrition, {{little is known about}} sticking patterns after birth. Our objective was to study <b>sucking</b> patterns in healthy fullterm infants and to describe the age-specific variations. Method: We studied the <b>sucking</b> patterns of 30 healthy, fullterm infants longitudinally from 2 or 3 days after birth to 10 weeks of age. During this time we recorded five to seven feeding episodes that we assessed off-line with the Neonatal Oral-Motor Assessment Scale (NOMAS). Results: We found a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern on the second or third day after birth in 27 out of 30 infants. During the following weeks we found abnormal <b>sucking</b> patterns in 23 out of 171 feeding episodes (14 %) and normal patterns in 148 episodes (86 %). Altogether, between 38 and 50 weeks' postmenstrual age (10 weeks after birth), 10 infants displayed a deviating, arrhythmical <b>sucking</b> pattern. Dysfunctional <b>sucking</b> patterns and problems of coordinating <b>sucking,</b> swallowing and breathing did not occur. Birth weight, gestational age, type of labour and gender did not influence <b>sucking</b> patterns. Arrhythmical <b>sucking</b> was seen more often in bottle-fed infants. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that practically all healthy fullterm infants started off with a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern soon after birth. One-third of the infants displayed one or more deviating episodes up to the age of 10 weeks. Apart from bottle-feeding, no other factors were found that influenced <b>sucking</b> patterns.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether the development of <b>sucking</b> patterns in small-for-gestational age (SGA) preterm infants differs from appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) preterm infants. Study design We assessed <b>sucking</b> patterns in 15 SGA and 34 AGA preterms (gestational age Results SGA preterms developed a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern later than did AGA preterms (median, 50 versus 44 weeks PMA, P =. 002). At term-equivalent age, none of the SGA and 38 % of the AGA preterms showed normal <b>sucking</b> (P <. 05); at 48 to 50 weeks PMA this was 54 % and 81 %, respectively (P =. 064). Abnormal <b>sucking</b> including "incoordination'' and dysfunctional <b>sucking</b> were more prevalent in SGA preterms than in AGA preterms (median, 11 % versus 0 % per infant, P <. 05). A higher gestational age and z-score for birth weight were predictive of normal <b>sucking</b> at 50 weeks PMA. Conclusions SGA preterms developed a normal <b>sucking</b> pattern later than AGA preterms.

5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally <b>sucked</b> towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is <b>sucked</b> into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E

40|$|The {{main part}} of this thesis sets out to study the {{sequential}} organisation of <b>sucking</b> during normal breast feeding. Data on breast feeding are scarce {{when compared with the}} large body of work on <b>sucking</b> during bottle feeding. One of the initial outcomes is that on the first breast, as compared with the second, <b>sucking</b> is slower overall. The widely-quoted dichotomy between nutritive and non-nutritive modes of <b>sucking</b> is not upheld. Rather, the organisation of <b>sucking</b> exhibits complete gradation between these two rhythms, and pausing is always a feature of <b>sucking</b> on the breast. <b>Sucking</b> patterns were also seen to change progressively through the feed, and attempts are made to account for these changes using several different approaches. <b>Sucking</b> patterns, in particular <b>sucking</b> rate, during breast feeding appear to be determined largely by the rate of milk flow rather than by the baby's hunger, fatigue or behavioural state, although the concurrent changes in milk composition cannot be ruled out since changes in milk flow and composition on the breast cannot be dissociated. However, the probability of the baby <b>sucking</b> at any one time is less strongly correlated with milk flow rate. An attempt is made to place the findings in their evolutionary and social context...|$|R

40|$|Thumb <b>sucking</b> is {{the process}} of <b>sucking</b> on the thumb for oral pleasure. Thumb and finger <b>sucking</b> habits, or nonnutritive <b>sucking,</b> are {{considered}} to be the most prevalent of oral habits. Some parents are concerned by thumb <b>sucking</b> and may even try to restrain the infant or child. In most cases, this is not necessary. Most children stop thumb <b>sucking</b> on their own. When older children continue to <b>suck</b> their thumbs, it could mean they are bored, anxious, or have emotional problems such as depression. This article presents a case report of a child with Hurler&#x 2032;s syndrome along with thumb sucking/biting habit. Hurler&#x 2032;s syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis I, is a rare condition inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. It represents the classical prototype of mucopolysaccharide disorder.
