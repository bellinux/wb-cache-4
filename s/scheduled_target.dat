30|$|The paper {{proposes a}} demand {{response}} scheme controlling many domestic electric water heaters (DEWHs) {{with a price}} function to consume electric power according to a <b>target</b> <b>schedule.</b> It discusses at length the design of an algorithm to calculate the price function from a <b>target</b> <b>schedule.</b> The price function {{is used by the}} control of each DEWH to automatically and optimally minimize its local heating costs.

It is shown that the algorithm is also applicable to clusters of large numbers of DEWHs with statistical knowledge only.

40|$|Abstract. Much {{work has}} been done to exploit the benefit brought by {{allowing}} job execution on distributed computational resources. Nodes are typically able to share jobs only within the same virtual organization, which is inherently bounded by various reasons such as the adopted information system or other agreed constraints. The problem raised by such limitation is thus related to finding a way to enable interoperation between nodes from different virtual organizations. We introduce a novel technique for integrating visions from both resource users and providers, allowing to serve multiple virtual organizations as a whole. By means of snapshot data stored within each grid node, such as processing and interacting history, we propose a demand-centered heuristic scheduling approach named Critical Friend Community (CFC). To this end, a set of simplified community <b>scheduling</b> <b>targeted</b> algorithms and processing workflows are described. A prototype of our scheduling approach is being implemented within the SmartGRID project...|$|R

Moreover, it categorizes sensors as ‘fat’, ‘healthy’ or ‘thin’ to show the dense, optimal and scattered areas. It can also yield the largest empty area of sensors in the field.
