5|$|In February 2017, {{the main}} and {{emergency}} spillways failed, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam.

5|$|Not {{far from}} Beaverkill Road is {{the east end}} of the <b>spillway</b> road, which was closed as a {{security}} precaution following the September11, 2001 attacks, but reopened after construction of a new alignment of NY28A was completed in 2012. Past the <b>spillway</b> road, NY28A continues east, briefly crossing the Blue Line and leaving Catskill Park as it passes another <b>spillway.</b> At the spillway's southeastern tip is a junction with Stone Church Road, where the route turns back to the north and reenters the park. Now in the town of Hurley, NY28A continues to follow the irregular reservoir shoreline to the northeast, but on a slightly further inland alignment than before. The land here remains wooded, but more frequently broken by houses on the southern side.|$|E
50|$|Open channel <b>spillways</b> are dam <b>spillways</b> that {{utilize the}} {{principles}} of open-channel flow to convey impounded water {{in order to prevent}} dam failure.

40|$|Juveniles {{from most}} fish taxa will pass downstream, over or through <b>spillways,</b> if outlet flow is sufficient. Fish passing over {{relatively}} high <b>spillways</b> may be injured by rapid pressure changes, rapid deceleration, shearing forces, turbulence, abrasion and the striking {{force on the}} water in free fall. Injuries begin to occur when impact velocity of a fish striking a water surface exceeds 16 metres per second. Water below some <b>spillways</b> may become supersaturated with atmospheric gas to an extent that gas-bubble disease in fish may occur. Flow deflectors placed near the base of <b>spillways</b> {{have been successful in}} reducing the deep plunging action which is responsible for air entrainment and subsequent nitrogen supersaturation. <b>Spillways</b> are not currently perceived to be a serious source of fish mortality in Canada, although nitrogen supersaturation below <b>spillways</b> was identified as a potential fish-conservation problem in three rivers in British Columbia.

5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency <b>spillway</b> was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service <b>spillway</b> was completed.

5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks were observed in the dam's structure.

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the <b>spillway</b> tunnels.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and <b>spillway</b> capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Air {{entrainment}} {{plays an}} important role in the reduction of cavitations risk potential in chutes and <b>spillways.</b> The advantages of stepped <b>spillways</b> over conventional smooth <b>spillways,</b> the air entrainment phenomenon, and the flow regimes occurring on stepped chutes have been reviewed.

The numerical computations of air entrainment in the skimming flow over stepped <b>spillways</b> are performed in two stages. In the first stage, the water flow equations are converted to discrete form using the overlapping cell vertex finite volume method on triangular unstructured mesh, and then, in the second stage, the flow field solution results are used for computing air concentration profiles by a separate post-processor. This postprocessor uses experimental relations for computing the inception point characteristics and air concentration distribution profiles along the stepped chute. The computed results of air entrainment into the supercritical skimming flow on stepped <b>spillways</b> have been compared with laboratory experimental measurements...|$|R

5|$|The large <b>spillway</b> tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of {{flooding}} in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached the lip of the emergency <b>spillway</b> (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E
25|$|A <b>spillway</b> is {{a section}} of a dam {{designed}} to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the <b>spillway.</b> There are several types of <b>spillway.</b> A service <b>spillway</b> or primary <b>spillway</b> passes normal flow. An auxiliary <b>spillway</b> releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service <b>spillway.</b> An emergency <b>spillway</b> is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service <b>spillway.</b> A fuse plug <b>spillway</b> is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E
