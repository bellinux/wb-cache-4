The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions.

5|$|In 1967, Carl Woese {{hypothesized}} that RNA might be catalytic {{and suggested that}} the earliest forms of life (<b>self-replicating</b> molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an RNA world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{and describe}} {{the notion of a}} robotic enzyme, and how it can use properties that are similar to biological enzymes to autonomously <b>self-replicate.</b> We test the idea of robotic enzymes using a virtual environment that simulates the currently existing modular robots in a physically accurate way. We describe the selfreplicating features of robotic enzymes, and how they could be used to autonomously <b>self-replicate</b> for multiple generations, limited only by the amount of modules in the environment.

5|$|The von Neumann neighborhood, {{in which}} each cell in a {{two-dimensional}} grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues {{to be used for}} other cellular automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using <b>self-replicating</b> spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{created the}} field of {{cellular}} automata {{without the aid of}} computers, constructing the first <b>self-replicating</b> automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of the Von Neumann universal constructor based on the von Neumann cellular automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a <b>self-replicating</b> molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E

5000|$|The Prusa i3, {{like many}} RepRap printers, {{is made from}} a {{combination}} of <b>self-replicated</b> 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components which commonly referred to as [...] "vitamins", as they cannot be produced by the printer itself.|$|R
5|$|While the {{military}} is examining GORT, the robot transforms into a swarm of winged, insect-like, nano-machines that <b>self-replicate</b> as they consume everything in their path. The swarm soon devours the entire facility, emerging above ground to continue feeding.|$|R
5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and solar sails, have already been developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of <b>self-replicating</b> robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} <b>self-replicating</b> molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short <b>self-replicating</b> RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5000|$|Motivational: {{ideas that}} people adopt because they {{perceive}} some self-interest in adopting them. Strictly speaking, motivationally transmitted memes do not self-propagate, but {{this mode of}} transmission often occurs in association with memes <b>self-replicated</b> in the efficiency parental, proselytic and preservational modes.|$|R
50|$|All {{biological}} organisms {{have the}} ability to <b>self-replicate</b> and self-assemble into functional components. The economical benefit of biocomputers lies in this potential of all biologically derived systems to <b>self-replicate</b> and self-assemble given appropriate conditions. For instance, all of the necessary proteins for a certain biochemical pathway, which could be modified to serve as a biocomputer, could be synthesized many times over inside a biological cell from a single DNA molecule. This DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over. This characteristic of biological molecules could make their production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive. Whereas electronic computers require manual production, biocomputers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them.|$|R
5000|$|On a nano scale, {{assemblers}} {{might also}} be designed to <b>self-replicate</b> under their own power. This, in turn, {{has given rise to}} the [...] "grey goo" [...] version of Armageddon, as featured in such science fiction novels as Bloom, Prey, and Recursion.|$|R
5|$|O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c try {{to obtain}} {{intelligence}} {{on the little}} <b>self-replicating</b> robotic invaders in the submarine, but {{they are forced to}} fall back. With Daniel's new theory that the Replicators are made up of the same materials they consume, the Replicators may be eliminated through sinking the iron submarine as long as the surviving Replicator from Thor's advanced ship is destroyed beforehand. Meanwhile, Carter witnesses a short battle against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy during which five Asgard ships are lost. Carter notices the Replicators' attraction to new technology and proposes to use the O'Neill, an incomplete Asgard ship originally designed to fight the Replicators, as a lure to draw the Replicators into hyperspace and destroy them in the O'Neills self-destruct. Thor eventually accepts the plan, the Replicators take the bait and are destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings, {{which use}} two {{different}} quadrilaterals, {{are the best}} known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated {{in this way is}} the rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising <b>self-replicating</b> properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.|$|E
25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{may have}} first originated in an RNA world, appearing as a <b>self-replicating</b> complex that only later evolved {{the ability to}} synthesize proteins when amino acids began to appear. Studies suggest that ancient ribosomes constructed solely of rRNA could have developed the ability to synthesize peptide bonds. In addition, evidence strongly points to ancient ribosomes as <b>self-replicating</b> complexes, where the rRNA in the ribosomes had informational, structural, and catalytic purposes because it could have coded for tRNAs and proteins needed for ribosomal self-replication. Hypothetical cellular organisms with <b>self-replicating</b> RNA but without DNA are called ribocytes (or ribocells).|$|E

40|$|Arbitrary quantum states {{cannot be}} copied. In fact, {{to make a}} copy we must provide {{complete}} information about the system. However, can a quantum system <b>self-replicate?</b> This is not answered by the no-cloning theorem. In the classical context, Von Neumann showed that a `universal constructor' can exist which can <b>self-replicate</b> an arbitrary system, provided that it had access to instructions for making copy of the system. We question {{the existence of a}} universal constructor that may allow for the self-replication of an arbitrary quantum system. We prove that there is no deterministic universal quantum constructor which can operate with finite resources. Further, we delineate conditions under which such a universal constructor can be designed to operate dterministically and probabilistically. Comment: Latex file, no figures, 7 page...|$|R

25|$|As {{amino acids}} {{gradually}} {{appeared in the}} RNA world under prebiotic conditions, their interactions with catalytic RNA would increase both the range and efficiency of function of catalytic RNA molecules. Thus, the driving force {{for the evolution of}} the ribosome from an ancient <b>self-replicating</b> machine into its current form as a translational machine may have been the selective pressure to incorporate proteins into the ribosome’s <b>self-replicating</b> mechanisms, so as to increase its capacity for self-replication.|$|E
