2500|$|Marlowe {{is alleged}} to have been a {{government}} spy (Park Honan's 2005 biography even had [...] "Spy" [...] in its title). The author Charles Nicholl speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. As noted above, in 1587 the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree of Master of Arts, denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified [...] "affaires" [...] on [...] "matters touching the benefit of his country". Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university – much longer than permitted by university regulations – that began in the academic year 1584–1585. Surviving college buttery (provisions <b>store)</b> <b>accounts</b> indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance – more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, store cards {{have been}} {{excluded}} from {{participation in the}} EFTPOS and ATM systems. Consequently, several larger <b>store</b> <b>accounts</b> have entered into co-branding arrangements with credit card networks for the store-based accounts to be widely accepted.

50|$|With the {{comparatively}} small Lumberjack Distribution absorbing the powerful and established Mordam to form LMMG, a revamped and expanded system {{of sales and}} shipping was needed. A contract was signed with WEA, the distribution arm of major label Warner Brothers Music calling for WEA to directly pick, pack, and ship music to certain national chain <b>store</b> <b>accounts</b> via a WEA-affiliated entity called Cinram. In accordance with this agreement, affiliated labels (including those formerly under the Mordam umbrella) were to ship physical goods directly to Cinram warehouse. LMMG hoped for first year sales in the $15 to 20 million range, thereby growing business and income of its affiliated labels.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of December 8th, 1883, the five outlaws rode into Bisbee. They tied their horses near the Copper Queen Mine smelter {{at the end of}} Main Street and walked to the Goldwater and Castaneda store. At the store, three of the men, {{including}} [...] "Tex" [...] Howard, who wasn't wearing a mask, entered the store while the other two remained outside. They leveled pistols at the store owner and persuaded him to open the safe, only to find that the payroll had not yet arrived. The robbers took some cash and a watch in the safe and robbed all of the employees and customers in the <b>store.</b> <b>Accounts</b> differ as to how much money they stole, but it was reported they took between $900 and $3,000 in cash along with the gold watch and articles of jewelry.|$|E
50|$|Zero balance account: A Zero balance account can {{be thought}} of as {{somewhat}} of a hack. Companies with large numbers of stores or locations can very often be confused if all those stores are depositing into a single bank account. Traditionally, it would be impossible to know which deposits were from which stores without seeking to view images of those deposits. To help correct this problem, banks developed a system where each store is given their own bank account, but all the money deposited into the individual <b>store</b> <b>accounts</b> are automatically moved or swept into the company's main bank account. This allows the company to look at individual statements for each store. U.S. banks are almost all converting their systems so that companies can tell which store made a particular deposit, even if these deposits are all deposited into a single account. Therefore, zero balance accounting is being used less frequently.|$|E

Her research examines institutionalized slavery and {{racism in the}} Middle Atlantic, American South and Caribbean, and colonial frontier interactions in the Middle Atlantic, during the recent past (1600-1900). [...] She examines how people, free and enslaved, created and used material culture—buildings, designed and vernacular landscapes, and handcrafted and mass-produced consumer goods—to promote and strengthen systems of inequality or to survive, challenge and reshape them. [...] Her interests extend to the dynamics of exchange, whether through formalized relationships recorded in <b>store</b> <b>accounts,</b> or barter and trade. [...] Currently, she is researching three areas: the production, exchange and use of pottery made by enslaved and free women of African descent in the eighteenth, {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} in the Leeward Islands; the enslaved communities of Thomas Jefferson in piedmont Virginia; and the origins of slavery in the seventeenth-century Potomac River valley.|$|E

50|$|In 1914, Western Union {{opened the}} first charge account for its {{customers}} and {{provided them with}} a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store charge accounts for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them. In 1950, Diners Club began opening charge accounts with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card {{could be used in}} a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own charge account facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store's cost in running their own <b>store</b> <b>accounts.</b> In 1957, American Express also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to ISO/IEC 7810 standards.|$|E

5000|$|The day-to-day {{work of the}} new Commission {{required}} specialist staff, and {{its first}} secretary was Edward Owen. Between 1908 and 1928 he did much to establish the Commission on sound and respected foundations. A reputable historian of Anglesey origins, he was trained as a lawyer and had served, like many a British civil servant, in the India Office, where he supervised the military <b>store</b> <b>accounts</b> and prepared statistical statements for India. As overall editor of the inventories, he was at pains to extend his knowledge beyond his own expertise in medieval and later manuscripts. His scholarship was widely admired by the Cymmrodorion and the Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society among others. He was also closely involved with the University of Liverpool, where he became reader in Welsh Medieval Antiquities (1921) during his time as the Commission's secretary. Owen's staff included his assistant in 1908, Edward Thomas, was a fine writer and observer of the landscape but he found the Commission's work uncongenial (he regarded himself 'a fish out of water') and resigned to concentrate on literature. Thomas proved {{to be one of}} Britain's finest war poets, but in 1917 he was killed in action at Arras. Three other of the early staff made greater contributions to the Commission. George Eyre Evans's life (1857-1939) spanned the formative years of modern archaeology. As a prolific antiquary with many publications to his name before he joined the Commission, he was most closely associated with Carmarthenshire, particularly the county museum and the antiquarian society. Alfred Neobard Palmer (1847-1915) was appointed in 1910 as a 'temporary assistant inspector of Ancient Monuments' for six months, at 15s. a day with a guinea for subsistence and travelling. Palmer suffered ill health, and his appointment was an act of kindness by Edward Owen, who had earlier secured him a government pension in recognition of his historical researches. A chemist by profession, Palmer turned himself into a local historian, particularly of Wrexham, where the local studies library is named after him.|$|E
