For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for <b>sending</b> <b>us</b> the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{comparison}} of Vivah with Sooraj Bartjatya's previous films compelled it to receive generally mixed reviews. The film {{was a big}} success, but before its release, many journalists expected Vivah to be a flop. Ron Ahluwalia of Planet Bollywood gave it 7.5 out of 10 wrote, [...] "Sooraj Bartjatya comes up with the best, cheesiest family flick we’ve {{seen in a long}} time without <b>sending</b> <b>us</b> back to the 1940s." [...] Deepa Gahlot of Sify said, [...] "Vivah is far less offensive and far more watchable." [...] Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India called it a [...] "simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah". Madhuparna Das of The Telegraph criticised Vivah for lacking plot, flat characters and mentioning that the story was [...] "rather weak and improbable." [...] BBC described Vivah as [...] "a didactic, worthy, and highly sanitised take on reality in keeping with the Rajshri tradition." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave only 1 out of 5 stars and condemned the screenplay, calling both Kapoor and Rao [...] "insipid and boring." [...] A review carried by Anupama Chopra mentioned, [...] "Sooraj Barjatya's fantasy world is carefully constructed, but his conviction infuses his films with an emotional heft." [...] Business of Cinema defended the film stating, [...] "Vivah is a film with beautiful moments, it promises to recreate the magic of Maine Pyar Kiya." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{war against}} the Barbary States was in {{response}} to the frequent piracy of American vessels in the Mediterranean Sea and the capture and enslavement of American crews for huge ransoms. President Jefferson, known for his aversion to standing armies and the navy, acted contrary to such sentiment and began his presidency by <b>sending</b> <b>U.S.</b> naval forces to fight the Barbary states rather than continue paying huge annual tributes to the petty North African kingdoms.

2500|$|Discomfort in the British Army with {{possible}} military action within Ireland was {{to some extent}} mirrored in the Royal Navy. In Firedrake, Engineer Lieutenant Ranken informed his captain [...] "that I had signed the British Covenant and that I should be no party to any aggressive move against Ulster {{if that were the}} intention in <b>sending</b> <b>us</b> to Kingstown". Had General Paget, he declared, [...] "joined for passage during my regime only one course was open to me - to decline to be a party to propelling the ship".
