50|$|Locking was {{achieved}} by a <b>solid</b> <b>bolt</b> head and three bolt lugs. The bolt head {{was designed to be}} removable thus allowing the owner to vary the head space by replacing the head. The bolt head is of the floating type whereby it is a loose fit in the bolt tube and held in place by a pin, the firing pin passing through a hole in that pin. This allows the locking lugs to self centre with even pressure when the action is locked.|$|E
5000|$|Model 1910 (Mk III) {{was made}} with a totally {{different}} bolt head; instead of having the <b>solid</b> <b>bolt</b> lugs travel in a vertical position and lock in a horizontal position, like for the Mk II and Mk II** (see illustration), Ross turned it 90 degrees so it travels in an horizontal position and locks vertically. Then, he used screw threads on the lugs outside which are locking into the matching threaded receiver. Some very scarce Mk II** with the same threaded lugs and receiver are known to exist. He also used the same shape of heavy barrel as used on the Mk II**. The M-10, in [...]280 Ross, {{is considered by many}} as being the finest rifle ever made by the Ross Rifle Co.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contemporary}} {{military and}} naval parlance the term gun {{has a very}} specific meaning and refers solely to any large-calibre, direct-fire, high-velocity, flat-trajectory artillery piece employing an explosive-filled hollowed metal shell or <b>solid</b> <b>bolt</b> as its primary projectile. This later usage contrasts with large-calibre, high-angle, low-velocity, indirect-fire weapons such as howitzers, mortars, and grenade launchers which invariantly employ explosive-filled shells. In other military use, the term [...] "gun" [...] refers primarily to direct fire weapons that capitalize on their muzzle velocity for penetration or range. In modern parlance, these weapons are breech-loaded and built primarily for long range fire with a low or almost flat ballistic arc. A variation is the howitzer or gun-howitzer designed to offer the ability to fire both low or high-angle ballistic arcs. In this use, example guns include naval guns. A less strict application of the word is to identify one artillery weapon system or non-machine gun projectile armament on aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The Naval Undersea Warfare Center has funded {{research}} {{to examine a}} range of finite element approaches used for modeling bolted connections subjected to various loading conditions. Research focused on developing finite element bolt representations that were accurate and computationally efficient. A variety of finite element modeling approaches, from detailed models to simplified ones, were used to represent the behavior of single <b>solid</b> <b>bolts</b> under static and dynamic tension loading. Test cases utilized models of bolted connection test arrangements (static tension and dynamic tension) developed for previous research and validated against test data for hollow bore bolts (Behan et al., 2013). Simulation results for <b>solid</b> <b>bolts</b> are validated against experimental data from physical testing of bolts in these load configurations...|$|R

SENTINEL II RFID lets users open and secure their in-room safe with the Signature RFID hotel lock room key.|$|R
6000|$|Near {{a century}} and a half has elapsed since these brave words were shaped by David Hume's pen; and the {{business}} of carrying the war into the enemy's camp has gone on but slowly. Like other campaigns, it long languished for want of a good base of operations. But since physical science, in the course of the last fifty years, has brought to the front an inexhaustible supply of heavy artillery of a new pattern, warranted to drive <b>solid</b> <b>bolts</b> of fact through the thickest skulls, things are looking better; though hardly more than the first faint flutterings of the dawn of the happy day, when superstition and false metaphysics shall be no more and reasonable folks may [...] "live at ease," [...] are as yet discernible by the enfants perdus of the outposts.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972-1976 K5(Blazer/Jimmy)/K10/K20/k30 (passenger side) Some 1977 K5 Blazers {{came with}} Dana 44s in the front, others {{came with a}} Corporate 10 <b>bolt</b> <b>solid</b> axle.|$|R
2500|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the stub axle rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a <b>solid</b> casting <b>bolted</b> {{to the side of the}} body. The block's vertical movement was controlled by coil springs. The front suspension was upgraded with a hydraulic shock absorber ...|$|R
40|$|Cable bolting and rock/rebar bolting are the {{two main}} {{reinforcement}} techniques used in underground coal mines to maintain the stability of openings. Due to the structural features of cable strands, cables and <b>solid</b> <b>bolts</b> behave differently in reinforcing rock strata. Since the generation of a cable model is different in a numerical program, and especially impossible in a 2 D program, some researchers tend to replace cable bolts with rebar bolts in numerical models, which is still pretty suspicious. To compare their performance differences when subjected in tension and/or in shear, numerical models of cable and rebar bolt were built and analysed using Flac 3 D program. The generated models of cables and rebar bolts were assigned identical geometrical dimensions and basic mechanical properties to ensure comparability. Attention was mainly given to the strength and stiffness of cables and rebar bolts both in tension and in shear. Conclusions are drawn from these models, {{which can be a}} reference for other studies in this area...|$|R
60|$|The Elmore Bank {{had just}} {{put in a}} new safe and vault. Mr. Adams {{was very proud of}} it, and insisted on an {{inspection}} by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three <b>solid</b> steel <b>bolts</b> thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the front}} bedroom, over the drawing-room. The first glance round {{showed it to}} be {{scrupulously}} clean, and solidly and tastelessly furnished. The hideous paper on the walls, the hideous carpet on the floor, were both of the best quality. The great heavy mahogany bedstead, with its curtains hanging from a hook in the ceiling, and with its clumsily carved head and foot on the same level, offered to the view the anomalous spectacle of French design overwhelmed by English execution. The most noticeable thing {{in the room was}} the extraordinary attention which had been given to the defense of the door. Besides the usual lock and key, it possessed two <b>solid</b> <b>bolts,</b> fastening inside at the top and the bottom. It had been one among the many eccentric sides of Reuben Limbrick's character to live in perpetual dread of thieves breaking into his cottage at night. All the outer doors and all the window shutters were solidly sheathed with iron, and had alarm-bells attached to them on a new principle. Every one of the bedrooms possessed its two bolts on the inner side of the door. And, to crown all, {{on the roof of the}} cottage was a little belfry, containing a bell large enough to make itself heard at the Fulham police station. In Reuben Limbrick's time the rope had communicated with his bedroom. It hung now against the wall, in the passage outside.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} {{is in the}} wheels. Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims. Those intended for road use would have continuous <b>solid</b> rubber tyres <b>bolted</b> around the rims, to improve traction on tarmac. Engines intended for agricultural use would {{have a series of}} strakes bolted diagonally across the rims, like the tread on a modern pneumatic tractor tyre, and the wheels were typically wider to spread the load more evenly.|$|R
60|$|Not so thought Jake the Flint. Despair did {{not seem}} to be a {{possibility}} to him. Accordingly, he examined his prison carefully, and with a hopeful smile. The examination was soon completed, for the room presented no facilities whatever for escape. There was no bed from which to take the sheets and blankets to extemporise a rope. No mattress to throw over the window so as to break a heavy man's fall. No chimney by which to ascend to the roof, no furniture, indeed, of any kind beyond a deal chair and table. The door was of <b>solid</b> oak and <b>bolted</b> outside.|$|R
40|$|This {{appendix}} contains – reproduced at {{smaller than}} normal size – {{the study of}} radar returns from past Space Shuttle launches {{to determine whether the}} <b>Solid</b> Rocket Booster <b>bolt</b> catchers may have failed during the flight of STS- 107. The report concluded that there was the possibility that one of the debris items seen on radar during that flight could have been part of a bolt catcher. This appendix has no recommendations, but the Board did make recommendations related to the bolt catcher issue in Volume I. The conclusions drawn in this report do not necessarily reflect the conclusions of the Board; when there is a conflict, th...|$|R
50|$|The {{core shroud}} is {{composed}} of multiple cylindrical thermal shields stacked {{on top of each}} other. In between each thermal shield is a horizontal, stainless steel cylindrical plate that helps keep the thermal shields in place. The plates are then welded together with the thermal shields so that they create one <b>solid</b> structure.Vertical tie <b>bolts</b> are then used to reinforce each horizontal plate with their adjacent thermal shields, stabilizing the cylindrical core shroud. The thermal shields are needed because the core shroud exists near the nuclear reactor core where heat is constantly present. The thermal shields prevent heat from damaging the core shroud by absorbing or reflecting the heat.|$|R
5000|$|Keokuk {{was struck}} by about ninety projectiles, many of which hit at or below her waterline. Commander Rhind {{reported}} his ship as {{being hit by a}} combination of <b>solid</b> shot, <b>bolts,</b> and possibly hot shot. As predicted by her chief engineer, her thin composite armor was completely inadequate to protect her from this onslaught and she was [...] "completely riddled" [...] in the words of Commander Rhind. However, she was able to withdraw under her own power and anchor out of range, {{thanks in part to the}} skills of her black pilot, Robert Smalls, a former slave and pilot of CSS Planter. Her crew kept her afloat through the night, but when a breeze came up on the morning of April 8, 1863, Keokuk began taking on more water, filled rapidly, and sank off Morris Island. She had given one month of commissioned service. One of Keokuks sailors, Quartermaster Robert Anderson, was awarded the Medal of Honor in part for his actions during the battle. In all, 14 of Keokuks crew were injured in the battle, including Captain Rhind with a contusion to his leg. Acting Ensign Mackintosh, one of the gun captains, later died from his wounds.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a new}} {{sensation}} {{to stand}} looking at a full table, painfully conscious {{of one of the}} vacuums which Nature abhors, and receive orders to right about face, without partaking of the nourishment which your inner woman clamorously demanded. The doctors always fared better than we; and for a moment a desperate impulse prompted me to give them a hint, by walking off with the mutton, or confiscating the pie. But Ike's eye was on me, and, to my shame be it spoken, I walked meekly away; went dinnerless that day, and that evening went to market, laying in a small stock of crackers, cheese and apples, that my boys might not be neglected, nor myself obliged to <b>bolt</b> <b>solid</b> and liquid dyspepsias, or starve. This plan would have succeeded admirably had not the evil star under which I was born, been in the ascendant during that month, and cast its malign influences even into my [...] "'umble" [...] larder; for the rats had their dessert off my cheese, the bugs set up housekeeping in my cracker bag, and the apples like all worldly riches, took to themselves wings and flew away; whither no man could tell, though certain black imps might have thrown light upon the matter, had not the plaintiff in the case been loth to add another to the many trials of long-suffering Africa. After this failure I resigned myself to fate, and, remembering that bread was called the staff of life, leaned pretty exclusively upon it; but it proved a broken reed, and I came to the ground after a few weeks of prison fare, varied by an occasional potato or surreptitious sip of milk.|$|R
