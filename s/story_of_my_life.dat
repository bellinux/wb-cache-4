Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas asked me if I wanted to tell the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Then they would {{know what to do with}} it."

The book was reviewed by Virginia Woolf, who felt it was too familiarizing of the royal family. She stated that [...] "suppose that among the autumn books of 2034 is Prometheus Unbound, by George the Sixth, or Wuthering Heights, by Elizabeth the Second, what will be the effect upon their loyal subjects? Will the British Empire survive? Will Buckingham Palace look as solid then as it does now? Words are dangerous things, let us remember. A republic might be brought into being by a poem." ...|$|E

In 1994 she worked opposite Anthony Quinn in This Can't Be Love, which was largely based on Hepburn's own life, with numerous references to her personality and career. These later roles {{have been described as}} [...] "a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character" [...] and critics have remarked that Hepburn was essentially playing herself.|$|R

5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: <b>Stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, Dunnery {{embarked}} on a [...] "house concert" [...] world tour, suggesting to fans that they book him to perform {{in their own homes}} for a paying audience, in a drug and alcohol-free environment. The concept proved to be very popular, not least with Dunnery himself, who has described them as [...] "phenomenally successful." [...] Dunnery continues to perform house concerts to this day and describes a typical performance as [...] "(showing up) as a friend - you can't show up as a rock dude or something - and it's just me and my acoustic guitar, no amplification, singing my songs and holding a 90-minute lecture on the human condition. I sing songs and tell <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It's not a party; it's more like going to church, but church with swearing!... (There is) an exchange of energy that I call a 'jacuzzi'. At the end of 90 minutes, everybody has dropped their ego. They don't even realise that has happened, but they have gradually taken off their clothes and gone into that energetic jacuzzi together. Something like that is a lot harder to achieve in a rock music arena." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1988 [...] {{long before}} the arrest of Tommy Burns and the {{subsequent}} unraveling of the horse murders conspiracy of silence [...] "Brat Pack" [...] novelist Jay McInerney based a roman à clef novel, titled <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> on the young adulthood of his former girlfriend Lisa Druck, James Druck's daughter. McInerney's novel implies {{that the cause of}} protagonist Alison Poole's [...] "party girl" [...] behavior is her father's abuse, including the murder of her prize jumping horse.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was open}} {{speculation}} that <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> was a roman à clef novel {{when it first}} appeared; to New York Magazines questions [...] "Is it real? Did it happen?" [...] McInerney replied, [...] "I'm anticipating some {{of that kind of}} speculation, but I'm utterly confident of not having any lawsuits on my hands. The book is a fully imagined work of fiction. On the other hand, it's not to say that I didn't make use of … That's why I live in New York. Mine is not an autonomous imagination." ...|$|E
2500|$|McInerney {{has said}} that he chose to write about Druck and her friends because he was both [...] "intrigued and appalled" [...] by their behavior, and the lead character, Alison Poole, who was closely modeled after Druck, was {{described}} as [...] "an ostensibly jaded, cocaine-addled, sexually voracious 20-year old." [...] <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> opens with Alison Poole's description of her father and her seemingly casual comment that she gave up riding when her horse [...] called [...] "Dangerous Dan" [...] in the story [...] suddenly [...] "dropped dead," [...] details that closely parallel Lisa Druck's early life.|$|E

"I am {{not going}} to tell any stories now," [...] he said, [...] "for my wife has not {{overcome}} her dislike to tobacco smoke, and she has insisted that she shall be one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hearers when I tell <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> past <b>life</b> to you; but I can tell you this, my friend: she will believe every word I say; there can be no possible doubt of that.

5000|$|Taïa {{has said}} that Mon Maroc (My Morocco) [...] "is <b>my</b> <b>story.</b> The <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Moroccan <b>life</b> that took place, {{over the course of}} 25 years, {{on the banks of the}} river Bou Regreg, in the two towns that are located at its mouth: Rabat and Salé, the first on the left bank, the other on the right bank." [...] Taïa wanted to name the book after Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho, a film that [...] "became mythical" [...] for him when he saw it in Morocco. Lacking a French equivalent, he used for My Morocco instead.|$|R
60|$|Let me, nevertheless, {{attempt a}} rough {{preliminary}} {{analysis of this}} confused process. A main strand is quite easily traceable. This main strand is the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> obvious <b>life,</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> as it must have looked to most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> acquaintances. It presents you with a young couple, bright, hopeful, and energetic, starting out under Altiora's auspices to make a career. You figure us well dressed and active, running about in motor-cars, visiting in great people's houses, dining amidst brilliant companies, going to the theatre, meeting in the lobby. Margaret wore hundreds of beautiful dresses. We must have had an air of succeeding meritoriously during that time.|$|R
