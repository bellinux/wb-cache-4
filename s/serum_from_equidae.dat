40|$|Clostridium difficile is an antibiotic-associated {{emerging}} pathogen {{of humans}} and animals. Thus far three toxins of C. difficile have been described: an enterotoxin (ToxA), a cytotoxin (ToxB) and an ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT). In the present work we describe the first isolation of CDT producing C. difficile <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> with gastro-intestinal disease. Out of 17 C. difficile strains isolated <b>from</b> <b>Equidae,</b> 11 were positive for the genes tcdA and tcdB encoding ToxA and ToxB. In addition four of these 11 isolates were positive for the cdtA gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT. Interestingly none of the isolates derived from canines (41 isolates) and felines (4 isolates) harboured the cdtA gene. In C. difficile field isolates which contained the cdtA gene, ADP-ribosyltransferase activity could also be detected in culture supernatants indicating expression and secretion of CDT. All strains were associated with intestinal disorders, but no association was found for the occurrence of toxins with a specific clinical diagnosi...|$|R

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have been devoted to the {{colloidal}} and soluble protein fractions of mare milk (caseins and whey proteins), to date {{little is known about}} the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) protein fraction from mare milk. The objective of this study was thus to describe MFGM proteins <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> milk and to compare those proteins to already described MFGM proteins from cow and goat milk. Major MFGM proteins (namely, xanthine oxidase, butyrophilin, lactadherin, and adipophilin) already described in cow or goat milk were identified in mare milk using mass spectrometry. However, species-specific peculiarities were observed for 2 MFGM proteins: butyrophilin and lactadherin. A highly glycosylated 70 -kDa protein was characterized for equine butyrophilin, whereas proteins of 64 and 67 kDa were characterized for cow and goat butyrophilin, respectively. Prominent differences across species were highlighted for lactadherin. Indeed, whereas 1 or 2 polypeptide chains were identified, respectively, by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis for caprine and bovine lactadherin, 4 isoforms (60, 57, 48, and 45 kDa) for lactadherin from mare milk were identified by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Polymerase chain reaction experiments on lactadherin transcripts isolated from milk fat globules revealed the existence of 2 distinct lactadherin transcripts in the horse mammary gland. Cloning and sequencing of both transcripts encoding lactadherin showed an alternative use of a cryptic splice site located at the end of intron 5 of the equine lactadherin-encoding gene. This event results in the occurrence of an additional alanine (A) residue in the protein that disrupts a putative atypical N-glycosylation site (VNGC/VNAGC) described in human lactadherin. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the existence of both lactadherin variants in mare MFGM. We show here that lactadherin <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> milk is much more complex than that from Bovidae milk (i. e., cow and goat milk), therefore raising questions regarding the precise function of these different isoforms, if any, in the equine mammary gland...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} effects of <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> {{patients}} with ankylosing spondylitis on the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway and to assess whether the serum has an osteogenic effect in MG 63 cells. METHODS: MG 63 cells were cultured with <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> 45 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 30 healthy controls, or 45 rheumatoid arthritis patients. The relative PPARD, fra- 1, MMP 7, OPG and RANKL mRNA levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Millimolar concentrations of leukocyte elastase, when released from single azurophil granules of activated neutrophils, lead to evanescent quantum bursts of proteolytic activity before catalysis is quenched by pericellular inhibitors. Herein, we tested the possibility that quantum proteolytic events are abnormal in AAT deficiency. We incubated neutrophils on opsonized fluoresceinated fibronectin in <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> individuals with various AAT phenotypes, and then measured and modeled quantum proteolytic events. The mean areas of the events in <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> heterozygous individuals (Pi MZ and Pi SZ) were slightly, but significantly, larger than those in <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> normal patients (Pi M). In marked contrast, mean areas of events in <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> AAT-deficient individuals were 10 -fold larger than those in <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> normal patients.

The MA test was highly serotype specific with <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> both animal species. The CF test was broadly reactive with <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> rabbits infected with various serotypes.

30|$|We {{observe a}} larger {{variation}} in the expression of p 62 induced by the patients' serum compared to the variation induce by the <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> healthy volunteers. p 62 expression in myotubes incubated with the <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> 66 patients (ICU group) {{was similar to the}} healthy group (131 [*]±[*] 4 vs. 122 [*]±[*] 9  % of control; ICU vs. healthy). Interestingly, the <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> 29 ICU patients (ICU+ and ICU- groups) induced an expression of p 62 superior of 2 SD in comparison with the values observed in myotubes incubated with the <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> healthy volunteers. Within this 29 samples, 14 were inducing an increase in the autophagic flux (p[*]<[*] 0.05, ICU+ vs. Healthy) and 15 were inducing a block of the autophagic flux (p[*]<[*] 0.05, ICU- vs. Healthy). Interestingly, the length of hospital stay was significantly greater in the ICU- (8.7  days, 95  % CI [6.0, 11.4]) compared to the ICU (4.0  days, 95  % CI [2.8, 5.3]) and the ICU+ (4.3  days, 95  % CI [1.7, 7.0]).|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) elicits {{the production of}} virus-specific antibodies in infected individuals. We investigated the ability of <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> HIV-infected individu-als to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in an in vitro S 1 er release assay system. Fresh {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from healthy donors seronegative for HIV were used as cellular effectors against HIV-infected and uninfected H 9 target cells in the presence of <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> HIV-infected or uninfected donors. <b>Serum</b> <b>from</b> HIV-infected, but not uninfected, donors significantly augmented cytolysis of virus-infected targets (P<. 005). There was no augmented killing of uninfected H 9 cells with sera from either group. Studies using <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> mice that had been immunized with synthetic peptides from the HIV envelope region suggested that this response is directed, at least in part, at several determinants of the transmembrane portion of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. Although the cause of AIDS is now recognized to be a human retrovirus (human immunodeficiency vi-rus [HIV]) [1], the mechanisms by which the host responds to this virus have not yet been fully delin-eated.

40|$|Gas-liquid {{chromatography}} (GLC) {{was used}} to study normal <b>serum</b> and <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> patients with septicemia caused {{by a variety of}} bacteria and by Candida albicans. The gas chromatograms of seven sera from six patients with septicemia due to C. albicans were found to be significantly and reproducibly different from those of normal sera. Chromatograms of <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> 19 bacteremic patients were indistinguishable from normals. The major peaks present in chromatograms of normal sera were identified by GLC and mass spectroscopy as the methyl esters of palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and stearic acids. In addition to these peaks, <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> patients with candidemia contained abnormal peaks that were also present in cultures of C. albicans grown in normal serum and in washed C. albicans harvested from cultures in yeast nitrogen base broth. Chromatograms from 11 cases of mucosal candidates differed little from normal and were easily distinguished from those of fungemia patients. Chromatograms of <b>serum</b> <b>from</b> two of four patients with deep-invasive candidiasis were indistinguishable from those of fungemia and reverted to normal after infections were eradicated...|$|R
