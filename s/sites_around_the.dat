Improvements to the Australia Zoo include the Animal Planet Crocoseum, the rainforest aviary and Tiger Temple. Irwin mentioned that he was considering opening an Australia Zoo in Las Vegas, Nevada, and possibly at other <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
5|$|A library {{has been}} present {{since the time}} of StWerburgh's Abbey, and {{following}} the dissolution of the monasteries it became the cathedral library. It continued to grow over the centuries, but by the 19thcentury it had become neglected. Between 1867 and 1885 it was enlarged and in the 1890s new bookcases were added. A further reorganisation took place in the 1920s but by the 1980s the contents were contained in five separate <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. A programme of repair and re-cataloguing of the contents was instituted. During the 2000s more work was carried out and the refurbished library, housed in three rooms, opened in 2007. The library is available for research and for organised visits by groups.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{temporarily}} {{returned to}} England to shoot scenes at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, which stood {{in for a}} location in Rome, {{before moving on to}} the city itself for a five-week shoot across the city, with locations including the Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum. The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E

5|$|His {{expertise}} {{resulted in}} his being invited by Charles Close, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey (OS), to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer. Accepting the position, Crawford moved to Southampton and began {{work at the}} project in October 1920. His arrival at the OS generated some resentment, with co-workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be unimportant. His job entailed correcting and updating information about archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised, and involved him undertaking much fieldwork, travelling across the British landscape to check the location of previously recorded sites and discover new ones. He began in Gloucestershire in late 1920, visiting 208 <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows to the map. Based on his research in this region, in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} decades of his careers, Moser sought to clarify the taxonomic {{identity}} of European fungi by collecting specimens to be described as neotypes in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries, but this was no longer necessary after changes to nomenclatural rules that took effect in 1981. Among the Agaricales, Moser's interest was primarily in the complex genus Cortinarius. He published book-length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and, co-writing with Horak, South America. Moser, working with Joe Ammirati, contributed to research on the genus in North America, and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa. He had a particular interest in Arctic–alpine habitats, and he documented, painted and published on his collections in these and other <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. Moser initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales, but later contributed to research in this area.|$|E

5|$|On {{receiving}} this reply, Bonaparte immediately {{ordered his}} fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> island. The French Knights deserted the order, {{and the remaining}} Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although Valletta {{was strong enough to}} hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he {{and the rest of the}} expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June.|$|E
5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world are estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, {{the west coast of}} Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other <b>sites</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.|$|E
50|$|Before {{this church}} was constructed, {{there was a}} wooden church on <b>the</b> same <b>site</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> year 1024. That church is assumed to have been built by Olav Trygvason, and it is {{possible}} that the present stone church is built around this church originally.|$|R
