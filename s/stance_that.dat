5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E

5|$|Another {{four years}} pass, and Kioe Gie has become {{editor-in-chief}} of Kemadjoean and married Ijan Nio. He is concerned, however, over the newspaper's new political orientation: the owner, Oeij Tjoan Siat, is aiming {{to make the}} paper pro-Dutch East Indies, a <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> Kioe Gie considers a betrayal to the ethnic Chinese. When Tjoan Siat comes to Kioe Gie's home {{to ask him to}} follow the former's new political leanings, heavily influenced by a monthly payment of 2,000 gulden offered by an unnamed political party, Kioe Gie refuses and resigns.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1970s Crucibulum {{was thought}} to be monotypic, {{containing}} the single species C.laeve (formerly C.vulgaris). This was in part due to the <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century, believing that the designation of new species was not justifiable due to the existence of intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity. In 1970–71, Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C.laeve sufficiently to justify naming them as new species.|$|E

5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's {{attorney}} (and future board member) Howard Lincoln was {{at first}} inclined to settle for $5–7 million. Eventually, however, he decided to fight, reassuring {{the head of the}} company's U.S. division, Minoru Arakawa, that this was a sign that Nintendo had made it big. On May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a chain of title to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name. When this failed to materialize in the next few weeks, Lincoln prodded Universal again. They responded with more demands for royalties.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E

In the light of this multi-level analysis of smiles, we propose the architecture of a fully interactive smiling ECA based on an extension of the SAIBA framework. I...|$|R

5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
50|$|Misconceptions about HIV and AIDS {{arise from}} several {{different}} sources, from simple ignorance and misunderstandings about scientific knowledge regarding HIV infections {{and the cause}} of AIDS to misinformation propagated by individuals and groups with ideological <b>stances</b> <b>that</b> deny a causative relationship between HIV infection and the development of AIDS.

5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) {{contemplated}} {{whether it}} would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers; neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E

5000|$|The Shapes were an English {{punk rock}} group that formed in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire in 1976. [...] Different {{in many ways}} from their peers in the nascent punk subculture, they were known for eschewing the more {{political}} <b>stances</b> <b>that</b> were fashionable at the time, instead producing works of a cartoonish and absurdist nature. They were often compared to The Rezillos because of their Gerry Anderson-themed work.|$|R
5|$|In 1965 Constantine {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Sports Council, which aimed to develop sport in Britain. Two years later, he was appointed to the three-person Race Relations Board, formed through the Race Relations Act, to investigate cases of racial discrimination. In this role he spoke out against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, a <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> led to an offer from the Liberal Party, which he declined, to stand as parliamentary candidate for Nelson. Later, he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the release, after a military coup, of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the overthrown Prime Minister of Nigeria. Constantine was appointed to the BBC's General Advisory Committee in 1966 and became a BBC Governor two years later, although declining health restricted his involvement. The following year the students of St Andrews University elected Constantine as Rector, but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role. In his last years, Constantine was criticised for becoming part of the Establishment; Private Eye mocked him, while the new generation of West Indian immigrants believed he was out of touch. More radical black spokesmen disapproved of his conciliatory approach to racist incidents.|$|E
5|$|In early 1623, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham {{decided to}} seize the {{initiative}} and travel to Spain incognito, to win the infanta directly, but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake. The infanta detested Charles, and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti-Catholic legislation by Parliament. Though a treaty was signed, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much {{to the delight of}} the British people. Disillusioned by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James's Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg empire. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham, who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield, by now made Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost. The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare or fund a war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain, a <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his <b>stance</b> <b>that</b> the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E
