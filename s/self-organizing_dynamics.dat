Crucially, we will show that some of the fundamental instabilities that arise in these coupled systems are remarkably similar to endogenous activity seen in the brain (using EEG and fMRI). Furthermore, by changing a small subset of the system’s parameters we can produce bifurcations and metastable sequential dynamics changing, which bear a remarkable similarity to pathological brain states seen in psychiatry. In what follows, we will consider the coupling of two macroscopic modes of brain activity, which, in a purely descriptive fashion, we will label as cognitive and emotional modes.

This paper proposes a technique to generate autonomous motions based on consistency of object dynamics.

The authors utilize Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias to <b>self-organize</b> the <b>dynamics,</b> and link static images to the <b>self-organized</b> <b>dynamics</b> using a hierarchical neural network to deal with the first issue. For evaluation of consistency, the authors have set an evaluation function based on object dynamics relative to robot motor dynamics.

However, the systematic development of systems exhibiting such properties challenges current development practices.

These models do not explain two prominent realities: (1) {{variation in the}} content of a legal system, and (2) patterns of non-hierarchical ordering that we observe.

The self-organizing model focuses on variation {{in the content of}} legal systems and attempts to explain the relationship between that variation and patterns of ordering. The self-organizing model demonstrates that variation and ordering are not opposite categories, but rather constitute one continuous phenomenon.

40|$|We {{review a}} general class of models for <b>self-organized</b> <b>{{dynamics}}</b> based on alignment. The dynamics of such systems is governed solely by interactions among individuals or "agents," with {{the tendency to}} adjust to their `environmental averages'. This, in turn, leads {{to the formation of}} clusters, e. g., colonies of ants, flocks of birds, parties of people, etc. A natural question which arises in this context is to understand when and how clusters emerge through the self-alignment of agents, and what type of "rules of engagement" influence the formation of such clusters. Of particular interest to us are cases in which the self-organized behavior tends to concentrate into one cluster, reflecting a consensus of opinions, flocking or concentration of other positions intrinsic to the dynamics. Many standard models for <b>self-organized</b> <b>dynamics</b> in social, biological and physical science assume that the intensity of alignment increases as agents get closer, reflecting a common tendency to align with those who think or act alike. Moreover, "Similarity breeds connection," reflects our intuition that increasing the intensity of alignment as the difference of positions decreases, is more likely to lead to a consensus. We argue here that the converse is true: when the dynamics is driven by local interactions, it is more likely to approach a consensus when the interactions among agents increase as a function of their difference in position. Heterophily [...] - the tendency to bond more with those who are different rather than with those who are similar, plays a decisive rôle in the process of clustering. We point out that the number of clusters in heterophilious dynamics decreases as the heterophily dependence among agents increases. In particular, sufficiently strong heterophilious interactions enhance consensus...|$|R
