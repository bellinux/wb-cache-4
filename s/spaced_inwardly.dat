The ground plane is formed with at least N coupling aperture slots therein, and the slots are substantially opposed to the patches. N feed lines are <b>spaced</b> <b>inwardly</b> from the ground plane and substantially parallel thereto, {{and at least one}} radio frequency chip is <b>spaced</b> <b>inwardly</b> from the feed lines and coupled to the feed lines and the ground plane. A first substrate layer is <b>spaced</b> <b>inwardly</b> from the feed lines, and is formed with a chip-receiving cavity, with the chip located in the chip-receiving cavity.; A second substrate layer is interposed in a region between the ground plane and a plane defined by the patch, the patch is formed in a first metal layer, the ground plane is formed in a second metal layer, and the second substrate layer defines an antenna cavity in which the N generally planar patches are located. 2 ̆ 2 Island 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 offset 2 ̆ 2 configurations, as well as fabrication methods, are also disclosed...|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 25 mm. The forewings are whitish buff, shaded with light brown. There {{are black and}} brown striae evenly distributed over the surface. The costa, except at the base and outer third, is dark brown and the outer margin is occupied by a large dark <b>space,</b> <b>inwardly</b> curved and limited by a dark velvety brown shade. The space contiguous to this toward the base is without striae and appears like a pale line, while the space within the curved brown line and a terminal dark brown line is dark olivaceous above vein 5, and lilacine white below it. There is a small dark brown spot on the lilacine portion and the fringe is pale brown. The hindwings and base of the fringe are pale brown, while the fringe terminally is white.|$|R
40|$|In the eye, {{different}} {{substances and}} ions including potassium (K+) are transported between neural retina and choroid via the subretinal <b>space.</b> <b>Inwardly</b> rectifying K+ channels (Kir) on the apical membrane of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells {{are thought to}} play {{an essential role in}} K+ transport in the subretinal space. Single-channel recordings from the apical membrane of RPE cells exhibited functional expression of a Kir channel with properties identical to those of Kir 4. 1, while recordings from the basolateral membrane showed no detectable Kir channel currents. The expression of Kir 4. 1 mRNA in RPE cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis and in situ hybridization. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry, we found that Kir 4. 1 was prominently expressed in RPE cells and localized specifically on the processes on their apical membrane. Developmental studies revealed that expression of Kir 4. 1 started to appear 10 days or later after birth in RPE cells, in parallel with the maturation of retinal neuronal activity as represented by the a- and b-waves of the electroretinogram. These data suggest that Kir 4. 1 is one of the Kir channels involved in RPE-mediated control of K+ ions in the subretinal space...|$|R
40|$|Brush border {{membrane}} vesicles {{were isolated}} from rabbit renal cortex by Mg++-precipitation and differential centrifugation. 36 Cl− and [3 H]glucose uptakes were simultaneously {{determined by a}} rapid filtration technique. Lysis of the vesicles with distilled water abolished 90 - 95 % of the radioactivity on the filters, suggesting that {{nearly all of the}} 36 Cl− and [3 H]glucose counts represented uptake into an osmotically reactive intravesicular <b>space.</b> <b>Inwardly</b> directed K+ gradients plus valinomycin stimulated 36 Cl− uptake, demonstrating a conductive pathway for chloride uptake into brush-border membrane vesicles. 36 Cl− uptake could also be stimulated by inwardly directed proton gradients (pHoutside < pHinside). This effect was seen in the absence of sodium, {{as well as in the}} presence of valinomycin when the vesicles had equal K+ concentrations inside and out. An “overshoot” phenomenon was observed when external 36 Cl− was 2 mM and the external pH was lowered from 7. 5 to 6. 0 or to 4. 5. The effect of the proton gradient was presumed to be different from the conductive mechanism because (a) the stimulation of 36 Cl− uptake by inwardly directed K+ diffusion potentials was additive to the proton gradient effect, and (b) competition studies revealed statistically significant effects of thiocyanate on the conductive pathway, but not on the proton-driven pathway...|$|R
40|$|Container-shaped {{molecules}} provide structured {{environments that}} impart geometric bounds on the motions and conformations of smaller molecular occupants. Moreover, they provide “solvation” that is constrained {{in time and}} <b>space.</b> When <b>inwardly</b> directed functional groups are present, they can interact chemically with the occupants. Additionally, the potential for reactivity and catalysis is greatly enhanced. Deep cavitands, derived from resorcinarenes, nearly surround smaller molecules and {{have been one of}} the most successful platforms for elaboration with functional groups. Derivatives bearing organic and metal-binding functional groups have been shown to affect recognition properties and selectively accelerate diverse reactions. In this review, we examine recent examples of these systems with an emphasis on how and why ordered nanoenvironments impart changes in the properties and reactivity of their occupants...|$|R
40|$|The three subtypes of calcium-activated {{potassium}} channels (KCa) of large, intermediate {{and small}} conductance (BKCa, IKCa and SKCa) {{are present in}} the vascular wall. In healthy arteries, BKCa channels are preferentially expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, while IKCa and SKCa are preferentially located in endothelial cells. The activation of endothelial IKCa and SKCa contributes to nitric oxide (NO) generation and is required to elicit endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations. In the latter responses, the hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cells is evoked either via electrical coupling through myo-endothelial gap junctions or by potassium ions, which by accumulating in the intercellular <b>space</b> activate the <b>inwardly</b> rectifying potassium channel Kir 2. 1 and/or the Na+/K+-ATPase. Additionally, endothelium-derived factors such as cytochrome P 450 -derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and under some circumstances NO, prostacyclin, lipoxygenase products and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) hyperpolarize and relax the underlying smooth muscle cells by activating BKCa. In contrast, cytochrome P 450 -derived 20 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and various endothelium-derived contracting factors inhibit BKCa. Aging and cardiovascular diseases are associated with endothelial dysfunctions that can involve a decrease in NO bioavailability, alterations of EDHF-mediated responses and/or enhanced production of endothelium-derived contracting factors. Because potassium channels are involved in these endothelium-dependent responses, activation of endothelial and/or smooth muscle KCa could prevent the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, direct activators of these potassium channels or compounds that regulate their activity or their expression may be of some therapeutic interest. Conversely, blockers of IKCa may prevent restenosis and that of BKCa channels sepsis-dependent hypotension...|$|R
40|$|Can sound {{penetrate}} beyond language? Is it {{a language}} of its own, a language without barriers or parameters and non-specific or defined by geography? Is it a language that relies purely on resonance? And what is resonance, can it be defined in a way where it does not evoke or suggest? Redefining the hierarchal structure and elitism found in words, words that can be relevant or irrelevant, one may seek {{to search for a}} meaning or let it pass undefined, perhaps let it be filled with uncertain assumption, sound on the other hand, is integral to a bodily function, its visceral reaction is penetrative beyond awareness. It is in fact anti-linguistic in its nature. However it is defined by its visceral connotations. So {{what does it mean to}} be involuntarily exposed to sounds, music for sake of this argument, in a public space, to know that we automatically react to sound in a visceral way? What does it mean to experience this in such a way, in such a space? In such a manner? Does this henceforth involuntarily connect us, to a set locality? To each other? To we form a composition with one another in the architecture of sound? How are we composers in the spatial experience? 2 ̆ 028 Exploring the corporeal specifics that are unique to the sound heard, as well as the universal aspects of the sound. We almost instinctively recognize a heartbeat; we associate a rate or repetition to what we perceive to be a heartbeat. What we in fact hear is the echo that the sound makes within our ribcage, making each heartbeat not only unique in itself but also relevant to our <b>inwardly</b> <b>space.</b> What does it mean to record such an intimate sound, and play it in a public space? What does it mean to place this intimacy outside, but to also invade the personal space yet again, by playing these sounds back at a specific frequency and in such a manner where one cannot avoid feeling the sound, not just hearing it...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} question, how does presence function in performative photography and drawing? Performative artists, who shift perceptions of self, time and <b>space</b> by focusing <b>inwardly,</b> explore the internal depths {{of mind and}} are seen to be - ‘imaging the void’ thereby they transform invisible internal states of mind into the production of presence. The invisible phenomenon of presence is examined via the artistic practices of the case study artists. The research focuses on Marina Abramović and timelessness, Yves Klein and the void, Joseph Beuys and dynamic creativity, and James Lee Byars and immanence, in order todevelop a framework of presence. Identifying and articulating attributes of presence within these artists’ practice is through theseminal textby Longchenpa,‘You Are the Eyes of the World’, an early 14 th century Tibetan Dzogchen Buddhist text on presence. The origins of practice, in the case study artists and my own, will be made via {{the use of a}} framework of presence comprised of five attributes: luminosity, timelessness, the void,dynamic creativity and immanence. It is proposed that opening up to these states of mind is how these artists work with presence. Presence is the sense of being present, here and now; it is also the experience of the self, mediating internal and external environments. The conscious experience of presence is a state of presence-awareness. Presence is the felt sense of being in the world and is understood here through contemporary presence theory and a framework of presence. From formless, to a sense of presence,is the dynamic creative process highlighted by the case study artists. By going beyond the directions of popular culture that define the prevailing art world, these artists bring to our attention invisible dimensions of lifeand nature that can challenge assumptions of practice and process. They have become discordant beacons in a contemporary art context. The philosophy and artistic practice of presence is an area that I contend deserves in-depth focus, and this research adds its contribution...|$|R
