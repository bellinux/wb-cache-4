CCC is produced by Principal <b>Submitting</b> <b>Person</b> ('PSP') being normally the professional architect, professional engineer or building draughtsman. The purpose of CCC is to expedite the development process and its approval for housing projects in Peninsular Malaysia and thus can attract investments. However, the enforcement of CCC may also entail certain side effect problems. These include abusive certifications by the professionals {{to the detriment of}} the purchasers in housing projects. This paper will highlight this problem. The research methodology that will be used in producing this paper is a composite between legal research and qualitative research methodologies. This paper finds that there are certain flaws in the application of CCC. Following this, the author proposes solutions to overcome these flaws in order to give better protections to purchasers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Certification of {{buildings}} {{is one of}} the conditions set by the government to ensure that buildings are constructed to achieve the required standards. This intended to safeguard the interests of the parties involved, especially the buyers. To improve public service delivery while not ignoring the interests of those involved, government held a new system for new building to obtain theirbuilding certification. The new system used calledCertificateCompletion and Compliance (CCC) where the appointed professionals were commonly known as Prinsiple <b>Submitting</b> <b>Person</b> (PSP), which will issue the certificate of the building. This study {{is to look at the}} existing literature related to building certification using PSP services under this CCC method. Literature from both local and overseas were revied in this paper. The authors intend to collect data from respondentsthat is the architects of 337 people and covers 12 local authorities in Selangor (first developed state in Malaysia). All types {{of buildings}} involved in this study. This study uses quantitative methods and qualitative questionnaires through interviews with respondents.

Normally, developers have difficulties obtaining CF for various reasons and excuses. To overcome this problem, the government has introduced a new method in delivery system namely Certificate of Completion and Compliance (CCC) which is the certificate issued by the professional known as Principal <b>Submitting</b> <b>Person</b> (PSP) who has major roles such as submit building plans to the LA for approval. However, after 7 years CCC is implemented, there have several problems arise such as CCC varies from one local authority to another, too much checklist and the procedure are complicated. The data analysis is to achieve 3 objectives of this study mainly are to examine the problems occurs in CCC implementation and to give recommendations on how to overcome the current problems in CCC implementation. To collect and analyse the data, interviews and questionnaire survey was conducted and quantitative data obtained from 50 respondents from the OSC staff and officers, LA and PSP...|$|E

For example, {{it was revealed}} that UNHCR staff in Nairobi extorted money from refugee for resettlement places. Apart from that, large families {{are more likely to be}} considered for resettlement than singles, because resettlement officers have to work through fewer case files per <b>submitted</b> <b>person</b> when referring large families. Also single men, who are likely to receive a more thorough and time consuming security screening from resettlement states, are less likely to be submitted.|$|R

40|$|The Completed of Certificate and Compliance (CCC) {{replaces the}} Certificate of Fitness for Occupation (CFO) {{previously}} {{issued by the}} local authority (PBT). The project’s Principal <b>Submitting</b> <b>Person</b> (PSP) who is a Professional Architect, Professional Engineer or a Registered Building Draughtsman allowed by the Architects Act to issue a CCC for buildings not exceeding two storey’s and an area less than 300 square meters issues the CCC. However, since launched on April 2007, {{the implementation of the}} CCC is still not enough. Base on the pilot study done before, some of people in the local authority, architect and public still not aware of this implementation. Although local authority has started the implementation of this system since a year ago, this new system still has very low awareness among the contractors. It is the government’s view that CCC will cut down on not important procedure and ensure that house buyers and building owners get to move in as quickly as possible without compromising their safety. This is consistent with the government’s desire to encourage selfregulation, which is introduced in the National Economy Growth Planning strategy to continuously enhance the delivery system...|$|E

40|$|Certificate of {{completion}} and compliance (CCC) {{was introduced in}} view of public service delivery system improvement towards transparency, speedy and efficiency to increase national productivity, improve investor confidence in property development as well as upholding people well-being. In CCC, instead of Local Planning Authority (LPA), competent person from professional consultants was given the responsibility to certified on the completion and safety of building. Through self-regulation and certification, the competent persons are required to adhere high standard of professionalism to ensure the success of CCC practice. Hence, the amendment of acts such as Road, Street and Building Act, 1974 (Act 133), Uniform Building by Law, 1984 (UBBL), Architect Act 1967 (Act 117) and Engineer Registration Act, 1967 transferred this accountability to the professional consultants. Nevertheless, inspection and enforcement from LPA and professional bodies {{must be done to}} ensure committed non-compliance actions are effectively supervised and stopped. This research is to study the effectiveness of self-regulation and certification concept by Principle <b>Submitting</b> <b>Person</b> (PSP) through CCC implementation. An audit on approved building plan application and project site inspection was done to inspect the completion of building and its CCC status. The study also covers level of PSP and LPA understanding on the process and procedure of CCC issuance, PSP and LPA roles and responsibilities, and CCC related offences as described in the act. Based on research findings, there are few things was not conformed with procedures {{due to the lack of}} LPA and PSP understanding on CCC or intentionally not comply because of the opportunity to do s...|$|E

40|$|In order {{developers}} {{handing over}} a {{building to the}} client, the building must comply with the various rules and procedures set by the respective local authorities. Before submission for CCC {{can be carried out}} by the developer, it is necessary to get a certificate of completion for the building construction. For this purpose, a more effective system introduced by the Malaysian government namely the Certificate Completion and Compliance (CCC). This system used respective professional services to recommend the issuance of building certificates for the building to be occupied. Under this approach, professional architects and engineer have been identified by government as a profession who is responsible for overseeing the entire project’s development and building that resulting in the issuance of CCC. Appointed architect or engineer called the Principle <b>Submitting</b> <b>Person</b> (PSP). This research uses qualitative method involving seven local authorities as respondents based on the “Snowball Sampling”. This approach asked the last respondents’ opinions on who are the next respondent that are appropriate for interview. The selection of respondents in a row expected to acquire direct information for the subject issue. PBT of Selangor and Malacca only (developed states) was selected and all types of buildings involved in this study. Reliability and normality tests of the variables showed normal distribution and a high level of reliability (above 0. 8). Research results obtained through interview revealed that all respondents agreed that the implementation of the new system CCC is rather effective than the old system. However, to achieved the CCC goal comprehensively the PSP appointed needs to maintain their work ethic and a best practice in ensuring the service provided could be able to satisfy all stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|The Criminal Procedure Law Article 106 (3) {{defines as}} follows. ? When {{the object of}} seizure is {{computer}} disk, or other storage medium of similar digital information, Court should be offered {{in the form of}} a printed document or a copy of digital information only to prove the facts of suspicion. ? However, when it is acknowledged that such method is impossible or it seems hard to achieve the goal of seizure, the Court can confiscate the storage medium to save digital information. The Criminal Procedure Law Article 106 (3) makes ? a principle, and then exceptively allows court to seize the storage medium. The legislative intent is that protecting the fundamental rights of the <b>submitting</b> <b>person</b> should be respected. When the execution of warrant by an investigative agency with a way of ?, generally an investigative agency acquires digital information to prove the facts of suspicion through several stage: (?) acquiring and moving storage medium from storage medium location to an office of an investigative agency or other external sites. (?) making image or logical copy of storage medium, (?) analysis(including search, recovery, etc), (?) acquiring digital informations to prove the facts of suspicion. In such cases, the most important two issues are: When the execution of warrant completed at step (?) or step (?) ? Whether or not in the process of (?), (?), (?), an investigative agency should guarantee the right of continued involvement by persons subject to seizure or their counsel(The Criminal Procedure Law Article 219, 121, 122) ? The Korean Supreme Court in its 2009 mo 1190 decision and 2011 mo 1839 decision clarified that the execution of warrant is completed at step (?) and an investigative agency must guarantee the right of continued involvement by persons subject to seizure or their counsel in the entire process, and prohibited the process of (?), (?), (?) by an investigative agency without the presence of those subject to seizure. Supreme Court’s intent may be to present guidelines to substantively guarantee a suspect’s right to informational self-determination and right of defense. But, on presents another view that the execution of warrant is completed at step (?), because The Criminal Procedure Law Article 106 says that storage medium to save digital information can be the object of seizure, and in the process of (?), (?), (?) by an investigative agency The Criminal Procedure Law Article 121 (execution of warrant and presence of persons subject to seizure or their counsel) can not be applied after step (?) is completed. In this paper, I argue that in the process of (?), (?), (?) an investigative agency must guarantee the right of presence of persons subject to seizure or their counsel, to protect the fundamental rights of person subject to seizure, on the other hand, that the right of presence of persons subject to seizure or their counsel can be excluded when there is a probable cause, for example, interference with the investigatory process by such persons, in order to exercise legitimate state punishment power...|$|E
