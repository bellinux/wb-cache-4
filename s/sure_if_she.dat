25|$|In {{the hours}} after Hades and Zelena return to Storybrooke, Zelena {{goes off to}} find the others and leaves the baby with Hades. While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to {{convince}} them that Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' deception but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades are talking about the others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is not so <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wants to. As Emma, Merida and David find Arthur's body at the Storybrooke Bridge, David tries to calm down a furious Emma, who's trying to protect Storybrooke from Hades' wrath.|$|E
25|$|Bunin's {{first love}} was Varvara Paschenko, his classmate in Yelets, {{daughter}} of a doctor and an actress, whom he fell for in 1889 {{and then went on}} to work with in Oryol in 1892. Their relationship was difficult in many ways: the girl's father detested the union because of Bunin's impecunious circumstances, Varvara herself was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted to marry and Bunin too was uncertain whether marriage was really appropriate for him. The couple moved to Poltava and settled in Yuly Bunin's home, but by 1892 their relations deteriorated, Pashchenko complaining in a letter to Yuli Bunin that serious quarrels were frequent, and begging for assistance in bringing their union to an end. The affair eventually ended in 1894 with her marrying actor and writer A.N. Bibikov, Ivan Bunin's close friend. Bunin felt betrayed, and for a time his family feared the possibility of his committing suicide. According to some sources it was Varvara Paschenko who many years later would appear under the name of Lika in The Life of Arseniev (chapter V of the book, entitled Lika, was also published as a short story). Scholar Tatyana Alexandrova, though, questioned this identification (suggesting Mirra Lokhvitskaya might have been the major prototype), while Vera Muromtseva thought of Lika as a 'collective' character aggregating the writer's reminiscences of several women he knew in his youth.|$|E

Alexis then embarrasses the staff by {{suggesting}} Anna Nicole Smith. Daniel later finds her crying (her face is streaked with mascara). Daniel consoles her, and reminds her she’s in the men’s room.|$|R
50|$|Robert Cole (Albert Brooks) is a Hollywood {{film editor}} {{right in the}} middle of cutting a new science fiction film with George Kennedy. His {{relationship}} with very patient bank executive Mary Harvard (Kathryn Harrold) is caught between undying devotion and endless agony. It's all because selfish Robert is a bit of a self-involved neurotic who can't quite decide if their relationship is meant to be, mainly because he's not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> the one or there's someone else.|$|R

"I am not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever {{became a}} Catholic herself {{but it was}} not long before she asked me to {{instruct}} two of her children, one of them being the future erratic genius, Oscar Wilde.

500|$|Grace Adler (Debra Messing), heavily pregnant, {{is having}} bizarre {{dreams of the}} future in which she and her gay friend and roommate Will Truman (Eric McCormack) are an old couple raising their child. In her dream, Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) is married to actor Kevin Bacon, and Karen Walker (Megan Mullally)—who has not aged (her explanation: [...] "Money")—is now in a {{relationship}} with her maid Rosario Salazar (Shelley Morrison). In Grace's real life, however, her relationship with Will is complicated. Grace is not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wants {{to spend the rest of}} her life living with Will. When her ex-husband Marvin [...] "Leo" [...] Markus (Harry Connick, Jr.) shows up and proposes to her—unaware she is pregnant with his child—she immediately accepts. Will feels betrayed, and stops speaking to her.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would finish her novel {{or if it}} would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E
60|$|She {{could see}} that now. <b>She</b> felt <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> told him she did not wish ever {{to see him again}} he would never appear before her. But what would he do? She was not in the least afraid of him, but his fierce earnestness frightened her, not for herself, but for him. Suddenly a thought struck her.|$|R

[...] "But I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> meant {{to trust me}} at all, she meant to trust to my {{discretion}} in the whole matter; and--Jack Lumley," [...] I added, getting up and grasping my friend's hand, [...] "if I cannot trust you I can trust nobody." ...|$|R

Some {{authorities}} now speculate that she suffered from Sydenham's chorea or Saint Vitus Dance, a neurological movement disorder characterized by abrupt, involuntary movements.

Her father restricts her freedom, unprepared to lose his daughter once more. In the middle of all this stress, {{on the night of the}} royal banquet, Eugene publicly proposes to Rapunzel, but she rejects it, feeling she is not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is [...] interested to stay at the palace after marriage and that she needs to sort out her life first. On that night, she is sneaked out from the kingdom by her lady-in-waiting, Cassandra, so that she can get her mind off her problems. When Cassandra shows her the place where the mystical golden flower that saved her mother and herself was found, she touches one of the mystical rock spikes that started to sprout around a year ago, causing her [...] 70 feet long blonde hair to grow back, and possessing new abilities. The story continues as she is confronted by a known enemy of the kingdom on her coronation day, and is forbidden to leave the walls of Corona without her father's consent. In her bedchamber, Rapunzel is determined to fill her journal with her own adventures, and solve the mystery of her hair's miraculous return.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{the parole}} board held a 16-minute hearing and {{concluded}} that his release {{would not be in}} the best interest of the community or his own personal safety. On the 26th anniversary of Lennon's death, Yoko Ono published a one-page advertisement in several newspapers saying that December 8 should be a [...] "day of forgiveness," [...] and that she was not yet <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was ready to forgive Chapman.|$|E
2500|$|For several years, Reddy {{maintained}} {{that she would}} not return to the stage. In 2008, she stated, [...] "It's not going to happen. I've moved on," [...] and explained that her voice had deepened to a lower key and she wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would be able to sing some of her hits. She also said she had simply lost interest in performing. [...] "I have very wide-ranging interests," [...] she said. [...] "So, singing 'Leave Me Alone' 43 times per song lost its charm a long time ago." ...|$|E

60|$|In the end, Grace did go, {{a little}} puzzled and {{doubtful}} still, but thankful beyond words {{to escape the}} drudgery of the counter and the noise and heat of the city.

5000|$|The {{music video}} premiered on July 13, 2011 on E! News, {{and it was}} {{released}} by VEVO on July 14, 2011. Soon after the premiere, Lovato spoke with Ryan Seacrest {{in an exclusive interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest. The video was met with a positive reception. James Montgomery of MTV News was very positive on the video—especially the scene when Lovato looks into the camera and almost breaks into tears. Montgomery said, [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> acting or not, but I doubt it, and really, it's not like it matters. Not when a singer connects to a song on such a visceral level, especially one who's already been through the wringer." [...] He concluded, [...] "there's some dramatically billowing fabrics and some shattered glass, but really, the song is the star. And that simplicity is perfect here, because the song provides all the pyrotechnics necessary." ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2008, Meyer's adult sci-fi novel The Host, was {{released}} by the adult division of Little, Brown and Company. It follows the story of Melanie Stryder and Wanderer, a young woman and an invading alien [...] "soul," [...] who are forced to work as one. The Host debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for 26 weeks. Meyer has said that she is working on additional books in The Host series and that she intends to write a trilogy, with {{the second and third}} books being called [...] "The Soul" [...] and [...] "The Seeker", respectively. In a Q session in Kansas City, Meyer stated that she has outlines for the sequels and has done some writing on them, but she has some qualms since The Host universe is a [...] "dangerous place" [...] where characters might die, and she is not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wants to kill them off.|$|E

[...] "The fact is, Mr Denham, I feel {{it to be}} my duty {{to tell you that}} there ain't a sound plank or timber in her from stem to stern, and I'm pretty <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> costs you money, she's likely to cost me and the men aboard of her our lives.

6000|$|... "Ah;--of that I know nothing. He, {{with his}} perversity, has estranged her. But I am <b>sure</b> of this,--that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> do not marry him, she will marry no one. But {{it is not}} on account of him that I speak. He must fight his own battles now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well--I'll {{withdraw}} the tongue, though I'm <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't {{do it when}} I was in the room, she did the minute I was outside.

60|$|Sir Henry, duly {{instructed}} as to {{the weaknesses}} customary to old men, thought his wife would be his best weapon--his <b>surest</b> dodge. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> could be got to be attentive and affectionate to her grandfather, to visit him, and flatter him, and hover about him, much might be done. So thought Sir Henry. But do what he might, Lady Harcourt would not assist him. It {{was not part of}} her bargain that she should toady an old man who had never shown any special regard for her.|$|R
6000|$|Well, I'm glad, I am <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> Fanny supposes <b>she's</b> happy. [...] I've {{no doubt}} her lover {{is good and}} noble--as men go.

60|$|Mrs. Poynsett {{of course}} {{declared}} her complete comfort in her five sons, but Lady Susan was <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had {{had as many}} boys, instead of one son and four daughters, {{she should have been}} worn out. Lorimer was a dear, affectionate fellow. Those he loved could guide him with a leash of gossamer, but young men in his position were exposed to so many temptations! There ensued a little sighing over the evils of wealth; and to see and hear the two ladies, no one would have thought that Julia Poynsett had married a young man for love--Susan Lorimer an old man for independence.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{accomplished}} some good, however," [...] continued the girl. [...] "Ingua is much happier and more content.

6000|$|Nearly two {{doses of}} the {{antidote}} were still left.
