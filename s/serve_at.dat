He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E

The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and keep being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> the castle.|$|E

Trying to get past Nico Hülkenberg on the inside of turn five, Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg, who hit the wall but was able to continue, though {{at the back of the}} field. Alonso was reprimanded with a five-second penalty to <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> his first pit stop. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado, damaging his front wing. Massa came into the pit lane for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound. Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps, eventually retiring on lap seven.|$|E

Arriving there in November 1859, the priest performed his first baptism among the local people the following month. Belcourt built a parish hall out of stone (which was used into the 1950s) and established the Farmers' Bank of Rustico. He founded a high school, where he taught until recruiting a teacher from Montreal to the island. The priest created a study group, the members of which had to agree to be teetotalers. He established a parish library, built {{with the assistance of}} 1,000 French francs a year from Emperor Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon I. In October 1865, Belcourt resigned from his position at the parish at Rustico, and {{returned to}} Quebec for some weeks.|$|E

5|$|In early November 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy {{selected}} Critchfield to be {{head of the}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. McElroy {{hoped that}} Critchfield {{would be able to}} fix the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without pay, with the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading an agency that did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1914 Rowell and {{his classmates}} were {{commissioned}} as first lieutenants in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time, Rowell's class {{had not yet}} completed its military training. The AIF's commander, Major General William Throsby Bridges, decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he allotted the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the AIF, rather than as staff officers. The cost of this decision was high; of the 134 commissioned in time to <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> the front, 42 were killed and 38 wounded. Cadets were posted to units being formed in their home states, so Rowell was posted to the 10th Infantry Battalion. When he discovered that the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was {{to be commanded by}} his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel F. M. Rowell, Sydney obtained permission to swap places with another member of his Duntroon class Lieutenant Eric Wilkes Talbot Smith. It was a fateful decision; Smith was fatally wounded on Anzac Day.|$|E

5|$|Stuart William Morgan, a 36-year-old {{lorry driver}} from Poole, Dorset, {{was arrested in}} February 1996 after a {{colleague}} recognised his image from a photofit. Morgan was later charged with Figard's murder, and convicted in October. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a life sentence, with a recommendation to <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 {{was rejected by the}} Court of Appeal, and in 2009 the High Court turned down his application for a review of the length of his sentence. He became eligible for parole in February 2016, and has continued to maintain his innocence.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} the case did not damage Laforey's career: his junior {{officers}} were promoted after the action and he was given command of the larger frigate HMS Aimable. He went on to <b>serve</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Trafalgar and become a full admiral {{before his death in}} 1835. However, historian Tom Wareham has speculated that the legal case was probably the reason that Laforey was denied the knighthood that customarily accompanied a successful frigate action {{at this stage of the}} war. More than five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from Carysfort still living in 1847.|$|E
