The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original <b>slow</b> <b>scan</b> source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} multilayer and bilayer Ni/Si {{thin films}} by nanodifferential scanning calorimetry nano-DSC at ultrarapid scan rates, in a temperature-time regime not accessible with conventional apparatus. DSC experiments were completed at <b>slower</b> <b>scan</b> rates as well, {{where it was}} possible to conduct parallel rapid thermal annealing experiments for comparison. Postexperimental characterization was accomplished by x-ray diffraction, and by transmission electron microscopy TEM and energy-filtered TEM of thin cross sections prepared by focused ion beam milling. We found that rate of heating has a profound effect on the resulting microstructure, {{as well as on the}} DSC signal. After heating to 560 °C at 120 °C /s, the general microstructure of the multilayer was preserved, in spite of extensive interdiffusion of Ni and Si. By contrast, after heating to 560 °C at 16 000 °C /s, the multilayer films were completely homogeneous with no evidence of the original multilayer microstructure. For the <b>slower</b> <b>scan</b> rates, we interpret the results as indicating a solid state diffusion-nucleation-growth process. At the higher scan rates, we suggest that the temperature increased so rapidly that a metastable liquid was first formed, resulting in complete intermixing of the multilayer, followed by crystallization to form solid phases.
