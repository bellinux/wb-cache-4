2500|$|Cobra Commander's {{figure is}} briefly {{featured}} in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures {{to set up a}} battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. As he imagined the characters in his head, he observed the [...] "core of Cobra Command" [...] atop an oak toy chest, high above the thick <b>shag</b> <b>carpet,</b> and [...] "the hooded Cobra Commander, looking like a blue klansman, was loading his black laser pistol and making small talk with Destro".|$|E
2500|$|On a knotted {{pile carpet}} (formally, a [...] "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" [...] carpet), the {{structural}} weft threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises {{at right angles}} {{to the surface of the}} weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knot types (see below), such as <b>shag</b> <b>carpet</b> which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible <b>shag</b> <b>carpet.</b> He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E

He eventually accrued around 200 employees and offices in Akron, Ohio and Southern California.

The bulk of his photography during this time took place west of the Rocky Mountains and in the Pacific Northwest.|$|R
5000|$|During the mid-1970s, {{with the}} {{popularity}} of deep <b>shag</b> <b>carpeting,</b> a rake attachment called the Shag King, was attached {{in front of the}} carpet nozzle to lift and align the nap while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models.

5000|$|Development of Buckner Terrace {{north of}} Interstate 30 was {{undertaken}} in 1965.

The development north of Interstate 30 was spearheaded by Buckner Park, Inc., and was headed by developer Wayne Claycomb. The mid-1960s built homes in the neighborhood were advertised as being equipped for gas and featuring a gas light in front of each home. Wood-paneled dens, <b>shag</b> <b>carpeting,</b> and wood-burning fireplaces were advertised features of many homes during this period.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{marked a}} period of decline for the aging luxury hotel, renamed as the Cabana Hotel in 1972. A new rooftop sign {{advertising}} the hotel was then added, along with a main hotel sign. The original ornate carpets were now replaced with <b>shag</b> <b>carpets,</b> and dropped ceilings were added. The economy had slowed, and a shift {{of attention to the}} northern end of town left older hotels, such as the Cabana, struggling. The scene was typical nationwide, as corporate mergers and new projects prompted the closing of many old buildings.|$|R

5000|$|The Creeping Terror (1964), {{directed}} by Vic Savage (under the pseudonym A. J.

What appears to be <b>shag</b> <b>carpet</b> is draped over several actors shambling about at a snail's pace, thus bringing the monstrous [...] "creeping terror" [...] to the screen.

5000|$|Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and complimented its [...] "crisp, precise harmonies that imply {{explosive}} vocal power but display few pyrotechnics", adding that [...] "Shai joins the spiritual yearnings of Take Six with the secular pull of Boyz II Men". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly found its hip hop and new jack swing-oriented songs [...] "fussy and unconvincing", but praised the group's crooning and stated, [...] "They wrap their voices like a thick <b>shag</b> <b>carpet</b> around the choruses of the album's languorous, starry-eyed ballads".|$|E

50|$|The 1962 Ambassador {{received}} a new front end {{that was very}} similar to the 1961-62 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and Ambassador lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added {{at the top of the}} line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl bucket seats, headrests, and color coordinated <b>shag</b> <b>carpets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{book about}} the popular history of the 1970s {{introduces}} it as the decade of [...] "pet rocks, <b>shag</b> <b>carpets,</b> platform shoes and the AMC Gremlin." [...] It is among the cars that {{people who were in}} high school in the late 1970s and early 1980s would be familiar with because {{it was one of the}} first cars they drove and among most often seen in student parking lots. Kiplinger's personal finance magazine, Changing Times, listed the AMC Gremlin as first among the best subcompact used cars as [...] "selected by top mechanics for good value, good service." [...] Five years after the Gremlin's introduction, the mechanics liked the six-cylinder engine and most preferred automatic transmission. Comments included, [...] "I have one. It's the greatest. I own one with a 304 V-8 engine. Have no trouble outside of normal maintenance." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fury {{was offered}} in three basic {{subseries}} for 1975 in sedans and coupes and {{two for the}} station wagon.

In addition to the Road Runner, the Fury coupes were offered in base, Custom and Sport models. The [...] "Sport" [...] was the top-line coupe featuring body pinstriping on the upper door and front and rear fenders, interiors with all-vinyl bucket seats and center cushion and armrest, or optional center console; or split bench seats with armrest, along with plusher <b>shag</b> <b>carpeting</b> on floor and door panels plus lower door carpeting.
