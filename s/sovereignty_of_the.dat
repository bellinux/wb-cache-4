5|$|Since Johor {{could not}} have ceded Singapore island and the islets in its {{vicinity}} to the British if it lacked title to them, this was evidence that the United Kingdom recognised the prior and continuing <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johor Sultanate over all islands {{in and around the}} Singapore Strait.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said {{that there would be no}} further talks over the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E

5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Malta has a {{long and}} rich history, and this is {{reflected}} in the island's cultural attractions. The Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans and the Byzantines have all occupied Malta at some point in history, leaving a mix of many different architectural styles and artifacts to explore. The <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights Hospitaller over Malta from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout Malta. The country's modern museums and art galleries feature relics from Malta's history for tourists and Maltese residents alike to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, {{and have}} caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office named a {{previously}} unnamed area Queen Elizabeth Land {{in tribute to}} Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim. Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby Falkland Islands, and the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.|$|E

5|$|The United States also observes tribal <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Indian {{nations to}} a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. {{citizens}} and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland {{and made a}} peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. The reconciliation led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and interregnum of 1917–1919 {{gave way to the}} Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|When General Andrew Jackson {{tried and}} {{executed}} two British agents during the First Seminole War in Spanish-held Florida, it precipitated the Great Seminole Debate of 1818–1819 in Congress, with some claiming he exceeded his orders from President James Monroe and demanding his censure. Floyd, however, supported Jackson's actions, maintaining he had acted {{according to precedent}} and his orders. He also denied the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seminole tribes.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though it}} had lost its {{defensive}} role, {{it was one of}} the strongest fortresses in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland up until the Second Partition of Poland of April 21, 1793. when both Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle and the city were transferred to the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire. On the same day, the castle's commandant gave up the key to the castle and swore allegiance to the empire in the city's cathedral. One hundred and one artillery cannons later saluted the commandant's decision inside the castle. During the French invasion of Russia of 1812, the Russian Imperial Army was stationed in the castle. In 1815, Konstantin Batyushkov, who later became a well-known poet and writer, was stationed as an officer in the castle. In 1846, poet Vladimir Raevsky was stationed in the castle, during which time he established a pro-Decembrist organization of progressively-minded army officers.|$|E
5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the last great political question of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political struggles of the early republic was to eliminate the privileged status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. The institution of the Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E
5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI {{stated that}} as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was little chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the ground station could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archipelago.|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 1846, the Oregon Treaty {{was signed}} with Great Britain, which settled {{the dispute over}} <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Country. On August 13, 1848 the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory out of the land between California and the 49th {{parallel}} (this served as the border with Britain's North American colonies) and west of the Rocky Mountains. A new bicameral territorial legislature was created with an upper chamber Council and lower chamber House. These bodies {{met for the first}} time on July 16, 1849, with some members of the provisional legislature continuing into the new government, including David Hill, Asa Lovejoy, Samuel Parker, and Absalom J. Hembree. Upon statehood in 1859, the territorial legislature would be transformed into the Oregon Legislative Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Owing to its location, Klis Fortress was an {{important}} defensive position during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. The fortress stands along the route by which the Ottomans could penetrate the mountain barrier separating the coastal lowlands from around Split, from Ottoman-held Bosnia. The Croat feudal lord Petar Kružić gathered together a garrison composed of Croat refugees, who used the base at Klis both to hold the Ottomans at bay, and to engage in marauding and piracy against coastal shipping. Although nominally accepting the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand, who obtained the Croatian crown in 1527, Kružić and his freebooting Uskoks were a law unto themselves.|$|E

The Northern Epirote side also demanded the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language to include the regions around Vlorë and Durrës (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of Northern Epirus and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam {{throughout}} the region. The region was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate {{for the next}} few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for a period of twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16thcentury, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman. The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17thcenturies; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.|$|E

These understandings did not last, however, and the Mongol Great Khan, Möngke, issued a directive to his brother Hulagu to extend the realms of the empire to the Nile River. The latter raised an army of 120,000 and in 1258, sacked Baghdad and slaughtered its inhabitants, including Caliph al-Musta'sim {{and most of his}} family after the Ayyubids failed to assemble an army to protect the city. That same year the Ayyubids lost Diyar Bakr to the Mongols.|$|E
5|$|Tyler was {{not only}} the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency, but at age 51, was the youngest president to that point. One of the main political principles he was guided by was states' rights, and he opposed a national bank, that the Whigs wanted to help develop the country, but which Tyler saw as an imposition on the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states. Tyler vetoed two bills to establish a national bank. Whig leaders, who wanted such a bank, saw political advantage in a breach with him. In September 1841, most of Tyler's cabinet resigned and Whig congressional leaders expelled him from the party.|$|E
