25|$|Princess Lolowah has {{dedicated}} {{her life to}} improving the welfare of women in Saudi Arabia, especially {{in the field of}} education. She {{has been a member of}} the Al Nahdah Philanthropic Society for Women in Riyadh since 1970. From 1990 to 1999, she assisted her mother, Queen Iffat in supervising the Dar Al Hanan School in Jeddah, the first private female high school in Saudi Arabia. Along with her mother and siblings, she helped found Effat College (now Effat University) in 1999. She was involved in all the phases of the college's founding, from raising funds, developing the curriculum, overseeing construction to the hiring of faculty and staff. She currently serves as the university's Vice Chair of the Board of Founders and Board of Trustees, and General Supervisor. <b>She</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to be photographed by Western media for the first time in 2005.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. <b>She</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E
500|$|... has endeavoured to {{describe}} a young woman, prompted in all her doings by a conscience wide awake, guided by principle, willing, if need be, to sacrifice herself, struggling always to keep herself from doing wrong, but yet causing infinite grief to others, and nearly bringing herself to utter shipwreck, because, for a while, <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> {{to believe that it}} would be right for her to marry a man whom she did not love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such engagements, Arabella," [...] he said, [...] "should {{always be}} {{authenticated}} {{by a third}} party. It is for that reason that a girl generally refers her lover to her father before <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> to be considered as engaged." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing is hateful to me. I {{have never}} spoken of hate. I shall always feel the strongest regard for {{my old friend}} and playfellow. But {{there are many things}} which a woman is bound to {{consider}} before <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> so to love a man that she can consent to become his wife." ...|$|R
500|$|Krause {{deemed the}} revelation of Adele's moving on [...] "an {{interesting}} twist, with unexpected repercussions", whereas Stevens' offering Bailey the money to open the free clinic, was negatively reviewed; looked upon as the most predictable event of the episode. Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that [...] "it {{would have been nice}} {{to learn more about the}} severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell." [...] In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: [...] "No one bothered to really mention that it would have been nice, had it been caught earlier. It was, but <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to deteriorate." [...] The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed [...] "a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for", but also a proof of [...] "how damaged Meredith really is". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: [...] "Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's probably right and should likely run in the opposite direction." [...] Considering each of the attending physcians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as [...] "hilarious, but a tad unbelievable", whereas assessing that Montgomery's [...] "great traits" [...] might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as [...] "certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow". Krause characterized the whole as [...] "one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to".|$|E
500|$|... is a Pulsian seeress hailing {{from the}} {{city-state}} of Paddra on Gran Pulse {{prior to the}} time of the War of Transgression, having written Analects relating to the event, Etro, Ragnarok, and the Eidolons. In the novel Fragments After, it is shown that Yeul was the first human created, and that for some unknown reason her soul does not fade after reaching the afterlife. Taking pity on her, Etro gives Yeul the ability to see the future, called the Eyes of Etro, and enables her to be continuously reincarnated throughout history. Though meant for the best, Yeul's ability to see the future becomes a curse, since each vision drains her lifeforce and she consequently always dies in her teens. Because of her fate, Caius Ballad, who had seen each Yeul live and die since before the War of Transgression, makes it his goal to destroy Etro and end time itself so Yeul would no longer die. Despite this, Yeul remains supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, and it is later revealed that <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to be reborn in order to be with Caius. Only one manifestation of Yeul is openly hostile towards the travelers and resentful of her fate. In Lightning Returns, the many versions of Yeul take up residence in the ruins of Etro's temple, with Caius as their guardian. It is revealed that Yeul's constant reincarnation caused her soul to fragment, with each previous life mingled with the Chaos and triggered the events of XIII-2. As the world ends, the souls of Yeul choose to stay and become the new goddess of death to restore the cycle of life Etro established. The final incarnation, who shares a strong bond with Noel and wishes for a new life, is allowed to leave and live as a normal human. Yeul is voiced by Amber Hood in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|Magliocco {{also saw}} {{herself as an}} insider because <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to {{experience}} the altered states of consciousness that contemporary Pagan rituals are reported to induce. As she stated, [...] "I take an experiential approach to the extraordinary experiences" [...] that occur in ritual, and that the [...] "essence {{of this approach is}} twofold". The first part of this involved the [...] "conscious, willing, and full participation in ritual experiences intended to induce alternate states of consciousness, and the interpretation of visions and dreams" [...] as different ways of interpreting life. The second part of this [...] "mandates that I consider informants' experiences seriously" [...] when they discuss altered states of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Although fearful {{and without}} sexual experience, <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> {{to be guided}} to a bedroom, where in the {{darkness}} a being she cannot see makes her his wife. She gradually learns {{to look forward to}} his visits, though he always departs before sunrise and forbids her to look upon him, and soon she becomes pregnant.|$|R
50|$|Betsy is {{overcome}} with excitement when {{her best friend}} (Nikki Valdez) and her boyfriend set Betsy up {{on a date with}} Michael. However, when they finally meet, Michael {{turns out to be the}} exact opposite of her ideal man. But Betsy doesn't let herself become disheartened, instead <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> to fall in love with the real Michael.|$|R
5000|$|Annataz Arataz, Zatanna's evil Earth-3 counterpart, assists Superman-Prime {{to detain}} and torment Mr. Mxyzptlk in Countdown to Final Crisis #23. The imp refuses to provide Prime with information, and Annataz restores his powers. Reflecting upon her own prior cruel actions, <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> {{to be killed}} by the enraged villain. Her spells are recited [...] "upside-down", rather than backwards.|$|R
2500|$|... "As {{long as he}} had his mistresses, {{things were}} better, but since the last one was exiled because <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to be insolent towards the King, {{and he has not}} {{provided}} himself with a new one, his temperament has grown worse, and I have daily been subjected to outbursts because of this, which has occurred even in front of the staff. This hostility have increased so much during the winter that I have reached the end of my patience." [...] She expressed her view upon love and sexuality and when Gustav III studied certain letters after his late mother in the company of others, as they contained information regarding the alleged love affair between his mother Queen Louisa Ulrika av Count Carl Gustaf Tessin, and the complaints from Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden over the attention Tessin gave his consort:" [...] It is undoubtedly so, that these papers can give reason for reflection; it does lead me to consider how easily a poor woman is judged and how unfortunate it is to have a heart filled with emotion, for a tender nature is a misfortune as well as a blessing, and no human can resist the power of love, even though friendship must at times be the comfort for the wise one, yes, nothing is more true than the inscription who were once placed upon the image of God of Love: 'Eho you are, her is your true master, he has been, he is and always will be.' You have to admit, my dear friend, that woman is truly an unhappy creature: while men have their complete freedom, she is always burdened by prejudice and circumstance; you may say, that men also have that hindrance, but it is not in equal degree. I am convinced that most women would ask for nothing more than to be transformed to men to escape the unhappy bondage and enjoy their full freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] said Mrs. Holt, with the angry tone which <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> {{to use only}} when {{speaking}} of Mr. Western.|$|E

[...] "For {{the sake of}} the neighbors, I had rather you played the fool in my study than upon my doorstep at this hour. Walk upstairs quietly if you please. My housekeeper is a hard-working woman: the little sleep <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> must not be disturbed." ...|$|R
25|$|Honesty differs {{greatly from}} Jaya's two {{previous}} major albums {{released in the}} Philippines, 1996's Jaya and 1997's In the Raw. Though, as before, Honesty contains mostly passionate, easy-listening love songs, this time out her approach is more intimate. She doesn't add many soulful flourishes as before, nor does <b>she</b> <b>allow</b> <b>herself</b> to soar passionately to the heavens, which she often did on her previous albums.|$|R
5000|$|Erlewine called Give Up the Ghost {{one even}} better than The Story, saying [...] "Give Up the Ghost opens up and breathes, never removes the {{spotlight}} from Carlile, who remains a singularly powerful singer/songwriter. When things are Spartan, her voice is haunting and gripping, wrenching out operatic emotions, but Give Up the Ghost trumps The Story because <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> to lighten up, to rock again on 'Dreams' [...] ".|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> {{to be led}} along, {{and when}} they had reached {{the other side of}} the Avenue, Stephen Weiss, {{speaking}} earnestly, and stooping a little towards her, commenced his explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Our good Archbishop!' she sobbed, when <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to speak, and to {{give way}} to a burst of tears. 'Ah, the martyr! Ah, the good pastor! The miserable--But no--my poor people, they knew not what they did!' ...|$|E
60|$|Constance {{might really}} {{have liked to}} read more tales than <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself.</b> The House on the Marsh tempted her, but she was true to the advice she had received, and Rose Rollstone upheld her in her resolution.|$|E
6000|$|But when Alison {{came home}} {{she found her}} more {{depressed}} than <b>she</b> had <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to be for years, and on asking {{what was the matter}} was answered-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Fan {{wondered}} whether Mary [...] "did not quite mean it" [...] {{when she told}} her what the consequences would be if <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to love Miss Churton. No, alas! she must have meant that very seriously {{from the way she}} spoke.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Jones {{was still}} {{thoroughly}} a Saxon, {{although she had}} lived {{for so many years}} among the Celts. But it was only when she was quite alone that <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> the indulgence of so peculiarly Saxon a mode of expressing either her surprise or indignation.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> {{to be led}} off the Falcon and to the depot. [...] "Your face is full of tears," [...] said Baxter. [...] "Here, {{put this}} veil over it," [...] and she was glad enough to do as bidden, that folks might not stare at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray {{speak to}} her, Lady Eustace. You {{see it is}} getting so late, and {{she ought to be}} nearly dressed now. Of course <b>she</b> must <b>allow</b> <b>herself</b> to be dressed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, {{you have}} found your match," [...] {{pronounced}} little Jessie, whom the scene appeared greatly to edify. Rose had heard the whole with an unmoved face. She now said, [...] "No; Miss Helstone is not my mother's match, for <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> to be vexed. My mother would wear her out in a few weeks. Shirley Keeldar manages better.--Mother, you have never hurt Miss Keeldar's feelings yet. She wears armour under her silk dress that you cannot penetrate." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Musick was {{diagnosed}} with spinal cancer on November 8, 1973, and died July 2, 1974; {{in the interests of}} medical progress, <b>she</b> had <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to be subjected to experimental treatments.|$|R
60|$|But {{sometimes}} at the sleepiest moment sleep is driven away by an accident. The accident {{in this case}} was that the nurse before finally dropping off remembered that she was nursing a sick man, and sat up to look at him before <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to drop off.|$|E
60|$|Clara, however, dried the tea-things, and {{was glad}} to be on such good terms with his mother; but it was torture {{not to be able to}} follow him down the garden. At last <b>she</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> to go; she felt as if a rope were taken off her ankle.|$|E
60|$|Her {{shoulders}} shook convulsively {{under his}} hands, which he laid on her paternally. His straggly, wiry moustache brushed her forehead in a good-night kiss.

50|$|Laura Landon is a {{sheltered}} freshman at a fictional university in a midwestern town. Intensely shy and introverted, she {{is drawn to}} the president of the Student Union, Beth Cullison. Beth is outgoing and friendly, experienced socially (with men, particularly) but feels a void in her life. She doesn't understand how the other girls are so fulfilled by the men in their lives, despite having tried. Every time <b>she</b> <b>allows</b> <b>herself</b> to be intimate with one, she breaks it off out of disappointment.|$|R
50|$|Days later, {{they meet}} again outdoors. Suzanne says <b>she</b> cannot <b>allow</b> <b>herself</b> to want Peter. He says he understands {{how she feels}} but {{does not want to}} lose her, but Suzanne ends the {{relationship}} anyway.|$|R
