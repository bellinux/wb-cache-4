One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman <b>she</b> <b>loves.</b> <b>The</b> play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E

Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she can hear the new Yonah inside her, and that <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.|$|E

25|$|Scotland under King James V (reigned 1513–1542) {{was in a}} {{state of}} unrest. Amongst the rebels were Douglas (Elena's father), Rodrigo (to whom she has been betrothed) and Malcolm (whom <b>she</b> <b>loves).</b> <b>The</b> King is in the habit of going about his lands {{disguised}} as Uberto. Seeing Elena he instantly falls in love with her, but she repels his advances stating that he is confusing hospitality and friendship for romantic interest. In the meantime he has realised that she is related to his enemies. The clans gather to overthrow the king, and Rodrigo and Douglas discover Elena's secret love for Malcolm. She tries to keep the peace, but the call to arms diverts the soldiers. The battle does not go well, and Rodrigo is killed. Again the king in disguise encounters Elena and gives her a ring to take to the king if she is ever in trouble. She decides to use it and goes to Stirling Castle where she finds that both Malcolm and Douglas are prisoners. She pleads their cases, and the king magnanimously pardons them and blesses the union, now unimpeded by Rodrigo, between Elena and Malcolm.|$|E

60|$|The {{next spring}} we were married, and I brought {{her home to}} my gray old {{homestead}} on the gray old harbor shore. A lonely place for a young bride, said Avonlea people. Nay, it was not so. She was happy here, even in my absences. <b>She</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> great, restless harbor and the vast, misty sea beyond; <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> tides, keeping their world-old tryst with the shore, and the gulls, and the croon of the waves, and {{the call of the}} winds in the fir woods at noon and even; <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> moonrises and the sunsets, and the clear, calm nights when the stars seemed to have fallen into the water and to be a little dizzy from such a fall. <b>She</b> <b>loved</b> these things, even as I did.

25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, also finding moments to steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E

[...] She explains in an interview that she was particularly influenced by the historical fiction of Rosemary Sutcliff as well as the fantasies of Ursula K.

500|$|The {{piece is}} one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs {{of the law and}} the legal profession, based on his short {{experience}} as a barrister. It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since [...] "he is such a very bad lot," [...] while the plaintiff argues that <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> defendant fervently and seeks [...] "substantial damages." [...] After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, Fred, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of La Périchole. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.|$|E

500|$|Back in Scranton, {{the party}} {{planning}} continues to go poorly. Dwight publicly and loudly confronts Kelly about {{her time in}} juvenile hall, {{which turns out to}} be for stealing the boat of an ex-boyfriend when she was 14. Kelly also declares she hates the cake Jim picked for her, which is completely blank; he later decorates it and spells her name incorrectly as [...] "Kelley". When Kelly insists the party needs a theme, Jim and Dwight are unable to think of anything.

Meanwhile, Angela appears much happier than usual because she bought a new $7,000 cat with the money she received from selling Andy's engagement ring. She has also set up a nanny cam so she can monitor the cats from work. However, she is horrified to see one of her other cats having sex with the new cat, and rushes home to stop it. Later, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar (Oscar Nunez) watch Angela arrive home on the nanny cam screen, and become disgusted when Angela starts licking the cat to help clean it. Angela eventually returns to work and coughs up a hairball. Oscar claims the image will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

Angelina believes she's Barbra Streisand mixed with Celine Dion." [...] The character is described as an alter ego by DeGarmo. DeGarmo revealed that she was having a [...] "blast" [...] picking out costumes for the over-the-top part: [...] "Her hair and make-up are icing on the cake" [...] she stated. Additionally, she noted that [...] "Angelina’s style has taken a few notes from the cast of Jersey Shore." [...] Comparing Angelina to herself, she said: [...] "There are some things that I, Diana, would be too terrified to walk out of the house wearing, but Angelina is not afraid." [...] She is also described as a [...] "mafia princess". DeGarmo said: [...] "You never know what she's going to do, which keeps everyone on their toes. One minute she's nice, the next she snaps". According to DeGarmo, Angelina is fully aware that her father is a mob boss and: [...] "she doesn't mind. She likes throwing around her weight at any time. <b>She</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> perks of being a mob boss's daughter. She lives for it." [...] Also, her character was probably based off of Angela Viracco, in the 1985 movie The Last Dragon.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by {{the works}} of Henrik Ibsen, Tot înainte depicts life in the fictional arms {{industry}} of Clermont-Ferrand. The young industrialist Jean Héquet intervenes to save the livelihoods of his employees, taking over management from his intransigent father. As a political manifesto, it seemingly favors class collaboration, but, as Călinescu notes, [...] "seems to be rather communistic in spirit." [...] According to Massoff, it was read as [...] "a play with socialist undertones". In Bestia, called by Călinescu [...] "an intellectual play with a confusing exposition", the divorcée Ninetta Coman displays her seemingly visceral misandry. Her viciousness is confronted by an idealistic husband, who (Faifer notes) is an [...] "artificial" [...] character. Towards {{the end of the}} play, Ninetta is revealed to have been the long-suffering victim of sexual violence, and to have undergone a voluntary hysterectomy.
