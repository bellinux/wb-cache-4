A <b>switch</b> <b>of</b> 4,979 <b>votes</b> out <b>of</b> nearly 1.4 million cast, however, would have made Lambert {{governor}} by a one-vote margin. Lambert was the first Louisiana Democrat to lose to a Republican candidate in a statewide general election, popularly called the runoff.|$|R

50|$|The Farmers' Association {{convened in}} Columbia on March 27 and {{immediately}} a call {{was made by}} W. Jasper Talbert to vote on proceeding with nominations for the statewide ticket. However, the tally from the delegates was 116 votes against nominations and 115 for nominations. Nevertheless, Talbert turned a one-vote defeat into a six-vote victory by <b>switching</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> delegates without their consent and allowing <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> an unseated delegation from Beaufort County. The official vote to proceed with nominations stood at 120 to 114 and Talbert then simply announced the nomination of Tillman for governor without even obtaining a vote from the delegation.|$|R
50|$|When Cooksey {{decided to}} run for the U.S. Senate against Democrat Mary Landrieu in 2002, Holloway entered the race to succeed him in the House. For a time, Holloway {{appeared}} strong. He had the support of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and the Majority Whip, Tom DeLay of Texas. But he finished third in the nonpartisan blanket primary with 42,573 votes (23 percent). Leading the pack was the eventual winner, Democrat Rodney Alexander, with 52,952 votes (29 percent). Newcomer Dewey Lee Fletcher, a Republican advertising entrepreneur from Monroe, who had previously been an aide to Cooksey, finished second in the primary with 45,278 (25 percent). A <b>switch</b> <b>of</b> 2,705 <b>votes</b> from Fletcher to Holloway would have placed Holloway {{in the second round of}} balloting against Alexander. A fourth candidate, Republican State Senator Robert J. Barham of Oak Ridge in Morehouse Parish, had 34,533 votes (19 percent). Three other candidates shared the remaining but critical 9,000 votes (5 percent).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between {{political}} sophistication and electoral volatility. Showing that there is disagreement {{in the literature on}} whether switching party preferences is related to low or high levels of political sophistication, it is then argued that the aspect of timing is often overlooked. Given differences in the impact of campaign messages depending on levels of political sophistication, the moment at which volatility is measured can be expected to bias findings. The effect <b>of</b> timing on <b>vote</b> <b>switching</b> is investigated by means of the Short-term panel of the German Longitudinal Election Study, organized {{in the context of the}} 2009 German elections. Event history analysis techniques are used to investigate the hazard <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> <b>vote</b> intentions from one party to another. Results indicate that timing indeed matters, while by election day the lower sophisticated voters have switched intentions most, the higher politically sophisticated started the campaign with a higher hazard <b>of</b> <b>vote</b> <b>switching.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} voter volatility and analyze the causes and motives <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> <b>vote</b> intentions. We test two main sets of variables linked to volatility in literature; political sophistication and ‘political (dis) satisfaction’. Results show that voters {{with low levels of}} political efficacy tend to switch more often, both within a campaign and between elections. In the analysis we differentiate between campaign volatility and inter-election volatility and by doing so show that the dynamics of a campaign have a profound impact on volatility. The campaign period is when the lowly sophisticated switch their vote intention. Those with higher levels of interest in politics have switched their intention before the campaign has started. The data for this analysis are from the three wave PartiRep Belgian Election Study (2009) ...|$|R

Although Senator Everett Dirksen noted Burger [...] "looked, sounded, and acted like a Chief Justice", the reporters depicted Burger as a weak chief justice who was not seriously respected by his colleagues due to alleged personal eccentricity and lack of legal acumen.

5000|$|Their rivalry climaxed in the 1912 Democratic {{national}} convention when Sullivan, working with others, {{was successful in}} thwarting Bryan's attempt to deadlock the convention and thus secure the nomination himself. Sullivan {{played a critical role}} in delivering the nomination to Woodrow Wilson at the party's convention in Baltimore. He <b>switched</b> the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the Illinois delegation from Champ Clark of Missouri to Wilson on the 43rd ballot despite the fact that Clark won the state's primary by over one hundred thousand votes. While Clark blamed Bryan and not Sullivan for his loss, historians such as Charles Link have credited northern urban bosses such as Sullivan, Tom Taggart of Indiana and Charles Murphy of New York for Wilson's victory. It was said (though much that is [...] "said" [...] about the convention is questionable) that Sullivan and Indiana boss Tom Taggart forged a deal with one of Wilson's aides in a Baltimore hotel room while all three men were clad in their pajamas; the deal allegedly involved putting Thomas Marshall on the ticket as vice president in exchange for the Indiana and Illinois delegations throwing their support to Wilson. When Clark lost, it was the first time a Democrat failed to obtain the party's nomination after securing a majority <b>of</b> the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the delegates in the convention since Martin Van Buren was denied the nomination in 1844.|$|R
2500|$|ERA {{generated}} {{nearly as}} much attention from legislators as the simultaneous consideration of the successful right-to-work law. Supporters of the amendment {{seemed to think that}} it was a foregone conclusion that Speaker Henry had found a way to get the amendment out of the previously [...] "obstructionist" [...] committee. Meanwhile, a small group of social conservatives, unknown to Henry or LeBlanc, was giving speeches in parts of the state where they sought to <b>switch</b> the <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> four Democratic representatives on the committee. These lawmakers were John W. [...] "Jock" [...] Scott of Alexandria, Michael F. [...] "Mike" [...] Thompson of Lafayette, Lane A. Carson of New Orleans, and A. J. McNamara of Metairie. It was believed that the Pentecostal Church, which opposed ERA and which was influential in Rapides Parish, convinced Scott to reverse his position. pro-life and anti-feminist groups in Lafayette and New Orleans, persuaded Thompson to oppose the ERA, and conservative women in Jefferson Parish pleaded with McNamara, later a Ronald W. Reagan-appointed U.S. district judge, to switch his vote as well.|$|R
50|$|A central {{component}} of realignment {{is the change}} in behavior <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> groups. Realignment means the <b>switching</b> <b>of</b> voter preference from one party to another, in contrast to dealignment (where a voter group abandons a party to become independent or nonvoting). In the U.S. and Australia, as the ideologies of the parties define many of the aspects of voters' lives and the decisions that they make, a realignment by a voter tends to have a longer-lasting effect. In Britain and Canada, on the other hand, voters {{have a tendency to}} switch parties on a whim, perhaps only for one election, as there is far less loyalty towards a particular party.|$|R
