40|$|The {{effect of}} infill {{quantity}} and contamination {{on the performance}} of second generation <b>sand-filled</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> sports surfaces was investigated in a laboratory study. Three 1 m 2 test surfaces were constructed by placing synthetic turf over a stone-tar-macadam-rubber shockpad sub-base. Ball rebound, ball roll, surface rebound hardness and rotational resistance of a dimpled rubber sole were measured for a range of infill quantities (0 - 35 kg/m 2) and infill contamination concentrations (0, 10 and 20 %). Increasing infill quantity increased hardness, reduced ball rebound and reduced rotational resistance linearly (p, 0. 01). Ball deceleration increased up to 10 kg/m 2 after which there was no further significant increase in the range tested. An optimum infill quantity of 25 - 30 kg/m 2, based on performance characteristics and the length of fibre above the infill, was identified for the synthetic turf surface tested. Increasing contamination also increased ball deceleration and reduced infiltration rate and kept surfaces wetter for longer during drying (p, 0. 001), resulting in conditions suitable for moss and algae formation. Maintenance, including regular brushing and monitoring of infill quantity, is required to ensure even distribution of the correct quantity of infill and the minimization of infill contamination in all infilled synthetic turf surfaces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{widespread}} use on athletic fields, <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperatures are considerably {{higher than those}} measured on natural turfgrass when exposed to solar radiation. Elevated temperatures may pose health risks to athletes competing on <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf.</b> Research was conducted at the University of Tennessee Centre for Athletic Field Safety to create a model for predicting <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature using atmospheric data. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature was measured on ten different <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> plots (42 m 2) varying in fibre type and infill characteristics. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Two temperature sensors placed in the centre of each plot measured surface temperature on 10 -minute intervals for three 8 -week periods {{over the course of}} two years. Atmospheric data including air temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), precipitation (mm), and solar radiation (W m- 2) were collected on the same interval. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature varied due to both air temperature and solar radiation. Predictive models using these data accounted for 86, 95, and 94 % of the variation in daily maximum, minimum, and mean <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature. Accuracy of these models for predicting daily mean and minimum <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature using 48 and 72 -hour forecasted air temperature data was excellent (+/- 1 °C). Models using 48 and 72 -hour forecasted were less accurate in predicting daily maximum <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature (+/- 4. 75 to 5. 33 °C). Our findings indicate that 72 hour forecasted air temperature data can be used to predict daily minimum and mean surface temperature of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf.</b> Such models could be used to schedule athletic events around periods of potentially hazardous surface temperatures...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} kinds of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> {{surfaces}} (e. g., surfaces that use a fill material (“infill”) between the blades of artificial grass {{and those that do}} not), and <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> may be installed for different uses (e. g., single or multiple sport athletic fields, landscaping, golf applications). The focus of this fact sheet is athletic fields with crumb rubber infilled <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf.</b> This fact sheet was developed to assist people in making decisions about installing or using this kind of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> athletic field. Considerations related to other kinds of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> fields are not addressed in this fact sheet. BACKGROUND The first well-publicized use of AstroTurf, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> for athletic fields, was at the Houston Astrodome in 1966. This first generation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> was essentially a short pile carpet with a foam backing. Since then, design changes have resulted in a greater variety of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> athletic fields. One type of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> is fabricated using synthetic fibers, manufactured to resemble natural grass, and a base material that stabilizes and cushions the playing surface. The fibers are typically made from nylon, polypropylene or polyethylene and are connected to a backing material. The base material, also called infill, consists of one or more granular materials that are worked in between the fibers during the installation process. Commonly used base materials are granulated crumb rubber (usually from used tires), flexible plastic pellets, sand, and rubber-coated sand. A combination of sand and crumb rubber is often used. Crumb rubber is produced by grinding used tires. Steel and fiber tire components are removed during the process and the rubber pellets are sorted by size. Pellet sizes ranging from about one-sixteenth to onequarter inch in diameter are used on <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf.</b> Crumb rubber is typically applied at a rate of two to three pounds per square foot of field surface...|$|R

40|$|Background: In 2007, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> {{recreational}} {{field in}} Newark, New Jersey, was closed because lead {{was found in}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> fibers and in surface dust at concentrations exceeding hazard criteria. Consequently, public health professionals across the country began testing <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> {{to determine whether it}} represented a lead hazard. Currently, no standardized methods exist to test for lead in <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> or to assess lead hazards. Objectives: Our objectives were to increase awareness of potential lead exposure from <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> by presenting data showing elevated lead in fibers and turf-derived dust; identify risk assessment uncertainties; recommend that federal and/or state agencies determine appropriate methodologies for assessing lead in synthetic turf; and recommend an interim standardized approach for sampling, interpreting results, and taking health-protective actions. Discussion: Data collected from recreational fields and child care centers indicate lead in <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> fibers and dust at concentrations exceeding the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 statutory lead limit of 300 mg/kg for consumer products intended for use by children, and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s lead-dust hazard standard of 40 μg/ft 2 for floors. Conclusions: <b>Synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> can deteriorate to form dust containing lead at levels that may pose a risk to children. Given elevated lead levels in turf and dust on recreational fields and in child care settings, it is imperative that a consistent, nationwide approach for sampling, assessment, and action be developed.

40|$|AbstractSurface {{temperatures}} of <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> {{have become a}} factor of growing interest and concern, particularly in warmer regions like Australia. However, it is unclear which components of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> system contribute to surface temperature. The aim {{of this paper was}} to compare the surface temperature of 34 different <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> products that were exposed to the same environmental conditions to ascertain which components of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> system and which environmental factors contributed to increased surface temperature. A total of 6, 120 observations were taken on the 34 products over the summer months, giving 30 observations for each of the variables on each product. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that the type of infill and shockpad had small-medium, but significant, effects on surface temperature (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 003, respectively), and the interaction between shockpad and tuft gauge was also significant (p= 0. 047). Level of solar radiation, ambient temperature and relative humidity (p< 0. 001 in all instances) were the only environmental variables that significantly influenced surface temperature. These findings confirm that both the composition of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> system and environmental factors contribute to <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> surface temperature, thus providing important information for <b>synthetic</b> <b>turf</b> manufacturers developing new cool climate products, or for local government authorities selecting products and/or informing safe play for end-users...|$|R
