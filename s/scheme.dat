We show that <b>schemes</b> satisfying the criterion for optimal accuracy of Geller and Takeuchi 1995 are significantly more cost-effective than non-optimally accurate <b>schemes</b> of the same type.

40|$|It is a {{classical}} insight that the Yoneda embedding defines an equivalence of <b>schemes</b> as locally ringed spaces with <b>schemes</b> as sheaves {{on the big}} Zariski site. Similarly, the Yoneda embedding identifies monoid <b>schemes</b> (or F_ 1 -schemes {{in the sense of}} Deitmar) with <b>schemes</b> relative to sets (in the sense of Toën and Vaquié). In this paper, we investigate the generalization to blue <b>schemes</b> and to semiring <b>schemes.</b> We establish Yoneda functors for both <b>schemes</b> theories. These functors fail, however, to be equivalences in both situations. The reason for this failure is a divergence in the Grothendieck pretopologies coming from <b>schemes</b> as topological spaces and <b>schemes</b> as sheaves. Restricted to blue <b>schemes</b> that are locally of finite type over a blue field, we construct an inverse to the Yoneda functor, which establishes an equivalence for this subclass of blue <b>schemes.</b> Moreover, we verify the compatibility of the Yoneda functors with the base extension from blue <b>schemes</b> to semiring <b>schemes</b> and with the base extension from semiring <b>schemes</b> to usual <b>schemes.</b> Comment: Adaptation of the last version to the original definition of blue schemes; extension of the results on semiring schemes; expanded expositio...|$|R
