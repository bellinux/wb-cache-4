5|$|Monocyte- and macrophage-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} characterized histologically by infiltration {{of the skin}} by monocyte or macrophage cells, often divided into several categories, including granulomatous disease, histiocytoses, and <b>sarcoidosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in <b>sarcoidosis),</b> and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles <b>sarcoidosis</b> in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and <b>sarcoidosis.</b> Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as <b>sarcoidosis,</b> and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, <b>sarcoidosis</b> or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or <b>sarcoidosis,</b> tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with <b>sarcoidosis,</b> Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sarcoidosis</b> is {{a disease}} of unknown cause {{that leads to the}} {{development}} of granulomas in various organs. While the lungs are typically involved, other organs may equally be affected. Some subforms of <b>sarcoidosis,</b> such as Löfgren syndrome, may have a particular precipitant and have a specific course. It is unknown which characteristics predispose <b>sarcoidosis</b> patients to brain or spinal cord involvement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sarcoidosis</b> occurs {{throughout}} the world in all races with an average incidence of 16.5/100,000 in men and 19/100,000 in women. The disease is most prevalent in Northern European countries and the highest annual incidence of 60/100,000 is found in Sweden and Iceland. In the United States <b>sarcoidosis</b> {{is more common in}} people of African descent than Caucasians, with annual incidence reported as 35.5 and 10.9/100,000, respectively. <b>Sarcoidosis</b> is less commonly reported in South America, Spain, India, Canada, and the Philippines. There may be a higher susceptibility to <b>sarcoidosis</b> in those with coeliac disease. An association between the two disorders has been suggested.|$|E
25|$|Neurosarcoidosis (sometimes {{shortened}} to neurosarcoid) {{refers to}} <b>sarcoidosis,</b> {{a condition of}} unknown cause featuring granulomas in various tissues, involving {{the central nervous system}} (brain and spinal cord). It can have many manifestations, but abnormalities of the cranial nerves (a group of twelve nerves supplying the head and neck area) are the most common. It may develop acutely, subacutely, and chronically. Approximately 5-10% of people with <b>sarcoidosis</b> of other organs (e.g. lung) develop central nervous system involvement. Only 1% of people with <b>sarcoidosis</b> will have neurosarcoidosis alone without involvement of any other organs. Diagnosis can be difficult, with no test apart from biopsy achieving a high accuracy rate. Treatment is with immunosuppression. The first case of <b>sarcoidosis</b> involving the nervous system was reported in 1948.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sarcoidosis,</b> amyloidosis, and Whipple's {{disease can}} also {{resemble}} RA.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis {{can only be}} made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample). Because of {{the risks associated with}} brain biopsies, they are avoided as much as possible. Other investigations that may be performed in any of the symptoms mentioned above are computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) studies. If the {{diagnosis of}} <b>sarcoidosis</b> is suspected, typical X-ray or CT appearances of the chest may make the diagnosis more likely; elevations in angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium in the blood, too, make <b>sarcoidosis</b> more likely. In the past, the Kveim test was used to diagnose <b>sarcoidosis.</b> This now obsolete test had a high (85%) sensitivity, but required spleen tissue of a known <b>sarcoidosis</b> patient, an extract of which was injected into the skin of a suspected case.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sarcoidosis</b> {{is one of}} the few {{pulmonary}} diseases with {{a higher}} prevalence in non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can cause}} similar symptoms include: herpes zoster, Lyme disease, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> stroke, and brain tumors.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone is {{also used}} by dermatologists to treat keloids, relieve the {{symptoms}} of eczema and atopic dermatitis, and stop the development of <b>sarcoidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|SS can be {{excluded}} from people with past head and neck radiation therapy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), pre-existing lymphoma, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> graft-versus-host disease, and use of anticholinergic drugs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases are}} due to primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} or cancer. Other causes include <b>sarcoidosis,</b> tuberculosis, Paget disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), vitamin D toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, and certain medications such as lithium and hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of VKH {{is based on}} the clinical presentation; the diagnostic differential is extensive, and includes (almong others) sympathetic ophthalmia, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma, posterior scleritis, uveal effusion syndrome, tuberculosis, syphilis, and multifocal choroidopathy syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Probable neurosarcoidosis can be {{diagnosed}} if {{the symptoms are}} suggestive, {{there is evidence of}} central nervous system inflammation (e.g. CSF and MRI), and other diagnoses have been excluded. A diagnosis of systemic <b>sarcoidosis</b> is not essential.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sarcoidosis</b> most {{commonly}} affects young adults of both sexes, although {{studies have reported}} more cases in females. Incidence is highest for individuals younger than 40 and peaks in the age-group from 20 to 29 years; a second peak is observed for women over 50.|$|E
25|$|The differing {{incidence}} {{across the}} world may be at least partially attributable {{to the lack of}} screening programs in certain regions {{of the world and the}} overshadowing presence of other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, that may interfere with the diagnosis of <b>sarcoidosis</b> where they are prevalent.|$|E
25|$|He died on July 23, 1955, at age 83, at {{his home}} in Washington, D.C., after a lifelong {{struggle}} with familial remitting-relapsing <b>sarcoidosis</b> (often confused with tuberculosis). He is buried in the vault of the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea in the Washington National Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|People with rheumatologic {{disorders}} such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis {{are at increased risk}} of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and <b>sarcoidosis</b> can also lead to osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{autoimmune}} diseases include SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and dermatomyositis. These conditions tend to {{be associated}} with autoantibodies to antigens which are not tissue specific. Thus although polymyositis is more or less tissue specific in presentation, it may be included in this group because the autoantigens are often ubiquitous t-RNA synthetases.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} due to <b>sarcoidosis</b> {{of other}} organs may be uveitis (inflammation of the uveal layer in the eye), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pains), lupus pernio (a red skin rash, usually of the face), erythema nodosum (red skin lumps, usually on the shins), {{and symptoms of}} liver involvement (jaundice) or heart involvement (heart failure).|$|E
25|$|Sporothrix {{infection}} presents macroscopically with nonspecific symptoms. In {{the clinical}} laboratory, many fungi isolated in culture are disregarded as contaminants. Therefore, accurate patient histories {{are important to}} establish suspicion of sporotrichosis and to inform which diagnostic tests are required. S. schenckii infection may also be confused with other diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum or <b>sarcoidosis</b> further underscoring the need for accurate diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|Perforated septum – The {{reconstruction}} of a saddle nose {{caused by a}} (collapsed) perforated septum, or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), <b>sarcoidosis,</b> {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA), relapsing polychondritis, by intranasal drug use, and by excessive nasal aerosol use. The saddle nose deformity resulting from lost dorsum support is reconstructed using autologous bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the cause of Beethoven's death: {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis, syphilis, infectious hepatitis, lead poisoning, <b>sarcoidosis</b> and Whipple's disease have all been proposed. Friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair, {{some of which have}} been preserved and subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 exhumation. Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that Beethoven was accidentally poisoned to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} potential {{side effect of}} spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia in these patients can present as a non anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Spironolactone may put patients at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, {{there has been some}} evidence suggesting an association between use of the drug and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone {{has been shown to be}} immunosuppressive in the treatment of <b>sarcoidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Lewis Balfour and his {{daughter}} both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when {{the family moved to}} a damp, chilly house at 1Inverleith Terrace in1851. The family moved again to the sunnier 17Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was eleven. Illness would be a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporary views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis or even <b>sarcoidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oral dryness {{may also}} be caused by mouth breathing, usually caused by partial {{obstruction}} of the upper respiratory tract. Examples include hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Irradiation of the salivary glands often causes profound hyposalivation. Alcohol {{may be involved in}} the cause of salivary gland disease, liver disease, or dehydration. Smoking is another possible cause. Other recreational drugs such as methamphetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens, or heroin, may be implicated. Rarer causes include diabetes (dehydration), hyperparathyroidism, cholinergic dysfunction (either congenital or autoimmune), salivary gland aplasia or atresia, <b>sarcoidosis,</b> human immunodeficiency virus infection (due to antiretroviral therapy, but also possibly diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome), graft-versus-host disease, renal failure, hepatitis C virus infection, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.|$|E
