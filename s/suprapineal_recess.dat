40|$|This 30 -year-old woman {{presented}} with clinical symptoms {{and signs of}} intracranial hypertension and Parinaud syndrome secondary to ventriculoperitoneal shunt dysfunction. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed gross triventricular hydrocephalus with a large <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess</b> due to aqueductal stenosis. Using an endoscopic approach, a ventriculostomy was performed within {{the floor of the}} dilated <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess.</b> Following this procedure the patient experienced alleviation of all her neurological symptoms and signs. Postoperative MR imaging and cerebrospinal fluid flow studies demonstrated a functioning ventriculostomy. The anatomy of the <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess</b> and its suitability for endoscopic ventriculostomy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of long-standing {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) pulsation against the thinnest segments of the ventricular walls, focal enlargement of the ventricular system (diverticulum) may occur, mainly at the medial wall of the trigone of the lateral ventricles (atrial diverticula) or at the posterior wall of the third ventricle (expansion of the <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess).</b> In the latter case, ocular signs {{are the most common}} symptoms, due to the severe deformation of the periaqueductal region. We describe a case of non-communicating hydrocephalus in a 36 -year-old woman who presented a three-year history of cerebellar ataxia. Preoperative brain magnetic resonance (MR) scan showed marked supratentorial hydrocephalus with an apparently patent aqueduct of Sylvius, and an enlarged <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess</b> causing cerebellar and tentorial dislocation. The patient was successfully treated by endoscopic third ventriculostomy and monitored by MR scans with phase-contrast sequences for assessment of CSF flow. Cerebellar ataxia is a very rare symptomatic onset for a <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess</b> expansion diverticulum, which may cause obstructive hydrocephalus that can be effectively treated by endoscopic third ventriculostom...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin-like immunoreactivity was {{investigated}} in the pineal complex of the golden hamster by use of the indirect immunohistochemical technique. The superficial and deep portions of the pineal gland, and also the pineal stalk exhibited an intense cellular immunoreaction for serotonin. In addition, perivascular serotonin-immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed. Some serotonin-immunoreactive processes of the pinealocytes terminated {{on the surface of}} the ventricular lumen in the pineal and <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recesses,</b> indicating a receptive or secretory function of these cells. Several serotonin-immunoreactive processes connected the deep pineal with the habenular area. One week after bilateral removal of both superior cervical ganglia the serotonin immunoreaction of the entire pineal complex was greatly decreased. However, some cells in the pineal complex, of which several exhibited a neuron-like morphology, remained intensively stained after ganglionectomy. This indicates that the indoleamine content of some cells in the pineal complex of the golden hamster is independent of the sympathetic innervation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings associated with presumed elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in dogs and to evaluate whether MRI could be used to discriminate between dogs with and without elevated ICP. Of 91 dogs that underwent cranial MRI examination, 18 (19. 8 %) were diagnosed with elevated ICP based on neurological examination, fundoscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. The MRI findings that showed the strongest association with elevated ICP were mass effect (odds ratio [OR], 78. 5), caudal transtentorial herniation (OR, 72. 0), subfalcine herniation (OR, 45. 6), perilesional oedema (OR, 34. 0), displacement of the lamina quadrigemina (OR, 27. 7) and effacement of the cerebral sulci (OR, 27. 1). The presence of any two or more of the following MRI findings identified elevated ICP with a sensitivity of 72 % and a specificity of 96 %: compression of the <b>suprapineal</b> <b>recess,</b> compression of the third ventricle, compression of the fourth ventricle, effacement of the cerebral sulci and caudal transposition of the lamina quadrigemina. In conclusion, there is an association between MRI findings and elevated ICP in dogs; therefore, MRI might be useful to discriminate between dogs with and without elevated ICP...|$|E
