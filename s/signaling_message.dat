50|$|A <b>signaling</b> <b>message</b> {{typically}} {{never goes}} {{directly from a}} given SEP to the destination SEP: the message would normally have {{to pass through the}} initiating SEP's adjacent STP {{so that it can be}} routed to the destination SEP.

In order to prevent various security attacks, these messages must be protected. In the current standard, the control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> between a HA and a MN are authenticated using IPSec, often with IKEv 2 and X. 509 certificates. Control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> between a MN and a CN are currently protected by an effective but insecure protocol, known as Return Routability. Using IBE (Identity-Based Encryption) for authenticating control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> requires more processing power but significant security enhancements are achieved. The current protocols for protecting control <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> are outlined in this paper.

40|$|For MIPv 6, once an MN {{changes its}} location, it sends binding update {{messages}} to its HA {{which results in}} significant overhead of the <b>signaling</b> <b>messages</b> if the handoff frequency increases.
