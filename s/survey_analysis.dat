2500|$|In the mid-20th century {{there was}} a general—but not universal—trend for U.S.-American {{sociology}} to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence {{at that time of}} action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. Robert K. Merton released his Social Theory and Social Structure (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Paul Lazarsfeld founded Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, where he exerted a tremendous influence over the techniques and the organization of social research. His many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the [...] "founder of modern empirical sociology". [...] Lazarsfeld made great strides in statistical <b>survey</b> <b>analysis,</b> panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis. [...] He is also considered a co-founder of mathematical sociology. Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident.|$|E
