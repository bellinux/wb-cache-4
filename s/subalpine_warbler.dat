5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler,</b> while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler,</b> greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

50|$|It {{used to be}} {{considered}} a subspecies of the <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Eastern <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> - {{subspecies}} albistriata, found from north-east Italy southeastwards {{to southern}} Turkey ...|$|E
5000|$|Western <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> - {{subspecies}} cantillans, {{found in}} north-west and peninsular Italy, Sicily, southern France and Iberia, and inornata found in north-west Africa ...|$|E
50|$|Eastern <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} race by its deeper blue-grey upperparts, a blackish mask on the lores and ear-coverts, brick reddish-brown coloration confined to the throat and breast and sharply demarcated from a largely white belly, paler flanks and a wider white submoustachial stripe.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} Cyprus warbler {{it forms a}} {{superspecies}} with dark throats, white malar streaks and light remiges fringes. This in turn {{is related to the}} species of Mediterranean and Middle East Sylvia warblers that have a naked eye-ring, namely the <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler,</b> Sardinian warbler and Ménétries's warbler. Both groups have a white malar area, but this may not form a clear streak in the latter group; above the white, the heads of males are uniformly dark.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are very}} small [...] "warblers" [...] and are {{intermediate}} between whitethroats and Tristram's warbler in coloration. Spectacled warblers are brown above and buff below, with chestnut wing patches and a white throat. Adult males have a grey head and the white eye ring which gives the species its name. Immature birds can be confused with both the whitethroat and the <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler,</b> and identification is difficult in the field. The song is a fast high warble.|$|E
5000|$|Together with Rüppell's warbler {{it forms}} a {{superspecies}} with dark throats, white malar streaks and light remiges fringes.

50|$|Together with Menetries' warbler the Sardinian warbler forms a superspecies. Both have white malar {{areas and}} light throats, and {{otherwise}} black heads in adult males, {{as well as}} a naked ring around the eye. The <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler,</b> which seems the superspecies' closest relative, has a dark throat and breast and a dark gray upper head in males, but otherwise shares these characters. These three species are related to a dark-throated superspecies consisting of Rüppell's warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia cantillans) {{is a small}} typical warbler which breeds in {{the southernmost}} areas of Europe and {{northwest}} Africa. It was first described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Montacilla cantillans. The current genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland sprite, related to silva, a wood. The specific cantillans is Latin for [...] "warbling" [...] from canere, [...] "to sing". This small passerine bird is migratory, and winters along {{the southern edge of}} the Sahara. It occurs as a vagrant well away from the breeding range, in both spring and autumn as far north as Great Britain.|$|E
5000|$|This bird {{seems to}} be related to the Sardinian warbler-Menetries' warbler {{superspecies}}. They all have white malar areas, the heads being dark above in adult males, and naked eye-rings. These three species are related to a superspecies consisting of Rüppell's warbler and the Cyprus warbler, which also share the white malar area with blackish above.(Shirihai et al. 2001, Jønsson & Fjeldså 2006 [...] )The <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> is divided into two distinct subspecies groups, which may possibly be sufficiently diverged to qualify as two separate species (Shirihai et al. 2001). The two groups have differing male plumages, distinctive calls, and are allopatric; further study is needed.|$|E
50|$|Nanjizel {{is within}} the Porthgwarra to Pordenack Point Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), {{designated}} in 1977 for its granite cliffs and maritime heath. The valley is a constant effort site (CES) for the West Cornwall Ringing Group which monitors the birds in the valley. Breeding birds include common chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), common whitethroat (Sylvia communis), dunnock (Prunella modularis), Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). Other birds found include brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus), common grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), Eurasian siskin (Spinus spinus) lesser redpoll (Acanthis cabaret) and <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia cantillans). Rareties ringed {{in the autumn of}} 2014 were aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), barred warbler (Sylvia nisoria) and paddyfield warbler (Acrocephalus agricola). A first for Britain occurred on 8 October 2008 with the trapping, and the measuring of biometric data, of an alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum). A first for Cornwall occurred on 2 September 2015, when a Blyth's reed warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum) was ringed. There have been six Isles of Scilly records and one from Devon so it was considered long overdue for Cornwall.|$|E

50|$|Krumovitsa Important Bird Area {{supports}} 136 bird species. Sixty-four are {{species of}} European conservation concern (SPEC), {{two of them}} being included in category SPEC 1 as globally threatened, 18 in SPEC 2, and 44 in SPEC 3 as species threatened in Europe. The area is of global importance, {{as it is a}} representative biome for the Mediterranean zone. Seven biome-restricted species, typical for the Mediterranean zone out of nine established in Bulgaria, occur there: black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica), olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum), <b>subalpine</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia cantillans), Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer), masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) and black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala). Krumovitsa {{is one of the few}} places in Bulgaria where the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) still can be observed. Krumovitsa provides suitable habitats for 46 species, included in Annex 2 of the Biodiversity Act, which need special conservation measures. Thirty-eight of them are listed also in Annex I of the Birds Directive and more than half of them breed in the region in significant populations. The region of the Krumovitsa is one of the most important sites in the country on a European Union scale for the breeding black stork (Ciconia nigra), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and olive-tree warbler.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{proposal}} to reorganise the taxonomy of the <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> complex, and {{the identification of}} the first British ‘Subalpine Warbler’ (St Kilda, June 1894) as a Moltoni’s Warbler, led the BOU to review other early records and determine the first British records of both Eastern and Western Subalpine Warblers. DNA analysis together with morphological criteria showed that the first Eastern <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> was shot on Fair Isle in May 1908 and the first Western <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> on the Isle of May in May 1924. ...|$|E
40|$|First data {{breeding}} of the <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Sylvia cantillans) in Cabrera Archipelago. It is explained that in Cabrera Gran between the lasts of April and beginnings of June of 1992 there were controlled {{a minimum of}} 10 territorial males of <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Svlvia cantillans) and were captured by ringing 25 birds. After this the 30 of June and 1 of July, were detected a mimimum of two familiar groups and were ringed two junior individuals and a female with a incubating plate. During the last fortnight of April {{and the first one}} of may of 1993 have been detected a minimum of 10 territories and have been ringed 20 more individuals in the same area with this data it is supposed that the breeding population it is well established in the island...|$|E
40|$|New {{data on the}} {{reproduction}} of <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Sylvia cantillans) in Mallorca. During the summer of 1996 (may-june) a series of observations of <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Sylvia cantillans moltonii) took place in six different localities of Mallorca and in the island Dragonera. In three of these zones its presence was known (reproduction confirmed in two of them), while in the other four {{there had been no}} record of the species. From the presented records and its behaviour (powerful response to a call) one can infer that it breeds in all thee localities, with the exception of Dragonera, where {{at the end of may}} only migrant birds could have been recorded. Some notes concerning its habitat are included, and it is suggested that the species could be breeding in other zones of Mallorca and Menorca where there is a suitable habitat...|$|E
40|$|The Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea) is an {{invasive}} species which {{has recently been}} found to be locally abundant in eastern Liguria (Italy). The song production of this bird was recorded over the course of an entire year (2011) and evaluated using both aural information and applying innovative automatic processing metrics. Our findings revealed that the Red-billed Leiothrix has loud vocalizations that are heard for most of the year, including in July and August when other birds are silent. Its song production has been estimated to amount to 37 % of the sounds uttered by the entire bird community. The next most vocal species are the European Robin (36 %), the Common Blackbird (18 %), the <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> (5 %) and the Sardinian Warbler (1 %). The Red-billed Leiothrix {{can be seen as a}} new acoustically dominant species and, consequently, a potential modifier of the soundscape patterns of the indigenous bird community. The modification of acoustic traits in the repertoire of both indigenous species and the Red-billed Leiothrix is to be expected according to a co-evolution hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|At stopovers {{sites in}} the Sahara and on Mediterranean islands, European warblers may feed on nectar. As a {{consequence}} of this behaviour the pollen of exploited plants often sticks on the birds' bill or plumage. We analyzed pollen samples carried by migrating warblers staging at Ventotene Island (Italy), a stopover site located in the Central Mediterranean and reached by large numbers of birds after a direct flight from North Africa. We discuss the possible role of migrants as pollen vectors. A total of 38 plant taxa were recorded in the pollen samples collected on 147 migrants. Pollen of Brassica sp., Ferule communis, Citrus sp. and Eucalyptus sp. were most commonly found. The nectar {{of the first two}} plants is largely exploited by warblers on Ventotene and the presence of their pollen on plumage is principally due to nectar feeding in situ. On the contrary, Citrus sp. and Eucalyptus sp., which are scarce and absent on the island respectively, were mainly collected on dried and agglutinated samples and their presence is likely to be due to nectar feeding at other sites than Ventotene. The other 34 plant taxa were recorded with low frequencies. Overall, the data suggest that nectar feeding migrants could play a role as pollen vectors only for Citrus sp., Eucalyptus sp., F communis and Brassica sp. However, the other less common plant taxa could also be useful markers of migration routes. We found species-specific relationships between bird species and the plants used for nectar feeding: short-distance migrants (mainly Eurasian Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and <b>Subalpine</b> <b>Warbler</b> S. cantillans) land on Ventotene when Brassica sp. flowers are more abundant and they mainly carry the pollen of this species. On the contrary, long-distance migrants (Garden Warbler S. born and Common Whitethroat S. communis) principally transport the pollen of F communis, whose flowering period takes {{place at the same time}} as their staging period on the island. The study underlines the tendency of warblers towards nectar feeding during migration...|$|E
