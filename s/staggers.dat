40|$|The {{competition}} between the <b>staggered</b> flux state, or the d-density wave state, and the d-wave pairing state is analyzed in two-dimensional t-J model based on the U(1) slave boson mean-field theory. Not only <b>staggered</b> flux of spinon but also <b>staggered</b> flux of holon are considered. In this formalism, the hopping order parameter of physical electron is described by the product of hopping order parameters of spinon and holon. The <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of electron is the difference of <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of spinon and that of holon. In π-flux phase of spinon, <b>staggered</b> fluxes of spinon and holon cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux order of electron does not exist. However, in <b>staggered</b> flux phase of spinon whose <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude is not π, fluxes does not cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of electron remains. Thus, the phase transition between these two phases, π-flux phase and <b>staggered</b> flux phase of spinon, becomes a second order transition in physical electron picture. The order parameter which characterizes this transition is <b>staggered</b> flux order parameter of electron. A mean-field phase diagram is shown. It is proved analytically {{that there is no}} coexisistence of <b>staggered</b> flux and d-wave pairing. The temperature dependences of Fermi surface and excitation gap at (0,π) are shown.

Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter.

Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them <b>staggers</b> away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes.

We show that, for plausible parameter values, wage and price <b>staggering</b> are highly complementary in generating monetary persistence.

The existence of complementarities means that beyond understanding how wage and price <b>staggering</b> work in isolation, {{it is important to}} explore their interactions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the degree of monetary persistence generated by wage vis-à-vis price <b>staggering</b> depends on the relative competitiveness of the labour and product markets.
