If not achieved, the Commission will carry out a [...] "careful analysis" [...] based on (1) a top-down assessment of the adjusted change of the structural balance (adjusting for: (i) the impact of revisions in potential GDP growth compared with the growth scenario underpinning the Council recommendation, (ii) the impact of revenue windfalls/shortfalls relative to the ones used in the baseline scenario, and (iii) the negative impact of the changeover to ESA 2010 on the cost of tax credits) and (2) a bottom-up assessment of the consolidation measures undertaken by the authorities for the period in concern (which differs from the adjusted top-down assessment by calculating the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>effort</b> unaffected by potential changes in public debt interest rates and potential changes of the GDP deflator - compared to the forecast figures utilized by the baseline scenario in the previous 126(7) report calling for [...] "effective action to end an excessive deficit"). In the event that both (1)+(2) return a shortfall for the targeted structural deficit improvements, the state will be deemed not to have implemented the required amount of corrective measures, equal to the launch of a 126(9) report requiring immediate effective action to be taken to make up for the recorded shortfall.|$|E

40|$|When {{comparing}} {{the speed and}} extent of economic development in different geographic {{regions of the world}} over the past 20 years, the under-average performance of Arab countries in general and Arab Mediterranean countries in particular is striking. This is despite an overall favorable geo-strategic situation at the crossroads of three continents, with excellent connections to sea and waterways and in direct proximity to the European Union, one of the world’s economic hubs. It is also despite the minor importance of negative factors such as a high-burden diseases or high levels of ethnic fractionalization. In this paper, I focus on identifying the most important constraints on Arab Mediterranean economic development. I use state-of-the-art econometric tools to quantify constraints that have been identified through economic theory and studies of the political economy characteristics of the region. The empirical results offer support for the central hypothesis that limited technological capacities and political economy structures are the primary constraints on economic development. With a view to international <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts,</b> my findings imply that the limited success of the Euro-Mediterranean policy to stimulate the economic development of the Arab Mediterranean countries might be because <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>efforts</b> do not tackle—or at least do not sufficiently tackle— these constraints. economic development, quantitative analysis, political economy, Arab countries...|$|R

However, Government has, while strongly criticizing the IMF/World Bank approach to <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> sought to effect <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the economy and to apply its own brand as well as conventional IMF instruments of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The Government's brand of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> seeks to satisfy the stated objective of strengthening the productive sectors of the economy. This is done in the contradictory context of a programme for transition to socialism and standing recognition of the need for meaningful social spending. In applying <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> Government does not appear to consider in "package form" the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women nor does it consider any immediate compensatory cushioning. The removal of consumer, however, has been tied to minimum wage enactments. The activities of Government in general do seek to guarantee the security of women under a national macro-economic programme which seeks to generally elevate women into a position of equality and self-reliance in the economy. This programme, if successful, would make it unnecessary to treat women as a special and disadvantaged group needing cushioning from the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The programme has, so far, only made notable progress in expanding social, public, health and educational facilities for women. These facilities have a direct bearing on the economic advancement of women. The one area where Government's approach has failed is in effecting a transition by women to meaningful management or ownership positions in the productive sectors. Generally, the impact of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women is hard to determine. Only a few of the instruments analysed in this paper had a direct determinable bearing on women. These are, the removal of consumer subsidies, credit facilitation for agricultural production, tax adjustment and producer subsidies.,Canadian Agency for International Development...|$|R
