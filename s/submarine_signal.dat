25|$|The Canadian {{engineer}} Reginald Fessenden, {{while working}} for the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company in Boston, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue (now Coast Guard) Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland Canada. In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse code) and echo ranging (detecting an iceberg at 2miles (3km) range). The so-called Fessenden oscillator, at about 500Hz frequency, was unable to determine the bearing of the berg due to the 3-metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer's radiating face (less than 1 metre in diameter). The ten Montreal-built British H-class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with a Fessenden oscillator.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, {{the company}} {{expanded}} its electronics capability through acquisitions {{that included the}} <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. In 1959, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it {{changed its name to}} Raytheon Company.|$|E

50|$|From 1968 to 1978, Morgera was {{employed}} by Raytheon in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, {{as a senior}} scientist and project manager within the <b>submarine</b> <b>signal</b> division. During these early years of his career, his accomplishments at Raytheon {{led to the creation}} of a patent for an innovative ocean bottom topography system (U.S. Patent 4207620 A) and deployment of a new acoustic telemetry system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{versatile}} craft, Inca {{was first}} {{assigned to the}} First Naval District and patrolled outer Boston Harbor. She also performed coast convoy duties with submarines during this period, and acted as test ship for <b>submarine</b> <b>signaling</b> and detector devices.|$|R
25|$|Cap Arcona had modern {{navigation}} and communication equipment. She was equipped for <b>submarine</b> <b>signalling,</b> which {{for a time}} was considered an alternative to radio. She also had wireless direction finding equipment, and from 1934 she had an echo sounding device and a gyrocompass.|$|R
50|$|La Marea {{was built}} as a {{diesel-electric}} motor vessel, with four four-cylinder single-acting two-stroke diesel engines. They powered electric generators that supplied current to a single electric propulsion motor rated at 981 NHP that turned a single propeller shaft. She was equipped with both <b>submarine</b> <b>signalling</b> and wireless.|$|R
50|$|A Fessenden {{oscillator}} is an {{electro-acoustic transducer}} invented by Reginald Fessenden, with development starting in 1912 at the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company of Boston. It {{was the first}} successful acoustical echo ranging device. Similar in operating principle to a dynamic voice coil loudspeaker, it was an early kind of transducer, capable of creating underwater sounds and of picking up their echoes.|$|E
50|$|From 1910-1911, Dorsey {{worked as}} an {{electrical}} engineer in the research laboratory of Western Electric Company. He {{worked as an}} inventor at the National Cash Register Company from 1912-16. He was a physicist for the Hammond Radio Research Laboratory in Gloucester, Massachusetts from 1916-1921 and for the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company from 1922-1925. Starting in 1926, {{he worked for the}} U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey as the principal electrical engineer, continuing through the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|During the First World War the Fessenden {{oscillator}} {{was applied}} to detection of submarines, but its rather low operating frequency of around 1 kilohertz gave it a very broad beam, unsuitable for detecting and localising small targets. In peacetime, the oscillator was used for depth finding, where the lack of directionality was not a concern, and Fessenden designed a commercial fathometer using a carbon microphone as receiver, for the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company.|$|E
50|$|On 10 February 1917 the Board {{established}} a Special Problems Committee with a Subcommittee on Submarine Detection by Sound. This {{led to the}} collaboration of the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signalling</b> Company, the General Electric Co and Western Electric Co in experiments on the problem. An experimental station was {{established a}}t Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|R
25|$|Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde built Slamat in Vlissingen on the River Scheldt, {{completing}} her in 1924. Her boilers had oil-burning furnaces, and her engines were {{steam turbines}} that drove her twin screws via double reduction gearing.

50|$|The wooden-hulled screw steam yacht Red Cross was {{completed}} in 1892 at East Providence, RI, and by 1907 had been renamed Admiral. At that time, the yacht was owned by the banker, George Rumsey Sheldon. She was next owned by Irving T. Bush (1869-1948), the founder and creator of the famed Bush Terminal in South Brooklyn, NY, before being acquired {{by the president of}} the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Co., of New London, Gordon Dexter (1864-1937) about 1914.|$|E
50|$|On July 8, aviso Ailette {{spotted the}} telephonic buoy of Le Prométhée without the {{possibility}} of knowing whether the later was triggered automatically or deliberately by the imprisoned crew. Several attempts were put in place to enter in contact with the crew. Two series of telephonic calls were passed by the buoy on July 8 and July 9; however, these remained in vain. The submarines Aurore, Eurydice and the Polish contre-torpilleur ORP Burza proceeded to put in motion underwater <b>submarine</b> <b>signal</b> recognitions in an attempt to apprehend the slightest activity in the submarine.|$|E
50|$|An act of Congress {{authorized}} South Dakota on 7 June 1900. The ship’s {{hull and}} machinery cost a contract total of $3,750,000. Her plant consisted of vertical triple expansion engines and 16 Babcock and Wilcox boilers, which powered two propellers. Four funnels, one cage mast, and one military mast provided a distinctive silhouette. One Type J <b>submarine</b> <b>signal</b> receiving set equipped the ship. Capt. Charles E. Fox reported on board as the ship’s General Inspector on 30 August 1907. The cruiser completed her preliminary acceptance on 19 November.|$|E
5000|$|... 0550hrs. December 9 (local time). A Japanese {{scout plane}} sights the {{location}} of Task Force 12. Shortly afterwards, a US <b>submarine</b> <b>signals</b> {{the location of}} Yamamoto’s main force. Both sides launch air-strikes, the groups passing within sight of {{each other on the}} way to their respective targets. The Lexington is sunk, as is the already damaged Akagi. Newton and Yamamoto abandon their respective flagships. Yamamoto orders his fleet to withdraw.|$|R
5000|$|The device {{could also}} be used as an {{underwater}} telegraph, sending Morse code through the water. The Fessenden underwater signalling apparatus, or more usually just [...] "The Fessenden", was fitted to Royal Navy submarines in World War I.British K-series submarines were equipped with Fessenden oscillators starting in 1915. However, a <b>submarine</b> <b>signalling</b> the surface could be heard by any nearby (enemy) hydrophone, so the system had restricted utility during wartime patrols.|$|R
50|$|Snapper fitted {{out at the}} Boston Navy Yard, {{then began}} three years of {{training}} and tests along the East Coast and in Chesapeake Bay. She ran experiments with radio, <b>submarine</b> <b>signaling</b> apparatus, different types of batteries, and other equipment, all of which has since become standard in submarines. She joined in Fleet maneuvers helping to develop submarine tactics in submerged attacks on combatant ships, and engaged in operations with airplanes in the infancy of naval aviation. Highlights of the period were the reviews of the Fleet by President of the United States William H. Taft and Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer in November 1911 and October 1912.|$|R
5000|$|On May 11, 1917 the United States Secretary of the Navy {{created a}} Special Board on Antisubmarine Detection [...] "for {{the purpose of}} {{procuring}} either through original research, experiment and manufacture, or through development of ideas and devices submitted by inventors at large, suitable apparatus for both offensive and defensive operations against submarines". Dr. Millikan of the United States National Research Council, Dr. Whitney of the General Electric Co., Dr. Jewett of the Western Electric Co., and Mr. Fay of the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Co. were appointed as advisory members.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, Lippmann entered industry, {{where he}} held various {{engineering}} roles until {{the entry of}} the United States into the Second World War, when he joined MIT's Radiation Laboratory. Here, from 1941 {{until the end of}} the war, he conducted both experimental and theoretical research on the X band and K band regions of the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically in their generation by circuitry, as well as similar work on directional couplers and microwave junctions. After the war, in 1946, he began his Doctor of Philosophy degree at Harvard under the supervision of Schwinger, while also leading the radar receiver group at the <b>Submarine</b> <b>SIgnal</b> Company in Boston (later amalgamated into Raytheon).|$|E
50|$|Although Fessenden ceased radio {{research}} {{after his}} dismissal from NESCO in 1911, {{he continued to}} work in other fields. As early as 1904 he had helped engineer the Niagara Falls power plant for the newly formed Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. However, his most extensive work was in marine communication, {{in conjunction with the}} <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company. While there, he helped develop a type of sonar system, the Fessenden oscillator, for submarines to signal each other, as well as a method for locating icebergs, to help avoid another disaster like the one that sank Titanic. In these efforts, akin to his replacing spark-gap with continuous-wave radio transmitters, he had the company replace devices that rang bells with ones that transmitted a steady tone.|$|E
50|$|Charles Vincent Walker FRS (20 March 1812 - 24 December 1882) was an English {{electrical}} engineer and publisher, {{a major influence}} on the development of railway telecommunications, he was also the first person to send a <b>submarine</b> telegraph <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|High power {{land-based}} transmitters {{in countries}} that operate <b>submarines</b> send <b>signals</b> that can be received thousands of miles away. Transmitter sites typically cover great areas (many acres or square kilometres), with transmitted power anywhere from 20 kW to 2 MW. <b>Submarines</b> receive the <b>signal</b> using some form of towed antenna which floats just {{under the surface of}} the water - for example a BCAA (Buoyant Cable Array Antenna). Modern receivers use sophisticated digital signal processing techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise (largely caused by lightning strikes around the world) and adjacent channel signals, extending the useful reception range.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 11 June the ship, in company with [...] and , made a contact and {{proceeded}} to attack. After over 40 depth charges, the <b>submarine</b> surfaced, <b>signaling</b> SOS. Suspecting a ruse, Inch and her companions opened fire and destroyed [...] The entire crew of 60 German sailors was rescued by the escorts.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian {{engineer}} Reginald Fessenden, {{while working}} for the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company in Boston, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue (now Coast Guard) Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland Canada.

50|$|The Dorsey Fathometer {{instrument}} {{was used to}} get a precise measurement of water depth. It could measure depths from 8 to 3000 fathoms. The accuracy of the {{instrument was}} to within three inches {{and it could be}} measured in a millisecond. There were different models of the fathometer made initially by the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company. The indicator of the Dorsey Fathometer was a neon tube on a rotating disc. The instrument looked like a clock and was in the bridge of a ship. The transmitting and receiving electronics were usually below the deckhouse. Before this instrument a ship had slow down considerably or stop to take soundings to get the depth. With Dorsey's Fathometer a ship could go at full speed and get the measurements.|$|E
50|$|Radio {{acoustic}} ranging had {{its origins}} in a growing understanding of underwater acoustics and their practical application during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century, and developed in parallel with echo sounding. The first step took place in the early 1900s, when the <b>Submarine</b> <b>Signal</b> Company invented a submarine bell signalling device and a hydrophone that could serve as a receiver of the underwater sounds the bells generated. The crew of a ship equipped with the receiving hydrophone could plot their ship′s distance from the submarine bell mechanism and plot intersecting lines from two or more bells to determine the ship′s position. The bells were installed at lighthouses, aboard lightvessels, and on buoys along the coasts of North America and Europe, and receiving hydrophones were mounted aboard hundreds of ships. It was history′s first practical use of acoustics in an ocean environment.|$|E
50|$|In 1822 Johann Schweigger {{devised the}} first galvanometer. This {{instrument}} was subsequently much improved by Wilhelm Weber (1833). In 1825 William Sturgeon of Woolwich, England, invented the horseshoe and straight bar electromagnet, receiving therefor the silver medal of the Society of Arts. In 1837 Carl Friedrich Gauss and Weber (both noted workers of this period) jointly invented a reflecting galvanometer for telegraph purposes. This was {{the forerunner of}} the Thomson reflecting and other exceedingly sensitive galvanometers once used in <b>submarine</b> <b>signaling</b> and still widely employed in electrical measurements. Arago in 1824 made the important discovery that when a copper disc is rotated in its own plane, and if a magnetic needle be freely suspended on a pivot over the disc, the needle will rotate with the disc. If {{on the other hand}} the needle is fixed it will tend to retard the motion of the disc. This effect was termed Arago's rotations.|$|R
50|$|The {{submarine}} left Malta on 22 July 1943 for {{a patrol}} {{in the southern}} Adriatic. She was diverted to a patrol area off Otranto on 26 July, and diverted again on 28 July. The <b>submarine</b> was <b>signalled</b> on 6 August to leave the patrol area but the signal was not acknowledged. Parthian failed to arrive at Beirut, where she was due on 11 August. It is likely that she was sunk by a naval mine near Brindisi.|$|R
5000|$|The ship left Stettin on 6 April 1940 at 3 AM. Two days later, at 11.15, {{only hours}} before the attack on Norway began, a {{surfaced}} submarine was sighted off Lillesand. At first it {{was thought to be}} a German submarine, {{but it turned out to}} be the Polish submarine ORP Orzeł, serving under British command. It had 85 A written on the tower. The <b>submarine</b> <b>signalled</b> for Rio de Janeiro to stop, and the order was followed. Captain Grudzinski, of the Polish Navy, then ordered the ship to surrender or it would be sunk, but nothing happened. The Polish submarine then torpedoed the ship, and she took in water and began sinking. [...] The crew and soldiers on board began to jump into the sea. At 12.00, an aircraft from the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service started circling around the sinking ship. At 12.50 the submarine torpedoed the ship a second time, from a submerged position. The torpedo hit the ammunition depot, which caused an explosion. About 180 survived the sinking, and were rescued from the sea and brought by local vessels to Lillesand and Kristiansand; roughly 200 died.|$|R
