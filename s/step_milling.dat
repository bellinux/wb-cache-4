50|$|The {{manufacture}} of oral solid dosage forms such as tablets {{is a complex}} multi-stage process under which the starting materials change their physical characteristics {{a number of times}} before thefinal dosage form is produced.Traditionally, tablets have been made by granulation, a process that imparts two primary requisites to formulate: compactibility and fluidity. Both wet granulation and dry granulation (slugging and roll compaction) are used. Regardless of whether tablets are made by direct compression or granulation, the first <b>step,</b> <b>milling</b> and mixing, is the same; subsequent steps differ.Numerous unit processes are involved in making tablets, including particle size reduction and sizing, blending, granulation, drying, compaction, and (frequently) coating. Various factors associated with these processes can seriously affect content uniformity, bioavailability, or stability.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} work is {{an analysis}} of flatness deviations of a workpiece made of X 2 CrNiMo 17 - 12 - 2 austenitic stainless steel. The workpiece surface was shaped using efficient machining techniques (milling, grinding, and smoothing). After the machining was completed, all surfaces underwent stylus measurements {{in order to obtain}} surface flatness and roughness parameters. For this purpose the stylus profilometer Hommel-Tester T 8000 by Hommelwerke with HommelMap software was used. The research results are presented in the form of 2 D surface maps, 3 D surface topographies with extracted single profiles, Abbott-Firestone curves, and graphical studies of the Sk parameters. The results of these experimental tests proved the possibility of a correlation between flatness and roughness parameters, as well as enabled {{an analysis of}} changes in these parameters from shaping and rough grinding to finished machining. The main novelty of this paper is comprehensive analysis of measurement results obtained during a three-step machining process of austenitic stainless steel.

Consequently, they can use the reported data to monitor fitness trends, develop/modify various physical training programs, and offer/provide fitness consultations to their members. Participants: 1216 (1050 male; 166 females) uniformed men and women firefighters in the San Francisco Fire Department. Procedures: The following measurements were collected and used in the data analysis and report (in the order written here) : Height and weight; Submaximal <b>step</b> <b>mill</b> test; Grip strength (right and left arms); Arm and leg strength; Push ups; Static plank; Sit and reach test. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics with charts and graphs were used to analyze and report all parameters separated by gender.

Forward stepwise statistical analysis was also used to select the most effective independent variables to predict the dependent scores (V 02 max and Total Fitness Score) separated by gender Conclusion: Fire fighting consists of strenuous physical work, therefore, professional fire fighters should devote more time in developing and maintaining a high level of physical fitness.
