2500|$|In {{his desire}} to become a saint, Dominic {{attempted}} to perform physical penances, like making his bed uncomfortable with small stones and pieces of wood, sleeping with a thin covering in winter, wearing a hair shirt, and fasting on bread and water. When his superiors (i.e., John Bosco, or his Rector, or his confessor) came to know this, they forbade him from doing bodily mortification, as it would affect his health. John Bosco told Dominic that as a schoolboy, the best penance would be to perform all his duties with perfection and humility, and that obedience was the greatest sacrifice. Thus, Dominic formed {{an important aspect of}} his philosophy of life, which was, in his words, [...] "I can't do big things but I want everything to be for the glory of God." [...] Don Bosco notes that from that time on, Dominic did not complain about the food or the weather, unlike some other boys at the Oratory, [...] bore all suffering cheerfully, and practised custody of his eyes and tongue. Eugenio Ceria, a Salesian commentator on the autobiography of John Bosco, (Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de <b>Sales)</b> <b>notes</b> that by this time, owing to his experience as an educator, John Bosco's ideas on several pedagogical and spiritual principles were well developed and linked and this led him to associate the fulfillment of daily duties with holiness in his advice to Savio.|$|E
40|$|The {{overarching}} {{objective of}} the FishPi project is to strengthen regional cooperation {{in the area of}} fisheries data collection. The role of every case study within the project is to bring together the countries with the most involvement in the fisheries selected to coordinate and cooperate in the search of a probabilistic regional sampling design. To this aim, case study 4 (CS 4) is focused in the Northern and Southern Hake stocks. The work done in the case study include the description of the fishery at a regional level, the compilation of the present national sampling activity, the compilation of the logbooks and/or <b>sales</b> <b>notes</b> from 2013 and 2014 –to have a single regional data set of all trips of interest in the region– and different runs of simulations to test the selected sampling scenarios and stratifications. Finally, an objective evaluation of the performance of these regional designs is expected to understand the changes needed compared to the present situation. This document presents the progress done in this case study, from the data compilation to the simulations, documenting the different steps taken and allowing an understanding of the pending tasks...|$|E
40|$|The Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF) in the Canary Islands {{are not an}} exception. They {{have been}} {{traditionally}} under-studied and not enough historical statistics are available. Therefore, most of the exploited resources remain unassessed. After tunas, the small pelagic fish (targeted by artisanal purse-seiners) are the most captured group in the area. The main species landed are chub mackerel (Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789), blue jack mackerel (Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825)), sardine (Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792)) and round sardinella (Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847). General information about this métier and the monitoring system {{carried out by the}} Canary Oceanographic Center of the IEO (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) is presented. It started in 2013, through the UE Data Collection Framework (Commission Regulation (EC) 665 / 2008). In order to estimate the population parameters and to describe the fishing effort and landings trends, monthly commercial catches of all these species are sampled in the laboratory and, since 2009, weekly length samplings are performed in fish markets by the IEO-Network of Sampling and Information. Besides, useful general information is analyzed from the Official <b>Sales</b> <b>Notes,</b> available since 2007. This project has been funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) within the National Program of collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Polic...|$|E

40|$|FishPi is a {{pilot project}} financed through an European grant (MARE/ 2014 / 19) aiming to {{strengthen}} regional coordination {{in the area of}} fisheries data collection. This project includes four case studies, one of which aims at analyzing alternative sampling plans for fisheries operating on Northern & Southern hake stocks. The case study analyzes a variety of sampling design scenarios, from Simple Random Sampling to combinations of stratified sampling designs (by country, by port, by quarter…), using anonymised landings data from logbooks and <b>sales</b> <b>notes</b> (2013 - 2014). The results were compared regarding bias and precision to evaluate the best approach. The most precise estimates of total catch were obtained in scenarios stratified by port and, secondly, by port and country and by port and quarter. The general conclusion was that regional sampling designs stratified by port provided improved precision in this fishery. Apart from statistical considerations, this conclusion was also discussed under other points of view to give a feasibility perspective showing that coverage by country, and also by domain (stock), would be compromised if regional design is simply based on statistical analyses. Efficiency and precision of sampling were found to be highly sensitive to the sampling assumptions and in general countries with smaller contributions to overall landings of hake would see their sampling plans reduced, compromising other requirements for advice such as those related to other stocks or local management measures established by National governments. Hence further analyses are being considered that integrate biometrics, cost-benefit aspects, and concurrent or single-stock sampling strategies...|$|E
40|$|For {{effective}} {{fisheries management}} {{to be able}} to act, realistic fisheries removal data are needed, so as to assess exploitation levels and the impact of fisheries on the ecosystem. Unfortunately, official statistics underestimate catches in most countries and regions. In the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean), where artisanal fishing and industrial bottom trawling are the most important fishing activities, unreported catches are common. They consist of landings at &# 8216;black markets&# 8217;, subsistence fishing, recreational fishing, locally unreported mainland fleet catches and discards. Here, we developed the first estimates of actual total fisheries removals from 1950 to 2010 for the Balearic Islands. We gathered all available official landings data (from national and regional agencies and fishers <b>sales</b> <b>notes)</b> and unreported catch data using grey literature and interviews with fishers and fisheries experts. We paid particular attention to those species of high economic importance to bottom trawling and artisanal fleets. We estimated a total catch of over 570, 500 t over the 1950 - 2010 time period, where official landings represent 44 % (around 248, 000 t), followed by &# 8216;black market&# 8217; (unreported commercial catches) (24 %), discards (18 %), recreational landings (10 %) and subsistence fishing (4 %). The total reconstructed catch of 570, 500 t is 2. 3 times the assumed official reported landings of 248, 300 t. Further studies are needed to obtain more accurate estimates of total fisheries removals from the Balearic Islands, especially for those species targeted by the artisanal fleet. Furthermore, additional insight into the taxonomic composition of the various catch components, including discards and subsistence/recreational catches is required...|$|E
