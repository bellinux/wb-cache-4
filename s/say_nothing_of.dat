5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{transition}} {{was not without}} its difficulties, and during this period {{the belief in the}} effectiveness of the older methods of memory training (to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the esteem in which its practitioners were held) steadily became occluded. In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the Puritans attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite absurd and obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish. Erasmus of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.|$|E

25|$|Bede's {{treatment}} of Chad is particularly problematic {{because he could}} not conceal that Chad departed from Roman practices in vital ways– not only before the Synod of Whitby, which Bede presents as a total victory for the Roman party and its norms, but even after it. However, Chad was the teacher of Bede's own teacher, Trumbert, so Bede has an obvious personal interest in rehabilitating him, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> his loyalty to the Northumbrian establishment, which not only supported him but had played a notable part in Christianising England. This may explain a number of gaps in Bede's account of Chad, and why Bede sometimes seems to attribute to Chad implausible motives. Chad lived at and through a watershed in relations between the Anglo-Saxons and the wider Europe. Bede constantly tries to elide the ambiguities of Chad's career, not always successfully.|$|E
25|$|During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the {{principal}} merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved {{in a way}} hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and rococo (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The {{main part of the}} wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps {{the upper part of the}} panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But Thomas Chippendale, Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture.|$|E

60|$|Now Herd's version <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> Douglas at Newcastle; {{the whole}} scene is at Otterburn. On the other hand, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe's MS. text DID bring Douglas to Newcastle. Of this Colonel Elliot <b>says</b> <b>nothing.</b> The English version <b>says</b> <b>NOTHING</b> <b>OF</b> PERCY'S LOSS OF HIS PENNON TO DOUGLAS (nor does Sharpe's), and gives the {{challenge}} and tryst. Scott's version <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> Percy's pennon, but Douglas takes Percy's SWORD and vows to carry it home. Percy's challenge, in the English version, {{is accompanied by a}} gross absurdity. He bids Douglas wait at Otterburn, where, pour tout potage to an army absurdly stated at 40,000 men, Percy suggests venison and pheasants! In the Scottish version Percy offers tryst at Otterburn. Douglas answers that, though Otterburn has no supplies--nothing but deer and wild birds--he will there tarry for Percy. This is chivalrous, and, in Scott's version, Douglas understands war. In the English version Percy does not. (To these facts I return, giving more details.) Colonel Elliot supposes some one (Scott, I daresay) to have taken Percy's,--the English version,--altered it to taste, concealed the alterations, as {{in this part of the}} challenge, by inverting the speeches and writing new stanzas of the fight at Otterburn, used a very little of Herd (which is true), and inserted modern stanzas.|$|R

500|$|Edward Samuel Corwin, {{writing in}} the Harvard Law Review, praised {{the idea of a}} {{fundamental}} higher law of reason enforceable by judges and so endorsed [...] "the ratification which Coke's doctrine received in American constitutional law and theory". Gary McDowell, writing in The Review of Politics, called the case's influence [...] "one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> history". McDowell pointed out that it was never discussed during the 1786 Constitutional Convention. During the ratification conventions, despite Coke being mentioned, it was not during debates over the striking down of unconstitutional statutes. Also, other writings of Coke were brought up but never Bonham's Case itself.|$|E
500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{garnered}} criticism. Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge found major flaws {{with the}} film, writing, [...] "Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging {{at some of}} its most critical moments. It is too subdued for Scorsese-philes, too violent for the most devout, and too abstruse for the great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian stated in his review, [...] "I fear that Silence expired in the womb during that long gestation period. It is beautiful to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> over-long; Masahiro Shinoda's 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō's 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese). Perhaps that leap toward the devout is needed to savour it fully–and I found I couldn't make it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Old English Gospel of Nicodemus, {{preserved}} in two manuscripts from the 11th century, contains a female figure {{referred to as}} Seo hell who engages in flyting with Satan and tells him to leave her dwelling (Old English ut of mynre onwununge). Regarding Seo Hell in the Old English Gospel of Nicodemus, Michael Bell states that [...] "her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical, and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the Frau Holle of German folklore, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> underworld goddesses in other cultures" [...] yet adds that [...] "the possibility that these genders are merely grammatical is strengthened {{by the fact that}} an Old Norse version of Nicodemus, possibly translated under English influence, personifies Hell in the neutral (Old Norse þat helviti)." ...|$|E

Kelly, not Usher, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> her rival pop divas – can match Beyoncé's genius for dragging her vocal lines [...] ". By contrast, IGN Music criticized Knowles' vocals in the song, writing that she [...] "comes in over the low-end track with too much earnestness, drowning out the funky grooves with her piercing dramatic mezzo-soprano. If she were a throaty alto, she'd fit the beats that have been served up to her much more appropriately." ...|$|E

500|$|In the United States, Coke's {{decision}} {{met with}} a better reaction. During the legal and public campaigns against the writs of assistance and Stamp Act 1765, Bonham's Case was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation. Marbury v. Madison, the American case which forms {{the basis for the}} exercise of judicial review in the United States under Article III of the Constitution, uses the words [...] "void" [...] and [...] "repugnant", seen as a direct reference to Coke. Some academics, such as Edward Samuel Corwin, have argued that Coke's work in Bonham's Case forms the basis of judicial review and the declaration of legislation as unconstitutional in the United States. Gary L. McDowell calls this [...] "one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> history", pointing out that at no point during the Constitutional Convention was Bonham's Case referenced.|$|E
500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I advise you to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), to <b>say</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, {{sort of like the}} Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E
