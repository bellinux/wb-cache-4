40|$|In recent years, non-fusion {{implants}} to stabilise the lumbar spine {{have become}} more and more popular. However, little is known on the load bearing of such dynamic <b>stabilisation</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to investigate the load bearing of discs bridged with rigid and dynamic <b>stabilisation</b> <b>systems,</b> six lumbar cadaver spines were mounted in a spine tester and loaded with pure moments in the three main motion planes. Four different states of the specimens were studied: intact, destabilised, stabilisation with a Dynesys® and stabilisation with an internal fixator. Intradiscal pressure (IDP) measurements were used to assess the load bearing of the bridged disc. In the neutral unloaded position, there were small but not significant differences in disc pressure for the four states of the treated disc (P> 0. 05). Concerning the disc pressure during the course of loading, both the Dynesys® and internal fixator did significantly reduce the pressure change from neutral to extension in comparison to the intact state (− 0. 05, − 0. 04 and + 0. 24  MPa, respectively) (P 0. 05). The devices apparently eliminated the pressure change from neutral to lateral bending (Dynesys 0. 01  MPa, Fixator 0. 01  MPa and intact 0. 24  MPa), but due to large variations in the intact and defect states the differences were not significant (P> 0. 05). In axial rotation, the pressure change for the internal fixator was reduced compared to the intact state; however, the change was only significant in left axial rotation (P 0. 05) in axial rotation. No changes in IDP were seen in the adjacent discs for either the Dynesys or the internal fixator. Our results showed that the IDPs for both devices were similar, but altered compared to the intact disc...|$|R

40|$|The enediyne {{chromoproteins}} are a {{class of}} potent antitumour antibiotics comprising a 1 : 1 complex of a protein and a noncovalently bound chromophore. The protein is required to protect and transport the highly labile chromophore, which acts as the cytotoxic component by reacting with DNA leading to strand cleavage. A derivative of the best-studied member of this class, neocarzinostatin (NCS), is currently in use as a chemotherapeutic in Japan. The application of the chromoproteins as therapeutics along with their unique mode of action has prompted widespread interest in this area. Notable developments include the discovery of non-natural ligands for the apoproteins and the observation that multiple binding modes are available for these ligands in the binding site. Mutation studies on the apoproteins have revealed much about their stability and variability, {{and the application of}} an in vitro evolution method has conferred new binding specificity for unrelated ligands.

40|$|Background: Scoliosis is {{a complex}} threedimensional {{deformity}} of the spine. It is classifi ed {{by the age of}} onset, anatomical region and aetiology. By aetiology it is further divided into two major groups: idiopathic (primary) and secondary scoliosis. Extensive diagnostic procedures are the basis of treatment, which can be either conservative or surgical. Methods: We compared two groups of patients with scoliosis, treated surgically in 1998 and 2008 at the Orthopaedic Hospital Valdotra. We compared aetiological as well as pre- and postoperative parameters of scoliosis between both groups. Results: At the Valdoltra Orthopaedic Hospital, the mean hospital stay was signifi cantly shorter in 2008 compared to 1998; there were more cases of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, neuromuscular and adult scoliosis in 2008 and more cases of juvenile idiopathic scoliosis in 1998. Compared to 1998, the majority of surgeries in 2008 were performed using the new CD Horizon Legacy spondylodesis system. Conclusions: Th e treatment of scoliosis at the Valdoltra Orthopaedic Hospital is successful. In the country, the institution ranks fi rst {{in terms of the number}} of patients treated.
