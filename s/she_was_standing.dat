This ended Khar's two year role as Foreign Minister. In April 2013, Khar announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> down at the next general election, so that her father, who had previously been ineligible to stand as a candidate, could succeed her. The condition requiring parliamentary candidates to hold a university degree, which had led to Khar replacing her father in 2002, had been lifted since the most recent general election. The PPP came second in the election, losing 74 seats; Khar's father was defeated in his bid to regain his former seat.|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to {{sprinkle}} some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E

The climax of her risqué performance found her [...] "humping" [...] and rolling around on the stage. The song was subsequently performed at The Virgin Tour in 1985. Madonna again donned wedding attire and performed a straight version of the song featuring a quotation from Michael Jackson's similar-sounding Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience as she rolled around the stage, carrying a wedding bouquet in her hand. The performance {{was included in the}} VHS release [...] recorded in Detroit, Michigan. In the 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour, the song was given a lighthearted comedic theme and included quotations from The Four Tops' [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". Madonna took off her outfit piece by piece, until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> in a black corset, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom. Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a skit where a {{flamboyant}} master of ceremonies welcomed spectators to the Onyx Hotel. After this, he took an onyx and threw into the video screens, causing a virtual chandelier {{to fall into the}} floor. Spears briefly appeared in the screens, as her dancers descended to the stage. She entered standing on top of a small bus dressed in a black catsuit, where she performed [...] "Toxic". She descended to the stage for the breakdown and then performed [...] "Overprotected". She took a break to talk to the audience, before going into [...] "Boys", which featured the male dancers pushing her while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> in luggage carts. [...] "Showdown" [...] featured rainbow-colored lighting effects and was the last song of the first act. A video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a frilly pink corset to perform [...] "...Baby One More Time". She performed [...] "Oops!...

The video screen moves up and Madonna appears, wearing a lamé jacket and holding a plastic gun in her right hand. A large cut out of Cagney appears in the middle and Madonna finishes singing the song, while pointing the revolver towards her dancers and pretending to fire at them, as sounds of gunshots are heard. She followed it with [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] which ended with Madonna pointing to her dancers and musicians across stage and uttering the line [...] "He/She's got the moves baby" [...] numerous times. For [...] "The Look of Love" [...] the spotlight was focused on her. The introductory music of the song started and Madonna roamed around the stage, pretending that she was lost. She wanted to portray her Who's That Girl film character Nikki, when she was lost in a similar sequence in the film. After she finished singing the song, Madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through the air, as the conveyor belt took her backwards, ultimately taking her away from the stage. Then a red phone booth appears on the stage, in which Madonna's silhouette appears to be changing costume. She emerges from the booth wearing the Edna Everage inspired costume and starts singing [...] "Dress You Up". Then she sang [...] "Material Girl", while stretching her legs on stage and showing her underwear and followed by [...] "Like a Virgin", during which she took off her outfit piece by piece, until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> in the same outfit {{from the beginning of the}} show, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom.|$|E

Torpedo planes were now sighted on the starboard bow very close, but the light was failing quickly. Ledbury engaged the torpedo planes, but one delivered a very good attack, dropping two torpedoes.

The destroyer switched on a brighter stern light and told the tanker to follow her to Malta. Ledbury informed stragglers of the presence of a minefield near Zembra, while she also contacted [...] that the survivors from the damaged ships had not been picked up and that she was going on with the tanker. It seemed to the crew that a very long time had passed before the ships were clear of the glare of the burning ships.
