5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the <b>slough</b> of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the <b>slough,</b> which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the <b>slough</b> in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper <b>slough,</b> and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a <b>slough</b> watershed education program for children.|$|E
5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} <b>slough.</b> It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} <b>slough</b> with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end of}} this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower <b>slough.</b> Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the <b>slough</b> is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the <b>slough</b> because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the <b>slough</b> during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic <b>slough</b> reaches the developed <b>slough</b> in hours.|$|E
50|$|The town of Ogema is {{naturally}} an internal drainage basin, with rolling hills and shallow <b>sloughs.</b> Typically, these <b>sloughs</b> mark regional low spots and are fed {{by a series}} of interconnected <b>sloughs</b> called kettle chains.|$|R
40|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) {{has been}} implicated in amphibian population declines globally. Given that Bd infection {{is limited to the}} skin in post-metamorphic amphibians, routine skin <b>sloughing</b> may regulate infection. Skin <b>sloughing</b> has been shown {{to reduce the number of}} cultivatable microbes on amphibian skin, and Bd infection increases skin <b>sloughing</b> rates at high loads. However, it is unclear whether species specific differences in skin <b>sloughing</b> patterns could regulate Bd population growth on the skin, and influence subsequent infection dynamics. We exposed five Australian frog species to Bd, and monitored <b>sloughing</b> rates and infection loads over time. <b>Sloughing</b> reduced Bd load on the ventral skin surface, in all five species, despite wide variation in susceptibility to disease. In the least susceptible species, an increase in <b>sloughing</b> rate occurred at lower infection loads, and <b>sloughing</b> reduced Bd load up to 100 %, leading to infection clearance. Conversely, the drop in Bd load with <b>sloughing</b> was only temporary in the more susceptible species. These findings indicate that the ability of <b>sloughing</b> to act as an effective immune defence is species specific, and they have implications for understanding the pattern of Bd population growth on individual hosts, as well as population-level effects...|$|R

5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually <b>slough</b> with serous exudate. The <b>slough</b> may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} <b>slough</b> had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the <b>slough</b> from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the <b>slough</b> with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the <b>slough</b> and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the <b>slough.</b> Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the <b>slough.</b> The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the <b>slough</b> under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the <b>slough</b> watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the <b>slough</b> floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>sloughing</b> serves an {{antifouling}} function. Epithallial shedding in most corallines {{is probably}} simply {{a means of}} getting rid of damaged cells whose metabolic function has become impaired. Morton and his students studied <b>sloughing</b> in the South African intertidal coralline alga, Spongites yendoi, a species which <b>sloughs</b> up to 50% of its thickness twice a year. This deep-layer <b>sloughing,</b> which is energetically costly, does not affect seaweed recruitment when herbivores are removed. The surface of these plants is usually kept clean by herbivores, particularly the pear limpet, Patella cochlear. <b>Sloughing</b> in this case is probably a means of eliminating old reproductive structures and grazer-damaged surface cells, and reducing the likelihood of surface penetration by burrowing organisms.|$|R
40|$|Amphibian skin is a {{multifunctional}} organ providing {{protection from}} the external environment and facilitating the physiological exchange of gases, water and salts with the environment. In order to maintain these functions, the outer layer of skin is regularly replaced in a process called <b>sloughing.</b> During <b>sloughing,</b> the outermost layer of the skin is removed in its entirety, which {{has the potential to}} interfere with skin permeability and ion transport, disrupting homeostasis. In this study, we measured, in vivo, the effects of <b>sloughing</b> on the cutaneous efflux of ions in toads Rhinella marina kept in freshwater conditions. We also measured transepithelial potential, cutaneous resistance, active ion transport and the distribution, abundance and gene expression of the key ion transport proteins sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) during <b>sloughing.</b> We hypothesised that the increase in transepithelial efflux of ions during <b>sloughing</b> is a consequence of increased permeability and/or a reduction in the abundance or expression of cutaneous ion transport proteins, resulting in disruption of internal ion homeostasis. There was a significant increase in sodium and chloride efflux during <b>sloughing</b> in R. marina. However, although in vitro skin resistance decreased after <b>sloughing,</b> active sodium transport increased commensurate with an increase in NKA and ENaC protein abundance in the skin. These changes in skin function associated with <b>sloughing</b> did not affect the maintenance of internal electrolyte homeostasis. These results suggest that during <b>sloughing,</b> amphibians actively maintain internal homeostasis by increasing cutaneous rates of ion uptake...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of disease {{as a significant}} global threat to amphibian diversity has generated considerable interest in amphibian defenses against cutaneous microbial infection and disease. To date, however, the influence of <b>sloughing</b> on the susceptibility of amphibians to infection and disease has been largely overlooked. To investigate the potential for <b>sloughing</b> to regulate topical microbial loads, the abundance of cultivable cutaneous bacteria and fungi in the cane toad Rhinella marina were compared before and after <b>sloughing.</b> Toads were also exposed to fluctuating thermal regimes (10 - 20 and 20 - 30 degrees C) and variable photoperiods to investigate possible effects of season and climate on <b>sloughing</b> periodicity. <b>Sloughing</b> substantially reduced the abundance of cultivable cutaneous bacteria and fungi by up to 100 %. The intermoult interval of toads maintained at 10 - 20 degrees C was twice that of animals at 20 - 30 degrees C and {{did not appear to}} thermally acclimate. Photoperiod had no discernable influence on <b>sloughing</b> periodicity. Results {{of this study suggest that}} normal <b>sloughing</b> cycles could play a significant role in controlling the persistence and build-up of cutaneous microbes, including pathogens. The loss of non-pathogenic commensal and protective skin microbiota after <b>sloughing</b> may also influence host susceptibility to cutaneous pathogens. We suggest that the spatio-temporal dynamics of chytridiomycosis, the widespread and often fatal disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, are related to temperature not only because of its effect on the growth of the fungus, but also because of its effect on the frequency of host <b>sloughing...</b>|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} 30years, more lumber and wood {{products}} companies opened along the <b>slough,</b> and tugboats moved log rafts {{up and down}} the waterway. Truck freight and other transportation companies built in the watershed. The city created the St. Johns Landfill on wetlands and small channels off the lower <b>slough</b> and built a new Portland Airport on land along the middle <b>slough.</b> Activists and civic leaders, concerned about pollution on the Willamette River, led cleanup campaigns, but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment. Pollution eventually grew so bad on the <b>slough</b> that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower <b>slough</b> in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the <b>slough</b> from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel <b>Slough</b> Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

40|$|Amphibian populations {{worldwide}} {{are currently}} experiencing unprecedented declines {{due to the}} combined effects of emerging infectious disease and climate change. The skin is {{the first line of}} defence in preventing establishment of pathogens and associated infections. Although amphibians undergo regular <b>sloughing</b> of the outer layer of the skin, the potential for regular <b>sloughing</b> {{to play a role in}} influencing cutaneous microbial populations and pathogens has been largely overlooked. In the present study, we assessed the effect of skin <b>sloughing</b> on cultivable cutaneous bacterial abundance in the green tree frog (Litoria caerulea). We also examined the effects of temperature and hydric environment on <b>sloughing</b> frequency and microbial re-establishment rates. Our data showed that cultivable cutaneous bacterial abundance was significantly reduced by <b>sloughing</b> events, and frogs kept at 2 ̆ 7 summer 2 ̆ 7 temperatures (23 - 33 degrees C) <b>sloughed</b> almost twice as frequently as those maintained at 2 ̆ 7 winter 2 ̆ 7 temperatures (13 - 23 degrees C). No effect of hydric environment on <b>sloughing</b> frequency was observed, but we did find that <b>sloughing</b> in L. caerulea appeared to be linked to ambient light cycles. Examination of the effect of <b>sloughing</b> on microbial recolonization indicated that at cool temperatures, an extended intermoult interval allowed microbial abundance to reach higher levels than at warmer ` summer 2 ̆ 7 temperatures (when the intermoult interval was significantly reduced). Our data suggest that <b>sloughing</b> may significantly influence the establishment and/or maintenance of cutaneous bacterial populations (pathogenic, mutualistic and/or commensal) and this, in turn, may be affected by environmental factors, such as ambient light and temperature. These findings are likely to be important for our understanding of the ecology of skin-based pathogens, such as the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis...|$|R

40|$|The crustose coralline alga Spongites yendoi (Foslie) Chamberlain (Corallinaceae, Rhodophyta) {{dominates the}} lower eulittoral zone along the South Coast of South Africa, {{together}} with the limpet Patella cochlear Born. This coralline alga was previously shown to undergo a deep-layer <b>sloughing</b> twice a year, as well as continuous epithallial <b>sloughing.</b> The hypothesis that deep-layer <b>sloughing</b> could perform an antifouling function was tested by determining the percentage cover of fleshy algae developing in a limpet exclusion experiment on live and killed coralline. Substantial fleshy algal cover developed in both limpet removal treatments, negating any possible antifouling function of deep-layer <b>sloughing.</b> A measurable decrease in the mean thickness of the coralline population was noted during periods of <b>sloughing.</b> A thicker crustose coralline, Leptophytum ferox (Foslie) Chamberlain & Keats, grew more slowly and was much more heavily burrowed and more weakly attached than S. yendoi.

Given that capture rates were higher in <b>Sloughs</b> Adjacent to Burns, it seems contrary to expectations that great egrets preferentially foraged in burned areas.

5|$|Used as a waste {{repository}} {{during the}} first half of the 20thcentury and cut off from the Columbia River by levees, the <b>slough</b> became one of Oregon's most polluted waterways. Early attempts to mitigate the pollution, which included raw sewage and industrial waste, were unsuccessful. However, in 1952 Portland began sewage treatment, and over the next six decades the federal Clean Water Act and similar legislation mandated further cleanup. State and local governments, often assisted by community volunteers, undertook projects related to public health, natural resources, and recreation in a region with many homes, industries, businesses, and roads.
