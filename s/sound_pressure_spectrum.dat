30|$|The {{recorded}} microphone {{signals are}} {{transformed into the}} frequency domain using the method presented by Chung [21]. This method rejects uncorrelated noise, e.g., turbulent flow noise, from the coherent sound pressure signals. Therefore, the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>spectrum</b> of one microphone is determined by calculating the cross-spectral densities between three signals, where one signal serves as a phase reference. In our case the phase reference signal is the source signal of the active loudspeaker. As a result we obtain a phase-correlated complex <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>spectrum</b> for each microphone signal.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} paper is to establish whether the sound visualization contours derived from the measurements can be used as a basis for the power-fold quality differentiation, and whether the results of noise source localization can suggest the best locations for signal sensor placement(s). With use of the acoustic camera, the diagnostic algorithm of the statistical envelope analysis is developed and validated using a large number of power-fold actuators comprising of subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; and &# 039;bad&# 039; samples. These power-fold actuators were tested and measured for the sound pressure spectra over the 1 / 3 rd octave band over the frequency range up to 6300 Hz. Power-fold noise was measured by use of the microphone array. For given frequency limits of 1 / 3 rd octave bands, sound pressure levels are measured on given power-fold actuators, an envelope algorithm was formed for the subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; actuators, thus allowing to develop a quality control acceptance boundary envelope, with which, <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>spectrum</b> amplitude of each individual actuator was compared.

40|$|In this study, {{efficient}} numerical {{method is}} proposed for predicting tonal and broadband noises of a centrifugal fan unit. The proposed method {{is based on}} Hybrid Computational Aero-Acoustic (H-CAA) techniques combined with Unsteady Fast Random Particle Mesh (U-FRPM) method. The U-FRPM method is developed by extending the FRPM method proposed by Ewert et al. and is utilized to synthesize turbulence flow field from unsteady RANS solutions. The H-CAA technique combined with U-FRPM method is applied to predict broadband as well as tonal noises of a centrifugal fan unit in a household refrigerator. Firstly, unsteady flow field driven by a rotating fan is computed by solving the RANS equations with Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques. Main source regions around the rotating fan are identified by examining the computed flow fields. Then, turbulence flow fields in the main source regions are synthesized by applying the U-FRPM method. The acoustic analogy is applied to model acoustic sources in the main source regions. Finally, the centrifugal fan noise is predicted by feeding the modeled acoustic sources into an acoustic solver based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The sound spectral levels predicted using the current numerical method show good agreements with the measured spectra at the Blade Pass Frequencies (BPFs) {{as well as in}} the high frequency range.

The primary objective of the AFN flight test was to acquire baseline airframe noise data on a regional jet class of transport {{in order to determine}} noise source strengths and distributions for model validation. To accomplish this task, two measuring systems were used: a ground-based microphone array and individual microphones.

40|$|The {{capability}} {{of three different}} perturbation approaches to tackle aiframe noise problems is studied. The three approaches represent different levels of complexity and are applied to trailing edge noise problems. In the Euler-perturbation approach the linearized Euler equations without source are used as governing acoustic equations. The sound generation and propagation is studied for several trailing edge shapes (blunt, sharp, and round trailing edges) by injecting upstream of the trailing edge test vortices into the mean-flow field. The effieciency to generate noise is determined for the trailing edge shapes by comparing the different generated sound intensities due to an initial standard vortex. Mach number scaling laws are determined varying the mean-flow Mach number. In the second simulation approach an extended acoustics analogy based on acoustic perturbation equations (APEs) is applied to simulate trailing edge noise of a flat plate. The acoustic source terms are computed from a synthetic turbulent velocity model. Furthermore, the far-field is computed via additional Kirchhoff extrapolation. In the third approach {{the sources of the}} extended acoustic analogy are computed from a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the compressible flow problem. The directivities due to a modeled and a LES based source, respectively, compare qualitatively well in the near field.
