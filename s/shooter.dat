5|$|In 1981, Defender {{established}} scrolling in shoot 'em ups, offering horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later {{games in}} the genre, the player could move in either direction.

Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling <b>shooter</b> with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling <b>shooter</b> to offer multiple, distinct levels. Atari's Tempest, released in 1981, {{is one of the}} earliest tube shooters and an early attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into <b>shooter</b> games. Tempest ultimately went on to influence major rail shooters.|$|E
