5|$|SpaceChem was ported to the iPad in October 2011, using touch {{controls}} {{instead of}} mouse and keyboard {{to manipulate the}} visual program. An Android port was released in July 2012. Both mobile platforms include most of the full game excluding the defense puzzles. The <b>sandbox</b> mode was added {{at the request of}} a player who was trying to explore SpaceChem computational abilities. Alongside the <b>sandbox</b> mode, Zactronics offered a contest for the most interesting <b>sandbox</b> creation. This same user was able to demonstrate a brainfuck interpreter within SpaceChem, claiming that the visual programming language was Turing complete. Barth has mentioned the possibility of a sequel in an interview with IndieGamer.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews; some reviewers {{praised the}} title for providing a humorous <b>sandbox</b> interface to experiment with, while others criticized the game's reliance {{on social media}} to popularize what was otherwise a simple and buggy product.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sandboxing</b> {{systems are}} {{extremely}} useful for secure execution of untrusted applications. Many of the <b>sandboxing</b> systems proposed so far provide security by intercepting system calls invoked by an application and controlling their execution. However, {{a problem in}} existing <b>sandboxing</b> systems {{is the amount of}} overhead required for security checks performed after system call interceptions. In this paper, we propose a <b>sandboxing</b> system that executes speculative security checks. The proposed system predicts the behavior of a <b>sandboxed</b> application and executes speculative security checks in parallel with the application, thus reducing the overhead. Behavior is predicted based on system call profiles in past executions of the application. We implemented the system on Linux and made a preliminary evaluation. 1...|$|R

5|$|Secrets of Rætikon is a single-player, story-driven, open world <b>sandbox</b> action-adventure video game. The player-character takes {{form of a}} bird. The player {{controls}} the bird with three buttons: one that flaps its wings, another that takes items into the bird's beak, and another that makes bird sounds. While the game can be played through keyboard and mouse, the developers instead recommend a controller.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, {{the company}} {{announced}} Bohemia Incubator, a platform {{for the development of}} experimental games. According to Bohemia Interactive, the incubator aimed at testing designs and concepts and getting the community involved in game development, as well as being the guidance of Bohemia's other technologies including its Enfusion engine and supporting services. Two titles were announced as part of the incubator. This includes Ylands, a <b>sandbox</b> game, and Argo, a free-to-play shooter without microtransactions released in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Field has {{baseball}} and softball fields, a <b>sandbox,</b> picnic tables, tennis courts, horseshoes courts, and shuffleboard courts. The Allen Shandler Recreation Area, renamed from the Holly Park Recreation Area in 1966 after a neighborhood {{boy who was}} diagnosed with a brain tumor in the 1960s and died at age 15, has baseball fields, benches, picnic tables, barbecue grills, and a comfort station. Other activities available at the park include basketball, ice skating, and fishing.|$|E
40|$|Accurate, {{continuous}} resource {{monitoring and}} profiling {{are critical for}} enabling performance tuning and scheduling optimization. In desktop grid systems that employ <b>sandboxing,</b> these issues are challenging because (1) subjobs inside <b>sandboxes</b> are executed in a virtual computing environment and (2) {{the state of the}} virtual computing environment within the <b>sandboxes</b> is reset to empty after each subjob completes...|$|R

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{are nearly}} always fitted with <b>sandboxes</b> from which sand {{can be delivered}} to the rails to improve traction and braking in wet or icy weather. On American locomotives the <b>sandboxes,</b> or sand domes, are usually mounted {{on top of the}} boiler. In Britain, the limited loading gauge precludes this, so the <b>sandboxes</b> are mounted just above, or just below, the running plate.|$|R
5|$|The {{developers}} redesigned {{the game}} engine, {{the software that}} handles rendering and much of gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in motion capture to develop more realistic character animations. Building a motion capture studio in-house saved Bungie time as motion capture data {{could be applied to}} the game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or <b>sandbox</b> approach to battles.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional city of Karnaca. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can {{alternatively}} decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude of ways to complete missions, from stealth to purposeful violent conflict, navigated through a <b>sandbox</b> environment.|$|E
5|$|Aside from map packs, {{the game}} is {{supported}} by regular matchmaking playlist updates. These updates make playlist and balance changes, <b>sandbox</b> tweaks and fix minor glitches. A title update to fix various game issues and glitches was released in December 2012. Spartan Ops went on a mid-season break that December and resumed on January 21, 2013; the back {{half of the season}} was made available as a free download from the Xbox Live Marketplace. On January 29, an in-game search feature was implemented for Halo 4s file sharing system; a web version of the Halo 4 file browser was made available on February 27, 2013. On April 8, 343 Industries launched a competitive skill ranking system akin to that featured in Halo 2 and Halo 3.|$|E

25|$|As built, the <b>sandboxes</b> were {{mounted on}} the front of the water tank and rear of the coal bunker, one on either side of each headlight. On some {{locomotives}} the front <b>sandboxes</b> were later relocated to the top of the tank.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sandboxes,</b> {{which were}} {{mounted on the}} bogie frames, were {{ineffective}} and required much too complicated gearing {{due to the fact}} that the engine units pivoted.

5|$|Hunter (1991) {{has been}} {{described}} as the first <b>sandbox</b> game featuring full 3D, third-person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series. The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns. It was also possible to ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or even make a parachute jump from a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall {{produced}} a massively popular mod for ARMA 2 {{that prompted the}} studio to develop a standalone game. The same year saw the arrest of two employees of Bohemia, who were charged with espionage by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ARMA 3s setting to a fictional one. The company is now working on several new projects, including preparing DayZ for an eventual full release and developing Ylands, a <b>sandbox</b> game {{which was part of}} Bohemia Incubator, a platform for Bohemia Interactive to release small, experimental projects.|$|E
5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world <b>sandbox</b> {{video game}} {{developed}} by Jay Watts' video game studio, Murudai. It was released on 17 June 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on 19 June 2011 on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. The game was developed with Microsoft's XNA tools, and its development was inspired by indie games such as flOw. The game follows the player in their mission to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects, eventually becoming a big crunch, which then produces a Big Bang.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Class MB {{on which}} the <b>sandboxes</b> were placed {{on top of the}} boiler in {{accordance}} with American practice, the <b>sandboxes</b> of the Class MC were arranged on a different system, the advantages of which were questionable. The <b>sandboxes</b> for the hind engine unit were secured to the running board just {{to the rear of the}} high-pressure cylinders, while those for the front engine unit were placed on the upper sides of the boiler just to the rear of the smokebox.|$|R
50|$|In {{the sense}} of {{providing}} a highly controlled environment, <b>sandboxes</b> {{may be seen as}} a specific example of virtualization. <b>Sandboxing</b> is frequently used to test unverified programs that may contain a virus or other malicious code, without allowing the software to harm the host device.|$|R
40|$|A {{widely used}} {{technique}} for securing computer systems is to execute programs inside protection domains that enforce established security policies. These containers, {{often referred to}} as <b>sandboxes,</b> {{come in a variety of}} forms. Although current <b>sandboxing</b> techniques have individual strengths, they also have limitations that reduce the scope of their applicability. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of the options available to designers of <b>sandboxing</b> mechanisms. As we discuss the tradeoffs of various design choices, we present a <b>sandboxing</b> facility that combines the strengths of a wide variety of design alternatives. Our design provides a set of simple yet powerful primitives that serve as a flexible, general-purpose framework for confining untrusted programs. As we present our work, we compare and contrast it with the work of others and give preliminary results. ...|$|R
5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world <b>sandbox</b> {{video game}} played from a {{two-dimensional}} perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects. The game ends when and if the player manages to accumulate enough mass to become a big crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, {{and is able to}} stay at the form of the object of their preference. Six different object are available in the game: small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star and black hole.|$|E
5|$|Theme Park offers {{three levels}} of simulation: the higher {{difficulties}} requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On <b>sandbox,</b> the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player is judged on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff can be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard {{based on the}} number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an open-ended <b>sandbox</b> mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sandboxing</b> a {{software}} process can protect against potentially malicious actions such as code injection and memory modifications {{that would otherwise}} tamper with the game. One of the key benefits of <b>sandboxing</b> {{is that it can}} effectively prevent the underlying cheat mechanisms from working, and thereby can avoid the need for banning game community members as cheats simply don't work. Additionally, strong prevention mechanisms can stop many game hackers from targeting the game because of elevated skill requirements. Compared to pattern detection systems, <b>sandboxing</b> is generally not privacy invasive as the approach requires no data to be uploaded to foreign back-end systems.|$|R
5|$|After {{the release}} of Live & Reloaded, Rare began work on another game in the Conker {{universe}} titled Conker: Gettin' Medieval. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled. Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the <b>sandbox</b> game Project Spark. The campaign, titled Conker's Big Reunion, is set {{ten years after the}} events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice roles. The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September. Conker's Bad Fur Day is also included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. The compilation was released on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows the goat to restart the game with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the <b>sandbox,</b> such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>sandbox</b> {{applications}} like Garry's Mod {{have allowed}} for the Vortigaunt {{to be used in}} a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. For example, in the webcomic Concerned, the inability for the players to harm allied non-player characters such as the Vortigaunt in Half-Life 2 forms a recurring joke, where the protagonist Gordon Frohman constantly tries to shoot Vortigaunts due to their role as enemies in Half-Life. This eventually backfires on him, as when Vortigaunts try to rescue Frohman from the destruction of the Citadel, his hostile nature leads them to simply abandon him to his fate. Vortigaunts are occasionally featured in machinima productions, often taking on the roles of minor characters, such as janitors under Combine jurisdiction. In addition, Vortigaunts are central to one Half-Life single-player modification, POV – Point of View, in which the player assumes the role of a Vortigaunt slave attacking Black Mesa.|$|E

40|$|In a {{transactional}} memory (TM) system, {{conflict detection}} ensures that transactions never commit {{unless they can}} be serialized. Validation further ensures that a doomed transaction (one that has seen an inconsistent view of memory) discovers its status and aborts before its inconsistency {{has a chance to}} cause erroneous, externally visible behavior. In an opaque TM system, post-validation of reads ensures that the view of memory is always consistent. In a <b>sandboxed</b> TM system, pre-validation of potentially dangerous operations ensures that inconsistency is harmless. <b>Sandboxing</b> is straightforward in managed languages, but its feasibility for unmanaged languages has been questioned and remains an open problem. In this paper we show that it is both possible and practical to implement <b>sandboxing</b> for C and C++ TM systems, with overheads (including wasted work) no worse than those of opaque implementations. Specifically, we present a software TM infrastructure using LLVM, the Dresden TM Compiler, and a novel <b>sandboxing</b> runtime, and describe its performance on a variety of benchmarks. Systems such as ours will, we believe, enable the development of new and faster TM algorithms (in both hardware and software) that depend on <b>sandboxing</b> for correctness—e. g. in conjunction with asynchronous (out-of-band) validation. 1...|$|R
