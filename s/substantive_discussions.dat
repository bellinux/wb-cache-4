5|$|Bo {{presided over}} a {{continued}} rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By {{the time that he}} became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the few}} ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington. On his trips to the United States, he conducted <b>substantive</b> <b>discussions</b> with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{negotiations}} between Sinn Féin and the British government {{led to more}} <b>substantive</b> <b>discussions</b> with the SDLP in the 1990s. Multi-party negotiations began in 1994 in Northern Ireland, without Sinn Féin. The Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire {{in the autumn of}} 1994. Sinn Féin then joined the talks, but the Conservative government under John Major soon came to depend on unionist votes to remain in power. It suspended Sinn Féin from the talks, and began to insist that the IRA decommission all of their weapons before Sinn Féin be re-admitted to the talks; this led to the IRA calling off its ceasefire. The new Labour government of Tony Blair wasn't reliant on unionist votes and re-admitted Sinn Féin, leading to another, permanent, ceasefire.|$|E
500|$|On 7February 1917, Sykes, {{claiming}} to be acting in a private capacity, entered into <b>substantive</b> <b>discussions</b> with the Zionist leadership. The previous British correspondence with [...] "the Arabs" [...] was discussed at the meeting; Sokolow's notes record Sykes' description that [...] "The Arabs professed that language must be the measure [...] and [...] could claim all Syria and Palestine. Still the Arabs could be managed, particularly if they received Jewish support in other matters." [...] At this point the Zionists were still unaware of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, although they had their suspicions. One of Sykes' goals was the mobilization of Zionism {{to the cause of}} British suzerainty in Palestine, so as to have arguments to put to France in support of that objective.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the serving}} Chief Justice {{is a member}} of the Council, she does not by {{convention}} get involved in <b>substantive</b> <b>discussions</b> on the bill, since she will be involved in the deliberations if the bill does get referred.

The 2013 meeting was the first at which two serving members of the Supreme Court were present, as John Murray is an ex-Chief Justice but was then an ordinary member of the Court, the first such since the term of the Chief Justice was limited to seven years in 1997.|$|E

Throughout Nixon's first term, only Kissinger participated in the President's important discussions with foreign state visitors. Nixon excluded Rogers from his first meeting with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin in February 1969. The NSC also took control of the process of clearing key policy cables to overseas posts. Kissinger and Rogers became rivals and developed formal contacts in place of <b>substantive</b> <b>discussions.</b>|$|E

This section also shows the limits of human security initiatives and how these can be addressed by the working towards a national dialogue on migration. The paper ends by analyzing the major themes from the various case studies and reiterating the importance of reaching a national dialogue to achieve human security for migration policy making.|$|R
