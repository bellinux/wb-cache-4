40|$|Abstract:- In {{the last}} period the {{interest}} for multi-storey buildings increased {{due to the}} development of cities around the world. In fact the price of land increased so much as the investitors want to build tall buildings in a small areas. The general behaviour of the tall buildings is analysed using dedicated software but many times the particular elements must be studied in experimental laboratories. At the „Politehnica ” University of Timisoara, it was developed a theoretical and an experimental program for a specific <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> <b>composite</b> (steel-concrete) joint, used for the administrative building with basement, ground floor and 12 stories. Special testing specimens were designed both for the structural <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> the <b>composite</b> joint. The calibration of the experimental specimens was performed in the elastic and post-elastic range using numerical analysis. The main objective of the studies was to observe and evaluate the behaviour and the failure mode for <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> <b>composite</b> joint. Two load hypotheses on the joint were considered: symmetrical and asymmetrical. The paper contains a comparative study between the theoretical and experimental results obtained on the behaviour of the structural <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> steel-concrete <b>composite</b> joint.

Methodology. Given the results of previously conducted theoretical research of existing types of space roof structures find promising areas of improvement or creation of new structures that should be devoid of weaknesses and imperfections of analogs and they should have an economic effect through rational use of materials. Findings. Types of <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> cable space frames and structural features of its elements are developed <b>and</b> considered. The <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> cable space frame is a completely new kind of space structure system that has the original structural concept and it was designed to cover large-span industrial and public buildings. The basic elements of that structure system are modular element of the bottom chord <b>and</b> space <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> module that consists of tubular rods and reinforced concrete slab. All modular elements are made in the factory. With bottom chord modular elements <b>and</b> space <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> modules can be assembled three types of longitudinal elements. It is the beam element, arched element and hanging element. Also with the modules can be assembled various structure system and their combinations. Number of space <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> modules <b>and</b> bottom chord modular elements, which is needed to collect <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> cable space frames, is determined by calculation and optimal designing.

40|$|The fire {{behaviour}} of a structural steel beam or a <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> beam {{in a fire}} compartment depends on many factors including {{the nature of the}} supports at the ends of the beam. This paper describes a detailed analytical investigation into the effects of support conditions on the fire performance of <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> <b>composite</b> steel-concrete beams exposed to linearly increasing temperature with time, as well as standard and parametric fires. The support conditions include simply supported, fully fixed, and a range of intermediate cases, providing varying levels of axial and flexural restraint. In each case, a comparison of the deflected shape with the evolving internal forces shows unusual but predictable behaviour, strongly dependent on the stress-strain relationship of the steel. In addition to the standard support conditions, a spring was used to simulate the effect of axial restraint provided by adjacent spans of a multi-span beam. This case showed that the spring stiffness had a very considerable influence on the behaviour of the beam and the time to failure under an increasing fire temperature. This paper gives new insight into the structural performance of <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> <b>composite</b> beams, observed in recent fires such as the eight storey steel frame at Cardington. There are major implications for structural designers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze {{feasibility}} of adopting composite material for design of helical coil spring. Combination of springs with <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> <b>composite</b> material i. e Glass fiber epoxy resin is to be used in place of conventional spring steel. The cause of implementing combination of <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> <b>composite</b> material is the low stiffness of single composite spring, which limits its application to light vehicles. Fuel efficiency of automobiles can be maximized by lowering the weight of the vehicle. The spring of the suspension system plays an important role for a smooth and jerk free ride. So it is required to design the springs very precisely. The use of conventional steel as spring increases the weight and manufacturing process energy required is more so manufacturers are willing to use composite materials light in weight and also have corrosion resistance, it can also withstand high temperature. Manufacturing composite material is quite costlier than the steel spring. The use of composite material is beneficial if manufacturing process is standardized it can increase the efficiency of the vehicle adherence overcome the material cost...|$|R

The equations are solved by Galerkin method. It is shown from the calculating example that the proposed method not only is easy to calculate, but also has high convergent speed. Introdution The <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> structure is a new-type structure based on <b>steel</b> structure <b>and</b> reinforced concrete structure. The <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete <b>composite</b> girder is the most useful composite structure. In the action of load, the shear lag effect will produce in the flange of <b>steel</b> girder <b>and</b> concrete slab of the composite structure.
