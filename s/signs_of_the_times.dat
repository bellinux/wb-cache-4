500|$|Binky Brown {{went out}} of print for two decades after selling its initial print runs, during which time enthusiasts traded copies or photocopies.

[...] "Sweet Void of Youth" [...] in 1976 follows Binky from high school to age thirty-one, torn between cartooning and more respected forms of art. Aside from occasional one-off strips, his more regular cartooning appeared in the ongoing strips The Sign Game, in <b>Signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> magazine, and Musical Legends in America, in Pulse!

2500|$|The terms aggiornamento (<b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times)</b> and ressourcement (light of the Gospel) figure {{significantly}} {{into the}} documents of Vatican II: “The Church carries {{the responsibility of}} scrutinizing the <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> and interpreting them {{in the light of}} the Gospel” (Gaudium et spes, 4). Louis Bouyer, a theologian at Vatican II, wrote of the distortion of the Eucharistic spirit of the Mass over the centuries, so that [...] "one could find merely traces of the original sense of the Eucharist as a thanksgiving for the wonders God has wrought.” The General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM) notes that at the Council of Trent “manuscripts in the Vatican… by no means made it possible to inquire into 'ancient and approved authors' farther back than the liturgical commentaries of the Middle Ages…. [...] traditions dating back to the first centuries, before the formation of the rites of East and West, are better known today because of the discovery of so many liturgical documents" [...] (7f.). Consonant with these modern studies, theologians have suggested that there be a continuity in praise of God between the opening song and the praise of the Gloria. This is explained by Mark R. Francis, C.S.V., of Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, speaking of the Kyrie: ...|$|E

2500|$|Periodical {{literature}} {{played an}} important part in the rapid and widespread dissemination of Millerite beliefs. [...] "From first to last the power of the press, in this particular form, was one of the foremost factors in the success of this now vigorous, expanding movement." [...] In addition to the <b>Signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> based in Boston, Millerite papers were published in numerous cities including New York, Philadelphia, Rochester, Cleveland, and Montreal. There were at least 48 Millerite periodicals that circulated in the period leading up to the Great Disappointment. The majority of these, however, were quite short-lived—often a new paper was started whenever a Millerite evangelistic campaign entered a new area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first full}} {{articulation}} of the Catholic doctrine {{on the principles of}} the relationship of the Catholic Church to the state (at the time, the Eastern Roman Empire) is contained in the document Famuli vestrae pietatis, written by Pope Gelasius I to the Emperor.

[...] The mission of the Church recognized the realities of secularization and pluralism. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. [...] "This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.". This was further expanded in Apostolicam Actuositatem, Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Dutch television in 2004, Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels argued {{that the use of}} condoms should be supported to prevent AIDS if sex with a person infected with HIV should take place, though it is to be avoided. According to Danneels, [...] "the person must use a condom in order not to disobey the commandment condemning murder, in addition to breaking the commandment which forbids adultery. ... Protecting oneself against sickness or death is an act of prevention. Morally, it cannot be judged on the same level as when a condom is used {{to reduce the number of}} births." [...] In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI asserted that handing out condoms is not the solution to combating AIDS and might make the problem worse. He proposed [...] "spiritual and human awakening" [...] and [...] "friendship for those who suffer" [...] as solutions. In 2010, Benedict in {{an interview}} which was published in the book Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the <b>Signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> when asked whether the Catholic Church were not opposed in principle to the use of condoms, stated: ...|$|E
