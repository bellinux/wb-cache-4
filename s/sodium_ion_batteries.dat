For preparing the cathode, a Mn-O precursor layer was first electrodeposited onto carbon fibers, followed by a hydrothermal reaction with NaOH to form the Na-Mn-O active material. The cathode’s properties were investigated based on electrochemical characterizations and its structure was analyzed based on a synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis. The synthesized orthorhombic Na 0. 91 MnO 2 phase was found to irreversibly change to the monoclinic NaMnO 2 phase along with unit cell deformation and volume change during the 1 st cycle discharge, resulting in an initial discharge capacity of 205 mAh/g. This suggests that this fiber-type cathode possesses an effective current-collecting performance without extra conductive material and binder. In addition, side reactions caused by the additives can be avoided, thus contributing to a lower polarization during the charge/discharge cycling. It was also found that the capacity fade during cycling was attributed to a partial phase change from the NaMnO 2 phase to the inactive Mn-O phases. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.
