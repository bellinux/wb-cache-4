40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the {{entry-level}} theatre voice teacher is confronted in the theatre voice class with a ‘dichotomized voice’ in training, where the physiological and the socio-cultural interweave brain/mind/body to form {{a sense of a}} self-reflected whole, through and because of voice usage. In the theatre voice training process, the <b>student’s</b> <b>voice</b> is subject to his or her embodied socio-cultural experience, which impacts on how the voice is produced and used in relation to the sense of self. Therefore the voice-in-training is intimately shaped by the body and embodiment. The <b>student’s</b> <b>voice</b> as gestural routine becomes an auditory marker of his/her identity. The entry-level theatre voice teacher should develop skills to pedagogically and ethically facilitate the training of the ‘dichotomized voice’.
