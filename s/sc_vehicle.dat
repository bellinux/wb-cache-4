40|$|Abstract Background This work {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether methoxychlor (MTX) exposure may modify the ultradian secretion of prolactin through changes in the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) induced by N ω -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Associated changes in dopamine (DA) content in the anterior (AH), mediobasal (MBH) and posterior hypothalamus (PH) and median eminence (ME) were evaluated. Methods Two groups of animals (MTX and MTX+L-NAME treated) received subcutaneous (sc) injections of MTX at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day for one month. The other two groups of animals (control and L-NAME treated) received <b>sc</b> <b>vehicle</b> injections (0. 5 mL/day of sesame oil), during the same period of time to be used as controls. Forty hours before the day of the experiment, animals were anaesthetized with intrapritoneal injections of 2. 5 % tribromoethanol in saline and atrial cannulas were implanted through the external jugular vein. Plasma was continuously extracted in Hamilton syringes coupled to a peristaltic bomb in tubes containing phosphate-gelatine buffer (to increase viscosity). The plasma was obtained by decantation and kept every 7 minutes for the measurement of plasma prolactin levels through a specific radioimmnunoassay and DA concentration by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results Prolactin release in animals from all experimental groups analyzed was episodic. Mean plasma prolactin levels during the bleeding period, and the absolute pulse amplitude were increased after MTX or N ω -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) administration. However MTX and L-NAME did not modify any other parameter studied with the exception of relative pulse amplitude in MTX treated rats. L-NAME administration to rats treated with the pesticide reduced mean plasma prolactin levels and the absolute amplitude of prolactin peaks. Peak duration, frequency and relative amplitude of prolactin peaks were not changed in the group of rats treated with MTX plus L-NAME as compared to either control or MTX treated rats. Whereas MTX decreased DA content in the ME and increased it in the AH, its content did not change in the MBH or PH, as compared to the values found in controls. Also, L-NAME administration decreased DA content in the ME as compared to controls. However, L- NAME administration to MTX exposed rats, markedly increased DA content in the ME as compared to either MTX treated or control rats. L-NAME administration increased DA content in the AH as compared to the values found in non-treated rats. However L-NAME administration to MTX exposed rats did not modify DA content as compared to either MTX treated or control rats. L-NAME administration did not modify DA content at the MBH nor in saline treated nor in MTX treated rats. However, the values of DA in the MBH in MTX plus L-NAME treated animals were statistically decreased as compared to L-NAME treated rats. In the PH, L-NAME administration increased DA content as compared to the values found in non-treated animals. L-NAME administration to MTX exposed rats also increased DA content as compared to either MTX treated or control rats. Conclusion The results suggest the existence of an interaction between MTX and L-NAME in the modulation of the ultradian prolactin secretion at the pituitary levels. The possibility of an indirect effect mediated by changes in DA content at the ME requires further examination. </p...|$|E

MD animals show a marked reduction in their circulating leptin levels, not only during the MD period, but also several days later (PND 13). A neonatal leptin surge occurs in rodents (beginning around PND 5 and peaking between PND 9 and 10) that has an important neurotrophic role. We hypothesized that the deficient neonatal leptin sig-naling of MD rats could be involved in the altered development of their hippocampus and frontal cortex. Accordingly, a neonatal leptin treatment in MD rats would at least in part counteract their neurobehavioural alterations. MD was carried out in Wistar rats for 24 h on PND 9.

Here, we report effects on male development. METHODS: 4 -MBC (0. 7, 7, 24, 47 mg/kg/day) was administered in chow to the parent generation before mating, during gestation and lactation, and to offspring until adulthood. mRNA was determined in prostate lobes by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and protein was determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: 4 -MBC delayed male puberty, decreased adult prostate weight, and slightly increased testis weight. Androgen receptor (AR), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), ER-α, and ER-β expression in prostate were altered at mRNA and protein levels, with stronger effects in dorsolateral than ventral prostate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{dominance}} of road transport, both on passenger and freight movements, has reached alarming levels for society {{due to their}} negative environmental impacts as well as societal and economic costs. To reverse this trend, many approaches have been applied, but without significant effects on mobility patterns and on the sustainability of the transport system. Fairly promising results have recently been reported in Europe with car-sharing. This research confirms, as hypothesized by prior research, that car sharing contributes to a more efficient and rational mobility (with lower number of vehicles per capita among members, lower demand for parking space, lower fixed costs and a complement to public transport). Additionally to the lower consumption of physical and economic resources, car sharing can {{also contribute to the}} reduction of energy and environmental impacts (added to the direct ones from the changes on vehicle ownership and usage patterns). A case study was carried out in Lisbon, Portugal, to estimate car sharing impacts and the effects of a possible technology change. The results demonstrate that those benefits can represent reductions of 35 or 47 % in terms of energy consumption and 35 and 65 % for CO 2 emissions, if a shift to Hybrid <b>vehicles</b> (<b>Sc.</b> 1) or to Electric <b>vehicles</b> (<b>Sc.</b> 2) is promoted, respectively. The impacts of reducing vehicle ownership, in a 1 to 6 ratio, due to the implementation of car-sharing were also estimated.

However, its benefit in heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension {{has yet to be}} determined. It has been reported that transgenic rats overexpressing TNF-alpha develop pulmonary hypertension. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the morphologic and hemodynamic effects of administration of an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (etanercept) in rats with monocrotaline (MCT) -induced pulmonary hypertension. METHODS:Adult Wistar rats were injected with MCT (60 mg/Kg <b>sc),</b> or <b>vehicle</b> only (day 0). Beginning one day later, the animals were randomly treated with etanercept (ETC, 0. 03 mg/Kg sc, three times a week) or with a similar volume of vehicle. The study thus had four groups: Ctrl (n = 6), Ctrl + ETC (n = 6), MCT (n = 6) and MCT + ETC (n = 6). On days 22 - 23, the rats were instrumented to record right ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures, dP/dtmax and tau. At the end of each experiment the heart and lungs were weighed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:Chronic administration of etanercept induced only a slight increase in relaxation velocity, with no effect on other hemodynamic parameters, including pulmonary hypertension, and no reduction in right ventricular hypertrophy.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how repeated administration of aripiprazole (a novel antipsychotic drug) alters its behavioral effects in two behavioral tests of antipsychotic activity and whether this alteration is correlated {{with an increase}} in dopamine D 2 receptor function. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were first repeatedly tested with aripiprazole (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, subcutaneously (<b>sc))</b> or <b>vehicle</b> in a conditioned avoidance response (CAR) test or a phencyclidine (PCP) (3. 20 mg/kg, sc) -induced hyperlocomotion test daily for five consecutive days. After 2 – 3 days of drug-free retraining or resting, all rats were then challenged with aripiprazole (1. 5 or 3. 0 mg/kg, sc). Repeated administration of aripiprazole progressively increased its inhibition of avoidance responding and PCP-induced hyperlocomotion. More importantly, rats previously treated with aripiprazole showed significantly lower avoidance response and lower PCP-induced hyperlocomotion than those previously treated with vehicle in the challenge tests. An increased sensitivity to quinpirole (a selective D 2 / 3 agonist) in prior aripiprazole-treated rats was also found in the quinpirole- induced hyperlocomotion test, suggesting an enhanced D 2 / 3 -mediated function. These findings suggest that aripiprazole, despite its distinct receptor mechanisms of action, induces a sensitization effect similar to those induced by other antipsychotic drugs and this effect may be partially mediated by brain plasticity involving D 2 / 3 receptor systems...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate if Schwann cell (SC) -like cells differentiated from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could improve the cutaneous nerve regeneration in skin flaps. Methods: Microvascular island groin flaps were elevated bilaterally in 32 Lewis rats. On the right flap, the epigastric nerve was resected and ligated (noninnervated flap), and on the left flap, the nerve was crushed (innervated flap). ASCs, SC-like cells differentiated from ASCs (dASCs), <b>SCs,</b> or <b>vehicle</b> were simultaneously injected to the dermal and hypodermal layers of flap. After 20 weeks, the reinnervation pattern of flap was assessed immunohistochemically using a neuronal marker, PGP 9. 5.

In the center of flap, there was no statistically significant increase in reinnervation density in all groups irrespective of flap innervation (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: dASCs could improve flap reinnervation by 2 mechanisms: First, neurotrophic factors produced by dASCs facilitated regrowth of cutaneous axons from the surroundings of flap. Second, nerve growth factor released by dASCs induced the collateral sprouting of undamaged axons in adjacent tissues. In addition to the use of innervated flaps, dASC transplantation therapy could be a new approach to improve the sensory {{recovery of}} skin flaps...|$|R

Our experiments aimed {{to test the}} hypothesis that daidzein and 17 beta-estradiol enhance endothelium-dependent relaxation through an increase in NO synthesis due to an increase in activity or expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Male rats were treated with daidzein (0. 2 mg/kg per day sc), 17 beta-estradiol (0. 1 mg/kg per day <b>sc),</b> or <b>vehicle</b> for 7 days and reactivity of isolated aortic rings was then determined. ACh-induced relaxation was significantly enhanced in aortic rings from rats treated with daidzein or 17 beta-estradiol but the relaxant responses to the endothelium-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside or isoprenaline were not different. Nitrite production and the level of cGMP were significantly greater in aortae from daidzein and 17 beta-estradiol compared with vehicle-treated rats. Daidzein and 17 beta-estradiol did not alter eNOS protein in endothelium-intact aortae but reduced expression of caveolin- 1 and increased expression of calmodulin, changes that would account for an increase in eNOS activity. There were no differences between groups in the expression of calmodulin and caveolin- 1 in arteries when the endothelium was removed. Daidzein or 17 beta-estradiol treatment selectively enhances endothelium-dependent relaxation in male rats through an increase in eNOS activity. The increase in eNOS activity is associated with a decreased expression of caveolin- 1 and an increased expression of calmodulin in endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Prolactin stimulates tuberoinfundibular {{dopamine}} neurons in the {{arcuate nucleus}} of the hypothalamus, mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 b (STAT 5 b). During late pregnancy, these neurons become unresponsive to prolactin, {{with a loss of}} prolactin-induced activation of STAT 5 b and decreased dopamine secretion. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins inhibit STAT-mediated signaling, and SOCS mRNAs are specifically elevated in the arcuate nucleus during late pregnancy. We hypothesized that changes in circulating ovarian steroids during late pregnancy might induce expression of SOCS mRNAs, thus disrupting STAT 5 b-mediated prolactin signaling. Rats were ovariectomized on d 18 of pregnancy and treated with ovarian steroids to simulate an advanced, normal, or delayed decline in progesterone. Early progesterone withdrawal caused an early increase in prolactin secretion, and increased SOCS- 1 and - 3 and cytokine-inducible SH 2 -containing protein (CIS) mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus. Prolonged progesterone treatment prevented these changes. To determine whether ovarian steroids directly alter SOCS mRNA levels, estrogen- and/or progesterone-treated ovariectomized nonpregnant rats were acutely injected with prolactin (300 g <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle.</b> SOCS- 1 and - 3 and CIS mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus were significantly increased by estrogen or prolactin, whereas progesterone treatment reversed the effect of estrogen. Results demonstrate that estrogen and prolactin can independently induce SOCSmRNAin the arcuate nucleus and that this effect is negatively regulated by progesterone. This is consistent with the hypothesis that declining progesterone and high levels of estrogen during late pregnancy induce SOCS in the tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons, thus contributing to their insensitivity to prolactin at this time...|$|R

Despite comparable antifracture efficacy, anti-catabolics and bone anabolic agents are likely to modify the various determinants of bone strength in very different ways. Eight weeks after ovariectomy (OVX), 8 -mo-old osteoporotic rats received pamidronate (APD; 0. 6 mg/kg, 5 days/mo, SC), raloxifene (3 mg/kg, 5 / 7 days, tube feeding), PTH(1 - 34) (10 mug/kg, 5 / 7 days, <b>SC),</b> or <b>vehicle</b> for 16 wk, and we measured vertebral BMD, maximal load, stiffness and energy, microarchitecture, and material properties by nanoindentation, which allows the calculation of the elastic modulus, tissue hardness, and working energy. Markers of bone turnover, plasma osteocalcin, and urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) were also determined. PTH induced greater maximal load than APD or raloxifene, as well as greater absorbed energy, BMD, and increased bone turnover markers. PTH markedly increased trabecular bone volume and connectivity to values higher than sham. Animals treated with APD had BV/TV values significantly higher than OVX but lower than sham, whereas raloxifene had no effect. Tissue hardness was identical in PTH-treated and OVX untreated controls. In contrast, APD reversed the decline in strength to levels not significantly different to sham, reduced bone turnover, and increased hardness. Raloxifene markedly increased material level cortical hardness and elastic modulus. These results show the different mechanisms by which anti-catabolics and bone anabolics reduce fracture risk. PTH influences microarchitecture, whereas bisphosphonates alter material-level bone properties, with probable opposite effects on remodeling space.

Antipsychotic effect was indexed by a drug 2 ̆ 7 s suppressive effect on avoidance responding in a rat conditioned avoidance response (CAR) model. Male adolescent Sprague–Dawley rats were first treated with risperidone (1. 0 mg/kg, sc) or sterile water and {{tested in the}} CAR model for 5 consecutive days from postnatal days P 40 to 44. After they became adults (P 80 – 84), they were switched to olanzapine (0. 5 mg/kg, sc), clozapine (5. 0 mg/kg, <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> treatment and tested for avoidance for 5 days. During the adolescent period, repeated risperidone treatment produced a persistent inhibition of avoidance response. Throughout the 5 days of adulthood drug testing, rats previously treated with risperidone in adolescencemade significantly fewer avoidance responses than the vehicle oneswhen they all were switched to olanzapine, indicating a risperidone-induced enhancement of behavioral sensitivity to olanzapine. In contrast, when switched to clozapine, rats previously treated with risperidone made significantly more avoidance responses than the vehicle rats, indicating a risperidone-induced decrease of behavioral sensitivity to clozapine. Performance in the prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response in adulthood was not altered by adolescent risperidone treatment. Collectively, adolescent risperidone exposure induced a long-term change in behavioral sensitivity to other atypical antipsychotic drugs, with the specific direction of change (i. e., increase or decrease) dependent on the drug to be switched to. These long-lasting changes are likely mediated by drug-induced neuroplastic changes and may also have significant clinical implications for antipsychotic treatment of chronic patients with an early onset of psychotic symptoms...|$|R

At the end of treatment, the right carotid artery was catheterized for arterial and left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic evaluation. Isoproterenol treatment increased LV weight but did not change hemodynamic parameters. Aortic mRNA and protein expression were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Isoproterenol enhanced aortic mRNA and protein expression of IL- 1 beta (124 % and 125 %) and IL- 6 (231 % and 40 %) compared with controls but did not change TNF-alpha expression. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmatic protein expression ration of the NF-beta B p 65 subunit was increased by isoproterenol treatment (51 %); in addition, it reduced the cytoplasmatic expression of I kappa B-alpha (52 %) in aortas. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using the aorta, and increased NF-kappa B DNA binding (31 %) was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats compared with controls (P < 0. 05). Isoproterenol treatment increased phenylephrine-induced contraction in aortic rigs (P < 0. 05), which was significantly reduced by superoxide dismutase (150 U/ml) and sodium salicylate (5 mM). Cotreatment with thalidomide (150 mg(.) kg(- 1.) day(- 1) for 7 days) also reduced hyperreactivity to phenylephrine induced by isoproterenol. In conclusion, overstimulation of beta-adrenoceptors increased proinflammatory cytokines and upregulated NF-kappa B in the rat aorta.

Arteriographic caliber was assessed in vivo at baseline and before sacrifice. On day 14 after injury, in vivo arteriographic caliber (baseline = 2. 44 ± 0. 43 mm) was decreased by 23. 1 ± 0. 1 % in controls and by 44. 5 ± 0. 1 % in estrogen-treated rabbits (P < 0. 001). Neither the neointimal area nor the neointima/media area ratio changed after estrogen treatment. Collagen fraction was increased {{in the media and}} neointima of estrogen-treated rabbits vs control (1. 38 ± 1. 30 vs 0. 35 ± 0. 67, respectively, P = 0. 01). Taken together, these findings suggest that estrogen increased negative vascular remodeling. Transcription of endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and iNOS) was analyzed by RT-PCR. eNOS mRNA expression was marginally increased after estrogen (P = 0. 07) and injury. iNOS mRNA was increased 2 - to 3 -fold on day 14 after injury. With estrogen treatment, iNOS mRNA increased in uninjured arteries and exhibited a further 5. 5 -fold increase after injury.

To date, the biological properties of the 20 -kDa GH-V have not been characterized in vivo. Using young male Wistar rats fed either chow or a high-fat (HF) diet for 4 wk postweaning, we investigated the effect of 7 days treatment with either 22 -kDa hGH-N, 20 -kDa hGH-V (5 ug·g– 1 ·day– 1 <b>sc),</b> or <b>vehicle</b> on body composition and endocrine and metabolic profiles. Total body growth (absolute weight gain and linear growth trajectory) in the 20 -kDa hGH-V-treated animals was intermediary between that of control and hGH-N-treated animals. Both 22 -kDa hGH-N and 20 -kDa hGH-V significantly reduced total body fat mass compared with control animals, and there were no differences between the GH isoforms in anti-lipogenic activity in animals fed the HF diet. Fasting plasma insulin and C peptide were significantly increased in animals on the HF diet and further increased by hGH-N but were unchanged in 20 -kDa hGH-V-treated animals compared with saline-treated controls. Plasma volume as assessed by hematocrit was increased in hGH-N-treated animals but was unchanged in 20 -kDa hGH-V-treated animals compared with controls. Furthermore, 20 -kDa hGH-V had reduced lactogenic (prolactin receptor mediated) activity characteristic of hGH-N as tested in vitro compared with the 20 -kDa hGH-N and 22 -kDa hGH-N variants. In summary, placental 20 -kDa hGH-V retains some of the growth-promoting and all antilipogenic activities of pituitary 22 -kDa hGH-N but has diminished diabetogenic and lactogenic properties compared with the native 22 -kDa hGH-N...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{stimulation}} of beta-adrenoceptors with isoproterenol induces alteration of vascular reactivity and increases local proinflammatory cytokines. We investigated whether fenofibrate and pioglitazone, PPAR-alpha and -gamma agonists, respectively, improve {{the changes in}} vascular reactivity induced by isoproterenol. Wistar rats received isoproterenol (0. 3 mg. kg(- 1). day(- 1), <b>SC)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> (CT) plus fenofibrate (alpha, 100 mg. kg(- 1). day(- 1), PO), pioglitazone (gamma, 2. 5 mg. kg(- 1). day(- 1), PO), or water for 7 days. In aortas, isoproterenol treatment enhanced the maximal response (Rmax) to phenylephrine (10 (- 10) to 10 (- 4) M) compared to CT as previously demonstrated. The effects of endothelium removal (E-) or L-NAME incubation (100 mu M) on the phenylephrine response were smaller in isoproterenol-treated animals compared to CT while superoxide dismutase (SOD, 150 U/mL) significantly reduced the Rmax to phenylephrine to CT levels. Neither fenofibrate nor pioglitazone changed the effects induced by isoproterenol in aorta. E-, L-NAME, or SOD effects were similar between CT alpha and CT. However, pioglitazone per se increased Rmax to phenylephrine (CT: 59 +/- 4 versus CT gamma: 72 +/- 5 % of contraction to KCl). E- or L-NAME effects were reduced in CT gamma compared to CT, and SOD normalized the altered reactivity to phenylephrine in the CT gamma group. In conclusion, neither fenofibrate nor pioglitazone ameliorates the altered vascular reactivity present in aorta from isoproterenol-treated rats. Moreover, pioglitazone per se induced endothelial dysfunction and increased phenylephrine-induced contraction in aorta.

40|$|Cardiac {{hypertrophy}} {{that accompanies}} hypertension {{seems to be}} a phenomenon of multifactorial origin whose development does not seem to depend on an increased pressure load alone, but also on local growth factors and cardioadrenergic activity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if sympathetic renal denervation and its effects on arterial pressure level can prevent cardiac hypertrophy and if it can also delay the onset and attenuate the severity of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hypertension. DOCA-salt treatment was initiated in rats seven days after uninephrectomy and contralateral renal denervation or sham renal denervation. DOCA (15 mg/kg, <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> (soybean oil, 0. 25 ml per animal) was administered twice a week for two weeks. Rats treated with DOCA or vehicle (control) were provided drinking water containing 1 % NaCl and 0. 03 % KCl. At the end of the treatment period, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate measurements were made in conscious animals. Under ether anesthesia, the heart was removed and the right and left ventricles (including the septum) were separated and weighed. DOCA-salt treatment produced a significant increase in left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratio (2. 44 ± 0. 09 mg/g) and right ventricular weight/body weight (RVW/BW) ratio (0. 53 ± 0. 01 mg/g) compared to control (1. 92 ± 0. 04 and 0. 48 ± 0. 01 mg/g, respectively) rats. MAP was significantly higher (39 %) in DOCA-salt rats. Renal denervation prevented (P> 0. 05) the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats but did not prevent the increase in LVW/BW (2. 27 ± 0. 03 mg/g) and RVW/BW (0. 52 ± 0. 01 mg/g). We have shown that the increase in arterial pressure level is not responsible for cardiac hypertrophy, which may be more related to other events associated with DOCA-salt hypertension, such as an increase in cardiac sympathetic activit...|$|R

In guinea pigs, {{maternal}} insulin-like {{growth factor}} (IGF) infusion in early-pregnancy enhances placental transport near-term, increasing fetal growth and survival. The effects of IGF-II, but not IGF-I, appear due to enhanced placental labyrinthine (exchange) development. To {{determine if the}} type- 2 IGF receptor (IGF 2 R) mediates these distinct actions of exogenous IGF-II in the mother, we compared the impact of IGF-II with an IGF-II analogue, Leu(27) -IGF-II, which only binds the IGF 2 R. IGF-II, Leu(27) -IGF-II (1 mg/kg per day. <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> were infused from days 20 - 38 of pregnancy (term = 67 days) and placental structure and uptake and transfer of [(3) H]-methyl-D-glucose (MG) and [(14) C]-amino-isobutyric acid (AIB) and fetal growth and plasma metabolites, were measured on day 62. Both IGF-II and Leu(27) -IGF-II increased the volume of placental labyrinth, trophoblast and maternal blood space within the labyrinth and total surface area of trophoblast for exchange, compared to vehicle. Leu(27) -IGF-II also reduced the barrier to diffusion (trophoblast thickness) compared to vehicle and IGF-II. Both IGF-II and Leu(27) -IGF-II increased fetal plasma amino acid concentrations and placental transfer of MG to the fetus compared to vehicle, with Leu(27) -IGF-II also increasing AIB transport compared with vehicle and IGF-II. In addition, Leu(27) -IGF-II increased fetal weight compared to vehicle. In conclusion, maternal treatment with IGF-II or Leu(27) -IGF-II in early gestation, induce similar placental and fetal outcomes near term. This suggests that maternal IGF-II in early gestation acts in part via the IGF 2 R to persistently enhance placental functional development and nutrient delivery and promote fetal growth. A. N.

40|$|Risperidone {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{atypical}} antipsychotic drugs and is approved for the treatment of mental disorders (eg. schizophrenia, autism) in children and adolescents. The present study investigated the repeated treatment effect of risperidone and associated neurotropic mechanism in the phencyclidine (PCP) -induced hyperlocomotion model in adolescent rats. We examined whether repeated risperidone treatment would cause a sensitized inhibition of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion in adolescent rats, and whether such a sensitization effect was mediated by risperidone-induced alterations in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), an important biomarker which plays a role in neuropathology of schizophrenia and action of antipsychotic medications. Male adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal days [P] 44 - 48) were first treated with risperidone (0. 50 or 1. 0 mg/kg, <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> and tested in the PCP (3. 2 mg/kg, sc) -induced hyperlocomotion model for 5 consecutive days. Three days later, all rats were then challenged with risperidone (0. 50 mg/kg) and PCP on ~P 51 to assess the potential sensitization effect. They were then sacrificed 1 day later and BDNF levels in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), striatum and hippocampus were examined using Western blotting. Behaviorally, repeated risperidone treatment progressively increased its inhibition of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion across the 5 test days. In the subsequent challenge test, rats previously treated with risperidone 1. 0 mg/kg showed a stronger inhibition of the PCP-induced hyperlocomotion than those previously treated with vehicle, indicating a robust risperidone sensitization. However, no such group differences in the BDNF and its precursor proteins in any of the three brain regions were found. Therefore, although repeated adolescent risperidone administration induced a sensitization effect in the PCP-induced hyperlocomotion model in a dose-dependent fashion, whether BDNF is critically involved in this effect is still unsettled. Future work that directly manipulates BDNF systems is needed to further investigate this issue...|$|R

In this study, we investigated {{the time course of}} PPI disruption induced by repeated amphetamine, quinpirole, phencyclidine (PCP), and dizocilpine (MK- 801) treatment. We focused on how PPI disruption development was influenced by drug administration regimens, comparing a constant versus an escalating dosing regimen. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were repeatedly treated with amphetamine (1. 25 – 5. 0 mg/kg, or constant 5. 0 mg/kg, sc), PCP (0. 50 – 2. 0 mg/kg, or constant 0. 5, 1. 0 or 2. 0 mg/kg, sc), quinpirole (0. 03 – 0. 12 mg/kg, or constant 0. 12 mg/kg, sc), MK- 801 (0. 025 – 0. 10 mg/kg, or constant 0. 10 mg/kg, <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> (saline) and tested for PPI once daily for 6 consecutive days. When amphetamine 5. 0 mg/kg or quinpirole 0. 12 mg/kg was administrated on a constant dosing schedule, both drugs disrupted PPI upon acute administration, but had no effect after repeated treatment and testing (days 2 – 5). However, when amphetamine 5. 0 mg/kg or quinpirole 0. 12 mg/kg was preceded by two lower doses in an escalating dosing regimen, both drugs still disrupted PPI on days 5 and 6 when the constant amphetamine and quinpirole had no effect. For PCP and MK- 801, repeated treatment under both regimens produced a stable and persistent disruption of PPI. Startle magnitude increased progressively and dose-dependently under both regimens for all drugs except for quinpirole, which caused a decrease. These results suggest that the drug dosing schedule, rather than the absolute amount of drug that an animal receives, has a greater impact on the development of PPI-disruptive effect of dopamine agonists than NMDA antagonists. Thus, in order to mimic the emerging process of PPI deficit with dopamine agonists, an escalating dosing regimen should be used...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{remodeling}} is {{an important}} feature of asthma physiopathology that can contribute to irreversible changes in lung function. Although neurokinins influence lung inflammation, their exact role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling remains to be determined. Our objective was to investigate whether inactivation of capsaicin-sensitive nerves modulates pulmonary ECM remodeling in animals with chronic lung inflammation. After 14 days of capsaicin (50 mg/kg, <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> administration, male Hartley guinea pigs weighing 250 - 300 g were submitted to seven inhalations of increasing doses of ovalbumin (1, 2. 5, and 5 mg/mL) or saline for 4 weeks. Seventy-two hours after the seventh inhalation, animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated and the lung mechanics and collagen and elastic fiber content in the airways, vessels and lung parenchyma were evaluated. Ovalbumin-exposed animals presented increasing collagen and elastic fiber content, respectively, in the airways (9. 2 ± 0. 9; 13. 8 ± 1. 2), vessels (19. 8 ± 0. 8; 13. 4 ± 0. 5) and lung parenchyma (9. 2 ± 0. 9; 13. 8 ± 1. 2) compared to control (P < 0. 05). Capsaicin treatment reduced collagen and elastic fibers, respectively, in airways (1. 7 ± 1. 1; 7. 9 ± 1. 5), vessels (2. 8 ± 1. 1; 4. 4 ± 1. 1) and lung tissue (2. 8 ± 1. 1; 4. 4 ± 1. 1) of ovalbumin-exposed animals (P < 0. 05). These findings were positively correlated with lung mechanical responses to antigenic challenge (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, inactivation of capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibers reduces pulmonary remodeling, particularly collagen and elastic fibers, which contributes to the attenuation of pulmonary functional parameters.

Objective : In the present studies, we investigated whether systemically administered E- 2078 could produce κ-agonist effects in rhesus monkeys, in tests of antinociception, diuresis and ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) discrimination. Methods : E- 2078 (0. 32 – 18 mg/kg, SC, IM or IV) was tested in the warm water (50 °, 55 °C) tail withdrawal assay of thermal antinociception. The diuretic effects of E- 2078 (0. 056 – 1. 8 mg/kg, SC) were also compared to those of the κ-agonist, U 69, 593 (0. 01 – 0. 32 mg/kg, SC).

Results : E- 2078 did not produce thermal antinociception in rhesus monkeys following SC or IM administration, up to the largest doses presently studied (i. e., 18 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). E- 2078 caused thermal antinociception by the IV route, but this effect was not apparently mediated by κ- or µ-opioid receptors, as shown by its insensitivity to quadazocine (1 mg/kg) pretreatment. However, SC E- 2078 caused diuresis, and this effect was blocked by quadazocine pretreatment, consistent with mediation by κ-opioid receptors. E- 2078 generalized in EKC-discriminating monkeys, but only after the largest dose (3. 2 mg/kg), and only following IV administration. Conclusions : The present studies suggest that systemically administered E- 2078 can produce some κ-receptor mediated effects in rhesus monkeys, but its profile of action is not identical to non-peptidic κ-agonists following all routes of administration, or across all experimental situations...|$|R
40|$|Antipsychotic drugs {{suppress}} animals' {{ability to}} avoid an aversive stimulus in the conditioned avoidance response model (CAR). This behavioral effect is thought to reflect antipsychotic activity and is suggested to be mediated by a drug's action in attenuating the motivational salience of a conditioned stimulus (CS). In the present study, we tested whether atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine act through this behavioral mechanism by manipulating the number of avoidance test trials. We reasoned that more CS trials {{in the presence of}} clozapine or olanzapine would afford the drug more opportunities to decrease the motivational salience of the CS, thus avoidance decline would be greater with the increase of CS trials in each test session. In two separate experiments, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were tested under clozapine (5. 0 mg/kg, sc), olanzapine (0. 5 mg/kg, <b>sc)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> (sterile water) for 6 consecutive days in three CS trial conditions (i. e. 3, 10, and 40 CS trials per session). Two days later, all rats were tested under the same 40 -trial session after receiving clozapine (5. 0 mg/kg, sc) or olanzapine (0. 5 mg/kg, sc). Results show that repeated clozapine and olanzapine treatment persistently decreased avoidance response, and this effect was potentiated by the increase of number of CS trials in the test sessions, as the clozapine-treated or olanzapine-treated rats tested under the 40 -trial or 10 -trial condition had significantly lower avoidance and faster decline across-sessions than those tested under the 3 -trial condition. This potentiated effect was not only seen in the total avoidance percentage, but also observed in the within-session decline pattern in the last three drug test sessions and in the final 40 -trial test session. These findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of a drug can be enhanced by increasing the exposure of symptoms {{in the presence of the}} drug. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Hybridization {{with high}} {{specific}} energy-storage de-vices such as supercapacitors (SCs) has important advantages in fuel-cell (FC) -based systems. This paper presents an approach {{for the design}} and analysis of FC hybrid systems (FCHSs) oriented to automotive applications. The FCHS {{is considered to be}} the most attractive long-term option for propulsion of passenger cars. The design stage includes the determination of the electrical topology and the determination of the hybridization degree (HD) according to drivability conditions. With the selected design, the optimal hydrogen consumption for different driving cycles and the energy flows in the hybrid vehicle are analyzed. The entire study is per-formed with a detailed model of the FCHS in the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) : the determination of the HD according to drivability requirements, the analysis of the energy flows, and the computation of the optimal hydrogen consumption. The results show that hybridization allows a significant improvement in the hydrogen economy through the recovered energy from breaking. At the same time, the results suggest a conflict between a design according to drivability conditions and a design for the highest ef-ficiency. The conclusion is that hybridization with <b>SCs</b> in FC-based <b>vehicles</b> is a meaningful procedure that enhances performance.
