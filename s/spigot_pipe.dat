50|$|Segmental {{sliplining}} is {{very similar}} to continuous sliplining. The difference is primarily based on the pipe material used as the new carrier pipe. When using any bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>pipe</b> such as FRP, PVC, HDPE or Spirally Welded Steel Pipe, the individual pieces of pipe are lowered into place, pushed together, and pushed along the existing pipe corridor.|$|E
50|$|Aqueducts brought {{fresh water}} to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs {{there are the}} source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The {{aqueduct}} branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and <b>spigots.</b> The <b>pipes</b> were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered as at Mycenae.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{different}} socket and seals exist. The most modern is the 'push-joint' or 'slip-joint', whereby the socket and rubber seal is designed to allow the <b>pipe</b> <b>spigot</b> to be, after lubrication, simply pushed into the socket. Push joints remain proprietary designs. Also available are locking gasket systems. These locking gasket systems allow the pipe to be pushed together but do not allow the joint to come apart without using a special tool or torch on the gasket.|$|R
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted <b>spigots.</b> It is <b>piped</b> to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|R
