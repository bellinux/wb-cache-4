5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} continued {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale.</b> <b>The</b> eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly {{as part of a}} diurnal fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August17.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to <b>scale</b> <b>the</b> islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to <b>scale</b> <b>the</b> island's cliffs.|$|E
5|$|As it {{completed}} its second cyclonic loop during March 2, the FMS {{reported that the}} system had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 165km/h (105mph), which made it a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian <b>scale.</b> <b>The</b> United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 195km/h (120mph), which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm.

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing <b>scale.</b> <b>The</b> ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in full <b>scale,</b> <b>the</b> school {{explosion}} used drywall {{around the}} interior of the set to protect it from the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{was also}} {{discovered}} in Southern California {{but on a}} much smaller <b>scale.</b> <b>The</b> first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E
50|$|The top of {{the head}} is covered by large {{symmetrical}} <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> dorsal <b>scales,</b> which are smooth and glossy, number 50-65 rows at midbody, while there are 315-355 ventral <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> tail has 60-75 mainly single subcaudal <b>scales</b> and <b>the</b> anal <b>scale</b> is single. <b>The</b> posterior subcaudals tend to be divided, often irregularly.|$|R
50|$|The fish {{is covered}} with cycloid <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> <b>scales</b> on <b>the</b> chub’s dorsal section, or top of the fish, have brown pigment. <b>The</b> <b>scales</b> on <b>the</b> ventral section, or bottom of the fish, lack pigment and are white in appearance.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane John, {{also known}} as Typhoon John, was both the longest-lasting and the farthest-traveling {{tropical}} cyclone ever observed. John formed during the 1994 Pacific hurricane season, which had above average activity due to the El Niño of 1994–95 and peaked as a Category5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind <b>scale,</b> <b>the</b> highest categorization for hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest <b>scale</b> (<b>the</b> synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|Of the 20storms {{during the}} season, 11 {{attained}} hurricane status. Six {{of those were}} major hurricanes, with sustained winds of over 111mph (179km/h). Two of the hurricanes reached winds of , which is a Category 5the highest of 5 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale.</b> <b>The</b> season produced several deadly storms, with eight storms killing more than 20people.

50|$|The {{head has}} a short snout, {{more so in}} males than in females. The eyes are large and {{surrounded}} by 9-16 circumorbital <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> orbits (eyes) are separated by 7-9 <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> nostril is like a slit and separated from the eye by two <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> eye and the supralabials are separated by a single row of <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> supralabials number 7-10, of which the fourth is enlarged. The body is covered with elongated, heavily keeled dorsal scales that give this animal a unique 'shaggy' idea to its skin, almost bristly appearance. <b>The</b> <b>scales</b> around <b>the</b> head and neck are the longest, decreasing posteriorly. Midbody, <b>the</b> dorsal <b>scales</b> are in 15-19 rows. There are 149-166 ventral scales and 35-64 subcaudals. <b>The</b> anal <b>scale</b> is single.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16.5-17.5 mm. The forewings are yellowish cream mottled {{with numerous}} black-tipped <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> veins are white {{and there are}} seven tufts of ochreous brown raised <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 20 mm. The forewings are white, the costal area suffused with pale olive brown <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> transverse lines are marked with dark purple-brown <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are shining white.|$|R
5|$|On May 19, {{prior to}} the start of the season, NOAA forecasters issued a 55%probability of above normal activity. The forecasters {{predicted}} 11–15 tropical storms, 6–9 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2–4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale.</b> <b>The</b> above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of La Niña developing in the season.|$|E

New techniques are changing the cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems, GPS locators, and self-steer programs for driverless machines giving economic benefits.|$|E
50|$|Observing the {{equation}} above {{it is clear}} to see that while the Reynolds numbers must be equal for <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> model and <b>the</b> prototype, this can be accomplished in many different ways, for example, in this problem by altering <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of <b>the</b> dynamic viscosity of the model to work with <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of <b>the</b> length. This means, <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> of different quantities, for example a material's elasticity in <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> model versus <b>the</b> prototype, are governed by equating the dimensionless quantities and <b>the</b> other quantity's <b>scaling</b> within <b>the</b> dimensionless quantity to ensure the dimensionless quantity of interest is of equal magnitude for <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> model and prototype.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are reddish brown, often {{sprinkled with}} light brown and dark brown <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> color is light brown anterior to the cell, sometimes sprinkled rather heavily with darker <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are light brown.|$|R
