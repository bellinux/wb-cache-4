5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of blind rivets, installation of a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer {{on one side and a}} bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an [...] "improved means of closing tubular rivets" [...] (granted May 1917). In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent that incorporated the pull-through mandrel, and allowed the rivet to be used blind. By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet company produced a [...] "cup" [...] rivet based on the design. It required a separate GKN mandrel and the rivet body to be hand assembled prior to use for the building of the Siskin III aircraft. Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo. Tucker Co. further modified the rivet design to produce a one-piece unit incorporating mandrel and rivet. This product was later developed in aluminium and trademarked as the [...] "POP" [...] rivet. The United Shoe Machinery Co. produced the design in the U.S. as inventors such as Carl Cherry and Lou Huck experimented with other techniques for expanding solid rivets.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} methods for {{installing}} <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. <b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of rivet. This tool is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A rivet compression tool does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internally and {{externally}} locked structural {{blind rivets}} {{can be used}} in aircraft applications because, unlike other types of blind rivets, the locked mandrels cannot fall out and are watertight. Since the mandrel is locked into place, they have the same or greater load-carrying capacity as <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> and may be used to replace <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> on all but the most critical stressed aircraft structures.|$|R
50|$|Semi-tubular rivets (also {{known as}} tubular rivets) {{are similar to}} solid rivets, except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole {{is to reduce the}} amount of force needed for {{application}} by rolling the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply a semitubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet.</b> Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets range from prototyping tools to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) are hand set, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semitubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC duct work, mechanical products, and electronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered highly special) and can be up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available, most common base metals are steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum and most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, tin. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assembly. An installed tubular rivet has a head on one side, with a rolled over and exposed shallow blind hole on the other.|$|E

40|$|The {{riveting}} process with a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> {{is one of}} the most applied joining processes in the aeronautic industry. New materials and new design requirements constitute challenges that drive the users to a better understanding of the installation process of riveted joints. Therefore, this study aims with the aid of FEM simulation to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and afterwards to predict the mechanical properties of the riveted joint depending on the installation parameters and characteristics of the adherends. The experimental installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude and continuous collection of process data. This paper deals with the simulation of the installation process. The simulation model consists of a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> with universal head described by the standard EN 6081 and aluminum (2024 T 351) ad herends. The rivet material model has been obtained by a compression test performed on specimens prepared from fasteners. The effect of friction was studied and a suitable friction coefficient identified. The developed installati onprocess model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with different experiments regarding the geometrical characteristics of the formed rivet head, the force-displacement curves and the surface residual strain of one adherend. Afterwards, the clearance fit between the rivet shank and the borehole, the rivet grip, and the squeeze force have been numerically studied in order to determine their effect on the joint. The effect of these parameters on the riveted joint is evaluated considering the residual stress and the residual contact force. The simulation of plastic deformation and residual stress state caused by the installation process provides a basis for the prediction of the mechanical properties of the riveted joint under external forces which is subject to ongoing research...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>rivets</b> {{are used}} in {{applications}} where reliability and safety count. A typical application for <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> can be found within the structural parts of aircraft. Hundreds of thousands of <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> are used to assemble the frame of a modern aircraft. Such rivets come with rounded (universal) or 100Â° countersunk heads. Typical materials for aircraft rivets are aluminium alloys (2017, 2024, 2117, 7050, 5056, 55000, V-65), titanium, and nickel-based alloys (e.g., Monel). Some aluminum alloy rivets are too hard to buck and must be softened by solution treating (precipitation hardening) prior to being bucked. [...] "Ice box" [...] aluminum alloy rivets harden with age, and must likewise be annealed and then kept at sub-freezing temperatures (hence the name [...] "ice box") to slow the age-hardening process. Steel rivets {{can be found in}} static structures such as bridges, cranes, and building frames.|$|R

40|$|Accepted: 18 August 2012 Many light metals, such as {{aluminum}} and magnesium alloys, are promised to provide sig-nificant weight reduction for automobiles. However, {{the difficulties in}} welding these metals seriously hinder their large-scale applications. A new, hybrid mechanical joining process is proposed to avoid the inherited metallurgical complications in welding. By spinning and pressing a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> into the metals, a joint is formed with the locking from the rivet, a stirred/mixed zone around the rivet, and solid bonding at the faying interface. This rivet-ing process combines the actions of friction-stir welding in which metals of different sheets are mechanically mixed, and self-piercing riveting process which embeds a rivet in the sheets. Experiments have shown that such a friction-stir riveting process can produce joints of compa-rable strength to those created by other joining means, and {{can be applied to}} difficult-to-weld metals and dissimilar metals, such as aluminum-to-aluminum, magnesium-to-magnesium, and aluminum-to-magnesium...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{frictional}} contact model is adopted {{for the analysis}} of conventional <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> setting.

Rigid- and elasto-plastic models are selected for process analysis in this paper. Process variables are selected to investigate the effect of variables on the successful rivet setting and servicing in any structure as force transmitting member. Major variables in riveting process are material variables such as material properties and geometrical variables, which are dimensions of head, shank, and blank diameters. Analysis in this study is concentrated on the influence of variety of materials and of shank dimensions on the contact area after rivet setting, i. e. after forming process of rivet head. Soft and hard materials are selected as mother materials to investigate how the selection of material influences on the riveting process in quantitative manner. The geometry of head is closely investigated through simulation in terms of contact status, i. e. contact area between rivet head and mother material, which would affect the snap fit joint by riveting...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid (bolted/bonded) joining is {{becoming}} one of the innovative joining processes for light weight structures in the transport industry, especially in the aerospace industry where weight reduction and high joining requirements are permanent challenges. Combining the adhesive bonding with the mechanical joining -riveting for instance- can lead to an enhancement of the properties of the joint compared to the wide established riveting, {{as a result of a}} synergistic load bearing interaction between the fastener and the adhesive bondline. The influence of the rivet installation process on a hybrid joint regarding the joint stress state, the change of the bondline thickness as well as its effects on the joint performance and load transfer are some of the factors that drive the users to a better understanding of the hybrid joining process. This paper deals therefore on one hand with the numerical simulation of the rivet installation process in an adhesively bonded joint to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and on the other hand with the investigation of the load transfer depending on the joint parameters. In order to simulate the rivet installation in adhesively bonded aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends, two models have been developed. One for a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> specified by the European standard EN 6081 another for a Lockbolt specified by the standards ASNA 2041 /ASNA 2045. The developed simulation model for the rivet installation process has been validated by comparing the simulation results with experiments regarding the qualitative change of the bondline thickness depending on the adhesive's Young's modulus and on the rivet type. The experimental rivet installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude. A generic numerical study to determine the effects of the adhesive's Young's modulus on the joint stress state and the effect of the rivet installation on the adhesive bondline has been carried out. In order to determine the load transfer behaviour in a hybrid joint, a single lap joint model for the above mentioned and aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends has been developed. A generic study to investigate the effect of the rivet installation and the adhesive Young's modulus on the load transfer has been carried out. To validate the simulation model for the single lap shear test, the simulation results have been compared with the experiments regarding the force displacement curves...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the project}} was to show the {{capability}} of increased tool velocities in <b>riveting</b> with selfpiercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b> The focus was on joints of high-strength steels with aluminum sheets. Also the combination of adhesive bonding with the high-speed riveting process was investigated. At some of the investigated sheet combinations a better joint quality, in terms of shaft groove filling, could be achieved by the high-speed joining process, whereby significant improvements in the connection strength properties could be reached. In addition, some investigations showed the ability to reduce the required width of the die forming ring by the usage of an elevated tool speed to reach a sufficient connection quality. Resulting benefits such as reduced deformation in the zone surrounding the joining point could also be demonstrated. By application of high-speed joining with self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> as a hybrid joining technique (mechanical joining and adhesive bonding), an improved connectivity between the adhesive and the component was determined. A detailed process analysis showed that the different cutting behavior of the steel sheets at the high speed process is responsible for the advantages of the process in the first place, while the problem of early indentation of the forming ring in the die-sided sheet can also occur in the high-speed joining process. The impact of the early die indentation on the joint quality is less detrimental at the high speed process than at the conventional joining with self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b> The sound emission of high speed process may represent a barrier to the use, as it comes due to sudden introduction of strong excitation energy of tools and components during the setting process. An implementation of the process in an industrial area requires further, more detailed studies about robust methods for the process control. Moreover, the test equipment developed for use in laboratory is relatively large, which limits the flexibility {{in the use of the}} investigated process. A high potential of high-speed joining as one solution for joining tasks could be revealed, where modern high and ultra-high strength steels are to be joined with significantly softer aluminum materials by self-piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The two {{historical}} fuselage failures, Comet in 1954 and Aloha in 1988, {{illustrate that}} similar accidents must be avoided {{which requires a}} profound understanding of the fatigue mechanisms involved, including analytical models to predict the fatigue behavior of riveted joints of a fuselage structure. The scope of the research project covers a variety of joint types and joining techniques for both monolithic and laminated sheet materials. The fuselage structure is a rather complicated system of parts consisting of skin sheets, tear straps, stringers, frames and doublers. These parts are interconnected by mechanically fastened and bonded joints, {{or a combination of}} both. The complex fuselage structure in the present research is reduced to specimen level size for laboratory testing and theoretical analysis. The major topics of the thesis are: Calculations of the combined tension and bending stress distribution in joints, which implies an extension of the so-called secondary bending model (Chapter 3). Find a direct and simple relation between the formed rivet head and squeeze force. (Chapter 4). Development of stress intensity factors for fatigue cracks in joints loaded under combined tension and application to fatigue crack growth results (Chapter 5). Fractographic observations with the scanning electron microscope of crack front shapes occurring in riveted joints under combined tension and bending (Chapter 5). Analysis of the residual strength of joints with fatigue cracks (Chapter 6). Neutral line model For mechanically fastened lap splice and butt joints in a fuselage structure, a dominant load is introduced by the Ground Air Ground (GAG) pressurization cycle. The hoop load is transferred from one skin panel to the next via the fasteners in the joint. The hoop load is offset by eccentricities in the load path, which causes secondary bending. The bending stress is a non-linear function of the applied tension load. The stress system in the joint then encompasses the membrane stress, the secondary bending stress and the bearing stress associated with the fastener loads on the holes. The secondary bending is highly depending on the magnitude of the eccentricity and the flexural rigidity of the joint between the fastener rows. The theory used to derive the bending stresses is based on the advanced beam theory. A further development of the neutral line model incorporates the internal moment, which is a useful representation of the load transfer occurring in multiple row joints. The calculation of the load transfer can be made for complicated lap splice and butt joints. With the developments of the present research, the neutral line model is still a very powerful tool to use {{in the early stages of}} joint design. It gives a good picture of the stresses in a joint. Riveting Solid rivets and more advanced fasteners are still widely used in aircraft fuselage design efforts. The fasteners are characterized by various parameters associated with the fastener material and geometry, sheet material and installation process. The present investigation focuses on solid rivets installed in aluminum and Glare. The expansion of a <b>solid</b> <b>rivet</b> in a rivet hole is important with respect to the fatigue properties of joints. The expanding rivet inside a fastener hole will create a compressive residual stress around the hole and this will delay fatigue crack nucleation. It is important to know the correct squeeze force used to form the driven head of a rivet. Measurements of the formed rivet head (diameter or protruding height) can be used to obtain information about the applied squeezing force. The riveting process is a non linear deformation process characterized by large plastic strains. Simple equations based on constant volume of the rivet and the Holloman model for uniform plastic deformation, were adopted to evaluate the riveting process. Useful results were obtained about the correlation between the rivet head deformation and the applied squeezing force. Stress intensity factors As a result of combined tension and secondary bending in a lap joint, fatigue cracks at the edge of a hole start at one side of the sheet only. Initially these cracks at the edge of a hole are growing as a part through the thickness corner crack, which later become a through the thickness crack, a so called through crack. But also for a through crack, the shape of the crack front is usually curved and the crack length measured at both sides of the sheet will be different. In view of fatigue crack growth predictions it then is necessary to obtain stress intensity factors for such slant and curved crack fronts. In the present investigation this problem has been explored for a simple configuration, which is an open hole in a sheet specimen subjected to combined tension and bending. Fatigue tests were carried out on specimens of AL 2024 T 3 clad sheet material with three different thicknesses (1. 0, 1. 6 and 2. 0 mm). In each specimen a single open countersunk hole was present. The development of the crack front is these specimens could be recorded because so-called marker load cycles were applied in these tests. It then was possible to observe the crack fronts in the scanning electron microscope, which still was a rather strenuous work. Reconstruction of the crack growth could be done for the larger part of the fatigue cracks. K-values were obtained for a large variety of crack front shapes and crack sizes. Comparison of the new calculated K values with existing solutions showed that the new solutions capture near the surface phenomenon more accurately than the previously published data. The improvement is a result of using an increased mesh density. For through the thickness cracks growing away from the countersunk hole, the normalized stress intensity factors approach the values of the normalized stress intensity factors for cracks emanating from a straight shank hole. Thus, the effect of the countersunk hole decreases with increasing crack length. The solutions for the pin loading b values show a dominant influence of the countersunk shape in the b/t values. Residual strength Static failure of a joint occurs when that joint is not able to carry the applied load anymore. The type of static failure in joints depends on the loading condition and the joint configuration. The most common static failure modes in monolithic aluminum joints are fastener shear failure, plate tension failure, bearing failure and plate shear failure. In Glare joints another failure mechanism, fastener pull-through, is often observed. This failure mechanism is related to the lower stiffness of Glare in thickness direction, leading to increased tilting of the fasteners and hence increased tensile stresses in the fastener. In the present thesis, a method is proposed to calculate the residual strength of joints of monolithic and fiber metal laminates. The method uses the remaining net section. For the fiber metal laminates the net section includes the remaining intact metal layers in combination with the intact fibers. The method starts with the blunt notch strength of the un cracked joint and the metal volume fraction for the fiber-metal laminates. The Norris failure criterion and the metal volume fraction are used to calculate the blunt notch strength for any possible Glare lay up. Secondary bending has a significant influence on the ultimate strength of both Glare and aluminum. The ultimate tensile strength reduces with increasing bending. Taking this into account, an empirically found reduction of 10...|$|E

5000|$|Blind rivets, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of blind rivets have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than <b>solid</b> <b>rivets.</b> Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration.

40|$|Punch <b>riveting</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> is an {{admitted}} {{technology in}} joining by forming of metallic workpieces. Conventional this technology workes with a rigid anvil. This causes {{the disadvantage of}} dimensioning {{the width of the}} coining ring separately for every single joining task to avoid a prematurely coining during the stamping stage. Additional the operating range of <b>solid</b> punch <b>riveting</b> is restricted by the process forces, the specific material requirements and the deformation of the sheets due to the joining process. The starting point for improvement respectively for the removal of these negative properties is the two-parted design of the anvil. Thus there can be realized a plane surface of coining ring and anvil ring during the stamping process. So an equal coining ring can be used for all joining tasks. In this research project the attributes of partitioned anvils in comparison with the state-of-the-art anvil were investigated. For that the M-Anvil (lower the anvil ring after stamping) and the P-Anvil (pre-tensioned anvil ring) were tested. The analyses show the advantages of the partitioned anvils especially in joining of different materials with distinct differences in strength. Referring to the process forces the conventional joining direction "soft in firm" is adverse. Through the realisation of distinctly smaller coining rings by using the partioned anvils clear benefits in process forces and deformation with the joining direction "firm in soft" can be generated. The strength of the joints made with the two-parted anvils and the conventional anvil are equal. Another advantage ist the universal use of the new anvils above all by the use of multi-zone punch rivets. Regarding this the geometry of the rivets should be improved particularly for equal required coining depth and the avoidance of the described demolition problem. The use of two-parted anvils effects essential convenient technological conditions and an extended range of application of <b>solid</b> punch <b>riveting.</b> Especially the M-Anvil is characterized by a huge reduction of process forces.

40|$|In this article, the {{possibilities}} for improving the joining process of self piercing <b>solid</b> <b>rivets</b> and self piercing nuts by increasing tool velocity are demonstrated. Thereby, the focus is put on the joining process of high strength steel sheets. Proper and reliable joining of these steels presents a major challenge for mechanical joining techniques. In the conventional joining process, where tool velocities well below 1 m/s are common, different problems during the joining process caused by the high strength of the steel sheets can occur. At the punch riveting process undesirable material flow or unwanted burr development can occur, and at the setting process of self piercing nuts a deformation of the nuts is possible. These problems can be reduced significantly by using elevated tool velocity. In the present paper, characteristics of the joining process at conventional and elevated tool velocity are investigated. The influence caused by different tool velocities within the joining process is shown by cross section- and process force analysis. In the cross section analysis of the mechanical joints it is demonstrated {{that the quality of}} connections can be improved significantly due to the usage of elevated tool velocity. The process force analysis of the high speed joining process shows an oscillating progression of tools and joining elements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{damages to}} fibre-reinforced {{plastics}} {{induced by the}} self-pierce riveting process are to be analysed and evaluated in a research project. A method was developed for the preparation of test specimens depicting the <b>solid</b> self-pierce <b>riveting</b> process, which allows the evaluation in X-ray computed tomography of defects such as delamination. Correlations of process influences and material variants are determined with the damage {{so that they can}} be minimized. In quasi-static and cyclic tests the extent of damage on laminate strength and load carrying capacity of joints will be investigated...|$|R
