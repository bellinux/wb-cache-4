40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{research}} was to analyse the relative manufacturing costs estimation process based on the similarity theory. Design/methodology/approach: The manufacturing costs were calculated with similarity theory use, where the exponents were assigned to operations and cutting processes. Findings: Many of construction <b>series</b> of <b>types</b> are similar partially. Because of {{that it is important}} to develop methods of manufacturing costs of <b>series</b> of <b>types</b> based on partial similarity. The cutting processes exponents use gives more accurate results than operation exponents. Research limitations/implications: The calculation process preparation stage is more time consuming with exponents assigned to cutting processes than to operations. Practical implications: Presented method was applied to sleeve <b>series</b> of <b>types</b> manufacturing cost estimation process.

40|$|Abstract. —Because {{populations of}} channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus have been {{difficult}} to sample in small impoundments, we determined whether tandem hoop net series (three nets tied in series and baited with cheese) fished for 3 d could effectively sample these populations. In 2000 we compared seasonal catch rates (catch per unit effort [CPUE], defined as the number of fish caught per series) and length frequencies (total length [TL]; mm) of channel catfish captured with two <b>types</b> of tandem <b>series</b> (long versus short bridles) and monitored the mortality of channel catfish along with the CPUE and mortality of bycatch in five lakes. Mean CPUE ranged from 12 to 194 fish/series for channel catfish and from 5 to 101 fish/series for bycatch among <b>series</b> <b>types,</b> lakes, and sampling periods. Mean CPUE for channel catfish and bycatch was similar between <b>series</b> <b>types</b> and did not consistently vary with sampling period. Length frequencies of channel catfish were usually similar between <b>series</b> <b>types.</b> Mortality was low for both channel catfish (0. 3 % of total catch) and bycatch (8 %). In 2001, using short-bridled series, we assessed gear size bias in one lake; sampled 66 lakes that are stocked annually with channel catfish fingerlings at rates of 12, 37, or 74 /ha; and estimated the sample sizes required for precise estimates of mean CPUE and accurate estimates of size structure. Hoop nets failed to capture channel catfish less than 25...|$|R
