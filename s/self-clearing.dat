40|$|Tsetse flies {{from the}} {{subspecies}} Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina palpalis gambiensis respectively transmit Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. The former causes the acute form of sleeping sickness, {{and the latter}} provokes the chronic form. Although several articles have reported G. m. morsitans gene expression following trypanosome infection, no comparable investigation has been performed for G. p. gambiensis. This report presents results on the differential expression of immune-related genes in G. p. gambiensis challenged with T. b. gambiense. The aim was to characterize transcriptomic events occurring in the tsetse gut during the parasite establishment step, which is the crucial {{first step in the}} parasite development cycle within its vector. The selected genes were chosen from those previously shown to be highly expressed in G. m. morsitans, to allow further comparison of gene expression in both Glossina species. Using quantitative PCR, genes were amplified from the dissected midguts of trypanosome-stimulated, infected, non-infected and <b>self-cleared</b> flies at three sampling timepoints (3, 10, and 20 days) after a bloodmeal. At the 3 -day sampling point, transferrin transcripts were significantly up-regulated in trypanosome-challenged flies versus flies fed on non-infected mice. In <b>self-cleared</b> flies, serpin- 2 and thioredoxin peroxidase- 3 transcripts were significantly up-regulated ten days after trypanosome challenge, whereas nitric oxide synthase and chitin-binding protein transcripts were up-regulated after 20 days. Although the expression levels of the other genes were highly variable, the expression of immune-related genes in G. p. gambiensis appears to be a time-dependent process. The possible biological significance of these findings is discussed, and the results are compared with previous reports for G. m. morsitans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — If a fault {{occurs in}} an Underground cable, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to track down the fault, as the conductors are concealed. The failure of cable does not occur instantly, it is developed slowly over a period of time, distinguished by series of single-phase sub-cycle incipient faults, accompanied by a high arc voltage. At the beginning the faults are <b>self-clearer</b> and incipient and they are unescorted by the operation of the overcurrent protective devices. If we overlook the incipient faults, they might provoke to a permanent fault. Hence an algorithm, incipient fault location algorithm is developed in a time-domain, to pinpoint the incipient fault in the underground cable. The algorithm estimates the distance to fault with respect to line impedance, by considering the arc voltage. The algorithm is simulated in MATLAB Simulink, it is evaluated by comparing with a base circuit, and for more accurate and error free identification of fault, ANN technique is used to process the result...|$|R
40|$|The {{examination}} of YLE in popular discourses in my doctoral thesis reveals the crucial importance of aesthetic arguments in debates on legitimacy of psb institutions. In popular discourses balanced and generally acceptable consensual style {{is seen as}} an inseparable part of psb media companies’ respectability and social responsibility. In other words, aesthetics is seen to be closely intertwined with ethical judgments. Aesthetic arguments are also closely linked to the concept of quality. Quality discourses, on their part, are always value-loaded even if this is not generally regocnized. In my study, the traditional quality discourse identified in popular YLE discourses is deeply rooted in vaguely Habermasian public sphere values underlining consensual value-neutrality. These values are engaged even when traditional quality discourse is turned upside down into nostalgic negative quality discourse denying all possibilities to have quality in commercialized media environment. Despite the high status of rational and deliberative communicative style in traditional popular YLE discourses these discourses are themselves based on dichotomies presupposing <b>self-clear</b> differences e. g. between non-commercial quality and commercial quantity.

As evidence for the timing of TOC using modern NAATs is limited, we performed a prospective cohort study to assess time to clearance when using modern RNA- and DNA-based NAATs. We included patients with anogenital gonorrhoea visiting the Sexually Transmitted Infection Clinic Amsterdam from March through October 2014. After treatment with ceftriaxone mono- or dual therapy (with azithromycin or doxycycline), anal, vaginal, or urine samples were self-collected during 28 consecutive days, and analyzed using an RNA-based NAAT (Aptima Combo 2) and a DNA-based NAAT (Cobas 4800). Clearance was defined as 3 consecutive negative results, and blips as isolated positive results following clearance. We included 77 patients; 5 <b>self-cleared</b> gonorrhoea before treatment and 10 were lost to follow-up. Clearance rate of the remaining 62 patients was 100 %.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between gas production from underground-to-inseam (UIS) drainage boreholes and various coal seam properties and operational factors were examined. Gas production from 279 UIS gas drainage boreholes was collated and assessed {{relative to a}} variety of coal geological properties and operational factors. The reasons for poor coal seam gas drainage performance from particular zones were investigated and actions to improve gas drainage performance have been recommended. Investigation were focussed on gas drainage performance from the Bulli seam of the Sydney Basin, focussing on West Cliff Colliery, where gas production was highly variable and many zones found to be difficult to drain. The degree of saturation (DoS) was found to {{have a significant impact on}} coal seam gas drainage, with decreased gas production from highly undersaturated zones with low permeability. Within West Cliff Colliery, in the areas where gas drainage was found to be particularly difficult, conventional UIS drainage was shown to be incapable of reducing the reservoir pressure below the critical desorption point prior to roadway development. From analysis of operational factors, drainage time was found to have a significant impact on gas production and appeared to be closely related to DoS indicating that coal with lower DoS required increased drainage time. Borehole length and orientation were found to have some impact on gas production with maximum gas production achieved from boreholes between 500 and 1 000 m long oriented between 5 and 60 O to the face cleat and between 0 and 40 O to the maximum horizontal stress. Boreholes drilled up-dip, with an apparent dip between 0. 0 and + 3. 0 O achieved increased gas production and the relationship was strongest in highly undersaturated coal. In saturated coal the initial gas flow rate tends to be high and the increased gas flow velocity supports the borehole to <b>self-clear</b> water and fines. With increasing age, gas flow velocity reduces which appears to affect the ability of the borehole to <b>self-clear,</b> particularly in boreholes oriented down-dip. Undulations such as troughs existing along the length of the boreholes also allow water and fines to accumulate which impedes gas drainage. No evidence was found to support a {{relationship between}} applied suction pressure and gas production. However where high suction pressure is applied to boreholes increased leakage may occur. A new method for enhancing coal seam gas production using cyclic injection of inert gas is proposed. The nature of coal seam gas emission from both fast and slow desorption gas testing methods was investigated using results from 4 185 gas tests collected from eight Australian underground coal mines, four located in Queensland and four in New South Wales. The following equations were found to best represent the average relationship between each gas content component and the total measured gas content (QM) :o Q 1 = 0. 0064 × QM 2. 0227 o Q 2 = 0. 0257 × QM 1. 9692 o Q 3 = 1. 1631 × QM 0. 7529 The following equations were proposed for use in estimating average and maximum QM based on Q 1 and initial desorption rate (IDR) : o QM(ave) = 9. 3729 × Q 10. 3328 o QM(max) = 2. 5665 × ln(IDR) + 2. 1686 o QM(ave) = 0. 7413 × √IDR •The relationship between QM and desorption rate index (DRI) was investigated and found to be different from the relationship presented in 1995, which is the basis for the DRI 900 methodology used to determine outburst threshold limit values (TLV) applicable to non-Bulli seam mines. The impact of recent increases to outburst TLV at several Bulli seam mines and the relationship between QM and DRI identified during this study suggests that a TLV applicable to the Bulli seam may be directly transferrable to non-Bulli seam mines. •From analysis of 3 355 fast desorption test results the relationship between QM and DRI was found to be independent of gas composition and represented by the following equation: o QM = 0. 008 × DRI The following relationships were identified from analysis of slow desorption data. • A linear relationship exists between Q 2 and QM that is independent of changes in seam gas composition. The rate of gas desorption was shown to be faster from samples with increased QM. Extending total desorption time beyond 200 days was shown to have little impact on Q 2 or the Q 2 :QM ratio. • From analysis of Q 2 and the Q 2 :QM ratio, no relationship was found between vitrinite content, porosity and mineral matter content of each sample, suggesting the nature of desorbed gas emission was independent of coal petrography. • Q 3 did not vary significantly in response to increasing QM whereas the Q 3 :QM ratio reduced. The results indicate coal samples with high QM, having increased DoS, desorb gas at a faster rate resulting in the Q 3 :QM ratio being less than from samples with low QM that desorb gas at a slower rate. The relationship between Q 3 and QM appeared to be independent of changes in seam gas composition. Extending the total desorption time beyond 200 days had little effect on residual gas content. • From analysis of Q 3 and the Q 3 :QM ratio relative to the measured vitrinite content, porosity and mineral matter content of the coal samples, it was found that residual gas content was independent of coal petrography. To reduce the risk of gas loss into solution from prolonged contact with the current conventional slow desorption testing apparatus; consideration should be given to the use of electronic gas testing apparatus for continual analysis of the desorbed gas from coal...|$|R

Although the majority of S. aureus community-acquired SSTIs are uncomplicated and <b>self-clearing</b> in nature, some per-centage of these cases progress into life-threatening invasive infections. Current animal models of S. aureus SSTI suffer from two drawbacks: these models are a better representation of hospital-acquired SSTI than community-acquired SSTI, and they involve methods that are difficult to replicate. For these reasons, we sought to develop a murine model of community-acquired methicil-lin-resistant S. aureus SSTI (CA-MRSA SSTI) that can be consistently reproduced with a high degree of precision. We utilized this model to begin to characterize the host immune response to this type of infection. We infected mice via epicutaneous chal-lenge of the skin on the outer ear pinna using Morrow-Brown allergy test needles coated in S. aureusUSA 300. Whenmice were challenged in this model, they developed small, purulent, <b>self-clearing</b> lesions with predictable areas of inflammation that mim-icked a human infection.

Deep shave biopsies were taken from each patient for histopathological examination. Results: All lesions showed a single punctum and this was confirmed by histopathological examination. Each individual lesion showed an epidermal hyperplasia consisting of many lobes which subdivided into lobules that contain the molluscum bodies.

40|$|Hydrocephalus is a {{neurological}} disorder that typically requires a long-term implantation of a shunt system to manage its symptoms. These shunt systems {{are notorious for}} their extremely high failure rate. More than 40 % of all implanted shunt systems fail within {{the first year of}} implantation. On average, 85 % of all hydrocephalus patients with shunt systems undergo at least two shunt-revision surgeries within 10 years of implantation. A large portion of this high failure rate can be attributed to biofouling-related obstructions and infections. Previously, we developed flexible polyimide-based magnetic microactuators to remove obstructions formed on hydrocephalus shunts. To test the long-term reliability of these magnetic microactuators, here we evaluate the impact of actuation cycle on mechanical stability of these microdevices. Over 50 minutes, 8 devices were actuated at 100 Hz at 37 °C continuously in phosphate buffered solution. By measuring the primary resonant frequency of each device, we were able to quantify changes in the structural integrity of each actuator. On average, the devices showed a drop of 2. 15 % in resonant frequencies.

During the early embedded phase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions interior to the ice line, uninhibited type-I migration leads to their efficient <b>self-clearing.</b> But, embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals at increasingly large radii, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel of heavy element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of disk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values comparable to or smaller {{than that of the}} minimum mass nebula model and type-I migration is no longer an effective disruption mechanism for mars-mass embryos. Over wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type-I migration efficiency, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a total mass several times that of the Earth. With this reservoir, there is an adequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky planets similar to those around the Sun. But, the onset of efficient gas accretion requires the emergence and retention of cores, more massive than a few M_earth, prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation probability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor axis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the strength of type-I migration. We suggest that the observed fraction of solar-type stars with gas giant planets can be reproduced only if the actual type-I migration time scale is an order of magnitude longer than that deduced from linear theories.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} to generate high voltage pulses (100 kV and up) with high peak power (10 MW and up) and high average power (1 MW and up) from a low voltage input source (e. g. +/- 1. 2 kV). This technology is presently being used to provide cathode pulse modulation for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator klystron RF amplifiers, which operate to 140 kV 11 MW peak power and 1. 1 MW average power. The design of the modulator, {{referred to as the}} Polyphase Resonant Converter-Modulator takes advantage of high-power component advances, in response {{to the needs of the}} traction motor industry (in particular, railroad locomotives), such as Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT's) and <b>self-clearing</b> metallized hazy polypropylene capacitors. In addition, the use of amorphous nanocrystalline transformer core alloy permits high frequency voltage and current transformation with low loss and small size. Other unique concepts embodied in the converter-modulator topology are polyphase resonant voltage multiplication and resonant rectification. These techniques further reduce size and improve electrical efficiency. Because of the resonant conversion techniques, electronic 'crowbars' and other load protective networks are not required. A shorted load detunes the circuit resonance and little power transfer can occur. This yields a high-power, high-voltage system that is inherently self-protective. To provide regulated output voltages, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of the individual IGBT pulses is used. A Digital signal Processor (DSP) is used to control the IGBT's, with adaptive feed forward and feedback control algorithms that improve pulse fidelity. The converter-modulator has many attributes that make it attractive to various pulse power and plasma applications such as high power RF sources, neutral beam modulators, and various plasma applications. This paper will review the design as used for the SNS accelerator and speculate on related plasma applications...|$|E
40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) {{is a new}} 1. 4 MW {{average power}} beam, 1 GeV {{accelerator}} being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The accelerator requires 15 converter-modulator stations each providing between 9 and 11 MW pulses with up to a 1. I MW average power. The converter-modulator {{can be described as}} a resonant 20 kHz polyphase boost inverter. Each converter modulator derives its buss voltage from a standard substation cast-core transformer. Each substation is followed by an SCR pre-regulator to accommodate voltage changes from no load to full load, in addition to providing a soft-start function. Energy storage is provided by <b>self-clearing</b> metallized hazy polypropylene traction capacitors. These capacitors do not fail short, but clear any internal anomaly. Three 'H-Bridge' IGBT transistor networks are used to generate the polyphase 20 kHz transformer primary drive waveforms. The 20 kHz drive waveforms are time-gated to generate the desired klystron pulse width. Pulse width modulation of the individual 20 lcHz pulses is utilized to provide regulated output waveforms with DSP based adaptive feedforward and feedback techniques. The boost transformer design utilizes nanocrystalline alloy that provides low core loss at design flux levels and switching frequencies. Capacitors are used on the transformer secondary networks to resonate the leakage inductance. The transformers are wound for a specific leakage inductance, not turns ratio. This design technique generates multiple secondary volts per turn as compared to the primary. With the appropriate tuning conditions, switching losses are minimized. The resonant topology has the added benefit of being deQed in a klystron fault condition, with little energy deposited in the arc. This obviates the need of crowbars or other related networks. A review of these design parameters, operational performance, production status, and OWL installation and performance to date will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology based {{dielectric}} elastomer transducers (DETs) {{are used}} for a grow- ing number of applications, including tunable optics, microfluidics, soft robotics, and haptic devices. DETs consist of non-conductive soft membranes sandwiched between compliant electrodes. They show unique performance characteristics, i. e. actuation strains similar to human skeletal muscles and millisecond response times which make them promising for applications as artificial muscles. Their main drawback, how- ever, are the high driving voltages of several kilovolts. For medical applications their operation voltage {{is limited to a}} few tens of volts. Within the SmartSphinc- ter project of the nano-tera. ch initiative, we have developed techniques to fabricate and characterize DET structures to be used as implants to treat fecal incontinence. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was selected as the material of choice for the mem- branes due to its biocompatibility and excellent elastic properties. The low adhesion of Au to PDMS has been reported in the literature and leads to the formation of Au-nanoclusters. The diameter of these nanoclusters was found to be (25 ± 10) nm and {{can be explained by the}} low surface energy of PDMS resulting in a Volmer- Weber growth mode. Therefore, we show that (3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) can be used as a molecular glue to promote the adhesion between the plasma treated PDMS and Au electrode. In order to reach actuation forces of several newtons as required for artificial fecal sphincters, multi-layer DETs have to be built. As a first step, a compact apparatus was designed and brought into operation to measure the exerted forces of planar DETs. DETs with an active area of 4 mm × 12 mm were fabricated on polyethy- lene naphthalate (PEN) cantilevers. The bending of the asymmetric cantilever was detected using a optical beam-deflection readout. The actuation force of such a single-layer DET was found to be below 1 mN. Therefore, thousands of DET layers have to be stacked to generate the required forces. Real-time measurements of the PEN cantilever curvature allow to extract the expected millisecond response time as well as to detect <b>self-clearing</b> effects of the electrode. The electrostatic pressure in DETs drives the incompressible PDMS elastomer to expand laterally by tens of percent. A major goal is the development of nanometer- thin flexible and stretchable electrodes. The two main paths employed to increase an electrode’s compliance involve either the manipulation of its intrinsic material properties or its structural features, such as the introduction of wrinkles, which arise above the critical stress of metal films on elastomer substrates. We have demon- strated that DETs with wrinkled Cr/Au electrodes show a drift of only 2...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric {{elastomers}} are {{an emerging}} transducer technology that fit an interesting niche. They {{are soft and}} compliant by nature, and can be stretched, either via mechanical or electrically-induced means, to very large strains. They are capable of large strains, high energy densities, and low costs, while possessing the additional advantages of being light weight and conformable. Dielectric elastomers are well suited for both actuator and generator applications, with the actuators being heralded as artificial muscles. There remains, however, several issues that prevent the widespread adoption of dielectric elastomer technology. Each applications has its set of technical issues; for actuator purposes, the primary issues are that the driving voltage required for high performance is in excess of 2000 V for most dielectric elastomer actuators, and that the lifetime when operated at high performance levels is rather short. The requirement to prestrain the elastomers to achieve high performance actuation in most cases can also add significant bulk and mass to the actuator as well as reduce its shelf-life. Thus, materials capable of high-strain performance without the requirement for prestrain are sought after. The ability to operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures and environmental conditions, as well as operate over a wide range of frequencies, is also very important for most actuator applications. The first part of this dissertation looks to tackle the aforementioned issues. Silicone materials are chosen as the base dielectric elastomer material as they are generally capable of operating over wide ranges of temperature and frequency and are generally unaffected by moisture and have good environmental stability. The work focuses on free-standing linear soft silicone actuators as this configuration is the most relevant for real applications. A particular soft silicone has been isolated a good candidate and was extensively tested in a free-standing linear actuator configuration {{to determine the effects of}} pre-stretch and the application of mechanical loads on its actuation performance. It is shown that when the mechanical loads are properly applied, large linear actuation strains of 120 % and work density of 0. 5 J/cm 3 can be obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when coupled with single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) compliant electrodes, fault-tolerance is introduced via <b>self-clearing</b> leading to significantly improved operational reliability. Driven at moderate electric fields, the actuators display relatively high linear actuation strain (25 %) without degradation of the electromechanical performance even after 85, 000 cycles. An issue related to the use of soft silicone actuators is that the work density is not very high when compared with many of the high-performance dielectric elastomer materials available. It is shown that the force output and work density of soft silicone actuators can be significantly enhanced by the addition of high permittivity titanium oxide nanoparticles. The nanocomposites are capable of maintaining the actuation strain performance of the pure silicone at relatively low electric fields while increasing the force output and work density due to the additive effects of mechanical reinforcement and permittivity enhancement. The high performance of the aforementioned soft silicone actuators requires the application of rather large levels of prestrain. In order to eliminate this requirement a novel all-silicone prestrain-locked interpenetrating polymer network (S-IPN) elastomer was developed. The elastomer is fabricated using a combination of two silicones: a soft room temperature vulcanizing silicone that serves as the host elastomer matrix, and a more rigid high temperature vulcanizing silicone that acts to preserve the prestrain in the host network. The free-standing prestrain-locked silicones show a more than twofold performance improvement over standard free-standing silicone films, with a linear strain of 25 % and an area strain of 45 % when tested in a diaphragm configuration. The S-IPN procedure was leveraged to improve electrode adhesion and stability as well as improve the interlayer adhesion in multilayer actuators. It is demonstrated that strongly bonded SWNT electrodes are capable of fault tolerance through <b>self-clearing,</b> even in multilayer actuators. The fault-tolerance and improved interlayer adhesion was used to fabricate prestrained free-standing silicone actuators capable of stable long life actuation (> 30, 000 cycles at > 20 % strain and > 500 cycles at ~ 40 % strain) while driving a load. Issues related to gradual electrode degradation are also addressed through the use of quasi-buckled electrodes. For generator purposes, the primary concerns are ensuring environmental stability, increasing energy density, lowering losses, and determining effective methods to couple the dielectric elastomer to natural energy sources. The factors that affect the energy density and efficiency are explored and it is found that energy density can be increased by applying larger mechanical strains and using stiffer materials. Increasing the permittivity of the material and bias voltage can also improve the energy density but reach a peak and decrease the energy density thereafter. The efficiency is shown to depend primarily on the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material, the applied strain, and a lumped parameter containing the stiffness, permittivity and nominal bias electric field. For a particular applied strain, the efficiency shows a peak at a particular value of the lumped parameter. Increasing stiffness shifts the location of the peak to higher values, and thus higher required electric fields, while increasing permittivity shifts it to lower values, and thus to lower electric fields. Using the results of this analysis, two material systems are explored: VHB acrylic elastomers at various prestrains and with various amounts of a stiffening additive, and a high energy density silicone-TiO 2 nanocomposite elastomer with various amounts of additive. It is shown that increasing prestrain in the VHB acrylic system increases the energy density, while the stiffening additive has the effect of making the acrylic stiffer but results in increased losses, result in poorer performance. The silicone TiO 2 composite demonstrates an increase in permittivity and stiffness with increasing additive while maintaining very high dielectric breakdown strength values. These increases are partially offset by small increases in mechanical and electrical losses. Calculations based on a simple model show that the generator energy density can be improved by a factor of 3 for a 20 wt. % TiO 2 loading at a strain of 50 % in area. The calculated generator energy density values exceed the maximum values measured experimentally for highly prestrained VHB 4910 acrylic elastomers. The focus on high energy density materials ignores the fact that not all applications require such a material, and that some applications may, in fact, benefit from the use of a softer material that is less intrusive. However, for lower energy density materials, parasitic losses due to electrode resistance and viscoelasticity play a larger role as relative energy gains are lower. With this is mind, a soft silicone single walled carbon nanotube composite is developed. The composite is very soft, has low viscoelastic losses, and is capable of being stretched up to > 150 % strain with only a marginal increase in resistance. The composite is also capable of being repeatedly stretched at up to 120 % strain for over 1000 cycles without any appreciable change in resistance and is capable of being stretched at strain rate up to 100 %/s or higher without affecting the performance of the electrode. Two applications for dielectric elastomer actuators are also explored. A pressure-based ocean wave energy harvesting concept was introduced that does not use any moving parts. A footfall energy harvester concept is also developed capable of being deployed inside the sole of a shoe or as a flexible floor tile...|$|E
