40|$|The {{background}} {{of this paper}} is the dual role that the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>can</b> have, of beeing both supportive and controlling in the meeting with clients. It is also about the power the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>can</b> have, how they handle the power in their profession and how they remain to it in the relationship with the client. The study is qualitative and built on interviews with eight <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> that work in different areas in the social services. We have chosen to see this dual role as if the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> have to, in their daily work, handle the roles as one authority role and one supportive role towards the client. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand how the dual role as the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> has in the profession, as a helper and a authority, is expressed in the work and relationship with the client. We have turned this purpose into two questions: How do <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> with authority remain to the dual roles of the profession? How do the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> describe and understand power? We don´t want to generalize in this study, we want to give an example of the <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> own experiences about the dual role. Our theoretical point of view is the pastoral power, street-level bureaucracy and human service organizations. We have also been using earlier research.

Recent regulation of the profession through state licensing statutes has thrust the subject into the legal arena.

Legal writing and legal reasoning, although sometimes logical-ly entangled and shrouded in jargon, are within the competence of nonlawyers, and if <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> fail to master this area, they fail to discharge a distinct pro-fessional responsibility to social work clients.

Continued study towards {{understanding}} schizophrenia and the impairments it can cause, {{is regarded}} as essential in the meaningful fulfilment of the educative and diagnostic contributions which the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>can</b> make in a comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation programme (involving patients and their families). The first section of this descriptive dissertation focuses on aspects like terminology, definition, {{and the most recent}} diagnostic criteria, in an endeavour to contribute theoretically towards understanding the illness. The complexity of the diagnostic process is emphasized, and the recent revision of the criteria (1987) is seen as indicative of continuous efforts towards improved diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. Previous studies, improved pharmacology and more sophisticated neurophysiological examining led to a change in focus with regard to aetiology and the development of the vulnerability-stress-coping-competence model which brought new hope with regard to outcome of treatment. Section Two highlights several interventions which the clinical <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> <b>can</b> undertake as psychotherapist, group and family therapist, as well as educator on primary, secondary and tertiary levels, from this model and within the psycho-educative perspective. The Neuro B programme, Stikland Hospital, Bellville, is described in section Three, {{as an example of a}} presently operating, comprehensive programme where these interventions can be holistically implemented. Particulars about 56 patients who have been involved in the programme are highlighted in Section Four, while Section Five deals with the opinions of former patients and their families concerning involvement in the programme - elicited by two sets of questionnaires.

In addition to understanding the Code of Ethics, <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>can</b> use the ETHIC model of decision making for resolving ethical dilemmas.
