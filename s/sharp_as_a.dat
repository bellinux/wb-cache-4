25|$|Sharp {{taught and}} {{composed}} music. Because music pedagogy {{of his time}} originated from Germany and was entirely based on tunes from German folk music, <b>Sharp,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> music teacher, {{became interested in the}} vocal and instrumental (dance) folk music of the British Isles, especially the tunes. He felt that speakers of English (and the other languages spoken in Britain and Ireland) ought to become acquainted with the patrimony of melodic expression that had grown up in the various regions there. He began collecting folk songs in 1903 when visiting his friend (and lyrics editor) Charles Marson in Hambridge, South Somerset. Over 1,600 tunes or texts were collected from 350 singers, and Sharp used these songs in his lectures and press campaign to urge the rescue of English folk song. Although Sharp collected songs from 15 other counties after 1907, the Somerset songs were the core of his experience and theories.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have always}} joked that I am <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sword, that I have the {{deciding}} strike that wins the important points. But all players can reach a pure state without conscious thought, where instinct dictates action. That {{is where you}} have to go, if you are to use your potential optimally." ...|$|E

5000|$|Adnan al-Sayegh (born 1955 in Al-Kufa, Iraq), [...] "is one of {{the most}} {{original}} voices from the generation of Iraqi poets known as the Eighties Movement. His poetry, crafted with elegance, and <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arrowhead, carries an intense passion for freedom love and beauty. Adnan uses his words <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weapon to denounce the devastation of war and the horrors of dictatorship." ...|$|R

2500|$|Longtime friend Nancy Stafford {{had called}} him on her mentor's 86th and final birthday, just one month before his death. In a statement, she said: [...] "He sounded strong at the time, and so upbeat and {{completely}} <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tack, as always," [...] said Stafford, [...] "I was shocked to find out barely a month later that he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sharp Nemesis NXT (which {{stands for}} [...] "Neoteric eXperimental Technology") is a sport-class kit-built {{aircraft}} designed for air racing. [...] It {{was designed by}} Nemesis Air Racing's president Jon <b>Sharp,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> follow-on to the highly successful Sharp Nemesis. [...] It is a two place, single engine, low wing, retractable gear kit aircraft. As designed, the aircraft {{is powered by a}} Lycoming TIO-540-NXT [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] six-cylinder engine.|$|E
2500|$|Nabokov {{employs a}} number of other {{techniques}} and themes to reinforce this contrast. For example, the characters' appearances. Ivanov's face is angular, almost harsh in its perspective: [...] "nose <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> draftsman's triangle; chin sturdy as an elbow". Whereas Nabokov emphasises the roundness of the Soviet: [...] "A puffy face ... with a plump mole by the right lobe of the nose." [...] Ivanov applies lather to [...] "the man's cheeks, rounded chin and upper lip." [...] His eyes are [...] "glittering little wheels". Later the Soviet's visage descends to being described as an [...] "eyeless, fat face".|$|E

50|$|Under twelve tone equal temperament, C for {{instance}} {{is the same}} as, or enharmonically equivalent to, B (B-natural), and G {{is the same as}} F (F-sharp). In any other tuning system, such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.|$|R
60|$|Here is some genuine thieves' {{literature}} {{after so}} much that was spurious; <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> etching, written with a shuddering soul. There is an intensity of consideration in the piece that shows {{it to be the}} transcript of familiar thoughts. It is the quintessence of many a doleful nightmare on the straw, when he felt himself swing helpless in the wind, and saw the birds turn about him, screaming and menacing his eyes.|$|R
2500|$|The show's {{official}} website describes Leslie as a [...] "skilled attorney". She {{is a lawyer}} at Vance Abram's law firm. Conwell stated: [...] "She's <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tack and self-assured." [...] Of Leslie's on and off storyline, Conwell said: [...] "With my character being a lawyer there {{always seems to be}} something going on in the city so Leslie is out there tending to her business". She explained that Leslie loves what she does, and [...] "finds different angles" [...] in cases which she can focus on. When Leslie first arrived, she became a [...] "one-time" [...] love interest for long-running character Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John). The couple didn't last long. Conwell said that when Leslie and Neil first hooked up, they went [...] "in for the kill" [...] and moved fast, but she wasn't sure whether the romance would be revisited.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin's {{electrical}} experiments led to {{his invention}} of the lightning rod. He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point could discharge silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching [...] "upright Rods of Iron, made <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down {{the outside of the}} Building into the Ground;... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!" [...] Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind that--Timms knows me, I know him. He'll oblige me as a {{personal}} favour. Wait here a bit. Perhaps, too, he's up at some party or another--he's a nice, jovial fellow, <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> needle, too; mind you, <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> needle, too.' ...|$|E

5000|$|In his Biographical Index of {{the current}} House of Commons, J. Wilson cites Richard <b>Sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} figure {{in the history of}} this institution and claims that it was [...] "...chiefly owing to his influences and exertions that the London Institute for the improvement of Science and Literature has been established." [...] Many of those who supported the idea of such an educational institution for London were fellow Dissenters who were forbidden to attend Oxford or Cambridge universities because of their religious beliefs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sharp</b> served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{judge of}} the 19th Judicial Circuit from 1978 to 1983. He was {{on the faculty of}} Indian River Community College in Ft. Pierce in 1979.|$|R

60|$|For {{a moment}} she sat still, and then a pain shot through her, a pain as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dagger thrust. She drew her hand away.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Mitchell <b>Sharp</b> {{was elected}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of Parliament {{representing}} Eglinton. Shortly thereafter, {{he was assigned}} the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Commerce. From 1965 through 1968, Sharp was the Minister of Finance. Other ministerial positions held include Secretary of State for External Affairs (1968-1974), President of the Privy Council (1974-1978) and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (1974-1978). <b>Sharp</b> resigned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parliamentarian in 1978.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sharp</b> {{appeared}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> portrait-painter at the Royal Academy in 1801, but {{he became}} known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> painter of small domestic scenes, usually of a humorous character. His works were populist, and successful in his day.|$|R

60|$|<b>Sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pistol-shot {{came that}} question, as Danton was turning away. The tone of it brought him up short. He turned again, Le Chapelier with him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you," [...] {{answered}} <b>a</b> small, <b>sharp</b> voice, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> long brass pin tried to straighten itself {{up in the}} middle of a faded blue cornflower, evidently prepared to address the meeting.|$|R
50|$|In 1654 he was {{nominated}} one of the assistant commissioners for Wiltshire, under the ordinance of 29 June for ejecting scandalous ministers, and was active among them, for example against Walter Bushnell, vicar of Box, (ejected in 1656). Byfields assembly practice had made him <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> examiner. He died intestate in London, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, {{at the end of}} 1660 or very beginning of 1661. His wife, Katharine, survived him, and administered to his effects on 12 February 1661. Samuel Butler in Hudibras made him iconic of those zealots for presbytery whose tactics opened the way to independency.|$|R
60|$|The {{light that}} touched the girl's face did not {{illuminate}} it all. Her profile was <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> old daguerreotype: {{he saw the}} flowing line from brow to chin, drawn with something of austere classic beauty, the arched lips and the faint indication of a gently-rounded cheek. The rest was in shadow, and the contrast of light and gloom was like a Rembrandt picture. Then the enameled spoons rattled as Lister put down the tray. He knew the picture. When he last saw the girl, her face was lighted like that by the blaze of a locomotive head-lamp.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{is doing}} {{justice to the}} {{patronage}} of the goddess of wisdom,' said Percy. 'He is as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> needle, and gets on in the world--has discarded [...] "conveying," [...] and promoted himself to selling lucifers.' ...|$|E
60|$|Pleas. If I am {{not mistaken}} in you, too, he has works of charity enough upon his hands already; but 'tis a willing soul, I'll warrant him, eager upon the quarry, and as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{governor}} of Covent-Garden.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, 'twould be a pity {{to make a}} mess here {{under such}} dubious circumstances. Mr. Dare, I {{perceive}} that a mean vagabond can be as <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political regenerator. I cry quits, if you care to do the same?' ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{ten minutes}} after, the hull rolled convulsively in the sea; went round once more; lifted its <b>sharp</b> prow <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man with arms pointed for a dive; gave a long seething plunge; and went down.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000-2004, Marc Sabat and Wolfgang von Schweinitz {{worked in}} Berlin {{to develop a}} {{different}} accidental based method, the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation. Following the method of notation suggested by Helmholtz in his classic [...] "On the Sensations of Tone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music", incorporating Ellis' invention of cents, and continuing Johnston's step into [...] "Extended JI", Sabat and Schweinitz consider each prime dimension of harmonic space to be represented by a unique symbol. In particular they take the conventional flats, naturals and <b>sharps</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F proceeds C-G-D-A-E-B-F and so on.|$|R
