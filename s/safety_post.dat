The program works hard meeting once a month until the month of prom to get activities, food, and shows together to entertain the students. They get donations from local businesses and churches to help cover the expenses. In the year 2010 the F.O.C.U.S. theme was [...] "An Evening in the Orient". With this theme, the entire inside {{of the high school}} was decorated to look like an oriental town complete with lanterns and a sushi bar.

50|$|Smerconish’s {{work as a}} radio {{broadcaster}} {{was consumed}} with the events of 9/11 for years following 2001. While {{paying close attention to}} the hearings of the 9/11 Commission, Smerconish picked up on a question put to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by Commissioner John Lehman which suggested that political correctness played a role in airport security before and after 9/11. Smerconish subsequently interviewed Lehman whereupon Lehman shared the fact that testimony in front of the Commission suggested there was a limit on the number of Arab males who could be pulled out of line at any one time for secondary screening. Smerconish wrote about Lehman’s account for his (then) column in the Philadelphia Daily News and stayed on the subject, eventually testifying before a Senate subcommittee at the invitation of Senator Arlen Specter. Ultimately, Smerconish wrote his first book, Flying Blind: How Political Correctness Continues to Compromise Airline <b>Safety</b> <b>Post</b> 9/11 (2004), about his investigation, and donated all proceeds to the Garden of Reflection, a 9/11 tribute garden in his native Bucks County, Pennsylvania.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{gain insight}} into the {{long-term}} impact of vagus nerve stimulation (with VNS Therapy) in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, we conducted the largest retrospective multicenter study to date over an extended follow-up period of up to 24 months. Methods: The primary objective was to assess change in seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type (defined as the most disabling seizure) following VNS device implantation. Treating physicians collected data from patient records from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. Results: The analysis population included 347 children (aged 6 months to 17. 9 years {{at the time of}} implant). At 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation, 32. 5 %, 37. 6 %, and 43. 8 %, respectively, of patients had 50 %reduction in baseline seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type. The responder rate was higher in a subgroup of patients who had no change in antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during the study. Favorable results were also evident for all secondary outcome measures including changes in seizure duration, ictal severity, postictal severity, quality of life, clinical global impression of improvement, and <b>safety.</b> <b>Post</b> hoc analyses demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between VNS total charge delivered per day and an increase in response rate. VNS Therapy is indicated as adjunctive therapy in children with focal, structural epilepsies, who for any reason are not good candidates for surgical treatment following the trial of two or more AEDs. Children with predominantly generalized seizures from genetic, structural epilepsies, like Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, could also benefit from VNS Therapy. Significance: The results demonstrate that adjunctive VNS Therapy in children with drug-resistant epilepsy reduces seizure frequency and is well tolerated over a 2 -year follow-up period. No new safety issues were identified. A post hoc analysis revealed a dose-response correlation for VNS in patients with epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{therapists}} need to {{efficiently and}} accurately screen a client’s medication management capacity, especially for clients post-stroke. Most therapists {{are not aware}} of, nor do they utilize specific assessments for, medication management capacity. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare {{the results of the}} ManageMed Screen (MMS), the Screening for Self-Medication <b>Safety</b> <b>Post</b> Stroke (S 5), and the Montreal Assessment of Cognition (MoCA) on a population of rehabilitation clients post-stroke to determine the usefulness of the medication assessment tools in clinical practice. These screens were designed for use in occupational therapy practice among other healthcare professions: the MMS was validated for the general adult population, the S 5 for clients post-stroke, and the MoCA is a cognitive screen used with adult clients with a variety of diagnoses including stroke. The MoCA was used to explore the potential relationship between cognition and medication management capacity. Study participants included five clients post-stroke and three occupational therapists. Clients were screened by the occupational therapists with the MMS, S 5, and MoCA, and clinicians also participated in a focus group to assess their perceived usefulness of the screens. Results demonstrated that the MMS score compared to the S 5 score was not statistically significant (r=. 671, p=. 215). There is no established consistency between the MoCA and MMS given these five clients. The MMS score was correlated to the MoCA score and was not found to be significant at a value of. 205 with p=. 741. The S 5 score was also correlated to the MoCA score using SPSS and was found to have a non-significant value of -. 287 and p=. 640. Additionally, through a focus group, clinicians deemed both the MMS and S 5 as useful, but felt the MMS was a more useful screen for their clinical practice with regard to efficient and practical use with clients post-stroke in a rehabilitation setting...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionExcimer {{laser energy}} is often {{required}} to extract chronically indwelling pacemaker and defibrillator leads from the vasculature and myocardium. This technique can {{be associated with}} vascular and right ventricular (RV) injuries. We sought to develop a safer, more effective method by applying site-specific delivery of electrosurgical energy (EE). MethodsUtilizing a polyacrylamide gel model to simulate soft tissue density, active and passive fixation defibrillator and pacemaker leads were implanted and manually extracted with and without EE delivered to the cathode. The amount of force required for complete removal was measured using a force transducer. The procedure was then repeated in an acute pig model to demonstrate proof of <b>safety.</b> <b>Post</b> mortem gross and histologic specimens were collected from the implantation site. ResultsIn the gel model, the force required for extraction, using manual traction in the active (83. 7 g) and passive (74. 6 g) fixation ICD leads, was reduced by 37. 8 % and 33. 5 %, respectively with EE (both p < 0. 01). The force required for extraction, using manual traction in the active (85. 2 g) and passive (71. 9 g) fixation pacemaker leads, was reduced by 64. 4 % and 42. 6 %, respectively with EE (both p < 0. 01). In an acute implantation pig model using an active fixation lead, delivery of EE to the cathode (n = 6) reduced the force required to manually extract the lead (140 g +/− 32. 5 versus 82 g +/− 14. 7, p = 0. 03). Post mortem analysis of the RV displayed formation of an epicardial hemorrhagic lesion that was also present after manual traction and EE. There was absence of pericardial effusion, perforation, and ventricular arrhythmia. ConclusionsSite-specific delivery of EE to areas of exposed metal along the lead decreased the force necessary for lead extraction in an in vitro and in vivo model. Further studies are needed to evaluate its application in clinical care...|$|E

50|$|The Aquitaine duchy {{sprawling}} {{out from}} the Loire to the Pyrenees was constructed in the 11th century. It was also from this time on, and for seven centuries, that the pilgrimage to saint Jacques de Compostelle began. Pilgrims came from all over Europe crossing the Landes. They followed itineraries that outlined resting stops, places of worship, castles or mottes surrounded by stakes. They used three routes including that of the coast. A number of commandaries or hospitals erected by the Templars or the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem (e.g., Contis, Saint-Paul-en-Born, Parentis, etc.) were regrouped on this coast road. Mimizan was created as a Sauveté (a sacred refuge created by the church {{for the protection of}} the weak).Its limits were set by nine monumental <b>posts</b> (<b>safety</b> <b>posts)</b> in the form of pyramids.
