40|$|Abstract: The use of {{a double}} <b>sided</b> <b>friction</b> stir welding tool (known as a bobbin tool) has the {{advantage}} of giving a processed zone in the workpiece which is more or less rectangular in cross section, as opposed the triangular zone which is more typically found when conventional friction stir welding tool designs are used. In addition, the net axial force on the workpiece is almost zero, which has significant beneficial implications in machine design and cost. However, the response of these tools in generating fine microstructures in the nugget area has not been established. The paper presents detailed metallographic analyses of microstructures produced in 25 mm AA 6082 -T 6 aluminium wrought alloy, and examines grain size, texture and mechanical properties as a function of processing parameters and tool design, and offers comparison with data from welds made with conventional tools...|$|R

5000|$|Like steel roller {{coasters}}, wooden {{roller coasters}} usually {{use the same}} three-wheel design, pioneered by John Miller. Each set of wheels includes a running wheel (on top of the track), a <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> (or [...] "guide") wheel (to guide motion in the lateral plane and reduce excessive side-to-side movement known as [...] "hunting") and an upstop wheel (beneath the track to prevent cars from flying off the track). Some wooden coasters, such as Leap-The-Dips, do not have upstop wheels and are known as <b>side</b> <b>friction</b> roller coasters. As a result, the turns and drops are more gentle than on modern wooden roller coasters. Scenic Railway roller coasters also lack upstop wheels but rely on a brake operator to control the speed so that upstop wheels are not necessary.

The investigation, conducted on dry and wet runway surfaces, utilized one main gear wheel, brake, and tire assembly of a DC- 9 series 10 airplane. During maximum braking, the average ratio of the drag force friction coefficient developed by the antiskid system to the maximum drag force friction coefficient available was higher on the dry surface than on damp and flooded surfaces, and was reduced with lighter vertical loads, higher yaw angles, and when new tire treads were replaced by worn treads. Similarly, the average ratio of <b>side</b> force <b>friction</b> coefficient developed by the tire under antiskid control to the maximum <b>side</b> force <b>friction</b> coefficient available to a freely rolling yawed tire decreased with increasing yaw angle, generally increased with ground speed, and decreased when tires with new treads were replaced by those with worn treads...|$|R

This paper argues that the “problem of access ” should rather be analyzed by identifying different demand and supply constraints.

We distinguish between payment and savings services and fixed intermediation costs, on the one hand, and lending services and different sources of credit risk, on the other hand. We include both supply and demand <b>side</b> <b>frictions</b> that can lead to lower access. The analysis helps identify bankable and banked population, the binding constraint to close the gap between the two, and policies to prudently expand the bankable population.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{a new set}} of stylized facts on the 2008 - 2009 trade collapse that we hope can be used to shed light on the importance of demand and supply-side factors in explaining the fall in trade. In particular, we decompose the fall in international trade into product entry and exit, price changes, and quantity changes for imports by Brazil, the European Union, Indonesia, and the United States. When we aggregate across all products, most of the countries analyzed experienced a decline in new products, a rise in product exit, and falls in quantity for product lines that continued to be traded. The evidence suggests that the intensive rather than extensive margin mattered the most, consistent with studies of other countries and previous recessionary periods. On average, quantities declined and prices fell. However, these average effects mask enormous differences across different products. Price declines were driven primarily by commodities. Within manufacturing, while most quantity changes were negative, in most cases price changes moved in the opposite direction. Consequently, within manufacturing, there is some evidence consistent with the hypothesis that supply <b>side</b> <b>frictions</b> played a role. For the United States, price increases were most significant in sectors which are typically credit constrained. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Road Intersection is a {{time-sharing}} space {{upon which}} {{the performance of the}} full corridor depends to a large extent. Malfunction or poorly designed and maintained junctions lead to chronic congestion. Unplanned development beside the intersection also impairs the movement of both through and turning traffic. Moreover, road side footpaths are mandatory for pedestrian movements. If footpath is blocked by temporary shops, pedestrians are compelled to come into the road causing a concern of their safety as well as traffic congestion. In this paper, an overview of faulty decisions of city authorities in an important road intersection of Dhaka city and its surroundings are discussed. An attempt has been taken to focus on the irrational decisions of the city authorities’ viz. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) and Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) to give permission of almost 25 markets near intersections without provision of any parking. By conducting photogrammetric survey of the area, it is found that a totally unattractive scene now exists in the area even 50 % of the existing road is lost sometimes due to <b>side</b> <b>frictions.</b> City authority, who supposed to be the guardian of the city, is making non-engineering, unscientific approach to solve problem which rather is acting as a problem creator, as such {{there is a need for}} revising the permission guidelines of shopping malls near intersections.

40|$|Advanced Traffic Control Systems (ATCS) {{are usually}} used {{in large cities}} in {{developing}} countries to ease congestion pro-blems. However, {{the application of the}} systems is not to all signalized intersections in the city. Local conditions such as geo-metric conditions and traffic conditions should be taken into account seriously. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify charac-teristics of signalized intersections which need to be under ATCS. Field data were collected at 19 signalized intersections un-der ATCS surveillance and 10 streams related to the intersections, in Bandung Indonesia. Manual traffic counts, video came-ras, and floating car technique were used to collect the data during morning peak period (07 : 00 - 08 : 00 am), off peak periods (10 : 00 - 11 : 00 am), and afternoon peak period (04 : 30 - 05 : 30 pm). Measurements to determine the characteristics of signalized intersections are throughput per capacity at each leg intersection, number of queue at each leg intersection, and travel time at each stream. The results found that the application of ATCS is recommended to signalized intersections with characteristics of many leg intersections, located in CBD, closed distance to adjacent intersection and high <b>side</b> <b>frictions.</b> The findings of this study are very beneficial not only for Bandung but for other large cities in Indonesia that have similar local conditions.

Friction stir welding method of welding is welding by utilizing the heat due to rotation of the tool that is rubbing against the parent material or workpiece.
