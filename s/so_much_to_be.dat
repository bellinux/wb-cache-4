5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally {{felt that he was}} not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com {{called it}} a [...] "great little episode" [...] and strong setup for the season finale. Although Sundermann {{initially}} had reservations about Leslie and Ben getting together, he now said it felt real because Leslie was willing to risk a job she loved <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with him. Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin said {{although the idea of}} pairing two co-workers felt like a conventional television move, he did not mind with Leslie and Ben because they are such a [...] "charming and well-matched pair". Martin also said Pamela Reed [...] "absolutely kills it" [...] as Leslie's mother. Rick Porter of Zap2it said Parks and Recreation was at the [...] "top of its game", and that [...] "The Bubble" [...] worked well paired along with the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian". He praised the comedic and romantic chemistry between Amy Poehler and Adam Scott, and said the subplot with Chris imposing changes on the parks department was [...] "great fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} had a {{one-night stand}} with George O'Malley, in the second season. Series writer Stacy McKee, said of the sexual encounter: [...] "There’s no turning back. There’s nothing George and Meredith can do. The damage is done – things {{will never be the}} same. They’ve just changed something important in their lives FOREVER and…they are freaking out." [...] Grey's character development has also been known as an influence on the creation of her half-sister, Lexie Grey. Particularly, it has been made clear that they both share the same motives. McKee offered her thoughts: [...] "Meredith and Lexie both want to succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> whole. But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.

He {{attempted}} to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as [...] "Why waste money on space research when there is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done here?". He said that when asked these type of questions [...] "I know that I'm dealing with an idiot." [...] Another question that annoyed him was [...] "what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?" [...] Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and 'cranks'. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E
500|$|When she {{returned}} from Russia, Pankhurst {{was delighted to}} find that women's right to vote was finally {{on its way to}} becoming a reality. The 1918 Representation of the People Act removed property restrictions on men's suffrage and granted the vote to women over the age of 30 (with several restrictions). As suffragists and suffragettes celebrated and prepared for its imminent passage, a new schism erupted: should women's political organisations join forces with those established by men? Many socialists and moderates supported unity of the sexes in politics, but Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst saw the best hope in remaining separate. They reinvented the WSPU as the Women's Party, still open only to women. Women, they said, [...] "can best serve the nation by keeping clear of men's party political machinery and traditions, which, by universal consent, leave <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desired." [...] The party favoured equal marriage laws, equal pay for equal work, and equal job opportunities for women. These were matters for the post-war era, however. While the fighting continued the Women's Party demanded no compromise in the defeat of Germany; the removal from government of anyone with family ties to Germany or pacifist attitudes; and shorter work hours to forestall labour strikes. This last plank in the party's platform was meant to discourage potential interest in Bolshevism, about which Pankhurst was increasingly anxious.|$|E
2500|$|The quote about Attlee, [...] "A modest man, {{but then}} he has <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modest about," [...] is {{commonly}} ascribed to Churchill—though Churchill denied saying it, and respected Attlee's service in the War Cabinet). Attlee's modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. In terms of the machinery of government, {{he was one of}} the most businesslike and effective of all the UK Prime Ministers.|$|E

2500|$|Slaveholders, {{primarily}} in the South, had considerable [...] "loss of property" [...] as thousands of slaves escaped to British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters' complacency about slave [...] "contentment" [...] was shocked by seeing that slaves would risk <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free. Afterward, when some freed slaves had been settled at Bermuda, slaveholders such as Major Pierce Butler of South Carolina tried to persuade them {{to return to the}} United States, to no avail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lure of the}} {{countryside}} could prove a distraction to an active boy, who needed to be pulled back into line. Henry Dowes wrote to Cromwell in September 1534 explaining that he had used every effort to advance Gregory in his studies, but “forcause summer was spent {{in the service of}} the wild gods, it is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded after what fashion youth is brought up.” However, by April 1535, Dowes was able to report to his father that [...] "his improvement is greater than at any time here before, partly because he is brought into some awe and dread, and is ready to give himself to learning when required, partly because those things which formerly alienated his mind from study are now withdrawn." ...|$|E

She also recalled an instance when she was home alone at age 17, where she covered the windows with dark towels to block out the sunlight and began cutting herself and slitting her arms with rusty scissors, stating that she [...] "wanted to die" [...] and [...] "couldn't feel any physical pain at all because [...] was just hurting so much inside".|$|E

2500|$|When she was 15, {{her parents}} separated, and her mother, {{supportive}} of her daughter's desire to act, moved {{with her to}} Los Angeles, where they lived out of their car until Swank's mother saved enough money to rent an apartment. Swank has called her mother the inspiration for her acting career and her life. In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out because of her ADHD and lack of interest. She described her time at South Pasadena High School, [...] "I felt like such an outsider. I didn't feel like I fit in. I didn't belong in any way. I didn't even feel like the teachers wanted me there. I just felt like I wasn't seen or understood." [...] She explained that she became an actor because she felt an outsider, [...] "As a kid I felt that I belonged only when I read a book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character. It was natural that I became an actor because I longed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> those other people, {{or at least to}} play them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in his career, Olympio {{had worked}} with Kwame Nkrumah, {{a leader of the}} {{independence}} struggle in the neighboring colony of Ghana and the first President of that country, on the issue of ending colonialism in Africa; however, the two leaders split over figuring out {{the eastern part of the}} German colony which had become part of Ghana and the division of the Ewe people. In order to unite the Ewe, Nkrumah proposed openly that Togo become part of Ghana while Olympio sought to have the eastern part of the old German colony returned to Togo. When Nkrumah made a surprise visit to Togo soon after the country had achieved independence and proposed a union of the two countries in the name of African unity Olympio responded that [...] "African unity, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desired, must not be used as an excuse for an expansionist policy." [...] The relationship between the two leaders declined with Olympio often dismissing Nkrumah as a [...] "black imperialist" [...] and, although he initially claimed he did not want a military in Togo, upon achieving independence Olympio funded and built a small military largely to protect the country against any possible advances by Nkrumah and Ghana.|$|E
