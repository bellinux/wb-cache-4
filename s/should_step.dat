5|$|Smith asked Walls {{for details}} of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl {{believed}} that the Army <b>should</b> <b>step</b> in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that {{it was already too}} late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she <b>should</b> <b>step</b> down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Evans {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he <b>should</b> <b>step</b> up his {{swimming}} career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months of training in London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E

25|$|The {{editors of}} The Chicago Tribune, a {{newspaper}} that had supported Nixon, wrote, “He is humorless {{to the point of}} being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.” The Providence Journal wrote, “Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.” This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon <b>should</b> <b>step</b> down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.|$|E

[...] Secretary of Transportation Federico Peña said he would pay back taxes owed for a part-time babysitter. [...] Other appointees said they had examined their records and were clean. [...] Stephanopoulos himself came under attention, but said the cleaner he had hired was from a cleaning company.

Dealey had just finished up Harder's epic fifth war patrol, in which he was credited with sinking five Japanese destroyers (reduced post-war to three destroyers). Despite the fact the crew was exhausted, Dealey agreed to extend his fifth patrol and take Christie on board. When Harder returned to port on 3 July 1944, Christie was concerned about its commander. Dealey was one of the leading submarine skippers but, having completed five war patrols, he was showing signs of strain. The admiral believed Dealey <b>should</b> <b>step</b> down from command of Harder, but Dealey felt he should make one more patrol before leaving the boat.|$|E
