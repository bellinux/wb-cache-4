500|$|In January 1953, Leigh {{travelled}} to Ceylon to film Elephant Walk with Peter Finch.

500|$|There {{was some}} puzzlement {{expressed}} by several reviewers, including Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Votta, {{as to why}} Finn would think Sam {{had been such a}} great performer to begin with that it was so important to bring him back.

Sam's scene with Blaine, however, was met with criticism, but of Blaine's characterization, not Sam's: BuddyTV John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine [...] "essentially calls Sam a whore" [...] and that [...] "he's like a completely different person". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger described the scene as [...] "pretty out of character" [...] for Blaine, and The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot, including Finn's antagonism toward Blaine, was [...] "so sloppily assembled" [...] he was glad it was ended in the following scene. The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked on—West enjoyed it, but <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hoping for more.|$|E
