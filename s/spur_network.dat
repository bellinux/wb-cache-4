40|$|Gully {{networks}} {{separated by}} resistant bedrock spurs {{are a common}} erosional feature along the escarpments that border the Valles Marineris. The resistant spur topography is best developed where {{the base of the}} slope is truncated by linear scarps interpreted as fault scarps. Regional variations in slope morphology imply that spur and gully topography undergoes a systematic progressive degradation through time associated with the erosional destruction of the basal fault scarps. The comparative morphometry of the divide networks indicates that the density of the spur networks and the number of first-order unbranched spurs decreases as the basal slope break becomes more sinuous. Abstraction of the spurs occurs through regolith storage in adjacent gullies at the slope base and the most degraded slope forms are entirely buried in talus. The basal fault scarps apparently control regolith transport by allowing debris to drain from the slope. As these basal scarps decay the slope base becomes increasingly sinuous and the slopes become transport limited. Dry mass-wasting {{may be the most important}} process acting on these slopes where a continually lowered base level is required to maintain the spur topography. In contrast to the Martian slopes, range front fault escarpments in the western U. S. show no systematic trend in <b>spur</b> <b>network</b> geometry as they are eroded. These weathering limited slopes are controlled by the more efficient removal of regolith through fluvial processes which rapidly create quasi-equilibrium drainage networks...|$|E

When it was again unveiled in 1977, more young children and teenagers than before tuned in, making The All-New Super Friends Hour a huge ratings success. The success prompted the ABC television network to plan a new and even more innovative series for the fall of 1978.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of WDBB {{becoming}} a simulcaster of WBMA-LD on its second subchannel in October 2014, WTTO and WDBB only simulcast the former's main programming feed, choosing to reallocate bandwidth space on WDBB's signal to transmit WBMA's programming feed in high definition on digital channel 17.2. On January 4, 2016, {{as part of a}} groupwide affiliation agreement with the <b>network</b> <b>spurred</b> by the <b>network's</b> acquisition of rights to reruns of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, WTTO switched the affiliation of its second digital subchannel to Antenna TV; this resulted in the displacement of GetTV (Now TBD) to a newly created fourth digital subchannel of the station.|$|R

New innovations such as smart electrical grids, tele-medicine, intelligent transportation networks, interactive learning and cloud computing will require fast communication networks to operate efficiently. Telecommunication companies have been investing to upgrade their older copper and coax cables to new fibre lines which have vastly larger capacity but the economic crisis has threatened to halt this investment just when consumers and businesses are using more Internet bandwidth. Telecommunication investment largely mimics GDP (gross domestic product) growth - but in a more exaggerated way...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} ad hoc grouping of portable terminals to form a wireless <b>network</b> <b>spurred</b> a large amount of interest in the field of wireless data communications. CDMA had been shown to outperform other multiaccess schemes and IEEE specifed the 802. 11 set of standards for wireless LANs using a CDMA based physical layer. But the lack of proper provisions in 802. 11 to provide a communication network without the existence of an access point resulted in extremely low data rates for truely ad hoc networks. In this project, we propose an MC-CDMA based physical layer for wireless ad hoc networks and present techniques to efficiently utilize network resources in a distributed manner...|$|R
50|$|The {{territory}} of region {{is characterized by}} rather flat relief with inflows of the rivers: Ayat, Ubagan, Ui, Torgai with inflows of the rivers: Saryozen, Kara. The Northern part occupy southeast suburb of the West-Siberian lowland, to the south from it is situated Torgai plateau; in the west - wavy plain Zaural plateau and in a southwest Saryarka <b>spurs.</b> River <b>network</b> is rare. Within {{the limits of the}} region it is totaled about 310 fine rivers. The largest rivers - Tobol and Torgai. On the river Tobol are Verhnetobolsk, Karatomar and Amangeldy water basins. In Kostanay Region are more than 5 thousand lakes. Largest of them are located in Torgai dell - Kusmyryn, Sarymoin, Aksuat, Sarykopa. Woodland area 2,175 km² including 1,512 km² natural plantings. In connection with the Soviet Virgin Lands Campaign, much of the area was ploughed for wheat. The Kostanay Region is rich in minerals, especially iron ore (deposits of magnetite ores - Sokolovsk, Sarbaiskoe, Kachary and brown soolits iron ores - Ayatsk iron ore pool, Lisakovsk deposit). The total stock of magnetite's ores and hematite's makes 15,7 billion tons, of them easy enrich and not demanding enrichment - 5,7 billion tons. Especially bowels are rich in iron ore, brown coal, asbestos, fire-resistant and brick clay, flux and cement limestone, glass sand, a building stone and others. Opened 19 deposits of bauxite, 7 - gold, on one of silver and nickel. In northern part of area chernozems and pine forests (Arakaragai, Amankaragai) prevail; in the central part - chestnut ground with pine forest Naurzimkaragai on the basis of which the same reserve is organized; the southern part is dominated by grasslands and shrublands.|$|R
40|$|Random walks {{are basic}} {{diffusion}} processes on networks and have applications in, for example, searching, navigation, ranking, and community detection. Recent {{recognition of the}} importance of temporal aspects on <b>networks</b> <b>spurred</b> studies of random walks on temporal networks. Here we theoretically study two types of event-driven random walks on a stochastic temporal network model that produces arbitrary distributions of interevent-times. In the so-called active random walk, the interevent-time is reinitialized on all links upon each movement of the walker. In the so-called passive random walk, the interevent-time is only reinitialized on the link that has been used last time, and it is a type of correlated random walk. We find that the steady state is always the uniform density for the passive random walk. In contrast, for the active random walk, it increases or decreases with the node's degree depending on the distribution of interevent-times. The mean recurrence time of a node is inversely proportional to the degree for both active and passive random walks. Furthermore, the mean recurrence time does or does not depend on the distribution of interevent-times for the active and passive random walks, respectively. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} alignment for {{the road}} has been proposed between Yaoundé, Cameroon and Brazzaville, ROC, which would do more to facilitate transport between {{the south and west}} of the continent, and which would probably have less of an environmental impact. It would run via Lambaréné (Gabon), and Dolisie (ROC). From the south, traffic going to West Africa would branch off in Yaoundé onto the western section of the Lagos-Mombasa Highway, while traffic going east and north would share the paved road from Yaoundé to Garoua-Boulai on the Cameroon-CAR border. As well as being shorter for traffic between south and west, this alternative alignment has other advantages: it already carries a little international traffic, it runs through more populated and economically active areas, it adds Gabon (and its capital, Libreville, via a <b>spur)</b> to the <b>network,</b> and it passes very close to Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) and the Atlantic ports of Douala and Pointe-Noire. Furthermore, a greater proportion of this section is paved, and those sections which are gravel roads or earth tracks are important as national roads and so are higher priorities for paving.|$|R
40|$|Globalization has catapulted ‘cycle time’ {{as a key}} {{indicator}} of operational efficiency [1] in processes such as supply chain management (SCM). Systems automation holds the promise to augment the ability of supply chain operations or supply networks to rapidly adapt to changes, with minimal human intervention, under ideal conditions. Business communities are emerging as loose federations or organization of networks that may evolve to act as infomediaries in global SCM. These changes, although sluggish, are likely to impact process knowledge and in turn may be stimulated or inhibited by the availability or lack of process interoperability, respectively. The latter will determine operational efficiencies of supply chains. Currently “community of systems” or organization of networks (aligned by industry or business focus) contribute minimally in SCM decisions because true collaboration remains elusive. Convergence and maturity of multiple advances offers {{the potential for a}} paradigm shift in interoperability. It may evolve hand-in-hand with [a] the gradual adoption of the semantic web [2] with concomitant development of ontological frameworks, [b] increase in use of multi-agent systems and [c] advent of ubiquitous computing enabling near real-time access to identification of objects and analytics [4]. This paper examines some of these complex trends and related technologies. Irrespective of the characteristics of information systems, the development of various industry-contributed ontologies for knowledge and decision layers, may <b>spur</b> self-organizing <b>networks</b> of business communities and systems to increase their ability to sense and respond, more profitably, through better enterprise and extraprise exchange. In order to transform this vision into reality, systems automation must be weaned from the syntactic web and integrated with the organic growth of the semantic web. Understanding of process semantics and incorporation of intelligent agents with access to ubiquitous near real-time data “bus” are pillars for “intelligent” evolution of decision support systems. Software as infrastructure may integrate plethora of agent colonies through improved architectures (such as, service oriented architecture or SOA) and business communities aligned by industry or service focus may emerge as hubs of such agent empires. However, the feasibility of the path from exciting “pilots” in specific areas toward an informed convergence of systemic real-world implementation remains unclear and fraught with hurdles related to gaps in knowledge transfer from experts in academia to real-world practitioners. The value of interoperability between systems that may catalyse real-time intelligent decision support is further compromised by the lack of clarity of approach and tools. The latter offers significant opportunities for development of tools that may segue to innovative solutions approach. A critical mass of such solutions may spawn the necessary systems architecture for intelligent interoperability, essential for sustainable profitability and productivity in an intensely competitive global economy. This paper addresses some of these issues, tools and solutions that may have broad applicability in several operations including the management of adaptive supply-demand networks [7]...|$|R
