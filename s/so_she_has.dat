5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become irritable or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final act of love, she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of her energy to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing to touch him for the first time.|$|E

500|$|Winslet {{was named}} one of the most {{beautiful}} people in the world by People magazine in 2005. Her beauty and sex appeal have been picked up by several other publications, including Harper's Bazaar, Who, and Empire magazines. Even <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> said that she does not subscribe to the beauty ideal of Hollywood, and uses her celebrity to make [...] "women feel empowered in any way, shape or form". She has spoken against botox and plastic surgery. In an effort to encourage natural ageing, she formed the British Anti-Cosmetic Surgery League, alongside the actresses Emma Thompson and Rachel Weisz. She instructs magazines and brands to not digitally smoothen her wrinkles in photographs. Winslet is reluctant to discuss the gender pay gap in Hollywood as she dislikes talking about her salary in public. In 2009, Forbes reported her annual salary to be US$2 million, with a majority of that stemming from her endorsement deals. Also that year, the UK Film Council calculated that she had earned £20 million from her acting roles since 1995.|$|E
500|$|... "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics. [...] Regarding the song's musical genre, Roger Holland of PopMatters {{believed there was}} no reason for Swift to limit herself into only the country music or why she should be a country artist at all. Holland continued, [...] "Yet this is the channel to market she has chosen, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to be prepared to hear complaints about the way that trademarked Mutt Lange guitar whine has been married to her bright shiny pop songs in order to get them onto CMT, GAC, and country radio." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com rated [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] four out of five stars. Lamb complimented Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style, but criticized the production and arrangement, perceiving them to be dull. He added that the track's refrains were most impacting and deemed it among the most memorable songs of 2007. Sean Dooley, also of About.com, described Swift's vocals as [...] "nothing less than captivating." ...|$|E

500|$|On the season's fight {{sequences}} and choreography, Bernthal said, [...] "The fights are all character-driven and {{the fights}} tell a story." [...] Cox added that [...] "there is absolutely {{an attempt to}} make sure every punch or kick that is thrown is like a line of dialogue; there is motive behind it, there is reason behind it, it means something." [...] Cox's stunt double, Chris Brewster, explained how the series' fight choreography has evolved, with the first season having shown Murdock just starting out as a vigilante—"he fought with all heart and soul, but wasn't a polished fighter....he was more raw and gritty"—while the second season sees the character having learned from previous mistakes—"his style is more defined and thought out now, but he will always fight with the Daredevil flair". As for the fighting styles of Punisher and Elektra, Brewster said that because of the Punisher's military background he uses a lot of weapons, and his [...] "hand to hand style is more of a close quarter combat nature", while Elektra was trained by Stick and the Hand, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> similar movement to Daredevil who was also trained by Stick. [...] "However," [...] Brewster continued, [...] "The Hand are trained assassins who are all about stealth takeouts and quick kills. Her style shows elements of" [...] that as well. The season uses multiple different martial art styles, including kali, Chinese kung fu, wing chun, kenjutsu, and boxing.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Flynn was {{conceived}} as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that [...] "Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower. <b>So</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a very limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy." [...] The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender-neutral Tangled {{is due in part}} to Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is [...] "to name the movie after the Princess", the directors had initially thought that the film [...] "would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that [...] "When Nathan and I figured out that this film was really about two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea." [...] Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with [...] "an ironic counterpoint", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As [...] "an example of first-person voice-over narration", Flynn's narration [...] "compels the viewer to identify empathetically with" [...] Flynn and Rapunzel.|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{situation}} arose in June 2009, when a traditional sweet shop in Petersfield came under serious threat of closure following {{the opening of}} a 99p Store, with takings going down by as much as 60percent a day.
