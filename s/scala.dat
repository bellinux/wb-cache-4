5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the <b>scala</b> vestibuli, the <b>scala</b> tympani and the <b>scala</b> media. Both the <b>scala</b> vestibuli and the <b>scala</b> tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The <b>scala</b> media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E

5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in <b>Scala.</b> The switch from Ruby to <b>Scala</b> and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for obtaining a {{complete}} geometry model of the fluid chambers of cochlea (<b>scalae)</b> from tomography images. An accurate segmentation of cochlea is problematic due to the low contrast of the inner membranes of <b>scalae.</b> Our method of 3 D segmentation is based on dynamic resampling of an original image stack to achieve a perpendicular cross-section of the <b>scalae</b> on all sections. Subsequently, perpendicular cross-section is being segmented using 2 D active contours. The center of mass of the contour is extracted and used to predict further course of <b>scalae</b> centerline by Kalman filter. Cross-section contours are subsequently assembled to the total geometry model. This method {{has been applied to}} CT images, but we expect that it could be used for segmentation of strongly curved low-contrast tubular objects recorded with other tomography techniques...|$|R

A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and <b>Scala.</b> Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard <b>Scala</b> framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager. The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.|$|E

Gobbi directed and sang in the 1969 production at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze, and later that year performed in and directed the same version at the August 1969 Edinburgh Festival.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany.

Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the <b>scala</b> naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, Messager {{encouraged}} Claude Debussy {{to complete}} his opera Pelléas et Mélisande and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. He conducted the premiere in 1902 and in gratitude the work was dedicated to him. Messager also conducted the premieres of Massenet's Grisélidis and Charpentier's Louise. As a conductor, he won praise from critics {{on both sides of}} the English Channel. The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of Pelléas et Mélisande was at La <b>Scala</b> in Milan, Messager's was still better.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{report on}} our {{experiences}} in redesigning <b>Scala’s</b> collection libraries, focussing {{on the role}} that type systems play in keeping software architectures coherent over time. Type systems can make software architecture more explicit but, if they are too weak, can also cause code duplication. We show that code duplication can be avoided using two of <b>Scala’s</b> type constructions: higher-kinded types and implicit parameters and conversions. ...|$|R
5|$|During this period, Verdi {{began to}} work more {{consistently}} with his librettists. He relied on Piave again for I due Foscari, performed in Rome in November 1844, then on Solera once more for Giovanna d'Arco, at La <b>Scala</b> in February 1845, while in August that year {{he was able to}} work with Salvadore Cammarano on Alzira for the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. Solera and Piave worked together on Attila for La Fenice (March 1846).|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} selected opera productions, such as: {{the first}} {{performance of the}} three-act version of Alban Berg's Lulu, completed by Friedrich Cerha, at the Paris Opera in 1979; Berg's Wozzeck at the Staatsoper Berlin in 1994; Wagner's Tristan und Isolde at La <b>Scala</b> in 2007; Janáček's From the House of the Dead, shown at several festivals and the Metropolitan Opera; and, as his last staging, Elektra by Richard Strauss, first performed at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July 2013. He was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize in 2008.|$|E

Filippini was touring Australia in 1914 with a Spanish opera company when World War I broke out; Filippini stayed and later married Anne McPharland, {{one of his}} students. As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia's first female symphony orchestra conductor. She sang the role of Marguerite in Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio Perth's performance of Faust in 1928.

Paoli received a contract to inaugurate Teatro Colón, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he sang Otello and Di quella pira.
