When the wall is filled in with planks, the frame is completed by a wall plate (stavlægje) with a groove on the bottom, holding the top ends of the wall planks. The whole structure consists of frames—a sill frame resting on the stone foundation, and the four wall frames made up of sills, corner posts and wall plate.|$|E

5000|$|Historic {{timber frame}} {{construction}} in England (and {{the rest of the}} United Kingdom) showed regional variation [...] which has been divided into the [...] "eastern school", the [...] "western school", and the [...] "northern school", although the characteristic types of framing in these schools {{can be found in the}} other regions (except the northern school). A characteristic of the eastern school is close studding which is a half-timbering style of many studs spaced about the width of the studs apart (for example six inch studs spaced six inches apart) until the middle of the 16th century and sometimes wider spacing after that time. Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings. A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as lozenges, stars, crosses, quatrefoils, , and many other shapes. The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a <b>sill</b> <b>beam,</b> the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill. Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring-bone or chevron pattern.|$|E

40|$|Recent field {{observations}} in bridge falsework identified potential {{deficiencies in the}} design of falsework resulting in localized bending in <b>sill</b> and cap <b>beam</b> flanges and lateral buckling in other beams. Possible limits states associated with the bearing of timber and steel posts on cap and <b>sill</b> <b>beams</b> are investigated in this report. The critical limit states are related to flange bending, post crushing or yielding, web yielding, web crippling, lateral web buckling and corbel crushing. Different methods are investigated for predicting the capacity of the flange. The first assumes a uniform stress distribution resulting in bending of the flange. This is adequate for timber posts, but not as accurate at the second more elaborate method which accounts for an interaction between flange bending and post compression strength, found to be effective for timber posts. The third method uses an effective bearing area of the post, which is more effective with steel posts. For beams with relatively thick webs, such as those typically used in bridge falsework, the web was found to have a greater capacity than th...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo tem como objetivo analisar, a partir de análises numéricas em elementos finitos, o comportamento de paredes de alvenaria de tijolos e blocos de vedação em conjunto com elementos estruturais de concreto armado, em situações em que alvenaria e concreto colaboram no suporte da edificação. As análises foram feitas com base em diagramas de tensões, onde foi possível observar os locais com concentração de tensões e sua forma de distribuição, e os parâmetros com influência no comportamento da estrutura. Nessas análises foram estudados vários parâmetros envolvidos nos sistemas mistos de concreto armado e alvenaria: o módulo de deformação {{longitudinal}} da alvenaria; a presença e dimensões de aberturas, vergas e contravergas, vigas e pilares; e modelos com vínculos ideais e encontro de paredes. Além disso, foi feito o pré-dimensionamento da estrutura de concreto e alvenaria. Os resultados das análises indicaram que a presença de elementos de concreto junto com a alvenaria resulta em uma distribuição mais uniforme das tensões, além de ter sido constatada uma redução de 50 % nas tensões de compressão na base da parede para o modelo com pilares de concreto. Verificou-se também que no modelo completo, com pilares e viga, a viga apresenta um comportamento diferente de uma estrutura reticulada, indicando que a parede acaba lhe servindo como um apoio distribuído. No pré-dimensionamento, verificou-se que, na ausência de pilares e viga, a resistência requerida de prisma é compatível apenas para componentes estruturais. Já no caso da viga, além de se constatar a diferença entre os modelos de cálculo usados e o comportamento real da estrutura, esse elemento pode não apresentar a resistência e/ou segurança necessária para a hipótese de viga biapoiada para as condições que aqui foram admitidas. Sobre este estudo, é importante destacar que não se tem a pretensão de defender esse tipo de estrutura, e sim analisar como ela se comporta frente às ações. This {{study has}} the aim to analyze, from numerical analysis in finite elements, {{the behavior of}} masonry walls of bricks and closing blocks together with structural elements of reinforced concrete, in situations in which masonry and concrete collaborate in {{the support of the}} building. The analysis were made based on the diagram of tensions, where it was possible to observe the places with concentration of tensions and their form of distribution, and the parameters with influence on the behavior of the structure. On this analysis, several parameters involved in the composite systems of reinforced concrete and masonry were studied: the modulus of longitudinal deformation of the masonry; the presence and dimension of cracks, lintels and <b>sills,</b> <b>beams</b> and pillars; and models with ideal ties and where the walls join. Besides this, preliminary design of the concrete structure and masonry was carried out. The results of the analysis indicated that the presence of concrete elements together with the masonry results in a more uniform distribution of the tensions, besides having been observed a reduction of 50 % in the compression tensions {{at the bottom of the}} wall for the model with concrete pillars. It was also verified that in the complete model, with pillars and beams, the beam presents a different behavior from a reticulated structure, indicating that the wall ends up serving it as a distributed support. In the preliminary design, it was noted that, without pillars and beam, the required resistance of the prism is compatible only for structural components. But in the case of beam, besides observing the difference among the models of calculation used and the real behavior of the structure, this element may not present the resistance and/or necessary security for the hypothesis of simply supported beam for the conditions that were admitted here. Regarding this study, it is important to emphasize that there is no intention of defending this type of structure, but rather analyse how it behaves before the actions...|$|R
40|$|The worst {{flood of}} the 20 th century {{happened}} at the night of January 31, 1953. After this disastrous flood the Dutch government came up with The Deltaworks, a large scale plan to protect the hinterland against future threats of high water. As part of the Deltaworks the Eastern Scheldt area was compartmentalized with the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier as imposing capstone of the compartmentalization. The barrier has greatly (and is still) contributed {{to the safety of}} the Netherlands, but it has also had a large impact on the Eastern Scheldt area. The Eastern Scheldt area is facing future (unanticipated) challenges like the sea level rise, the sand demand of the Eastern Scheldt, the scour holes near the shores of Schouwen-Duiveland and new safety standard for flood defenses. These challenges can be influenced by the barrier. Analyses of the challenges revealed that adjustments to the storm surge barrier, which are respond to the sand demand, are the most promising to effectuate. As a consequence of the compartmentalization of the Eastern Scheldt, the flow velocity in the tidal basin decreased with approximately 50 %. As a result, the net buildup of tidal flats stopped while the waves remained stable or even increased in height. The waves crumble the edges of the tidal flats causing the tidal flats to decrease in height. This phenomenon is called the ’sand demand’ of the Eastern Scheldt. To outweigh the Sand demand some adjustments to the moveable part of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier are examined. A lowered <b>sill</b> <b>beam</b> alternative is developed to influence the tide during normal tidal conditions. In this alternative the effective cross sectional area of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier will increase with approximately 6, 200 m^ 2 (from 17, 900 to 24, 100 m^ 2). The measures in this alternative include the following adjustments: 1.) Lowering of 50 sill beams, 2.) Extension of 50 gates, 3.) Adjusting the sill construction. By enlarging the cross sectional area of the barrier the tidal volume through the barrier and the tidal flow velocity in the Eastern Scheldt enlarges. The governing force in shoal build up is the tidal flow velocity, therefore the enlargement of the tidal velocity in the Eastern Scheldt should result in an improvement of the sand demand problem. Instead of removing the whole <b>sill</b> <b>beam</b> it is chosen to lower the sill beams. From a safety point of view it is chosen to not lower the outer sill beams to reduce the possible negative effects on the shores of Schouwen and Noord-Beveland. The lowered <b>sill</b> <b>beam</b> alternative must outweigh the current situation. The current situation holds the maintaining of the current barrier and planned investment in preservation of the tidal flat by sand suppletion. The estimated cost for maintaining the current barrier in its original state is approximately 650 million euro (within a range of +/- 20 %). The further research into the alternative has shown that the cost of adjusting the <b>sill</b> <b>beam</b> of the barrier cost more than maintaining the barrier in its current state. Because of the higher costs and the uncertainty in the actual effect of the measures, it seems more effective and safer to maintain the barrier in its current state. In this regard a critical note should be placed at designing with a lifetime of 200 years. Because of the robustness of the design {{it is almost impossible to}} make, economically attractive, modifications to improve the functionality of the barrier. If designing with a lifetime of 200 year is still desirable, the structure should be designed in such a way that it is adaptive to future changes.

40|$|Hurricane Sandy made {{landfall}} in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States (U. S.) October 29, 2012 as a post-tropical cyclone. With a {{wind field}} of approximately 1000 mi (1600 km) and a near 90 degree landfall angle with the coast, the storm generated an 11. 6 ft (3. 52 m) storm tide above {{mean sea level}} (MSL) at the Battery, New York City, and resulted in more than $ 65 billion in total damage including the U. S. and the Caribbean. With the threat of future sea level rise and the possibility of stronger future storms, implementing flood protection measures in New York City and the surrounding areas is an imperative. This thesis is a response to Hurricane Sandy. It presents a feasible flood risk reduction system for Jamaica Bay, New York City, and a preliminary design for a storm surge barrier to be constructed as a part of this system. This thesis also addresses possible environmental impacts, pollution, and vessel traffic in the bay. Because it is a preliminary design, and due to the time constraints of a MSc. thesis, the design of the storm surge barrier is neither complete nor detailed. Some aspects of the barrier are developed and reasonable assumptions are made for other aspects based on similar past projects. The Jamaica Bay Flood Risk Reduction System (JBFRRS) has been designed to be implemented in three (3) phases with the final phase beginning in 2032. The reason for building the JBFRRS in phases is to decrease the initial costs of the system. The purpose of this phased approach is also to reduce the pollution in the bay and to allow the JBFRRS to adapt to sea level rise as it occurs. Due to the uncertainty of future sea level rise, storm intensity and frequency, an adaptive approach could be the most applicable. It allows some flood protection measures to be immediately constructed while the more expensive elements of the system are under further design. The most significant finding concerning the barrier is that it could be overflown during storm tide events. This is due to the large surface area of the Jamaica Bay basin behind the barrier. This aspect is important because it lowers the height and therefore the costs of the barrier. Vertical lift gates are found to be optimal at this location due to their high reliability, lower costs through repetition, and their ability to allow tidal flow during normal conditions. Piers with shallow foundations along with top and <b>sill</b> <b>beam</b> have been chosen to house the vertical gates. An initial estimate of the costs the JBRRS ranges from $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion (2014 dollars). Because the barrier is still in the early design phases, the final costs of the system will differ from this estimate.
