40|$|By {{measuring}} the currents {{associated with the}} <b>streamer</b> discharge along silicone rubber surfaces, parameters of <b>streamer</b> propagation such as the minimum field of <b>streamer</b> crossing, the field of stable <b>streamer</b> propagation, the mean velocity and the <b>streamer</b> charge distribution have been analyzed and compared to the <b>streamer</b> discharge in air alone. Clear differences were observed in the measured currents for the individual surfaces at low background fields (285 kV/m). For higher fields the <b>streamer</b> crosses the gap almost independently of the surface type. The minimum <b>streamer</b> field {{was found to be}} slightly increased compared to air. The field of stable <b>streamer</b> propagation also was higher than in air. It is similar to 570 kV/m, larger than that of the <b>streamer</b> discharge in air (similar to 500), under the same conditions. The <b>streamer</b> speed was found slightly increased {{in the presence of the}} silicone rubber surface and the distinction between the individual surfaces was modest. A discussion on possible mechanisms for the observed differences in the <b>streamer</b> speed and currents with and without the insulator surfaces is presented. The net positive charge of the <b>streamer</b> along an insulating surface seems to be distributed along the <b>streamer</b> channel rather than localized in the front part of the channel as the case for the <b>streamer</b> in air...|$|R

40|$|Pictures {{show that}} <b>streamer</b> or sprite {{discharge}} channels {{emerging from the}} same electrode or position sometimes seem to reconnect or merge even though their heads carry electric charge of the same polarity; one might therefore suspect that reconnections are an artifact of the two-dimensional projection in the pictures. We have used stereo-photography of laboratory scale <b>streamer</b> discharges to investigate the full three-dimensional structure of such events. We analyze reconnection, possibly an electrostatic effect in which a late thin <b>streamer</b> reconnects to an earlier thick <b>streamer</b> channel, and merging, a suggested photo-ionization effect in which two simultaneously propagating <b>streamer</b> heads merge into one new <b>streamer.</b> We also investigate the branching lengths and angles in the 3 D <b>streamer</b> tree structures...|$|R
