The method-called the Complementary Hydrograph method-involves a process of decomposing a known <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> of duration t o into a pair of "complementary" hydrographs associated with two sequential rainfalls with the sum of their durations equal to t o. In converting the t o-hour <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> into a t a-hour <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> the method produces a <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> of duration t b=(t o-t a) concurrently. In hydrograph conversion, the Complementary Hydrograph method produces an identical result to the well-established S-Hydrograph method and involves a comparable number of computational steps. In certain special cases, such as converting a <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> into one with half its duration, the new method requires fewer computational steps. While the two methods employ different approaches in their solutions of hydrograph conversion problems, the agreement in their results stems from the fact that both methods are founded on the same principles of superposition and linearity of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> method. The S-Hydrograph method can also be viewed as a special case of the Complementary Hydrograph method in which the known hydrograph is associated with a storm of infinite duration and uniform intensity. The Complementary Hydrograph method offers a more unified and versatile approach in dealing with various types of unit-hydrograph conversion problems. For example, the method can be extended to derive <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> from a hydrograph associated with a multiperiod, varied intensity rainfall.

The representative examples are the torrential floods on the experimental watersheds of the rivers Manastirica (June 1996) and Kamišna (May 2007). Hystorical maximal discharges (Qmaxh) were reconstructed by use of ″hydraulics flood traces ″ method. Computations of maximal discharges (Qmaxc), under hydrological conditions after {{the restoration of the}} watersheds, were performed by use of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> theory and Soil Conservation Service methodology. Area sediment yields and intensity of erosion processes were estimated {{on the basis of the}} “Erosion Potential Method”. The actual state of erosion processes is represented by the coefficients of erosion Z= 0. 475 (Manastirica) and Z= 0. 470 (Kamišna). Restoration works have been planned with a view to decreasing yields o...|$|E

As a result of calculated <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs,</b> runoff characteristics of rivers in Southern Kyushu District are summarized as follows: 1. The amount of base flows is comparatively large. Most of its physical causes {{are considered to be}} a plenty of groundwater. 2. The peak of <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> is not so high as it in another river basins. 3. The runoff coefficient is relatively large. 南九州地域の流出特性を単位図より考察した結果,つぎの点に他地域との相異点をみた. i) 基底流量が多い. ii) ピーク流出は小さい. iii) 流出率(総降雨量に対する総流出量の比率) は大きい. 以上の結果は水利用の立場からは望ましいことであり,南九州地域は水資源開発計画を推進するに有利な条件をそなえているといえよう...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed {{in the application}} of many models of catchment behaviour that catchment rainfall is uniformly distributed over a catchment. This study examines the effects of non-uniform spatially distributed rainfall on the application of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> theory. A simple distributed linear catchment model is used to simulate the response of a catchment to stationary and moving storms and three different <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> derivation techniques have been applied to the responses obtained. The model responses demonstrate that spatial distribution of rainfall can produce effects which might be mistakenly used as evidence of non-linear catchment behaviour. The <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> derivation techniques were least successful for slow moving storms and large catchments. Overall the gamma distribution method resulted in the best estimates of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs.</b> However the least squares techniques achieved the best results for stationary storms. The spatially distributed rainfall resulted in the derivation of markedly different <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> for different storms on the same catchment. An examination of the lumped representation of distributed rainfall showed that an alternative to the catchment mean rainfall could allow significant improvements {{in the application of}} the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> theory for the case of moving storms...|$|R

The moments of the instantaneous <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> are suggested as a series of parameters of the response, for which correlations should be sought.
