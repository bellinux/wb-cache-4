Despite repeated attempts throughout his reign, Taraki proved unable to persuade the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> intervene {{in support of the}} restoration of civil order.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia and the Central Asian republics were {{weakened}} {{economically and}} faced declines in GDP. Post-Soviet states underwent economic reforms and privatisation.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United States would now be legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of {{any part of the}} plane.|$|E

In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E
