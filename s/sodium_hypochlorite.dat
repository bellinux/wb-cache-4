For this purpose, non sterile cysts were extracted from infected soil and hatched into zinc chloride solution with concentration of 0. 5 g L - 1. Then, for preparation of sterile second stage larvae, several sterilizing treatments were used. Mean comparisons were performed between sterilized live larvae number by Duncan's method.

30|$|Texturing monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) {{for solar}} cell {{fabrication}} {{is still a}} key issue due to consumption of {{a large amount of}} costly isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in conventional NaOH/KOH solution. Controlling IPA amount in NaOH/KOH-texturing bath for longer life of the solution in industrial batch production is a difficult task. This article reports the use of a chemical bath with a composition of NaOH–NaOCl (<b>sodium</b> hydroxide–sodium <b>hypochlorite)</b> for texturing monocrystalline silicon surface for solar cell fabrication. We report such a novel concept of texturing of the c-Si surface without using IPA and discarding the saw damage removal step.

Easy control of the process due to the self-controlled reaction {{is one of the major}} advantages and there is no need of sophisticated temperature-controlling system during texturing in the industrial batch process. Moreover, FTIR analysis shows the formation of Si–Cl bond during texturing, which improves the quality of diffused junction due to the gettering effect of Cl.
