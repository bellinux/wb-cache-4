5|$|International {{publishers}} expressed {{some interest}} in carrying Elmer, {{but none of them}} would commit to it. To generate more interest among readers, Alanguilan released the sold-out first issue for free online. This led publisher Editions Ca Et La to purchase the French rights in 2010. After Alanguilan exchanged emails with publisher Dan Vado, <b>Slave</b> <b>Labor</b> Graphics released Elmer as a 144-page trade paperback in North America. <b>Slave</b> <b>Labor</b> Graphics also distributes the comic digitally.|$|E

5|$|Burning houses {{suspected}} of being partisan meeting places and poisoning water wells became common practice for soldiers of the German 9th Army. At Kharkov, the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union, food was provided only to {{the small number of}} civilians who worked for the Germans, with the rest designated to slowly starve. Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany to be used as <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> beginning in 1942.|$|E

50|$|Bangladesh {{had sent}} {{soldiers}} for the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria and on April 2012 they were abducted but were soon released by Syrian rebels. In 2015 to 2016 Bangladeshi women were trafficked to Syria {{where they were}} forced to work as sex workers and as <b>slave</b> <b>labors.</b> The women were promised jobs as maids in Lebanon. In 2016 the government of Bangladesh issued an advisory against travelling to Syria.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} Coffin {{came to realize}} that many of the goods he sold in his {{business}} were produced with <b>slave</b> <b>labor.</b> Through his travels Coffin learned of organizations in Philadelphia and New York City that only sold goods produced with free (non-slave) labor. He began to purchase stock from these organizations and marketed free-labor goods to his fellow abolitionists, though the products provided him with little profit.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise discover a lost colony of humans in the Delphic Expanse. The colony originated from a wagon train from the American Old West in the 1860s which was abducted as <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> by an alien race called the Skagarans. The humans overthrew the Skagarans and now treat them as second class citizens.|$|E
5000|$|On February 20th, 1860, the State of Alabama {{granted a}} charter to {{incorporate}} the Tuskegee Railroad. The Railroad owners were David Clopton, William Foster, Cullen A. Battle, Robert F. Ligon, J.W. Echols, S. B. Baine, G.W. Campbell, A. B. Fanin, John C. H. Reid, W. G. Swanson and A. D. Edwards.

50|$|Neo, a drifter {{from the}} atomic-blasted wastelands, and his klutzy robot sidekick {{arrive at a}} factory where <b>slaves</b> <b>labor</b> to fuel the Dark One's Power Station. He meets a woman who convinces him to help rescue her father, a {{scientist}} who invented a device that can break the Dark One's control over the factory slaves.

50|$|Field {{hands were}} <b>slaves</b> who <b>labored</b> in the {{plantation}} fields. They commonly {{were used to}} plant, tend, and harvest cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco.|$|R
5|$|Slaves {{and their}} {{descendants}} were usually found in regions devoted to producing exports for foreign markets. Sugarcane plantations on the eastern coast of the northeast region during the 16th and 17th centuries are typical of economic activities dependent on <b>slave</b> <b>labor.</b> In northern Maranhão province, <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> was used in cotton and rice production in the 18th century. In this period, slaves were also exploited in Minas Gerais province where gold was extracted. Slavery was also common in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo during the 19th century for the cultivation of coffee which became vital to the national economy. The prevalence of slavery was not geographically uniform across Brazil. Around 1870 only five provinces (Rio de Janeiro with 30%, Bahia with 15%, Minas Gerais with 14%, São Paulo with 7% and Rio Grande do Sul also with 7%) held 73% of the nation's total slave population. These were followed by Pernambuco (with 6%) and Alagoas (with 4%). Among the remaining 13 provinces none individually had even 3%.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} home, Houston {{negotiated}} a labor-swap arrangement with Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In {{lieu of a}} cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties, and he set about to build the Woodland home for his wife. The first child to be born {{in the house was}} Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.|$|E
5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} <b>slave</b> <b>labor,</b> Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E
50|$|At its peak, Black Walnut Plantation {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most {{successful}} plantations in Halifax County. The only Civil War battle fought in Halifax County, the Battle of Staunton River Bridge, took place on Black Walnut Plantation in the summer 1864. Confederate troops maintained encampment there during the war alongside up to 800 Confederate <b>slave</b> <b>labors</b> - and Union forces after.During the 1939 National Tobacco Festival, legendary Academy Award Winner Mary Pickford visited Black Walnut as Queen of the festival.|$|R
50|$|The Germans {{viewed the}} Slavs as {{a pool of}} <b>slave</b> work <b>labor</b> {{for use by the}} German Reich; if {{necessary}} they could be worked to death.|$|R
5000|$|After nightfall {{the slaves}} reached Cannes-Brulées, about 15 mi {{northwest}} of New Orleans. The men had traveled between 14 and 22 mi, a march that probably took them seven to ten hours. By some accounts, they numbered [...] "some 200 slaves," [...] although other accounts estimated up to 500. [...] As typical of revolts of most classes, free or slave, the insurgent slaves were mostly young men {{between the ages}} of 20 and 30. They represented primarily lower-skilled occupations on the sugar plantations, where <b>slaves</b> <b>labored</b> in difficult conditions.|$|R
5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by <b>slave</b> <b>labor.</b> After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E
5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> camps. As Japan had not yet ratified the Geneva Convention, the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|Auschwitz was {{considered}} a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to its many amenities and the abundance of <b>slave</b> <b>labor.</b> Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred Jehovah's Witnesses for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior. Höss lived {{with his wife and}} children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.|$|E
50|$|General Pinckney was a {{commander}} during the Revolutionary War, a signer of the United States Constitution, and, in 1804 and 1808, {{a presidential candidate}} for the Federalist Party. After he inherited the islands from his father, Pinckney was an absentee landowner until 1804, {{when he moved to}} the island and began managing the property. The Pinckney family developed the islands into a plantation, removing much of the maritime forest and draining and tilling the fertile soil. By 1818, over 200 <b>slaves</b> <b>labored</b> to produce fine quality long-staple Sea Island Cotton on 297 acre; 386 slaves lived on the island by 1840.|$|R
50|$|Annie Parlane MacPherson (1833 - November 27, 1904) was a Scottish evangelical Quaker {{and founder}} of the Home Children scheme, sending poor and orphan {{children}} to Canada and other colonies to serve as <b>slave</b> child <b>labor.</b>|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1600s, English {{settlers}} colonized {{the island}} and established a permanent settlement. They gradually tried to develop plantations, using imported African <b>slaves</b> as <b>labor,</b> but the soil was rather poor. The island produced some commodity crops.|$|R
5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed {{as part of}} Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as slaves. Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as <b>slave</b> <b>labor.</b> The ten-year plan would have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{has written}} of his Jewish parents' {{experiences}} during World War II. His mother, Maryla Husyt, {{grew up in}} Warsaw, survived the Warsaw Ghetto, the Majdanek concentration camp, and two <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> camps. Her first husband died in the war. She considered {{the day of her}} liberation as the most horrible day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In Charlottesville, Virginia, the Smoking Man is admonished by the Well-Manicured Man (John Neville) {{when the}} latter learns about Mulder's travels. Skinner and the agents are subpoenaed {{to appear before}} Senator Sorenson's panel over the missing pouch; when Skinner {{questions}} Scully about Mulder's whereabouts, she is not forthcoming. Meanwhile, as Mulder and Krycek hike through the forests of Krasnoyarsk, the former theorizes that the fragment may be tied to the Tunguska event, a mysterious cosmic impact {{that occurred in the}} area in 1908. The two men come across a <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> camp, but are captured by the taskmasters and thrown into a gulag.|$|E
5000|$|Linda McCaffery, a {{professor}} at Barton County Community College, explained the range of Orphan Train experiences: “Many were used as strictly <b>slave</b> farm <b>labor,</b> but there are stories, wonderful stories of children ending up in fine families that loved them, cherished them, and educated them.” ...|$|R
25|$|After 1800, {{some of the}} Cherokee and {{the other}} four civilized tribes of the Southeast started buying and using black <b>slaves</b> as <b>labor.</b> They {{continued}} this practice after removal to Indian Territory in the 1830s, when as many as 15,000 enslaved blacks were taken with them.|$|R
50|$|Welser {{transported to}} the colony German miners, and 4,000 African <b>slaves</b> as <b>labor</b> to work sugar cane plantations. Many of the German colonists died from {{tropical}} diseases, to which they had no immunity, or hostile Indian attacks during frequent journeys deep into Indian territory in search of gold.|$|R
5|$|Rejecting his mother's {{proposal}} of sending him {{to study in}} Spain at the University of Salamanca and Alcalá de Henares, alongside his cousin Manuel Belgrano, he enrolled in jurisprudence studies in the University of Chuquisaca, in the Upper Peru (modern Bolivia). There, he learned about the ongoing French Revolution, and the new ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He also learned about the 1782 Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II and the oppression of the indigenous peoples, which influenced his actions in his future Upper Peru campaign. Before returning to Buenos Aires, he visited Potosí and witnessed the use of <b>slave</b> <b>labor</b> in the mines.|$|E
5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as <b>slave</b> <b>labor.</b> After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on <b>slave</b> <b>labor,</b> and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the differing early slave {{societies}} of colonial Virginia and Bermuda. Specifically, this study looks at how the first century of slave laws and customs in the respective colonies varied so greatly. Relatively speaking, slave laws and customs in colonial Virginia were harsh {{when compared to the}} laws and customs of colonial Bermuda. This difference was due to the difference in the type of <b>labor</b> <b>slaves</b> performed and in landowning patterns in the respective colonies during the seventeenth century. In Virginia, <b>slaves</b> <b>labored</b> under a harsh regime on plantations, while Bermudian slaves worked often in a maritime economy. Furthermore, in Virginia, land owning patterns differed greatly; Virginian landlords typically stayed in Virginia while Bermudian landlords were often absent from their landholdings. These differences that led to a lax system in Bermuda changed by the 1720 s when slaves were deemed to be too dangerous. This study has used a great deal of government documents, court records, diaries, and collections of letters from colonial Bermuda and Virginia. Using these sources, this study suggests what aspects within the respective colonies led to the harsh customs and laws in Virginia and the relatively lax system in Bermuda...|$|R
50|$|The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, {{as well as}} 4,000 African <b>slaves</b> as <b>labor</b> to work {{sugar cane}} plantations. Many of the German colonists died from {{tropical}} diseases, to which they had no immunity, or hostile attacks by natives during frequent journeys deep into Amerindian territory in search of gold.|$|R
50|$|Most {{internally}} trafficked forced laborers {{originated from}} the states of Maranhão and Piauí, while Pará and Mato Grosso states received the higher number of internally trafficked <b>slave</b> laborers. <b>Labor</b> trafficking victims are {{also found in the}} Cerrado, the Atlantic Forest, and the Pantanal. Children in involuntary domestic servitude, particularly involving teenage girls, also constitute a problem in the country.|$|R
