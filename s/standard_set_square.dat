40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Standard</b> <b>setting</b> in {{assessment}} seeks to apply meaning of achievement to an assessment score. Appropriate <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> for script concordance tests (SCTs) remains a challenge, with existing methods representing norm-referenced approaches. AIMS: To develop a criterion-referenced <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> approach for SCT using an adapted Nedelsky approach, to pilot feasibility, and to compare failure rates {{with two other}} methods. METHODS: Second- and third-year medical students were administered a 45 -question SCT and results collated. <b>Standard</b> <b>setting</b> was applied using three approaches: (1) norm-referenced (student cohorts), (2) expert-referenced (student cohort compared to expert mean), and (3) adapted Nedelsky approach using answer key normalization. Feasibility and failure rates were measured. RESULTS: All <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> approaches were feasible, with 60 additional minutes required for the Nedelsky <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> exercise. Failure rates between the three approaches were similar (Year 2 : 8. 0 – 9. 8 % and Year 3 : 2. 1 – 7. 6 %), with the adapted Nedelsky approach representing an intermediate option (Year 2 : 8. 0 % and Year 3 : 3. 5 %).

In clustering two major research issues are scalability and {{the requirement of}} domain knowledge to determine input parameters. Most approaches suggest the use of sampling {{to address the issue}} of scalability. However, sampling does not guarantee the best solution and can cause significant loss in accuracy. Most approaches also require the use of domain knowledge, trial and error techniques, or exhaustive searching to figure out the required input parameters. In this paper we introduce a new clustering technique based on the <b>set</b> <b>square</b> distance. Cluster membership is determined based on the <b>set</b> <b>squared</b> distance to the respective cluster. As in the case of mean for k-means and median for k-medoids, the cluster is represented by the entire cluster of points for each evaluation of membership. The <b>set</b> <b>square</b> distance for all n items can be computed efficiently in O(n) using a vertical data structure and a few pre-computed values. Special ordering of the <b>set</b> <b>square</b> distance is used to break the data into the “natural ” clusters compared to the need of a known k for k-means or kmedoids type of partition clustering. Superior results are observed when the new clustering technique is compared with the classical k-means clustering.

The scalability of the proposed technique is proved using a large RSI data set. Keywords Vertical <b>Set</b> <b>Square</b> Distance, P-trees, Clustering. 1...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – The research is conducted as a longitudinal single case study of the auditing standard-setting activities of the Danish professional body 1970 - 1978. The case is based on extensive interviews with members of the standard-setting board at that time, supplemented with documentary studies. Findings – The paper identifies and discusses five general measures to deal with the immanent resistance to auditing standard setting: alignment of interests, representation, due process, soft texts, and reference to ideology. It concludes by analyzing how these strategies are adapted to changing patterns of standard-setting resistance at various stages. Research limitations/implications – The paper discusses auditing <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> only. Although resistance to accounting <b>standard</b> <b>setting</b> may be dealt with in the same way, the patterns of resistance are most likely different and the adaptation strategies may therefore also be different.
