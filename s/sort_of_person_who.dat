500|$|British and European psychiatrists {{assessing}} the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971: [...] "The {{information we have}} about [...] suggests {{that he is the}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him.

500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues. The journalist A. N. Wilson quotes Churchill commenting years before that [...] "Tom Driberg is the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> gives sodomy a bad name".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story.

500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> people would get deeply involved with.

According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E

500|$|Wu was {{in general}} loyal to Deng Xiaoping's government, but {{continued}} to be an outspoken critic. In 1983, he dismissed Deng's Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign as futile. In September 1986, he read an essay {{at a meeting of}} the China Writers Association entitled [...] "Against Those Who Wield the Scissors—a Plea for an End to Censorship". It was enthusiastically received by the audience, but only a censored version was published, minus 1,000 characters deemed [...] "acrimonious". After the December 1986 student demonstrations, he was pressured to leave the Communist Party in 1987. Retired Politburo member Hu Qiaomu came to his home in person to demand his resignation from the Party. He obliged, as he did not think he was [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> should be in the Party." [...] In spring 1989, Wu signed a petition calling for greater political freedom. Following the army crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Wu called for a reassessment of the incident, but was forbidden to speak at a CPPCC meeting.|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as [...] "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E
2500|$|Coonan {{hoped that}} Carl {{would be as}} devious as {{original}} villain Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), hoping for [...] "spicy storylines" [...] for his character, who is [...] "a bad guy" [...] and [...] "pretty nasty" [...] with [...] "a dark way of going about things." [...] However, he hoped that Carl would have redeeming qualities {{and that he would}} not be [...] "a total arch-villain". He also compared Carl to William Shakespeare's Iago (from Othello), and said Carl is a film fan who would compare himself to Al Pacino in films such as Scarface and The Godfather. He also said Carl presents [...] "different fronts to different people" [...] and opined that there is [...] "a bit of nice in him", but he likes to dominate, make money and have influence, and would not be good until he achieves that. He wondered if Carl would be capable of settling down and starting a family. On playing a villain, Coonan said, [...] "It is good fun playing the bad guys. They are the always the best to play. They do not care how people perceive them. They do not have the normal social restrictions." [...] He said that Carl is [...] "slightly psychotic" [...] and is [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> finds it genuinely heartwarming to see people suffer". In October 2013, Coonan said that Carl had been [...] "an absolute bastard" [...] during his six months in the show.|$|E

60|$|Now, however, no whit {{anticipating the}} {{oblivion}} which awaited {{their names and}} feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining their fiery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the same time, they exhibited their paces, together with the grace and dexterity of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, {{the sound of a}} wild Barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of the challengers, where the performers were concealed. It was of Eastern origin, having been brought from the Holy Land; and the mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and defiance, to the knights as they advanced. With the eyes of an immense concourse of spectators fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform upon which the tents of the challengers stood, and there separating themselves, each touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance, the shield of the antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself. The lower orders of spectators in general--nay, many of the higher class, and it is even said several of the ladies, were rather disappointed at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy.

6000|$|Thus we {{see what}} vein of thought was running through the graver and more active minds of Geneva {{about the time of}} Rousseau's visit. Whether it be true or not that the {{accepted}} belief of many of the preachers was a pure Deism, it is certain that the theory was fully launched among them, and that those who could not accept it were still pressed to refute it, and in refuting, to discuss. Rousseau's friendships were according to his own account almost entirely among the ministers of religion and the professors of the academy, precisely the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> would be most sure to familiarise him, in the course of frequent conversations, with the current religious ideas and the arguments by which they were opposed or upheld. We may picture the effect on his mind of the difference in tone and temper in these grave, candid, and careful men, and the tone of his Parisian friends in discussing the same high themes; how this difference would strengthen his repugnance, and corroborate his own inborn spirit of veneration; how he would here feel himself in his own world. For as wise men have noticed, {{it is not so much}} difference of opinion that stirs resentment in us, at least in great subjects where the difference is not trivial but profound, as difference in gravity of humour and manner of moral approach. He returned to Paris (Oct. 1754) warm with the resolution to give up his concerns there, and in the spring go back once and for all to the city of liberty and virtue, where men revered wisdom and reason instead of wasting life in the frivolities of literary dialectic.[245] ...|$|R
60|$|A theory which {{maintains}} that truth may justifiably be persecuted because persecution cannot possibly {{do it any}} harm, cannot be charged with being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths; but we cannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons to whom mankind are indebted for them. To discover to the world something which deeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove to it {{that it had been}} mistaken on some vital point of temporal or spiritual interest, is as important a service as a human being can render to his fellow-creatures, and in certain cases, as in those of the early Christians and of the Reformers, those who think with Dr. Johnson believe it to have been the most precious gift which could be bestowed on mankind. That the authors of such splendid benefits should be requited by martyrdom; that their reward should be to be dealt with as the vilest of criminals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error and misfortune, for which humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes, but the normal and justifiable state of things. The propounder of a new truth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in the legislation of the Locrians, the proposer of a new law, with a halter round his neck, to be instantly tightened if the public assembly did not, on hearing his reasons, then and there adopt his proposition. People who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposed to set much value on the benefit; and I believe this view of the subject is mostly confined to the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> think that new truths may have been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now.|$|R
60|$|As {{respects the}} {{governor}}, {{and the other}} high functionaries of the colony, some indulgence was entertained; it being the popular notion that men who lived so much within doors, and whose hands got to be so soft, were not exactly the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> would be most useful at the oar. Heaton, and the merchants, Pennock, and the two younger Woolstons, with the clergyman, were easily excused in the popular mind; but the governor {{was known to be}} a prime seaman, and a silent expectation appeared to prevail, that some day he would be seen in the bow of a boat, lancing a whale. Before the first season was over, this expectation was fully realized; Governor Woolston heading no less than four of what were called the colony boats, or boats that belonged to the state, and fished as much for honour as profit, taking a fine whale on each occasion. These exploits of the governor's capped the climax, in the way of giving a tone to the public mind, on the subject of taking whales. No man could any longer doubt of its being honourable, as well as useful, and even the boys petitioned to be allowed to go out. The Kannakas, more or less of whom were employed in each vessel, rose greatly in the public estimation, and no young man could expect to escape animadversion, unless he had been present at least once at the taking of a whale. Those who had struck or lanced a fish were now held in a proportionate degree of repute. It was, in fact, in this group that the custom originally obtained, which prohibited a young man from standing {{at the head of the}} dance who had not struck his fish; and not at Nantucket, as has been erroneously supposed.|$|R
