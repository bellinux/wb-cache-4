5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight <b>Saving</b> Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy <b>saving</b> measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight <b>Saving</b> Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight <b>Saving</b> Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E

5|$|Daylight <b>saving</b> time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight <b>saving</b> time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, after {{a three-year}} trial of {{daylight}} <b>saving</b> in Queensland, Australia, {{a referendum on}} daylight <b>saving</b> was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote– with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the Daylight <b>Saving</b> for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating {{the implementation of a}} dual-time zone arrangement for daylight <b>saving</b> in South East Queensland {{while the rest of the}} state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight <b>Saving</b> for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight <b>saving</b> into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of Daylight <b>Saving</b> Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight <b>saving</b> since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern Daylight <b>Saving</b> Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E
