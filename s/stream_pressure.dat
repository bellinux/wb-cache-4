40|$|The {{reduction}} of shock-associated noise in inverted velocity profile coannular jets is investigated and quantified by making optical and acoustic measurements {{as a function}} of outer and inner <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio combinations and interpreting noise results with the aid of new theoretical models. Schlieren photographs are obtained in three series of test conditions with a varying primary <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio, and acoustic experiments are conducted on a polar arc radius of 3. 05 m over a frequency range of 200 Hz to 80 kHz. A constant-thrust comparison is made, and data are plotted and discussed with emphasis on the variation of jet noise levels with primary stream Mach number and equivalent single jets on an absolute basis. It is shown that shock noise from the outer stream is almost eliminated when the inner stream is operated at a Mach number above unity at inverted and normal velocity profile conditions, and optical measurements indicate that for a fixed supercritical fan <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio, the repetitive shock structure in the outer stream is minimized when the primary stream ratio becomes supercritical...|$|E

40|$|While {{flowing through}} porous medium, ground water flow dissolves {{minerals}} thereby in creasing medium porosity and ultimately permeability. Reactive fluid flows preferentially into highly permeable zones, which are therefore dissolved most rapidly, producing a further preferential permeability enhancement. Accordingly, slight non-uniformities present in porous medium can be amplified {{and lead to}} fingering reaction fronts. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate dissolution-induced porosity changes on reaction front morphology in homogeneous porous medium with two non-uniformities. Four controlling parameters, including up <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient, reaction rate constant, non-uniformities spacing and non-uniformity strength ratio are comprehensively considered. By using a modified version of the numerical code, NSPCRT, to conduct a series of numerical simulations, front behavior diagrams are constructed to illustrate the morphologies of reaction fronts under various combinations of these four factors. Simulation results indicate that the two non-uniformities are inhibited into a planar front under low up <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient, merge into a single-fingering front under inter mediate up <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient, or grow into a double-fingers front under high up <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient. More over, the two non-uniformities tend to develop intoadouble-fingering front as the non-uniformity strength ratio in creases from 0. 2 to 1. 0, and merge into a single-fingering front while the non-uniformity strength ratio in creases from 1. 0 to 1. 8. When the reaction rate constant is small, the two non-uniformities merge into a single front. Reaction rate constant significantly affects front advancing velocity. The front advancing velocity decreases with the reaction rate constant. Based on these results, front behavior diagrams which de fine the morphologies of the reaction fronts for these four parameters are constructed. Moreover, non-uniformity strength ratio and reaction rate constant are identified as two important factors that govern the interaction of dissolution and solute transport in groundwater systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} various flow or {{geometry}} parameters on detonation initiation in supersonic combustible mixtures using a hot jet were investigated, including the free stream Mach number Ma?, the hot jet Mach number Maj, the free <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> P?, the hot jet pressure Pj, {{the diameter of}} the hot jet Dj, and the height of the free stream channel Hc. The results show that there exists a free stream Mach number range (Ma?min, Ma?max) for the successful initiation. When Ma? is beyond that range, the hot jet is not able to initiate the detonation and the flow field maintains a stable shock wave or shock reflection induced by the hot jet. For the other parameters, including the hot jet Mach number, the free <b>stream</b> <b>pressure,</b> the hot jet pressure, {{the diameter of the}} hot jet, and the height of the free stream channel Hc, there exists a critical value for the detonation initiation. For the hot jet Mach number Maj, the hot jet pressure Pj, the diameter of the hot jet Dj, when they are larger than the critical values, the initiation can be realized eventually and the larger the parameters the faster the initiation. Otherwise, the flow field will maintain the final stable state as the shock wave or shock reflection. For the free <b>stream</b> <b>pressure</b> P? and the height of the free stream channel Hc, when they are larger than the critical values, the flow field will also maintain the final stable state.

The present research examines the hydrodynamic constant-flow mixer with a grid made of smooth cylinders as the agitator of cavitation.
