40|$|Abstract—In this brief, an {{efficient}} technique for implementation of soft-error-tolerant <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> is presented. The proposed technique uses two implementations {{of the basic}} registers with different structures operating in parallel. A soft error occurring in either <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> causes the outputs of the <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> to differ, or mismatch, {{for at least one}} sample. The <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> are specifically designed so that, when a soft error occurs, they produce distinct error patterns at the <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> output. An error detection circuit monitors the basic <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> outputs and identifies any mismatches. An error correction circuit determines which <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> is in error based on the mismatch pattern and selects the error-free <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> result as the output of the overall error-protected system. This technique is referred to as structural dual modular redundancy (DMR) since it enhances traditional DMR to provide error correction, as well as error detection, by means of <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> modules with different structures. The proposed technique has been implemented and evaluated. The system achieves a soft error correction rate of close to 100 % for isolated single soft errors and has a logic complexity significantly less than that of conventional triple modular redundancy. This is achieved using a Cadence 180 nm CMOS technology. Index Terms—Dual modular redundancy (DMR), <b>shift</b> <b>registers,</b> finite impulse response (FIR), soft errors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Irregular {{clocking}} {{of feedback}} <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> {{is a popular}} technique to improve parameters of keystream generators in stream ciphers. Another technique is to implement nonlinear functions. We join these techniques and propose Modified Alternating Step Generators built with linear and nonlinear feedback <b>shift</b> <b>registers.</b> Adequate nonlinear Boolean functions are used as feedbacks or as filtering functions of <b>shift</b> <b>registers</b> {{in order to increase}} complexity of sequences produced by individual registers and the whole generator.

Joe Logue and Rick Dill (IBM) were building counters using monojunction transistors. Torkel Wallmark and Harwick Johnson (RCA) used both the thyristors and field-effect transistors. The works of 1955–1958 that used germanium thyristors were fruitless. Only {{in the summer}} of 1959, after the inventions of Kilby, Lehovec and Hoerni became publicly known, D'Azaro reported an operational <b>shift</b> <b>register</b> based on silicon thyristors. In this register, one crystal containing four thyristors replaced eight transistors, 26 diodes and 27 resistors. The area of each thyristor ranged from 0.2 to 0.4mm2, with a thickness of about 0.1mm. The circuit elements were isolated by etching deep grooves.|$|E
