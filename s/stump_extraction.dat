40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of tree <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> on the diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce Picea abies roots. I tested if the density of saproxylic beetles was {{the same in the}} interior layer of the stump storage piles as in the exterior layer. I also tested if the beetle density was as high or higher in piles as in remaining stumps at extraction clear-cuts and to test if they could be ecological traps. I tested if species at higher trophic level as well as red-listed species could be impacted negatively by <b>stump</b> <b>extraction.</b> A total of 110 root wood samples were collected from 6 clear-cuts and 6 extraction clear-cuts and 4 different piles in central Sweden near Uppsala, Lindesberg and Fågelfors. The clear-cuts were dominated by Norway spruce and were sampled 1 to 2 years after clear felling. Norway spruce is the most common tree species used in tree <b>stump</b> <b>extraction.</b> Insect were reared from the sampled roots in rearing boxes for 8 weeks. Insects were also sampled after the rearing box period by pealing the bark of the roots and putting the bark in Tullgren-funnels to sample the last insects inside the bark. The sampled Coleoptera were determined to species level. A total of 1379 beetles of 35 species were collected from the roots. Higher species richness was found inside the piles (PIN) than {{on the outside of the}} piles (POUT). Hardly any difference was found between the clear-cut (C) and extraction clear-cut (EC) in species-richness per root-sample, but a significant difference was found between the pile habitats. Common saproxylic species, like Dryocetes autographus and Hylastes cunicularius, showed increased abundance in C and EC but a decrease in the storage piles. The pest species Pityogenes chalcographus was only reared in PIN. Predatory species higher up in the trophic levels, like the staphylinid Nudobius lentus, were found in low abundance in C, EC and in POUT but not in PIN. This could mean that the piles can be an ecological trap to species at higher trophic levels as well as for some pest species. The results of this study indicates that tree <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> can cause a lower diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce roots and a decreased species richness if the stump piles constitutes an ecological trap. As a consequence, this can decrease the diversity and species richness in the surrounding area...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about climate}} change and fossil fuel {{shortages}} are encouraging interest in stumps, as alternative energy sources. Stumps are an almost unused resource {{in the context of}} bio fuels. Stump harvesting signifies an intensification of forest management compared with conventional stem-only or above-ground biomass-only harvesting. There are many benefits of stump harvesting. These include: the production of wood fuel, fossil fuel substitution, and improved soil preparation. Removing tree trunks in Hungary has been going on according to the principle of <b>stump</b> <b>extraction,</b> which means stumps are removed by grabbing technology. Experiments have been carried out to reduce the extraction force. In the Great Hungarian Lowland, where large areas require the operation implementation, <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> is done by special, hydraulic driven baggers equipped with a special bucket. During operation of the equipment, we carried out measurements of the extraction force and the time requirement. The experiments are designed to carry out the measurements with different soils and different tree species. According to our proposal the suitable force and torque required to remove stumps can be significantly reduced if before the lifting the soil — root connection is loosened. One of the possible ways to implement this task is the use of vibration. Since relatively great vibration power and wide domain of frequency are necessary, therefore we prepared the loosening machinery elements of alternating-current hydraulics system. Based on constructions variants we created a tractor-mounted experimental alternating-current hydraulic stump-loosening machine. It was designed with the ability to produce horizontal vibration in order to loosen stumps...|$|E

" The attempt of this paper is to present a case of massive postoperative clot formation after tooth extraction and highlight on the oral complications of {{surgical procedures}}. A 32 -year-old male patient reported to the Dental Clinic for evaluation and extraction of grossly decayed 46. Clinical evaluation of 46 revealed root <b>stumps.</b> <b>Extraction</b> of the root stumps was performed, and it was uneventful. Hemostasis was achieved and postsurgical instructions were specified to the patient. The patient reported to the clinic, the very subsequent morning with a criticism of bleeding at the extraction site. On clinical examination, bleeding was noted from the socket in relation to 46. To control bleeding, oral hemostatic drugs Revici - E (Ethamsylate 500 mg) was prescribed and bleeding was stopped in 2 h. However, a massive clot was formed at the extraction site. Further, this clot resolved on its own in 1 -week time. Despite the fact that dental extraction is considered to be a minor surgical procedure, some cases may present with life-threatening complications including hemorrhage. Vigilant and significant history taking, physical and dental examinations prior to dental procedures are a must to avoid intraoperative and postoperative complications...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden, <b>stump</b> fuel <b>extraction</b> {{for energy}} {{purposes}} {{is not a}} well-established practice and this major resource is currently left in the forest. The stump fuel supply chain is both challenging and complex, due to distance between resource and end user, material bulkiness, {{and the number of}} subprocesses involved. This study examined the impact of different aspects such as site characteristics, fuel quality, biomass losses, and machine performance on fuel cost. Two systems, including transport of comminuted and uncomminuted fuel, were studied. Discrete-event simulation was used to model systems and to analyse the dynamics of the supply chain and its various components. For a distance of 10 [*]km, transportation of uncomminuted fuel gave the lowest costs. For distances from 30 to 70 [*]km, site size (odt) determined whether to comminute or not before transport. For longer distances, comminution before transport proved to be necessary. Well-planned stump storage was shown to reduce the delivery costs significantly, while high moisture content (> 45 %) had detrimental effects on system costs per unit energy delivered. However, the most influential parameters were productivity level and site characteristics (distance and site size) ...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{appendicitis}} is {{the most}} common surgical emergency in developed countries. The treatment of acute appendicitis is either open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The latter has gained wide acceptance in the past years, although the debate on the true merits of laparoscopic appendectomy is still on going. Some authors prefer this approach as the gold standard for all patients, but in our opinion a tailored approach is warranted for specific patient groups. In addition, a standardised guideline on the technical aspects is still lacking. In the current article, open versus laparoscopic appendectomy and several technical aspects, such as <b>stump</b> closure, appendix <b>extraction</b> and single incision are discussed laparoscopic appendectomy are being addressed.

40|$|In forests {{there are}} many organisms that depend on trees. When forests are managed the {{environment}} for tree-associated species changes, {{and a lot of}} their habitat is lost. In boreal forests it is common with clearcutting, where almost all trees are harvested. In addition, with an increased demand for biofuel, the extraction of tree tops, branches and stumps is expanding. At the same time, some trees are retained in the open conditions after clearcutting for conservation purposes. In the boreal forests of Sweden, tree species richness is poor but the richness of flora and fauna of species associated with trees is high. I have analyzed the responses of epiphytic lichens to the environmental change on retained trees when the surrounding forest is clearcut. I have also analyzed the responses of saproxylic beetles to <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> in the landscape. Overall, there is a wide variety of species responses, and they can be difficult to predict. Sometimes tree traits, such as successional strategy, can help predict the responses of tree-associated species to environmental change. Sometimes the traits of the tree-associated species themselves can drive their response to environmental change. For lichens, species associated with the late-successional Norway spruce occur less on trees retained at clearcuts than on trees in closed-canopy forest. The pattern is the opposite for lichen species associated with early-successional tree species. Some lichen traits can also drive species responses to the open environment after clearcutting; characteristics that seem to increase the probability of lichens to occur on trees retained at clearcutting are a foliose or fruticose growth form, thallus sunscreen, or asexual reproduction. The responses of saproxylic beetles to landscape <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> varies, with predators more negatively affected than lower trophic levels. In an attempt to elucidate different aspects of the distribution of responses, I suggest ways to develop the concept of response diversity. The diverging responses of species to forest management entails different requirements for their conservation...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{scientists}} {{must meet}} the sometimes conflicting demands of policy and science, but not necessarily at the same time. We analysed the policy and intra-scientific orientations of research projects on effects of <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> on biodiversity, and found shifts over time associated with these demands. Our results indicate that uncertainties related to both factual issues and human decisions are often ignored in policy-oriented reports and syntheses, which could give misleading indications of the reliability or feasibility of any conclusions. The policy versus intra-scientific orientation of the scientific papers generated from the surveyed projects varied substantially, although we argue that in applied research, societal relevance is generally more important than intra-scientific relevance. To make conservation science more socially relevant, {{there is a need}} for giving societal relevance higher priority, paying attention to uncertainties and increasing the awareness of the value of cross-disciplinary research considering human decisions and values.

40|$|Wood fuels make a key {{contribution}} to {{renewable energy sources}} in the Nordic countries. The growing demand for forest biomass can be partly met by utilising energy-rich stumps left after clear cutting. As fuel, stump wood is commonly associated with a high presence of contaminants, resulting in high ash content. The concentration of contaminants depends on factors such as soil type, weather conditions, harvesting method, storage duration and other handling operations. The high ash content is a major drawback when using stump wood as fuel. Handling methods that could improve fuel quality are therefore highly desirable. To produce a fuel of acceptable quality, i. e. with low moisture and ash content and high energy value, the above-mentioned factors require evaluation and quantification. In this thesis, various handling methods within the supply chain for Norway spruce stump and their effects on the biomass as fuel are evaluated. The following handling processes are dealt with: harvesting technique, pre-treatments including stump splitting/fractionation and cleaning using vibration or sieving, storage methods and storage duration. Choice of stump harvesting head proved {{to have an impact}} on fuel quality, as splitting of <b>stumps</b> during <b>extraction</b> allowed better drying during storage. Such stumps could be stored directly in windrows, since no difference could be established between this method and storage in heaps prior to windrow storage. In general, storage improved fuel quality. Changes in fuel quality parameters do not reflect the whole picture, however, since dry matter losses occur during storage, and therefore the storage period should be kept as short as possible. During winter months, when demands for fuel are highest, stump ash content can be high, since frozen contaminants are difficult to detach from stumps during transport. To achieve acceptable fuel quality during high demand periods, long storage duration or a pre-treatment involving additional stump cleaning is required. Fuel quality was clearly improved by vibration-based cleaning before the comminution of stumps or by sieving stump wood after crushing. These methods can allow stump wood fuel of acceptable quality to be supplied within a harvesting season...|$|R
40|$|Forest biomass burned {{for energy}} {{purposes}} {{does not need}} to be accounted for under IPCC rules. This has led to a number of countries considering tree stump harvesting as a source of forest biomass. However there are concerns that the soil disturbance that this may entail could have adverse environmental effects, including the loss of sequestered carbon from the soil. Published results differ in the degree and nature of stump harvesting soil disturbance. Two widely used measures employed in stump harvesting soil disturbance studies are visual assessment of disturbance extent and bulk density measures of the nature of disturbance. Each of these has limitations. This study seeks to extend the insight into both the nature and extent of soil disturbance resulting from stump harvesting by the application of additional techniques. In this way the physical effects of soil disturbance by stump harvesting will be compared with those of other forestry practices. To overcome the two-dimensional and subjective nature of visual assessment, a radiometric approach was adopted, utilising residual Chernobyl 137 Cs fallout to determine the degree of soil mixing. To complement bulk density measurements, micromorphological analyses of soil thin sections taken from field samples were carried out to investigate the impact of compressive force on pore space. Low-cost tracer devices were deployed in the soil around stumps prior to extraction to permit the monitoring of the lateral movement of soil during <b>stump</b> <b>extraction.</b> These methods were applied to a stump harvesting operation carried out under current UK guidance at a UPM Tilhill managed site in south west Scotland. The radiometric method demonstrated its capacity to recognise differing degrees of soil disturbance in an operational forest environment, including some disturbance that might escape visual assessment. Analysis of soil thin sections provided the evidence of a significant increase in the pore capacity of disturbed soil. The soil movement tracers developed for this project provided the capability to examine the various trajectories of soil during <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> as well as dimensioning the resulting disturbance crater. The study indicated that under current UK management and operational practice, stump harvesting generated a higher level of soil disturbance compared to ground preparation by trench mounding, with an estimated 1260 m 3 ha- 1 of soil disturbed by stump harvesting compared to 250 m 3 ha- 1 from trench mounding. Stump harvesting was found to generate a net reduction in soil bulk density in the affected areas, contrary to the findings of some other studies. This outcome is dependent on adhering to particular site management and operational procedures. The practice of raking over the site following stump harvesting is estimated to add a further 10...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{detailed study of}} stump harvesting in Lamloch Forest in north Dumfries and Galloway from 2010 to 2014. The study explored both {{the nature and extent}} of soil disturbance resulting from stump harvesting using a variety of standard and innovative techniques. Stump harvesting disturbance was compared with that of other forestry practices. To complement the two-dimensional and subjective nature of visual assessment techniques, a radiometric approach was adopted, utilising residual Chernobyl 137 Cs fallout to determine the degree of soil mixing. To support bulk density measurements, micromorphological analyses of soil thin sections were carried out to investigate the impact of compressive force on pore space. Low-cost tracer devices were deployed in the soil around stumps prior to extraction to permit the monitoring of soil lateral movement during <b>stump</b> <b>extraction.</b>   The study showed that stump harvesting followed by restock, when carried out under current guidelines, disturbed around five times the volume of soil compared to that disturbed by trench mounding. Stump harvesting also resulted in a net reduction in soil bulk density.

30|$|An {{important}} {{question is whether the}} estimated forest biomass potentials represent a sustainable potential. In our study, we focused on biomass potentials from forests available for wood supply and we are therefore not considering harvesting in strictly protected forests and forests where harvesting is not allowed or not possible. Furthermore, we estimated a harvest level that could be sustained for several decades and considered multiple environmental factors that reduce biomass availability to avoid detrimental effects on forests. However, this does not necessarily imply that substantially increasing harvesting levels would be sustainable in all aspects. A key issue is whether using forest biomass contributes to climate change mitigation, but this strongly depends on how wood is used. Numerous studies (for an overview, we refer to Searchinger et al. 2018) argue that burning wood may - at least temporarily - increase carbon in the atmosphere before it is absorbed again by the re-growing trees. Using wood for materials, however, could result in lower emissions as compared to alternative, fossil-intensive materials (Sathre and O’Connor 2010; Leskinen et al. 2018). The overall climate change mitigation effects of using wood should consider the carbon balances in forest ecosystems, harvested wood products and substitution effects (Leskinen et al. 2018). Increasing harvest levels may also affect forest biodiversity. Intensively managed areas generally contain less features important for biodiversity as compared to unmanaged (Paillet et al. 2010) or less intensively managed forests (Wallenius et al. 2010; Brukas et al. 2013). Increasing harvesting intensity may negatively affect biodiversity (Bouget et al. 2012) as well as other functions and services provided by forests (Sing et al. 2018), although increasing harvest intensity may also have positive effects by improving early seral habitat conditions and by increasing light availability, which allows for a more complex understory vegetation to develop (Vance et al. 2018). In addition to stemwood, also the extraction of logging residues may lead to negative trade-offs with biodiversity (Jonsell 2008; Bouget et al. 2012; Ranius et al. 2018). Furthermore, logging residue extraction could lead to reduced nutrient availability in forest soils, which may have negative consequences on future tree growth (Achat et al., 2015 a; Achat et al., 2015 b; Ranius et al. 2018). Especially the extraction of stumps is disputed, as <b>stump</b> <b>extraction</b> could have adverse impacts on forest soil carbon stores and greenhouse gas emissions; disturbance of soil structure leading to increased risk of soil erosion, increased soil compaction, depleted soil nutrient stocks, and changes in nutrient cycling might impact on future productivity and lead to loss of valuable habitats (Walmsley and Godbold 2010; Vanguelova et al. 2017). We attempted to consider these aspects in the definitions of the constraints applied to the extraction of logging residues and stumps following the definition of the biomass typologies (Dees et al., 2017 a; Panoutsou 2017), but this does not mean there will not be any negative impacts of increasing harvesting levels.|$|E
