40|$|Two-phase-flow {{stability}} can be analysed {{with the}} TOSCLE code. TOSCLE uses equations derived by linearising and taking Laplace transformations of the mass, energy and momentum conservation equations and solving the resultant one-space-dimension equations analytically along a straight, uniform cross-section pipe with uniform heat addition or removal per unit length. Separate solutions are obtained for single-phase regions and two-phase {{regions of the}} pipe. Single-phase regions can be either subcooled liquid or superheated vapour. Complicated circuits can be analysed by subdividing the components until they conform to the "straight, uniform cross-section, uniform heat" description. The code calculates steady-state pressure drop for given inlet velocity, then perturbed pressure drop for given inlet velocity perturbation. The latter calculation is repeated {{at a number of}} frequencies to permit the drawing of a Nyquist plot of the inlet velocity to pressure drop transfer function from which stability is assessed. A <b>simple</b> <b>slip</b> correlation is incorporated as well as a two-phase-friction multiplier, which is taken as a quadratic in quality. Localised restrictions are permitted. The deficiencies of the analysis are a neglect of subcooled boiling and of variations in fluid saturation properties with pressure.

50|$|A single <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or switch tracks to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot switch tracks. This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|R

The data was collected by recording the students’ conversation. The conversation lasted for about 30 minutes. The data, then, was transcribed into the written form. In analyzing the data, the writer used the framework proposed by Faerch and Kasper (1983 : 214). The result showed that the speech plannings the students usually attempted in making conversation are: temporal variables such as pause (filled), drawls; hesitation phenomena such as filled pause, repetition, and correction; and other phenomena like <b>slip,</b> <b>switch,</b> uptake signal, and interjection. From the kinds of speech plannings mentioned above {{it can be said}} that pauses (filled) were the most attempted by the students so they could gain time for execution. In general, the speech plannings attempted by the students indicate that the students’ speaking readiness is low. In other words, they often find problems in their conversation. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{time-dependent}} Ginzburg-Landau {{model of}} plastic deformation in two-dimensional solids is presented. The fundamental dynamic variables are the displacement field u and the lattice velocity v= u/ t. Damping {{is assumed to}} arise from the shear viscosity in the momentum equation. The elastic energy density is a periodic function of the shear and tetragonal strains, which enables formation of slips at large strains. In this work we neglect defects such as vacancies, interstitials, or grain boundaries. The <b>simplest</b> <b>slip</b> consists of two edge dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors. The formation energy of a slip is minimized if its orientation is parallel or perpendicular to the flow in simple shear deformation and if it makes angles of ±π/ 4 {{with respect to the}} stretched direction in uniaxial stretching. High-density dislocations produced in plastic flow do not disappear even if the flow is stopped. Thus large applied strains give rise to metastable, structurally disordered states. We divide the elastic energy into an elastic part due to affine deformation and a defect part. The latter represents degree of disorder and is nearly constant in plastic flow under cyclic straining.

The further investigation shows that they not only {{play the role of}} the light absorbers, but also can be viewed both as electron- and hole-transporting media, owing to their ambipolar charge transport character [50]. In perovskite film synthesis, a nonporous homogenous perovskite film must be deposited in order to avoid shunting in planar devices. However, films produced by conventional spin coating methods were found to be comprised of large CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 microwhiskers and many uncovered void areas [51]. Dendrite crystal growth implies that organolead iodide perovskite (OIP) exhibits preferential growth. Inspired by that phenomenon, the synthesis of OIP nanowires (NWs) was investigated and implemented in our group [52]. In addition to our work, Swiss scientists Endre Horvá et al. pioneered the synthesis of OIP NWs by a <b>simple</b> <b>slip</b> coating method during a similar period [53].

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we explore the {{mechanism}} of energy transfer between the single actuated DOF of a one-legged hopping robot and the remaining unactuated DOFs, during stable running. The concept of the energy transfer mechanism is laid out, after which follows an analytical study. Using this study, an initial controller is derived for the control of a <b>simple</b> <b>SLIP</b> model with friction in the leg and hip, using a single actuator at the hip. We show that while this controller is capable of stable motion for the SLIP model, it {{does not lead to}} stable locomotion for the full realistic robot model with pitching body, leg inertia and friction in hip and leg. This indicates that the SLIP model often used for controller design may be unsuitable for this purpose. The necessary modifications are then made to the controller to achieve stable locomotion for the full model, again with a single, easy-to-implement actuator located at the hip. Finally, results are shown from applying the controller to the full model {{for a wide range of}} parameters leading to stable motions.

40|$|Wheel slip {{compensation}} {{is vital for}} building accurate and reliable dead reckoning based robot localization and mapping algorithms. This investigation presents stochastic slip compensation scheme for robot localization and mapping. Main idea of the slip compensation technique is to use wheel-slip data obtained from experiments to model the variations in slip velocity as Gaussian distributions. This leads to a family of models that are switched depending on the input command. To obtain the wheel-slip measurements, experiments are conducted on a wheeled mobile robot and the measurements thus obtained are used to build the Gaussian models. Then the localization and mapping algorithm is tested on an experimental terrain and a new metric called the map spread factor is {{used to evaluate the}} ability of the slip compensation technique. Our results clearly indicate that the proposed methodology improves the accuracy by 72. 55 % for rotation and 66. 67 % for translation motion as against an uncompensated mapping system. The proposed compensation technique eliminates the need for extro receptive sensors for slip compensation, complex feature extraction and association algorithms.
