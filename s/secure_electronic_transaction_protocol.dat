40|$|Recently, a new {{light-weight}} {{version of}} the <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> <b>protocol</b> was proposed. The protocol can achieve two goals. One goal is that the security level {{is the same as}} the SET protocol. The other goal is to reduce the computational time in message generation and verification, and reduce the communication overhead. However, the protocol has a weakness, which is that non-repudiation is acquired, but confidentiality is lost. In this paper, we point out the weakness of the protocol.

40|$|The SET (<b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transactions)</b> <b>protocol</b> was {{designed}} as an open industry standard for the secure transmission of payment information over private and public networks. Anecdotal evidence suggested that SET had been slow {{to get off the}} mark in Australia for several different reasons, notably the absence of software products, its limited functionality, and cost of implementation. This exploratory study sets out, firstly, to identify the reasons for this reluctance to adopt and implement SET by a variety of Internet Payment System (IPS) developers promoting their products in the Australian e-Commerce market. This begs the question as to the level of consideration given to security and other payment system issues in these systems. To this end, the paper then analyses the alternate tools and services these vendors have utilized (if any) in order to comply with the established payment security requirements of confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation that SET {{was designed}} to address...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Secure {{electronic}} commerce {{relies on the}} application of secure transaction protocol. However, even with the so-called secure protocol, the communication can be compromised frequently without effective approach to detect the subtle flaws before it launches into practice. We generated ENDL[2] {{that is used to}} formally verify the authentication properties of secure transaction protocols. We have showed how to employ it to depict the complicated security properties of secure protocols, especially the instances in SET (<b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction)</b> <b>protocol,</b> in our previous work [3]. The first stage of the SET protocol, namely Cardholder Registration, has been defined in book [1] respectively. It formally describes the seven fundamental steps of the flow of transactions in outline. Based on the ENDL, we describe the whole verification of cardholder registration process in this paper. Some potentially dangerous flaws of SET protocol are noted while verifying the protocol...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a protocol design process, and illustrate its use by creating ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based Secure Protocol for Electronic Commerce Transactions. The design process is {{organized around the}} authentication tests, a method for protocol verification based on the strand space theory. The authentication tests dictate how randomly generated values such as nonces may be combined with encryption to achieve authentication and freshness. ATSPECT offers functionality and security guarantees akin to the purchase request, payment authorization, and payment capture phases of SET, the secure electronic transaction standard created by the major credit card firms. In previous work [10, 12, 8], we have developed a method—called the “authentication test ” method—that {{can be used by}} hand to verify cryptographic protocols. We also pointed out that the same ideas can be used to guide the protocol development process, quickly leading to new protocols; proofs of correctness for these protocols then follow from the development process. In [10, 12] we illustrated the point by “reinventing ” preexisting protocols. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use it to create a completely new protocol with highly non-trivial functionality. We call our new protocol ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based Secure Protocol for Electronic Commerce Transactions. It is intended to achieve the essential security goals of the existing Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) purchase request, payment authorization, and payment capture phases, as we understand them. The <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> <b>protocol</b> [15] was a major effort undertaken by a consortium of credit card companies and banks in the mid- 90 s. It was intended to provide a basis for secure electronic commerce. It is not currently in use anywhere, presumably partly as a consequence of being complex, difficult to implement, and difficult to analyze. For these reasons it was viewed as a high-risk un...|$|E
40|$|Credit cards {{have been}} the {{dominant}} payment method in e-commerce during the past years {{and it is not}} expected {{that this is going to}} change soon. However, credit card payments as used today are not suited for anonymous or pseudonymous payments. Credit card payments disclose the identity of a customer to the merchant and the issuer of the credit card knows exactly where the customer makes payments. The <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) <b>protocol</b> makes credit card payments over the Internet more secure, but it does not much to protect the privacy of the customer. In this report, we present the Pseudonymous <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (PSET) <b>protocol.</b> PSET is an extension of SET and enables pseudonymous credit card payments over the Internet. Pseudonymous payments mean that none of the involved parties in the payment process can learn the identities of both the customer and the merchant at the same time. This is achieved by distributing the knowledge of the whole transaction among the involved parties. On the other hand, PSET guarantees that it is not possible for any of the involved parties to cheat and that it is possible to unambiguously resolve the identity of a pseudonymous customer in case of a dispute...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The use of Web {{technology}} for communicating healthcare-related information has grown {{dramatically in the}} past several years. The 1997 AMIA Fall Symposium included over 120 papers, posters, and panels that included or discussed a Web interface in a clinical application. Though early prototype developments focused primarily on the use of Web clients on private networks 1 - 5 (i. e., intranets), the use of the public Internet as a communications infrastructure for patient-identifiable data is growing. This growth has been propelled by the recent introduction of security technologies for Web communications such as the Secure Sockets Layer 7 (SSL) and the <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transactions</b> (SET) <b>protocol.</b> 8 These technologies contribute to the protection of data communications between server and client, but do not address vulnerabilities in the client and server environments.

Together, these transactions constitute the kernel of the protocol. We then encoded our model and the aforementioned correctness properties in the input language of the FDR model checker. Running FDR on this input established that our model of the SET protocol satisfies all five properties even though the cardholder and merchant, two {{of the participants in}} the protocol, may try to behave dishonestly in certain ways.

40|$|Abstract. Owing to the {{limitations}} of mobile terminals and network bandwidth, the current <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) <b>protocol</b> can not be introduced into mobile payment directly. Present mobile payment system often uses symmetric encryption algorithm that may bring in some security risks. A new secure mobile payment protocol based on ECC was presented,which ensures information flows from merchant to customer and enhances the security of customer’s information. Theoretical analysis shows that, ECC can not only {{meet the requirements of}} short key generation time, but also ensure {{that at the same time}} of cracking code the ratio of RSA and ECC key length is greater than 5 : 1. The number of signing the certificate verification, asymmetric and symmetric encryption of the new protocol is also lesser than SET protocol, so the current mobile terminal and network capabilities can support this protocol to ensure safe and effective mobile payment process. Introductions With the development of wireless communication and mobile Internet, there are more and more smartphone users. The number of mobile phone subscribers has reached about 6 billion [1].
