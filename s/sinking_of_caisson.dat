40|$|An open-dug caisson shaft {{is a form}} of {{top-down}} {{construction in}} which a concrete shaft is sunk into the ground using the weight of the shaft and additional kentledge, if required. Excavation at the base <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> shaft wall allows the structure to descend through the ground. A thorough understanding of the interaction between the caisson shaft and soil is essential to maintain controlled <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>caisson.</b> In this paper, the failure mechanisms developed beneath caisson blades in sand are investigated. A series of laboratory tests were carried out at the University of Oxford to explore how varying blade angles affect the performance of the bearing capacity beneath the <b>caisson.</b> Cutting angles <b>of</b> 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 ° and 90 ° (flat) were penetrated into sand under plane strain conditions; forces were monitored using a Cambridge-type load cell while soil displacements were recorded using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand how the soil failure mechanism develops and to determine the optimum cutting angle. The results of the laboratory tests can be scaled to predict the likely behaviour in the field. Results show that the bearing capacity is significantly dependent on the cutting angle; in a dense sand a steep cutting angle may be used to aid <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>caisson...</b>|$|R

The CSIR have carried out a number of studies with regards to the safety of the structure. The consequences <b>of</b> <b>caisson</b> failure and the possible effects on the port were however not investigated. When it was determined that settlement was taking place, information concerning the condition <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> structure and factors influencing the structure were gathered. Investigations on the following were done: (a) Extent <b>of</b> <b>caisson</b> settlement. (b) Sediment movement around the structure. (c) Foundation condition.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the past}} decade, the performance-based design method <b>of</b> <b>caisson</b> breakwaters has been developed, which allows a certain damage while {{maintaining}} {{the function of the}} structure. However, the existing method does not consider the changing coastal environment due to climate change impacts so that the stability of the structure is not guaranteed over the lifetime of the structure. In this paper, a time-dependent performance-based design method is developed, which is able to estimate the expected sliding distance and the probability of failure <b>of</b> a <b>caisson</b> breakwater considering the influence of sea level rise and wave height increase due to climate change. Especially, time-dependent probability of failure is calculated by considering the sea level rise and wave height increase as a function of time. The developed method was applied to the East Breakwater of the Hitachinaka Port which is located on the east coast of Japan. It was shown that the influence of wave height increase is much greater than that of sea level rise, because the magnitude of sea level rise is negligibly small compared with the water depth at the breakwater site. Moreover, investigation was made for the change <b>of</b> <b>caisson</b> width due to climate change impacts, which is the main concern of harbor engineers. The longer the structure lifetime, the greater was the increase <b>of</b> <b>caisson</b> width.

A typical caisson has been used in this study with a length-to-diameter ratio <b>of</b> 2. The <b>caisson</b> is assumed to be embedded in a homogeneous soil deforming under undrained conditions. The performance <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> under separate axial, lateral and torsional forces was investigated first, followed by the interaction of these forces with each other. The ultimate capacity <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> under combined loading is presented in the form of failure envelope in the axial-torsional loading plane and axial-lateral, and lateral-torsional loading surfaces along the skirt of the foundation.

40|$|A {{generalized}} spring multi-Winkler {{model is}} {{developed for the}} static and dynamic response <b>of</b> rigid <b>caisson</b> foundations <b>of</b> circular, square, or rectangular plan, embedded in a homogeneous elastic. The model, {{referred to as a}} four-spring Winkler model, uses four types of springs to model the interaction between soil and caisson: Lateral translational springs distributed along the length <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> relating horizontal displacement at a particular depth to lateral soil resistance (resultant of normal and shear tractions on the caisson periphery); similarly distributed rotational springs relating rotation <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> to the moment increment developed by the vertical shear tractions on the caisson periphery; and concentrated translational and rotational springs relating, respectively, resultant horizontal shear force with displacement, and overturning moment with rotation, at the base <b>of</b> the <b>caisson.</b> For the dynamic problem each spring is accompanied by an associated dashpot in parallel. Utilising elastodynamic theoretical available in the literature results for rigid embedded foundations, closed-form expressions are derived for the various springs and dashpots <b>of</b> <b>caissons</b> with rectangular and circular plan shape. The response <b>of</b> a <b>caisson</b> to lateral static and dynamic loading at its top, and to kinematically-induced loading arising from vertical seismic shear wave propagation, is then studied parametrically. Comparisons with results from 3 D finite element analysis and other available theoretical methods demonstrate the reliability of the model, the need for which arises from its easy extension to multi-layered and nonlinear inelastic soil.

The impact of this was so intense that the seismograph at Kidderpore registered it as an earthquake and a Hindu temple on the shore was destroyed, although it was subsequently rebuilt. While muck was being cleared, numerous varieties of objects were brought up, including anchors, grappling irons, cannons, cannonballs, brass vessels, and coins dating back to the East India Company.The job <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> the <b>caissons</b> was carried out round-the-clock at a rate of a foot or more per day. [...] The caissons were sunk through soft river deposits to a stiff yellow clay 26.5 m below ground level. The accuracy <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> the huge <b>caissons</b> was exceptionally precise, within 50-75 mm of the true position. After penetrating 2.1 m into clay, all shafts were plugged with concrete after individual dewatering, with some 5 m of backfilling in adjacent shafts. The main piers on the Howrah side were sunk by open wheel dredging, while those on the Kolkata side required compressed air to counter running sand. The air pressure maintained was about 40 lbs per square inch (2.8 bar), which required about 500 workers to be employed. Whenever excessively soft soil was encountered, the shafts symmetrical to the caisson axes were left unexcavated to allow strict control. In very stiff clays, a large number of the internal wells were completely undercut, allowing the whole weight <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> to be carried by the outside skin friction and the bearing under the external wall.

The nonlinear soil reactions along the circumference and on the base <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> are modeled realistically by using suitable couple translational and rotational nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, which can realistically (even if approximately) model such effects as separation and slippage at the caisson-soil interface, uplift <b>of</b> the <b>caisson</b> base, radiation damping, stiffness and strength degradation with large number of cycles. The method is implemented in a new finite difference time-domain code, NL-CAISSON. An efficient numerical methodology is also developed for calibrating the model parameters using a variety of experimental and analytical data. The necessity for the proposed model arises from the difficulty to predict the large-amplitude dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>caissons</b> up to failure, statically or dynamically. In a subsequent companion paper [Gerolymos N, Gazetas G. Static and dynamic response <b>of</b> massive <b>caisson</b> foundations with soil and interface nonlinearities - validation and results.
