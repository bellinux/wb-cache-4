He summarized {{the content of}} the lyrics, writing [...] "t starts in the past, {{at the start of a}} relationship, and then lets us know it’s a flashback. They’re <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> reminiscing. It then jumps back to the beginning and steps us through the couple’s years together, but all the while shifting perspective, jumping between their separate memories." [...] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song [...] "features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus" [...] and it talks about [...] "the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past." [...] Priya Elan of The Guardian believed that [...] "Mine" [...] depicts [...] "a stop-start relationship between a normal guy and girl".

500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason {{has also}} been {{referenced}} by several television shows. The stop motion animated television show Robot Chicken features Jason in three of its comedy sketches. In episode seventeen, [...] "", the mystery-solving teenagers from Scooby-Doo arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are killed off one by one. Velma is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In episode nineteen, [...] "That Hurts Me", Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of [...] "Horror Movie Big Brother", alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Pinhead, and Ghostface. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical Friday the 13th. Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of Family Guy entitled [...] "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One". The so-called [...] "Mr. Voorhees" [...] explains to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as {{the manager of the}} [...] "Britches and Hose" [...] clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up. In an episode of The Simpsons, Jason appears in a Halloween episode <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> with Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks where the family is, Jason responds, [...] "Ehh, whaddya gonna do?" [...] and turns the TV on. He also appears in The Simpsons episode [...] "Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot!", alongside Pinhead, menacing Bart in a fantasy sequence. The South Park episodes [...] "Imaginationland EpisodeII" [...] and [...] "III" [...] feature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an inhabitant of the [...] "bad side" [...] of Imaginationland, a world populated by fictional characters. This version of Jason has an effeminate voice and describes the removal of Strawberry Shortcake's eyeball as [...] "super hardcore". Experimental pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Jason Voorhees out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his [...] "Totally Sweet" [...] series in 2013.|$|E
