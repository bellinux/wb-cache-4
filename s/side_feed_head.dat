40|$|The novel {{concept of}} reverse flow {{operation}} with reactor <b>side</b> <b>feeding</b> is studied for selective oxidation of NH 3 to produce either N 2, N 2 O, or NO. During normal reverse flow operation, where the feeds are alternately introduced from {{either end of}} the reactor, the conversion is always lower when compared to steady state, once-through operation at the same residence time. The novel concept of reverse flow operation with reactor <b>side</b> <b>feeding</b> is therefore proposed to avoid the decrease of conversion. The production rate of the desired product can be kept at a high level, which may even exceed the production of normal reverse flow operation and steady state, once-through operation. The reactor behavior was simulated for three regimes (quasi steady state, dynamic, and relaxed steady state) with varying feed positions. The development of spatiotemporal patterns inside the reactor with <b>side</b> <b>feeding</b> shows completely different behavior compared to normal reverse flow operation and steady state, once-through operation, leading to the possibility of conversion and selectivity manipulations. In addition, the proposed concept also indicates better conversion for the dynamic and relaxed steady-state regimes. The influence of shifting the feed positions to the reactor center is most pronounced if the switching time is shorter. This concept also provides an opportunity to prevent the dead gas volume {{in the center of the}} reactor if suitable feed positions can be applied. The catalyst effectiveness in this novel concept is therefore much better than during normal reverse flow operation and steady state, once-through operation, particularly in the relaxed steady-state regime...|$|R

40|$|Head and eye {{movements}} were simultaneously recorded during locomotory and pecking behavior of 4 pigeons (CoLumba Livia), which {{were trained to}} traverse a conditioning chamber, with a pecking key and a food dispenser at each end. Each trial involved key pecking, walking, and <b>feeding.</b> <b>Head</b> {{movements were}} registered with a skull-mounted miniature accelerometer, and eye movements were recorded with implanted electrooculographic electrodes. An almost perfect tem-poral coordination between head and eye movements was observed during both walking and feeding bouts. During walking, head movements primarily provide retinal image stability, and eye movements support visual scanning. During <b>feeding,</b> <b>head</b> movements mainly subserve the grasp-ing of food items, and eye movements maintain visual fixation on them. Because the eyes are reflexively closed during the middle phase of pecks, the head and eye movements are then under ballistic control. The peculiar saltatory head motions that many birds ex-hibit while they walk have repeatedly attracted interest in the past. As early as 1930, Dunlap and Mowrer reported that although the body of locomoting chickens, pigeons, and star...|$|R
