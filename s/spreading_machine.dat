Some agricultural LCA were carried out to assess environmental performances of fertilisation processes, but they barely {{take into account the}} direct contributions of agricultural machinery. In this paper, we develop the three step method used to assess the environmental impacts of organic spreading using the LCA approach in order to ecodesign organic spreaders (building technological indicators, establishing a link between these indicators and nitrogenous emissions, and assessing fuel consumption of tractors during all the spreading processes). We achieve a LCA study for 45 spreading scenarios and compare environmental performances of <b>spreading</b> <b>machines</b> according to the main LCA environmental impacts. LCA results mainly show that pedoclimatic conditions have an influence on the environmental impacts of spreading scenarios especially for acidification, eutrophication, and global warming and that environmental impacts present significant differences between <b>spreading</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spur and {{helical gears}} {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} very large power between two parallel shafts. However in spur gears the engagement between two meshing teeth is sudden line contact over entire face width which results in generation of noise and higher dynamic load. In helical gears the engagement between two meshing teeth begins with point contact and gradually extends diagonally along the gear tooth surface, resulting in quiet operation. Hence normally spur gears are used for low speed power transmission (20 m/s) and helical gears are preferred for high speed. A considerable {{research in the area of}} bending stress analysis of involute spur gear has been carried out. However it is seen that a very little work has been carried out on stress analysis of involute helical gears. For finding stress concentration & stress pattern in the body, experimental stress analysis is very useful & is employed extensively. In Eco Board Industries Limited., Islampur (Maharashtra), <b>spreading</b> <b>machine</b> is used to spread bagasse in the formation of particle board. Positive Infinite Variable (PIV) gear box is used to transmit the power to belt conveyor of <b>spreading</b> <b>machine</b> which contains helical gears. The power transmitted by gear box is 2. 2 kW at 760 rpm while speed reduction is 1 : 70. In working condition of gear box it has been observed that helical pinion mounted on motor shaft fails due to load coming on the teeth. It seems that the failure is due to stress concentration and bending stresses at tooth root of gear. The crack is initiated just near to high stress concentration region of gear. The calculation of maximum tensile stress of helical gear at tooth root is three dimensional problem. The accurate evaluation of stress state and distribution of stress i...|$|E

As they generate such substances, sludges are often associated with environmental burdens and contribute to major environmental impacts (acidification, eutrophication and global warming). In this paper, we achieve a LCA study for 45 sewage sludge spreading scenarios. After assessing the system boundaries and the functional unit, inventory data were collected. Two impact assessment methods were chosen: Eco-indicator 99 and the CML baseline 2. An analysis of nitrogenous emission origins according to spreader technological performances was possible according to the first results.

Several sets of comparative measurements were made with each type of machine on both grassland and arable land (mostly cereal stubbles), covering a range of soil, crop and weather conditions. Measurements of NH 3 emissions were made for 5 – 7 days following application using a micrometeorological mass balance technique. Mean reductions in NH 3 emission achieved from grassland, in comparison with surface broadcast application, were 73, 57 and 26 % for shallow injection, {{trailing shoe}} and band spreading, respectively, the latter not being significant (probability P> 005). Mean cumulative emissions, expressed as % total ammoniacal N applied in the slurry, were 13, 12 and 35 % for shallow injection, trailing shoe and band spreading, respectively. There was a trend (probability P= 0029) for decreasing emissions with increasing sward height (between 10 and 20 cm) following trailing shoe applications. Abatement was generally less effective when these techniques were used on arable land, with mean reductions of 23, 38 and 27 % achieved for shallow injection, trailing shoe and band spreading, respectively, with none achieving statistical significance (probability P> 005).

40|$|Pumps {{are among}} the most <b>spread</b> <b>machines</b> in {{industrial}} facilities. In this work a comparative CFD analysis using different software is presented. The three-dimensional flow in the semi-open impeller and volute of a centrifugal pump is numerically simulated. The main advantage of semi-open impeller centrifugal pump is its efficiency which can be considered constant thanks to the clearance adjustment. In addition this kind of impeller is less likely to clog with solid bodies (important in case of slurry-processing). The open impeller has all the parts visible, so it is easier to inspect for wear and damages. Eventually it is lighter than a shrouded impeller: it can spin faster. The stress due to centrifugal force is indeed a limit for the speed of this machines. On the other hand its main disadvantage if compared to a shrouded pump is its lower efficiency due to the heavier tip leakage. In addition it cannot be employed in case of explosive products: the risk of contact between impeller and volute causing sparks is not negligible. The simulations have been carried out using both open-source and proprietary software: OpenFOAM®, PumpLinx ® and ANSYS-CFX ®. The performance of the machine handling both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are also investigated. The numerical models and the results of the different computational strategies were compared with the experimental data and the accuracy of different software is evaluated in the case of Newtonian model. It is well known that the performance of a centrifugal pump drops processing a viscous fluid. Even so the behavior during the pumping of non-Newtonian fluids has not been investigated so far. The non-Newtonian fluid processed is a shear-thinning fluid (the apparent viscosity decreases with an increase stress).
