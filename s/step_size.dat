25|$|Band {{members also}} try to keep a {{constant}} pace or <b>step</b> <b>size</b> while marching in parade. Step sizes usually vary between 22 and 30 inches (56–76 cm) per stride. A <b>step</b> <b>size</b> of 22.5inches is called an 8-to-5 step because the marcher covers five yards (about 4.6 m) in eight steps. A <b>step</b> <b>size</b> of 30inches is called 6-to-5 because five yards are covered in six steps. Because yard lines on an American football field are five yards apart, exact 8-to-5 and 6-to-5 steps are most useful for field shows.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a previously derived model describing electrophoretic transport processes is reformulated, and its usefulness is demonstrated by simulating moving boundary electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing with immobilized species. The resulting solution is stable, evolves smoothly when suitable small <b>step</b> <b>sizes</b> are used, and has a loosely defined convergence as the <b>step</b> <b>sizes</b> are made smaller.

40|$|AbstractGlobal almost sure {{asymptotic}} {{stability of}} stochastic θ-methods with nonrandom variable <b>step</b> <b>sizes</b> {{when applied to}} bilinear, nonautonomous, homogeneous test systems of ordinary stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is investigated. Sufficient conditions for almost sure asymptotic stability are proved for both analytical and numerical solutions in R 1. The results of Saito and Mitsui (World Sci. Ser. Appl. Math. 2 (1993) 333, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 33 (1996) 2254), Higham (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 38 (2001) 753) and Schurz (Stochastic Anal.

The investigations indicate that θ-methods with variable <b>step</b> <b>sizes</b> or variable parameter θ governed by certain conditions can successfully be used to guarantee almost sure asymptotic stability while discretizing nonautonomous SDEs...|$|R

25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the <b>step</b> <b>size</b> needed to get an answer that is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E

25|$|If the ordered pairs {{representing}} the original input function are equally spaced in their input variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform {{is known as}} a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of <b>step</b> <b>size</b> equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled for 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1Hz frequency spacing.|$|E
25|$|Military bands or {{corps of}} drums were {{historically}} the first marching bands. Instrumentation in these bands varies but generally consists of brass, woodwinds, and percussion. Due {{to their original}} purpose, military marching bands typically march in a forward direction with consistent straight lines. Music is performed at a constant tempo (120–140 BPM) to facilitate the steady marching of the entire military group the band is playing with. The marching <b>step</b> <b>size,</b> or interval, is consistent, and usually at a 6 to 5 (six steps per five yards) or 8 to 5 (eight steps to five yards). This style includes field music units such as drum and bugle corps or bugle bands, pipe bands, and fife and drum corps.|$|E
