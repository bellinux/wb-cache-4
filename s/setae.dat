5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like <b>setae)</b> {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed <b>setae.</b> This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced <b>setae</b> arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking <b>setae.</b> Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) <b>setae</b> scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its <b>setae.</b> <b>Setae</b> are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the <b>setae</b> are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E

5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal <b>setae</b> (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of <b>setae.</b> The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks.

5|$|It is {{not known}} what the {{function}} of the oral <b>setae</b> in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger-hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, they were probably used for mechanical interactions with their food. The <b>setae</b> may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the clypeus and labral indicates that they served as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E

5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the <b>setae</b> in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial <b>setae,</b> and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial <b>setae,</b> and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled <b>setae</b> on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have <b>setae</b> on the cap.|$|E

5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is a bee.

5|$|Meat ant {{workers may}} be {{confused}} with those of I. lividus, as the two appear similar and are grouped in the same species complex. I. lividus and the much more localised I. spadius can be distinguished from {{other members of the}} I. purpureus group by the shape of the pronotum. Aside from colour differentiation that was a key morphological character to distinguish I. purpureus and the synonym I. greensladei from each other, some meat ant populations exhibit polymorphism despite being monomorphic (occurs in a particular form); specifically, body size among meat ants may vary geographically. For example, those that are found in very hot regions tend to be larger, whereas those found in regions of high humidity tend to be smaller than average. Examined workers once referred to as I. greensladei from southwestern Western Australia have erect <b>setae</b> on the genae (lateral sclerites), whereas those studied elsewhere have glabrous genae, meaning that these areas have no hairs. Such patterns are most likely clinal, where several characteristics may gradually differentiate over a geographical area. The colour of the <b>setae</b> throughout the body and the iridescence may vary geographically. For example, populations restricted to the coasts of Western Australia usually have pale <b>setae,</b> compared to most colonies throughout the country, which have the common blackish <b>setae.</b> In 1993, Shattuck could not separate populations with pale <b>setae</b> when other key diagnostic traits that would separate these populations were not considered. Meat ants from the Western Australian wheatbelt and goldfields show different iridescence; the iridescence in some collected specimens ranged from pale greenish-blue to yellowish-green, especially around the humeri (a structure which forms the basal corner of an insect's wing or wing case) and frons. The variation of the iridescence is, however, a consistent pattern found in other Iridomyrmex species with little distinction, making it a subtle character. The colour variation is less marked in all collected specimens of I. purpureus, as well as its close relative I. viridiaeneus, which is found in dry regions around the south-western regions. Shattuck further notes that populations found throughout the Northern Territory and South Australia have reduced pubescence on the first gastral tergite, but this is different elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long <b>setae</b> (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense <b>setae</b> of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of <b>setae.</b> The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E
5|$|Their dactyli are {{powerful}} and curved into a scimitar-like shape. The second pair of gnathopods are densely covered in hair-like <b>setae</b> {{while the first}} pair only has <b>setae</b> on the posterior margins. The third and fourth pereopods are absent. In their place are two pairs of elongated oval gills arising from {{the third and fourth}} pereonites, respectively. In mature females, two brood pouches also develop in the third and fourth pereonites. These are formed by oostegites – platelike expansions from the basal segments (coxae) of the appendages. The fifth to seventh pereopods function as clasping appendages. They all have propodi with two spines on their inside margins. The seventh pair of pereopods are the longest of the three pairs, followed by the sixth pereopod pair and the fifth pereopod pair.|$|E

40|$|Accumulation {{of certain}} nonmetabolizable sugar-phosphates (including -methyl glucoside- 6 -phosphate) in Escherichia coli is growth {{inhibitory}} and elicits the glucose-phosphate stress response. The transcription factor SgrR activates transcription {{of the small}} RNA SgrS under stress conditions. SgrS represses translation of mRNAs encoding sugar transporters. The sgrR and sgrS genes are located directly upstream of <b>setA,</b> and this gene organization is conserved in numerous enteric species, prompting the hypothesis that <b>SetA</b> contributes to the glucose-phosphate stress response. <b>SetA</b> is a proton motive force-driven efflux pump capable of transport-ing various sugars and sugar analogs in vitro.
