The State of Tennessee appointed commissioners during the years 1867 - 1871 to sell the delinquent railroads on which the State had <b>statutory</b> <b>liens.</b> On March 20, 1872, Joseph Jacques, agent for the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad Company, bid $23,000 for the property. A court confirmed the sale on November 18, 1873. On December 26, 1873, the railroad line was sold to W. P. Elliott, who operated the line until September 13, 1877. On that date, W. P. Elliott conveyed the property to H. M. Aiken, who operated the property until October 24, 1884. On that date, Aiken conveyed the property to the Tennessee and Ohio Railroad Company.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} broaden the legal studies on the sea loan by an {{analysis}} of the western legal tradition. It undertakes an attempt to find out whether the Roman concept of the sea loan is applicable nowadays. The revival of an ancient solution is more plausible thanks to the idea of the Project Finance and the ongoing process of the decodification of private law. The ancient legal institution of pecunia traiecticia and the modern idea of the Project Finance are good examples of the legal solutions that existed or exist outside the codified legal structure. A broad insight into the history of the sea loan shows how many different contracts were developed {{under the influence of the}} pecunia traiecticia. It was a fact in Roman law, in ius commune and in the common law tradition. The vivid development of contractual agreements concerning risky ventures: both on sea and on land was stopped, however, by the process of codification and by the rise of <b>statutory</b> <b>liens,</b> and insurance contracts. The market of risky investments has started to present a challenge to the process of codification once again in the 20 th and 21 st century. It has been driven by many soft law regulations and uncodified practical solutions. One of them is Project Finance that today seems to be the legal regulation that is the closest to the Roman sea loan. It is an uncodified way to finance and organize risky investments. The significant decentralization of legal systems in all their dimensions, or even in their breakdown into the independent systems makes the revival of pecunia traiecticia more plausible. It can be a useful, less risky alternative to the instruments of speculative investment, e. g. options contracts, forward contracts, hedge contracts, and a less complicated contract than a set of instruments used in the Project Finance. Flexibility of legal solutions used in the risky ventures, variety of legal sources and the openness to the legal tradition could make contemporary legal systems more just and effective than in the era of codification...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} stress and economic difficulties which characterized {{sectors of the}} agriculture industry during the 1980 s may continue to trouble some producers into the 1990 s {{as a result of}} drought and international competition. This report explains legal alternatives available to creditors for using a borrower's personal property to satisfy debt secured with personal property as well as unsecured debt. A debt is secured when a creditor has a lien; that is, the legal right to seize and use some of the borrower's property to pay an obligation. An unsecured debt is not accompanied with a legal right entitling the creditor to seize some of the borrower's property if the obligation is not paid. Instead, a creditor must convince a court that an amount is owed, but unpaid. The creditor will then proceed to collect payment as prescribed by statute and the court. The two most common means for a creditor to acquire a lien are 1) for the borrower to voluntarily grant a lien (a voluntary lien), and 2 } for the creditor to acquire a <b>lien</b> according to <b>statutory</b> law and without the borrower's consent. This second category of liens {{is often referred to as}} statutory, involuntarily, or nonconsensual liens. The most common <b>statutory</b> <b>liens</b> that apply to agriculture in North Dakota are the agricultural supplier's lien, agricultural processor's lien, and agister's lien (which encumbers livestock being kept or fed for their owner). The typical voluntary lien to encumber personal property is a security interest which empowers creditors to repossess the encumbered property as long as there is no breach of the peace. The alternative for creditors is to rely on the judicial proceeding of claim and delivery to seize the property. The law specifies limitations as well as protection for debtors. For example, a debtor is not relieved of an obligation even though the debtor's assets are not sufficient to pay the obligation. Likewise, a debtor cannot give away property to frustrate a creditor's collection attempts. However, a debtor is allowed to retain exempt assets; that is, those items state statutory law specifies as beyond the reach of creditors. Exempt personal property includes the family's clothing; one year's supply of provisions for the family (including fuel); a trailer, mobile home, or $ 7, 500 (substitute for a homestead); property valued between $ 5, 000 and $ 8, 000 ($ 2, 500 for a single person); a vehicle up to $ 1, 200 in value; and certain pensions, annuities, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and limited payments from specified pension programs (such as social security). Financial disputes are not limited to debtors and creditors. Creditors also compete with each other to collect their obligation from the borrower's assets. Such conflicts are resolved according to the priority of the creditors. Few financial disputes will be litigated; instead, most culminate with the parties negotiating a settlement that is preferrable to litigation. The parties must fully understand their legal rights and the likely result of litigating (including the cost and time necessary to litigate), however, in order to recognize an acceptable settlement.

5000|$|At the {{relevant}} time, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 contained provisions {{relating to the}} imposition of charges for services and facilities provided to airline operators. The legislation also created a <b>statutory</b> <b>lien</b> over aircraft to secure payment of such charges. At the time Compass went into provisional liquidation, it owed the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA, later [...] "Airservices Australia") substantial amounts in respect of charges and penalties payable in respect of the operations {{of each of the}} leased aircraft. The CAA invoked its statutory liens. Each respondent paid, under protest, the charges and penalties claimed to be owing in respect of each aircraft. Upon receipt of those payments, the CAA discharged the liens it asserted. The amounts were paid pursuant to agreements which entitled the respondents to recover the moneys, together with interest, if it were to be held that, as against the respondents, the liens did not validly secure payment of the charges, or for any reason the liens, or the charges, or both, were, in whole or in part, illegal, void or unenforceable.|$|E
40|$|Medicaid is {{the joint}} federal/state program that pays for {{long-term}} {{health care in}} a nursing home. 1 To be able to receive Medicaid benefits, an individual must meet numerous eligibility requirements but, in short, must have a very minimal level of income and assets.

40|$|The repairer’s lien {{is one of}} {{the last}} {{remaining}} at common law. Under the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, a repairer’s lien over goods takes priority over any security interest in the same goods. Due to the advent of trading on credit terms, repairers are increasingly unable to rely on a lien as a means of security. Because of the nature of their work, ordinary security interests taken by repairers are likely to lose in any priority dispute. This paper addresses two broad points within this issue. The first point considered is whether the repairer’s interests should be protected, concluding that they should be afforded a super priority similar to the current scheme. The second point considered is the nature of reform that could be undertaken, concluding that a <b>statutory</b> <b>lien</b> should be inserted into the PPSA. This lien would generally subsist in credit trading environments whilst not adversely affecting the interest of other creditors...|$|E

40|$|The City of Detroit's {{filing for}} {{municipal}} bankruptcy in July, 2013, {{has added to}} a continuing controversy of whether general obligation bondholders have a secured lien. The City of Detroit claimed its general obligation bondholders {{did not have a}} fully secured lien because the law of the state of Michigan did not create a <b>statutory</b> <b>lien.</b> Without the creation of a lien by state law, during the insolvency or bankruptcy of municipalities, general obligation bondholders will potentially have a mere promise to pay versus a binding obligation to pay, and therefore, will not have a secured lien. Treating otherwise secured general obligation bonds as unsecured will create more risk for investors and increase the cost of borrowing for cities. This article discusses the treatment of general obligation bonds in recent municipal bankruptcies; identifies the states that create a binding obligation to pay general obligation bondholders; describes problems of not treating general obligation bonds as secured; and proposes that states create clear laws that grant statutory liens for general obligation bondholders...|$|E
40|$|From {{the outset}} of Detroit’s bankruptcy, an {{unlikely}} set of issues kept coming up: What exactly is a lien? Who has a property interest or its equivalent in bankruptcy? Did general obligation bondholders have special status, due to Detroit’s promise to use its “full faith and credit” for repayment? What about Detroit’s pension beneficiaries, who could point to {{a provision in the}} Michigan Constitution stating that accrued pension benefits cannot be diminished or impaired. In this Article, I explore these and related issues that have arisen in Detroit and other recent municipal bankruptcy cases. Part I of the Article briefly compares liens and a variety of lien substitutes. In Part II, I recount the history of bankruptcy’s <b>statutory</b> <b>lien</b> provision, which honors state liens but not state priorities, and requires that the lien be good both in bankruptcy and outside of bankruptcy. My focus in Part III is the status of general obligation bonds in Detroit, a question which has turned out to have different answers for the two different types of Detroit GO bonds. In Part IV, I explore Rhode Island’s remarkable statute purporting to give a sweeping lien to GO bondholders. I then discuss the question whether pensions can be restructured in bankruptcy in Part V. I conclude that they can, and that the precise status of pension claims turns in large part on bankruptcy’s treatment of trusts...|$|E
