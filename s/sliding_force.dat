The rock mass is subjected to fail by tensile force due to their low tensile resistance strength. As a result, coseismic landslides often have high and steep head scarps.

40|$|To {{validate}} {{the design process}} and {{ensure the safety of}} an important structure with sliding supports, a finite element-based force identification technique and a strain measurement point selection procedure have been presented in part I of this paper. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed force identification technique and measurement point selection procedure are now verified in part II of this paper through numerical investigations on a steel plate support structure. The relationship between the orthogonal property of the selected measurement points and the condition number of the identification equation and the effectiveness of the sequential orthogonal searching algorithm are examined through Monte Carlo simulation. Two cases on force identification of the steel plate structure are then presented: one case concerns concentrated <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> acting either at node or inside grid, and the other case pertains uniformly distributed sliding load covering a fixed area. For both cases, the strain measurement points of fairly good orthogonal property are firstly determined using the proposed measurement point selection procedure. The positions and magnitudes of initial and final forces are then identified using the proposed force identification technique with or without measurement noise included. The identification results obtained from both cases show that the proposed force identification method can effectively locate and identify the concentrated <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> and the uniformly distributed sliding load covering a fixed area with no information required on the initial position and magnitude of the <b>sliding</b> <b>force.</b> It is also illustrated that the increase of the number of measurement points can improve the accuracy of identification results.

40|$|Surfaces are rough, unless {{special care}} {{is taken to}} make them atomically smooth. Roughness exists at all scales, and any surface-producing {{operation}} affects the roughness in certain degrees, specific to the production process. When two surfaces are brought close to each other, contact is established at many isolated locations. The number and size of these contact islands depend on the applied load, material properties of the surfaces {{and the nature of}} roughness. These contact islands affect the tribological properties of the contacting surfaces. The real contact area, which is the sum total of the area of contacting islands, is much smaller than the apparent contact area dictated by the macroscopic geometry of the contacting surfaces. Since the total load is supported by these contact islands, the local contact pressure will be very high, and dependent on the local microscopic geometry of the roughness. Thus understanding the deformation behaviour of the rough surfaces will lead to better understanding of friction and wear properties of the surfaces. In this work, the interaction of these contact islands with each other is studied when two surfaces are in contact and sliding past each other. Asperities {{can be thought of as}} basic units of roughness. The geometry and the distribution of heights of asperities can be used to define the roughness. For example, one of the earliest models of roughness is that of hemispherical asperities carrying smaller hemispherical asperities on their back, which in turn carry smaller asperities, and soon. In the present study the asperities are assumed to be of uniform size, shape and distribution. Normal and tangential loading response of these asperities with a rigid indenter is studied through elastic-plastic plane strain finite element studies. As a rigid indenter is loaded onto a surface with a regular array of identical asperities, initial contact is established at a single asperity. The plastic zone is initially confined within the asperity. When the load is increased,the elastic-plastic boundary moves towards the free surface of the asperity, and the contact pressure decreases. The geometry and spacing are determined when the neighbouring asperities come into contact. The plastic zone in these asperities is constrained, and hence contact pressure sustained by these asperities is larger. As the indentation progresses, more asperities come into contact in a similar way. If a tangential displacement is now applied to the indenter, the von Mises stress contours shift in the direction of indenter displacement. As the tangential displacement increases, the number of asperities in contact with the indenter decreases gradually before reaching a steady sliding state. The tangential <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> experienced by the indenter arises from two components. One is the frictional resistance between the contacting surfaces and the other is due to the plastic deformation of the substrate. If the surface is completely elastic, it has been seen that the <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> is purely due to the specified friction coefficient. For the smooth surface, as the subsurface makes the transition from purely elastic to confined plastic zone, plasticity breaks out on the free surface, hence the <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> increases. For surfaces with asperities, even at very small load, the asperities deform plastically and hence the <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> is considerably higher. The frictional force is experimentally measured by sliding a spherical indenter on smooth and rough surfaces. These experimental results are qualitatively compared with two dimensional finite element results. It has been observed that for rough surface, <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> is considerablyhigherthanthesmoothsurface,asisobservedinsimu-lations at lower loads.

The values of A and S are derived from shear tests, also over wide ranges of strain rate and temperature. All data were then subjected to special viscoelastic transformation.

In the past decades, researches on hydraulic mechanism and time-dependent characteristics of loose deposits failure are frequently reported, however adequate measures for reducing debris flow are not available practically. In this context, a time-dependent model was established to determine the changes of water table of loose deposits using hydraulic and topographic theories. In addition, the variation in water table with elapsed time was analyzed. The formulas for calculating hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressures on each strip and block unit of deposit were proposed, and the slope stability and failure risk of the loose deposits were assessed based on the time-dependent hydraulic characteristics of established model. Finally, the failure mechanism of deposits based on infinite slope theory was illustrated, with an example, to calculate <b>sliding</b> <b>force,</b> anti-sliding force and residual <b>sliding</b> <b>force</b> applied to each slice.

40|$|Axonemal dyneins are the {{molecular}} motors {{responsible for the}} beating of cilia and flagella. These motors generate <b>sliding</b> <b>forces</b> between adjacent microtubule doublets within the axoneme, the motile cytoskeletal structure inside the flagellum. To create regular, oscillatory beating patterns, {{the activities of the}} axonemal dyneins must be coordinated both spatially and temporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains that build up within the moving axoneme, but it is not known which components of stress or strain are involved, nor how they feed back on the dyneins. To answer this question, we used isolated, reactivate axonemes of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas as a model system. We derived a theory for beat regulation in a two-dimensional model of the axoneme. We then tested the theory by measuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes, which have asymmetric beats, and mutant axonemes, in which the beat is nearly symmetric, using high-precision spatial and temporal imaging. We found that regulation by <b>sliding</b> <b>forces</b> fails to account for the measured beat, due to the short lengths of Chlamydomonas cilia. We found that regulation by normal forces (which tend to separate adjacent doublets) cannot satisfactorily account for the symmetric waveforms of the mbo 2 mutants. This is due to the model's failure to produce reciprocal inhibition across the axes of the symmetrically beating axonemes. Finally, we show that regulation by curvature accords with the measurements. Unexpectedly, we found that the phase of the curvature feedback indicates that the dyneins are regulated by the dynamic (i. e. time-varying) component of axonemal curvature, but not by the static one. We conclude that a high-pass filtered curvature signal is a good candidate for the signal that feeds back to coordinate motor activity in the axoneme...|$|R
