40|$|Stoma {{nurses and}} their {{contribution}} to work with <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> of patients. The diploma thesis dealt {{with the cooperation of}} stoma nurses with <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> of stoma patients in ten regions of the Czech Republic. The aim was to find out if stoma nurses recognize the importance of <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> for stoma patients, how their work contributes to <b>self-help</b> <b>groups,</b> if stoma nurses cooperate with <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> and if they inform stoma patients about the existence of <b>self-help</b> <b>groups.</b> Another objective was to determine the level of significance stoma patients give to <b>self-help</b> <b>groups.</b> The goals of the work were met. The theoretical section addresses the issues of <b>self-help</b> <b>groups,</b> the history, benefits, risks, stoma nurses and their education. Cooperation between doctors, stoma nurses and the club of patients is also mentioned. The contexts of a stoma - preoperative and postoperative care, nursing care complications, the stoma aids - are involved in the conclusion of the thesis. In the practical section an investigation through qualitative in-depth interviews with stoma nurses on the base of five research questions was carried out. Do stoma nurses consider <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> important {{in the life of a}} stoma patient? What information do stoma patients ask for when stoma nurses participate in self help groups? What is the cooperation of stoma nurses with <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> in individual regions? Do stoma patients take part in activities within <b>self-help</b> <b>groups?</b> Which age groups of patients, according to stoma nurses´ opinion, prefer to work in <b>self-help</b> <b>groups?</b> On the basis of a qualitative research hypotheses were established for a quantitative investigation. This quantitative research survey through questionnaires was conducted in patients with a stoma, also in ten regions. H 1 : Stoma nurses recognize the importance of <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> for patients with a stoma. H 2 : Stoma nurses cooperate with <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> of stoma patients. H 3 : Stoma nurses inform stoma patients about <b>self-help</b> <b>groups.</b> H 4 : The biggest benefit of stoma nurses for stoma patients in <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> is giving information about the use of aids. H 5 : Stoma patients consider <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> very important. All hypotheses were confirmed. Stoma nurses as well as stoma patients consider <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> very important in their lives. Currently stoma nurses cooperate with <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> in all regions, they inform new stoma patients about opportunities to take part in <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> and do not forget to give advice about aids and stoma nursing, which is the most valuable information for the stoma patient especially at the beginning of treatment. The results were consistent in both investigations and will be offered to individual stoma nurses for improvement of mutual cooperation. And in the regions where <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> do not exist yet or are being established, I firmly believe that the results of this thesis will help in <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> activities. The research survey has proved that the stoma nurses´ work is meaningful owing to its results and goals. Stoma nurses have a large share of the <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> work...|$|R

2500|$|Beath was {{diagnosed}} with autism {{at the age of}} four in 1964, thanks to the persistence of his mother who knew he wasn't simply [...] "retarded" [...] (as it was expressed {{in the language of the}} day). She took him to see Dr Kenneth Soddy and followed his programme for autistic children which emphasised inclusive and stimulating activities with trusted family members such as singing, talking, reading aloud and imaginative play and a reduction in the time he was allowed to spend in solitary activities. Within eighteen months he was speaking and enjoying play with children he knew but remained shy and confused when confronted with children unknown to him or in a setting outside his home. As an adult, he became an advocate for those living with autism and frequently gave talks about his life and living with the syndrome. He was an active participant, supporter and speaker of Autonomy Shropshire (a <b>self-help</b> <b>group</b> based in Shropshire for young people and adults with high ability autism) and Autism Cymru. For several years, he was an advisor to the board on autism spectrum disorders for Autistica.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, {{a member}} of a feminist {{reproductive}} health <b>self-help</b> <b>group,</b> Lorraine Rothman, modified equipment found in an underground abortion clinic that was developed for a new non-traumatic, manually-operated-suction abortion technique. Rothman took the thin, flexible plastic Karman cannula (about the size of a soda straw), and the syringe (50 or 60ml), and added a one-way bypass valve, to fix two main problems. The contraption could prevent air from being pumped into the uterus, and also suctioned uterine contents directly into the syringe, thus limiting the amount that could be removed. Rothman's and Downer's group dubbed the new invention the [...] "Del Em." [...] Rothman added two lengths of clear plastic tubing, one from the cannula to the collection jar and another to go from the collection jar to the syringe. With this new set-up, the contents of the uterus went directly into the jar, allowing for the extraction of more material, and the two-way bypass valve diverted any air that may have been inadvertently pushed back toward the body to exit harmlessly into the air; this would prevent air from entering the uterus. By making it possible for more than one person to operate the device, the skill level of the operators was greatly reduced. One person could concentrate on guiding the sterile cannula through the vaginal cavity into the cervical os while another could pump the syringe to develop the vacuum. The Del Em made the procedure more comfortable, with personal control of the suction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{the debate}} on 'Third options' for health care {{delivery}} in low- and middle-income countries it is proposed that self-help should play a larger role. Self-help is expected to contribute towards improving population health outcomes and reducing government health care expenditure. We review scope and limitations of <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> in Europe and South Asia and assess their potential role in health care {{within the context of}} health sector reform. <b>Self-help</b> <b>groups</b> are voluntary unions of peers, formed for mutual assistance in accomplishing a health-related purpose. In Europe, <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> developed out of dissatisfaction with a de-personalised health care system. They successfully complement existing social and health services but cannot be instrumentalized to improve health outcomes while reducing health expenditure. In South Asia, with its hierarchical society, instrumental approaches towards self-help prevail in Non-governmental Organizations and government. The utility of this approach is limited as <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> are unlikely to be sustainable and effective when steered from outside. <b>Self-help</b> <b>groups</b> are typical for individualistic societies with developed health care systems – they are less suitable for hierarchical societies with unmet demand for regulated health care. We conclude that <b>self-help</b> <b>groups</b> can help to achieve some degree of synergy between health care providers and users but cannot be prescribed to partially replace government health services in low-income countries, thereby reducing health care expenditure and ensuring equity in health care. </p...|$|R
