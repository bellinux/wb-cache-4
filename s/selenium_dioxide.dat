5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves {{the extraction of}} <b>selenium</b> <b>dioxide</b> from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce <b>selenium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step).

40|$|Interstitial water {{profiles}} of SeO 42 −, SeO 32 −, SO 42 −, and Cl− in anoxic sediments indicated {{removal of the}} seleno-oxyanions by a near-surface process unrelated to sulfate reduction. In sediment slurry experiments, a complete reductive removal of SeO 42 − occurred under anaerobic conditions, was more rapid with H 2 or acetate, and was inhibited by O 2, NO 3 −, MnO 2, or autoclaving but not by SO 42 − or FeOOH. Oxidation of acetate in sediments could be coupled to selenate but not to molybdate. Reduction of selenate to elemental selenium {{was determined to be}} the mechanism for loss from solution. Selenate reduction was inhibited by tungstate and chromate but not by molybdate. A small quantity of the elemental selenium precipitated into sediments from solution could be resolublized by oxidation with either nitrate or FeOOH, but not with MnO 2. A bacterium isolated from estuarine sediments demonstrated selenate-dependent growth on acetate, forming elemental <b>selenium</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> as respiratory end products. These results indicate that dissimilatory selenate reduction to elemental selenium is the major sink for selenium oxyanions in anoxic sediments. In addition, they suggest application as a treatment process for removing selenium oxyanions from wastewaters and also offer an explanation for the presence of selenite in oxic waters...|$|R
50|$|Mercury is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most notorious metal pollutants present in food, water, air and soil, but the process of eliminating it is limited. Heavy metals such as mercury are formed on the earth's crust and made into solutions with ground water through certain natural processing and pH changes occurring in the soil. There are traditional methods that are used to extract mercury from the natural water sources and industrial waste water, such as chemical precipitation, amalgamation, reverse osmosis, membrane filtration and photochemical methods. However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a nanofiltration technology that overcomes all of these issues. Nanofiltration technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized. Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as <b>selenium</b> NPs, manganese <b>dioxide</b> nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube−silverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials. Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water.|$|R
