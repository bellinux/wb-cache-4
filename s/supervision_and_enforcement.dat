40|$|Hate {{crimes are}} {{informal}} social control mechanisms utilized in stratified societies to police relative identity boundaries (Perry, 2009). No research has, however, located racially-motivated hate crimes {{as a form}} of racialized social control. Considering the long history of racial violence and racialized social control in the United States, the war on drugs, the post- 9 / 11 socio-political context, immigration reforms, and increased attention to racialized police violence, it becomes important to explore the spectrum of racialized social control. In order to do so, this study introduces racially-motivated hate crimes as an informal mechanism of racialized social control. As such, this study engages an explorative and comparative analysis of reported racially-motivated hate crime rates, correctional <b>supervision</b> rates, <b>and</b> immigration <b>enforcement</b> rates in the United Stated of America. The findings capture the continued anti-Black racism, the complicated racialization and criminalization of Latinos, and a drastic intensification in the social control of Muslims, ‘Muslim-looking’ Arabs, and Middle Easterners post 9 / 11. The mirroring of hate crime trends against patterns of correctional <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> immigration <b>enforcement</b> illustrates the broad spectrum of racialized social control. Specifically, racially-motivated hate crimes are an informal mechanism of racialized social control that supplements formal and semi-formal control mechanisms...|$|R

However, poaching records have {{raised questions about}} the extent of compliance to the fishing moratorium. We compiled data of commercial landings figuring in official reports as well as episodes of apprehensions of illegal catches by environmental police. According to reports, national catches declined seventy percent after the moratorium establishment, with an average of 393 tons per year of poaching between 2003 and 2011. Although poachers are occasionally caught during environmental police raids along Brazilian coast, in Pará State catches are reported to continue and poachers have targeted aggregations. Data from those episodes do not reflect the real number of poaching, which is believed to be much higher, once fisher process fishes before landings to confuse the <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> weak <b>enforcement</b> efforts. As management strategies, we recommend the continuity of the fishing moratorium, besides increase in surveillance <b>and</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The choice of priority areas for concentration of goliath grouper conservation efforts may be an effective approach...|$|R

The PCAOB {{decision}} makes the validity of good-cause removal protections depend on the separation of adjudicative from policymaking <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> functions within the agency.

In PCAOB, the demand for political <b>supervision</b> over rulemaking <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> trumped Congress's choice to preserve the independence of officials who perform those roles and also adjudicate. In that way, PCAOB reversed the consistent constitutional validation of good-cause removal protections for those who engage in adjudication. While PCAOB might well be confined to two (or greater) levels of good-cause removal protection, {{it has the potential}} to restructure the constitutional footing for agencies with a single level of good-cause removal protection, preserving that protection for dedicated adjudicators but casting it aside for agencies with more than just adjudicative functions...|$|R

Resources must be devoted to keep 13 separate securities regulators operating in Canada. This is inefficient since each jurisdiction dedicates a different level of resources to securities regulation, which causes the intensity of policy development, <b>supervision,</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> activities to vary across Canada. In addition, most efforts are duplicative, which results in unnecessary costs, overstaffing, and delays.

5000|$|A {{controlled}} {{border is}} a border that allows {{movement of people}} between different jurisdictions but places restrictions and sometimes significant restrictions on this movement. This type of border may require a person crossing this border to obtain a visa {{or in some cases}} may allow a short period of visa free travel in the new jurisdiction. A controlled border always has some method of documenting and recording people movements across the border for later tracking and checking compliance with any conditions associated with the visa or any other border crossing conditions. A controlled border places limitations on what a person crossing the border can do in the new jurisdiction, this is usually manifested in limitations on employment and also it limits the length of time the person can legally remain in the new jurisdiction. A controlled border often requires some type of barrier, such as a river, ocean or fence to ensure that the border controls are not bypassed so that any people wishing to cross the border are directed to authorized border crossing points where any border crossing conditions can be properly monitored. Given the large scale movement of people today for work, holidays, study and other reasons a controlled border also requires internal checks and internal enforcement within the jurisdiction to ensure that any people who have entered the jurisdiction are in fact complying with any border crossing conditions and that they are not overstaying to reside illegally or as an undocumented resident. [...] Most international borders are by legislative intent of the controlled border type. However, where {{there is a lack of}} adequate internal enforcement or where the borders are land borders, the border is often controlled only on part of the border, while other parts of the border may remain open to such an extent that it may be considered an open border due to lack of <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement.</b>|$|E

Some peculiarities of the international environment make it difficult to replicate this structure, and this may explain why recent large-scale rescue packages have worked less than satisfactorily. However, private contingent credit facilities and IMF lending into arrears in the context of internationally-sanctioned, temporary moratoria on foreign debt, may offer some scope for effective, though limited in aims and resources, international liquidity support.

After almost 82 years, a national policy was launched by the Government on January 2004 to assist in the comprehensive development of the cooperative movement. The National Cooperative Policy (NCP) will ensure that the huge resources of the cooperatives can be harnessed to generate and contribute to the economic growth of the country. However, in the light of many issues such as weak structure and the absence of good corporate governance in some cooperatives, the present Cooperative Act 1993 is being reviewed and several new provisions would be added to increase <b>supervision,</b> monitoring <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> against existing cooperatives in Malaysia. It is quite imperative that by regulating the operation of cooperatives will require also the managing of intellectual and human capital assets that exist in the movement.

The sharing of knowledge among the cooperatives will eventually produce better and more educated human resources that are able to experience greater control over the works and the administration of their quality working life. Structural analysis of the cooperative movement indicates the significant influence of knowledge management in sustaining its future growth given the timely introduction of the NCP. Thus, measures taken to underline this influence will also be addressed to represent the cooperative movement's readiness to face economic {{and business}} challenges in Malaysia...|$|R
