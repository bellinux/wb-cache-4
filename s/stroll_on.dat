500|$|Many of the Cuban {{musicians who}} {{featured}} on the album were at their musical prime in the 1940s and 1950s. After {{the success of the}} 1997 record they became known in Cuba as [...] "Los Superabuelos" [...] (the Super-Grandfathers). Juan de Marcos González, a Cuban folk revivalist who was younger than the bulk of performers introduced Cooder to veteran singer Ibrahim Ferrer. Ferrer (1927–2005) had been lead vocalist for bandleader Pacho Alonso, and also sang for Beny Moré, Cuba's most prominent performer in the 1940s, before his soft singing style fell out of fashion. Having found the semi-retired seventy-year-old Ferrer taking his daily <b>stroll</b> <b>on</b> the streets of Havana and shining shoes for extra money, González signed him up for the project. Cooder later described the discovery as something that happens [...] "perhaps once in your life", and Ferrer as [...] "the Cuban Nat King Cole". Ferrer became a prominent member of the group, and the success of the record was attributed in part to the popularity of his vocal performances. The singer went on to record a number of successful solo albums and performed with contemporary acts such as the Gorillaz before his death in 2005 at the age of 78.|$|E

500|$|The park's attractions include {{naturalized}} plantings {{that are}} inspired by the landscape that grew on the disused tracks, and views {{of the city and}} the Hudson River. The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts, swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. [...] "By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through," [...] said landscape architect James Corner, [...] "almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to <b>stroll</b> <b>on,</b> and the planting...." [...] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon. Ipê timber for the built-in benches has come from a managed forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to ensure sustainable use and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources, and fragile ecosystems. According to James Corner Field Operations, the High Line's design [...] "is characterized by an intimate choreography of movement." ...|$|E
