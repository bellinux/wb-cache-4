5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest. The <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> divided into two parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds food, and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> more acidic than {{that of any other}} vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the <b>stomach)</b> <b>is</b> more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to achieve a stomach-selective gene {{transfer}} following the administration of naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) onto the gastric serosal surface in mice. Gene expression in the stomach and other tissues was evaluated by firefly luciferase activity. Six hours after gastric serosal surface instillation of naked pDNA, high gene expression in the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> observed. On the contrary, intravenous and intraperitoneal injection of naked pDNA exhibited no detectable gene expression. Following instillation of naked pDNA onto the gastric serosal surface, gene expression in the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> significantly higher than in other tissues. Gene expression in the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> highest 12 h after the instillation and thereafter decreased gradually. Utilizing a glass-made diffusion cell that is able to limit the contact dimension between the gastric serosal surface and the naked pDNA solution administered, site-specific gene expression in the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> achieved. This novel gene transfer method is expected to be a safe and effective treatment against serious stomach diseases...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{reported}} {{two cases}} of aberrant pancreas in the stomach. Out of 2, 430 cases who were examined with gastrocamera, two cases of aberrant pancreas in the <b>stomach</b> <b>were</b> found. Case 1 was a 31 year-old male. Case 2 was 41 year-old female. They were diagnosed radiologically and endoscopically as submucosal tumor of the <b>stomach</b> and <b>were</b> gastrectomyzed. The resected specimens were diagnosed histologically as aberrant pancreas.

40|$|The {{structural}} characterization {{and function}} of the stomach in the omnivore Pygocentrus nattereri were described using light and scanning electron microscopy. The sac-like <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> morphologically divided into the cardiac and pyloric regions. The histological structure of the stomach consisted of four layers of the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa. The superficial epithelium of the cardiac <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> lined with columnar epithelial cells and the glandular epithelium contained numerous gastric glands. Gastric glands were completely absent in the pyloric portion. The mucosal surface of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> a meshwork of various folds, provided with oval or rounded columnar epithelial cells which were densely packed with short, stubby microvilli. The occasional presence of conspicuous gastric pits was surrounded by epithelial cells. The localization and chemical nature of acid and neutral mucins in the various cells of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> studied by employing combined the Alcian Blue-Periodic Acid Schiff (AB-PAS) technique. The deposition of glycogen was detected in the gastric glands {{as well as in}} the epithelial lining of the stomach. The utmost reactions for protein and tryptophan were recorded in the gastric glands of mucosa. The cellular organization and histochemical characterization of the <b>stomach</b> <b>are</b> discussed in relation to the feeding and digestion of the fish concerned...|$|R
25|$|When the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> empty, ghrelin is secreted. When the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> stretched, {{secretion}} stops.

30|$|In the laboratory, {{we used a}} {{stereomicroscope}} {{to examine}} the stomach contents. Certain morphologically indistinct materials (e.g., algae and detritus) were observed with a light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2, Göttingen, Germany). All <b>stomach</b> contents <b>were</b> identified to the lowest taxon possible. The composition of the <b>stomach</b> contents <b>was</b> analyzed according to the methods of Hyslop (1980) and presented as volume percentage (V%). The V% of each food item in the fish <b>stomachs</b> <b>was</b> visually assessed as follows: <b>stomach</b> contents <b>were</b> compressed on a 1 [*]×[*] 1  mm grid slide to a uniform depth of 1  mm, and the areas of each food item were calculated. As part of {{the identification of the}} food items, we designated decomposed organic matter with no green pigment or cellulose as detritus (Adams 1976). Fish with empty <b>stomachs</b> <b>were</b> excluded from analyses.|$|R
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (bloat) is {{a common}} condition in dogs in which the stomach fills with gas, and can become torsed. This requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent necrosis of the stomach wall and death of the dog. During surgery, the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> deflated and put back into its normal position. A gastropexy may be performed, whereby the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> attached to the body wall to prevent this condition from recurring. A splenectomy or partial gastrectomy may also be required.|$|E
25|$|Treatment usually {{involves}} resuscitation with intravenous fluid therapy, usually {{a combination of}} isotonic fluids and hypertonic saline or a colloidal solution such as hetastarch, and emergency surgery. The <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> initially decompressed by passing a stomach tube, or if that is not possible, trocars can be passed through the skin into the stomach to remove the gas, alternatively the trocars may be inserted directly into the stomach following anaesthesia {{in order to reduce}} the chances of infection. During surgery, the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> placed back into its correct position, the abdomen is examined for any devitalized tissue (especially the stomach and spleen). A partial gastrectomy may be necessary if there is any necrosis of the stomach wall.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} by parasympathetic (stimulant) and sympathetic (inhibitor) plexuses (networks {{of blood vessels}} and nerves in the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior, celiac and myenteric), which regulate both the secretory activity of the stomach and the motor (motion) activity of its muscles.|$|E

50|$|Deep-frozen <b>stomachs</b> <b>are</b> milled and {{put into}} an enzyme-extracting solution. The crude rennet extract is then {{activated}} by adding acid; the enzymes in the <b>stomach</b> <b>are</b> produced in an inactive form and are activated by the stomach acid. The acid is then neutralized and the rennet extract is filtered in several stages and concentrated until reaching a typical potency of about 1:15,000; meaning 1 g of extract can coagulate 15 kg of milk.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{biological}} investigation of important demersal fish species, <b>stomachs</b> have <b>been</b> taken from cod, haddock, saithe {{and a few other}} species in 1982 and 1983. Also observations of <b>stomachs</b> have <b>been</b> made in the field. Some of the data from this sampling programme are presented in this paper. Data have been collected in spring, when the spawning of cod and herring take place and in summer. The <b>stomachs</b> have <b>been</b> preserved one by one together with data on each individual fish. In 1982 the <b>stomachs</b> <b>were</b> mainly put on formalin but in 1983 they were frozen. Data collected together with the <b>stomachs</b> <b>are</b> length, weight, age, sex and maturity. For cod also an index describing them as coastal or oceanic type have been given by otolitt readings. The <b>stomach</b> content have <b>been</b> analyzed for important prey groups.

25|$|Gastroscopy, or {{endoscopic}} {{evaluation of}} the <b>stomach,</b> <b>is</b> useful in chronic cases of colic suspected {{to be caused by}} gastric ulcers, gastric impactions, and gastric masses. A 3-meter scope is required to visualize the stomach of most horses, and the horse must be fasted prior to scoping.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} radiographs {{can be used}} to examine the stomach for various disorders. This will often include the use of a swallow barium. Another method of {{examination}} of the <b>stomach,</b> <b>is</b> the use of an endoscope. A gastric emptying scan is considered the gold standard to assess gastric emptying rate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> tubular in shape, with {{multiple}} diverticula extending throughout the body.

50|$|The vagal afferents are {{activated}} {{during the}} gastric phase of digestion when the corpus and fundus of the <b>stomach</b> <b>are</b> distended {{secondary to the}} entry of a food bolus. The stimulation of the mechanical receptors located in the gastric mucosa stimulates the vagus afferents. The completion of the reflex circuit by vagus efferents leads to the stimulation of postganglionic muscarinic nerves. These nerves release acetylcholine to stimulate two end effects. One, the parietal cells {{in the body of}} the <b>stomach</b> <b>are</b> stimulated to release H+. Two, the ECL cells of the lamina propria of the body of the <b>stomach</b> <b>are</b> stimulated to release histamine. Vagal stimulation of the peptidergic neurons, occurring simultaneously, leads to the release of gastrin-releasing-peptide. Finally, the Delta cells are inhibited to reduce the inhibition of gastrin release.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to obtain and compare the two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasonographic images of pathological conditions of the stomach in dogs in clinical cases. Materials and Methods: In our study, 12 clinical conditions of the <b>stomach</b> <b>were</b> recorded using ultrasonography. The ultrasound machine used for this study was 3 D ultrasound machine (Nemio-XG: Toshiba, Japan) having four-dimensional volumetric transducer. Results: Present study was done to compare 2 D and 3 D ultrasonographic images in different gastric affections in dogs. In case of uremic gastropathy due to inflammatory response, the wall of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> 0. 6 cm thick and hyperechoic and gastric folds were also hyperechoic indicative of gastritis. In second, third, and fourth case of gastritis the wall of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> 0. 7, 0. 6, and 0. 55 cm, respectively thick and hyperechoic. In fifth and sixth case of gastritis, inflammatory response due to ingestion of polythene and sand led to gastritis and ultrasonographically, the wall of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> 0. 6 cm and 0. 7 cm thick, respectively, and hyperechoic. In case of gastric ulcer, ultrasonographically, there was a disruption of gastric mucosal layer. In cases of gastric dilatation, anechoic content indicating fluid <b>was</b> seen in <b>stomach</b> area and due to dilatation boundary of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> not clear and the increase in the lumen of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> observed. In case of foreign body, ultrasonographically the wall of the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> 0. 55 cm thick and hyperechoic. In the middle of the stomach, multiple hyperechoic shadows of the foreign bodies i. e. leather and bunch of straw of grass were observed. In case of pyloric stenosis ultrasonographically, anechoic lumen of the pylorus surrounded by 0. 5 cm hypoechoic thickened muscle. In some cases, 3 D ultrasonography was not diagnostic i. e. gastric foreign bodies and gastric dilatation. These conditions were better visualized on the 2 D sonogram. Conclusion: The appearance of clinical conditions of the stomach such as gastritis and pyloric stenosis were more distinct on 3 D ultrasonogram than 2 D ultrasonogram. The 3 D ultrasonography was not diagnostic in cases of gastric foreign bodies and gastric dilatation...|$|R
25|$|In {{birds and}} crocodilians, the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into two}} regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and {{connecting}} the true stomach to the crop. Beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} many other animals, the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> located between the {{oesophagus}} and the small intestine. It secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum where peristalsis takes over to move this {{through the rest of}} the intestines.|$|E
25|$|There are {{additional}} {{factors contributing to}} protection from pathogen invasion. For example, low pH (ranging from 1 to 4) of the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> fatal for many microorganisms that enter it. Similarly, mucus (containing IgA antibodies) neutralizes many pathogenic microorganisms. Other factors in the GI tract contribution to immune function include enzymes secreted in the saliva and bile.|$|E
