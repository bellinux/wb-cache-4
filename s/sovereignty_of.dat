5|$|For {{a period}} of time the French ceded <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the island of Saint Barthélemy to the Swedes but it was {{eventually}} returned. Saint Barthélemy (1785–1878) was operated as a porto Franco (free port). The capital city of Gustavia retains its Swedish name.|$|E
5|$|Since Johor {{could not}} have ceded Singapore island and the islets in its {{vicinity}} to the British if it lacked title to them, this was evidence that the United Kingdom recognised the prior and continuing <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the Johor Sultanate over all islands {{in and around the}} Singapore Strait.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the central}} {{concepts}} of modern political philosophy. However, faced with processes of economic globalization {{as well as}} legal and political universalism, contemporary political theory struggles {{to account for the}} exercise of state power in terms of the traditional understanding <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> This survey article reviews the most influential conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in contemporary continental political philosophy. These include Schmitt’s defense <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and Agamben’s rejection of sovereign politics {{as well as a number}} of theoretical attempts to account for the complexities <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and its adaptation to new political circumstances...|$|R
5|$|British <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> {{several of}} the {{overseas}} territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: Gibraltar is claimed by Spain, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are claimed by Argentina, and the British Indian Ocean Territory is claimed by Mauritius and Seychelles. The British Antarctic Territory is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and Chile, while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said {{that there would be no}} further talks over the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Malta has a {{long and}} rich history, and this is {{reflected}} in the island's cultural attractions. The Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans and the Byzantines have all occupied Malta at some point in history, leaving a mix of many different architectural styles and artifacts to explore. The <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the Knights Hospitaller over Malta from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout Malta. The country's modern museums and art galleries feature relics from Malta's history for tourists and Maltese residents alike to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Relations with Singapore took a dive {{after the}} International Court of Justice ruled in Singapore's favour {{following}} a long legal {{battle over the}} <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> Pedra Branca. At the inaugural session of the 12th Johor State Assembly in 2008, the Sultan stated his stand on Malaysia's sovereignty over Pedra Branca, and vowed to find legal means to retrieve the island's sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, {{and have}} caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office named a {{previously}} unnamed area Queen Elizabeth Land {{in tribute to}} Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim. Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the nearby Falkland Islands, and the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical account of Agamben’s {{understanding of the}} logic <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and <b>of</b> the notion bare life, particularly Agamben’s approach to the paradox <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> {{and its relation to}} Aristotle’s metaphysical category of potentiality. With regards to bare life, it brings together an analysis of the figure of the homo sacer with an account of Agamben’s use of paradigms as methodological tools. The first part of the paper argues that Agamben ontologises sovereignty by dramatising the paradox of its structure as im-potentiality. The second part claims that even though an account of Agamben’s methodology serves to respond to the different critiques that his notion of bare life has raised, Agamben’s notions <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and <b>of</b> bare life ultimately rely on Schmitt’s decisionism...|$|R
5|$|The U.S. {{position}} that the Baltic states had been forcibly annexed would remain its official stance for the following 51 years. Subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions reaffirmed {{the substance of the}} Declaration. President Dwight D. Eisenhower asserted the right of the Baltic states to independence in an address to the United States Congress on January 6, 1957. After confirming the Helsinki Final Act in July 1975, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution that the Final Act would not affect the continuity of U.S. recognition of the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> Baltic states.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the American Indian {{nations to}} a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. {{citizens}} and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland {{and made a}} peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. The reconciliation led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and interregnum of 1917–1919 {{gave way to the}} Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|When General Andrew Jackson {{tried and}} {{executed}} two British agents during the First Seminole War in Spanish-held Florida, it precipitated the Great Seminole Debate of 1818–1819 in Congress, with some claiming he exceeded his orders from President James Monroe and demanding his censure. Floyd, however, supported Jackson's actions, maintaining he had acted {{according to precedent}} and his orders. He also denied the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> the Seminole tribes.|$|E
5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E

5|$|During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin {{assassination}} plots, {{including the}} Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also {{known as the}} Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, {{even though he had}} not been involved in the plot. Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|His {{relations}} with Temenggong Daing Ibrahim remained strained; in 1860, Sultan Ali allowed a Bugis adventurer, Suliwatang, the chiefs of Rembau and Sungei Ujong {{to settle in}} Muar and prepare themselves for an attack on Johor. Such bad blood between the Sultan and Temenggong Daing Ibrahim passed down to the Temenggong's son, Abu Bakar, who succeeded his father after the former died in 1862. Shortly after Abu Bakar became the Temenggong of Johor, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali to reassert of Johor's sovereignty over Segamat. Continued disputes over the <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> Segamat led to an outbreak of a war between the Temenggong's men with the Sultan's. Eleven years later in 1873, attempts made by Suliwatang to collect custom taxes from inhabitants at the Muar estuary led to further conflict with Abu Bakar's (who became Maharaja in 1868) men.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} {{perpetual}} cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E

40|$|The {{sovereignty}} notion {{has been}} examined by various scientific studies within centuries.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this project}} is to revisit and reconsider the central concept <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> within International Relations. From a social, historical and discourse-embedded standpoint, it will {{be argued that the}} known conception and narrative <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> as tied to the Westphalian nation state, comprises only one definition of several other autonomous uprising and contesting loci <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in our contemporary transforming and globalised world. Thus, the concept <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> as inherently bound to a demarcated territory and authority of the nation state needs reconsideration in the aim of exploring more suitable ways to describe and conceptualise emerging non-state agency and polities in our current globalised world order. Deconstructing sovereignty into the elements of territory, population, authority and recognition provides a useful framework for understanding the significance of transnational non-state polities’ claim to sovereignty. An examination the <b>sovereignty</b> claim <b>of</b> the Inuit Circumpolar Council, functions as an empirical example, possibly indicating new ways in which transnational and non-state polities are altering known conceptions <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> within International Relations. The Inuit Circumpolar Council’s claim to sovereignty consequently exhibit how the concept <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is best understood as transformative by nature rather than static or insignificant...|$|R
