As Leclerc laid dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap be killed by drowning them in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, simply killing everybody who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15, 000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned so that no-one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing {{that most of his}} army in St. Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French only held Port-au-Prince, Le Cap and Les Cayes sent about 20, 000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> planning on doing to them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given, and the Haitians were just as brutal as the French, as they burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied to a board and sawed them into two. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.|$|E
500|$|When Campbell's advance {{companies}} spotted Howe's {{line around}} 2:00 pm, {{the main body}} stopped short {{of the field and}} Campbell went to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up against. [...] He viewed Howe's defenses as essentially sound, but a local slave told him that there was a path through the swamp on Howe's right. [...] Campbell ordered Sir James Baird to take 350 light infantry and 250 New York Loyalists and follow the slave through the swamp, while he arrayed his troops just out of view {{in a way that would}} give the impression he would attempt a flanking maneuver on Howe's left. [...] One of his officers climbed a tree to observe Baird's progress. [...] True to the slave's word, the trail came out near the Continental barracks, which had been left unguarded; the Continentals were unaware they had been flanked. [...] When they reached position, the man in the tree signaled by waving his hat, and Campbell ordered the regulars to charge.|$|E
500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was {{a breath of fresh}} air. I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. He brought a lot to the table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale. In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as [...] "an incredible talent." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jacinta {{smiled at}} him. [...] "I have," [...] she said, [...] "one or two {{faithful}} servants. Shall we move a little nearer and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy Skunk hitched up his {{trousers}} and {{started toward the}} Lone Little Path. [...] "Come on!" [...] said he. [...] "Let's follow him and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{look into}} the window and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing," [...] {{suggested}} Dick uneasily, for {{he could not get}} it out of his head but that his brother's guess might be correct.|$|R
2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed! nor ever will;--unless it be a fault {{to love a}} {{woman as}} <b>he</b> loves me. <b>See</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing now,--where <b>he</b> has gone,--what he has to suffer, coupled as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> with that wretch! And all for my sake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if he does}} it {{any more}} I shall {{certainly}} {{let him know that}} I <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> about. <b>He</b> has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked no longer, but hunched his shoulders, {{holding his}} elbows stiff, that none might <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> feeling. Behind him a man said: ...|$|E

6000|$|Deering nodded. [...] "Stannard {{sent them}} back and pushed ahead with Gillane {{to look for a}} line down the other side. When we get across we'll <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up against." ...|$|E

60|$|I didn't {{go around}} to-day {{with the others}} to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing. I will {{do that in a}} quiet time, when there is not {{anything}} going on, and when I shall not be called upon to deliver intemperate compliments on a railroad in which I own no stock.|$|R
50|$|The King of Castille {{apparently}} wants Elvira, Queen of León, {{to marry}} his brother, Don Sebastian, and, {{because it has}} been rumoured that Sebastian will enter her kingdom in disguise, she has in turn disguised herself as a peasant girl (and her attendant, Carmen, is disguised as a peasant boy) in order to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> like.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the fellow}} {{must have gone}} out {{a good deal more}} quietly than you did, because I didn't hear him. I suppose you felt you had to get after him and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{stood at}} the door. Now that she had carried out her preposterous impulse to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> like, she was cold, she was as ready to detect familiarities as the virtuous Miss Ella Stowbody.|$|E

6000|$|Billy Mink {{just had}} to laugh. The idea of great big Buster Bear getting drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny.

[...] "Let's go <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing," [...] said Billy Mink.|$|R
6000|$|Releasing each other, they crept to the door, {{opened it}} softly, and peeped out. It was a cloudy night, {{and the black}} shadow of the Mounds made the dark yard darker.

6000|$|... 'Are {{you talking}} about my having gone with him to see some sights? I see nothing wrong in that.

6000|$|... [217] Velleius Paterculus, lib. ii., ca. xiv.

60|$|The millman here {{looked around}} at the log which he was then sawing, and he {{observed}} {{that it was time for}} him to attend to it.
