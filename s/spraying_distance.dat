The results showed that the <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> greatly affects the microhardness, adhesion, and crystallinity of the sprayed HA coatings. Microhardness value was increased as the <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> was decreased, mainly due to the formation of dense coating with lower porosity.

X-Ray diffraction was carried out on all coatings by using Bragg-Brentano geometry. The phases identified in the as-supplied powder Cr 3 C 2 /Ni-Cr were fcc Ni-Cr and orthorhombic Cr 3 C 2. In contrast to the original powder, the coatings showed evidence of Cr 3 C 2, Ni-Cr and either Cr 6. 2 C 3. 5 N 0. 3 or Cr 3 C 1. 52 N 0. 48 carbo-nitride phases depending on the ratio of C/N in the coating. The presence of Cr 7 C 3 and CrO 2 was also identified in the coatings deposited at atmospheric pressure. The volume fraction of carbide plus nitride phase in the coating was always less than the volume fractions of the carbide phase in the original feed stock powder. The volume fraction of carbide plus nitride phase was found to depend quite markedly on the spraying parameters such as pressure, power input, <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> and substrate cooling. The results have been presented in terms of spraying efficiency, ξ. The highest value of ξ (86. 4 %) was obtained for coatings produced at 1200 mbar pressure, a <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> of 120 mm, without N 2 cooling and the lowest value (25. 2 %) was found for the coatings deposited at 300 mbar for the same <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> but with N 2 cooling. The presence of graphitic carbon was detected in all samples especially for specimens where the fraction of carbide plus carbo-nitride phases was the greatest. The influence of spraying parameters such as pressure, power input, <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> and substrate cooling on the microstructure was determined.

40|$|For a {{thermally}} sprayed coating, {{a strong}} adhesion between the coating and the substrate {{is critical for}} its service performance. Furthermore, the adhesion between the coating and the substrate is mainly controlled by the splat-substrate adhesion.

40|$|Abstract. Thermal sprayed WC-based {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used in modern industry, especially in excellent wear-resistant-demanding fields, due to their high hardness and superior mechanical properties. WC-Co is a typical representative of the coatings, usually used as the protective layers of shaft, pump sleeve intine, etc. WC-Co coatings were prepared on low carbon steel substrate using {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} (HVOF) technology, under different distance ranging from 160 to 240 mm. The influence of the <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> on coating hardness was investigated and discussed. The results reveal that, the cross-sectional hardness of the HVOF WC-Co coatings depend not only on the <b>spraying</b> <b>distance,</b> but also on the indentation position. The average microhardness for all the coatings was obviously enhanced. The highest one (1793. 6 Hv) was produced with a distance of 240 mm.

Coatings were characterised in terms of microstructure and mechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) by nanoindentation. All coatings displayed a two-zone microstructure formed by partially melted areas containing nanometre or submicrometre-sized particles surrounded by fully melted areas. These partially melted areas strongly increased as standoff distance lengthened. Mechanical properties worsened with <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> increase.

The <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> and the substrate temperature during deposition were also varied. Sliding wear tests were performed against WC- 6 % Co balls using a pin-on-disc tribometer. The highest sliding wear resistance was obtained for the samples processed at a pressure of 1200 mbar, a <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> of 120 mm and substrate heating to 600 °C, for which an average value for the specific wear coefficient, k, of 5. 72 E- 07 mm 3 /N m was determined. An increase in the <b>spraying</b> <b>distance</b> from 120 to 140 mm, keeping all the other parameters constant produced an increase in the wear volume of 33 %. However, for the same spraying pressure and distance, cooling the substrate resulted in an increase in the wear volume of nearly 1125 % when compared to the coating produced with optimum conditions. In addition, a decrease in wear resistance of 83 % occurred when the pressure was varied between 1200 to 300 mbar, which was attributed to a decrease in the carbide deposition efficiency, ξ, defined as the relationship between the (Cr 3 C 2) coating/(Cr 3 C 2) powder. This new material, consisting of chromium carbide, Ni-Cr, carbo-nitride phase and graphitic carbon had excellent sliding wear resistance that was approximately 23 times better than that reported for conventional HVOF Cr 3 C 2 - 25 NiCr coatings. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{biocompatibility}} and osteoconductivity of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings {{have led}} to their use {{in a wide range}} of applications in dentistry and orthopaedics. One such application is for the uncemented fixation of implants, where coatings are commonly applied to titanium implants using a plasma thermal spraying process. The spraying process is affected by a large number of parameters leading to highly complex process – property – structure relationships. In a step forward from one-at-a-time analyses, this study used Design of Experiment (DOE) methodology to investigate the simultaneous effects of key plasma spray process parameters on hydroxyapatite coatings for biomedical applications. The effects of five plasma spray process parameters (current, gas flow rate, powder feed rate, <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> and carrier gas flow rate) on the roughness, crystallinity and purity of hydroxyapatite coatings was determined using a fractional factorial design. The results of this study enabled identification of consistent and competing influences within the process and the identification of some first order interactions. In particular, the diffuse particle size of the HA feedstock powder was found to influence the responses observed within the parameter range investigated. The roughness of HA coatings was found to relate to the particle velocity and the degree of particle melting occurring, withhigher coating roughness resulting when current was high, gas flow rate was low and powder feed rate was high. Highest coating crystallinity resulted at high current, low <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> and low carrier gas flow rate. Under these conditions deposition of larger HA particles resulted leading to higher amounts of bulk crystalline material and the low <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> increased the substrate temperature allowing amorphous material to recrystallise. Coating purity relates directly to thermal decomposition of the particles within the plasma jet with a high purity coating resulting at low particle temperatures i. e at the lower ranges of powder feed rate, <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> and carrier gas flow rate. This study thus brings greater clarity on the effects of plasma spray process parameters on the properties of resultant hydroxyapatite coatings...|$|R

At low plasma power most of the deposited precursor is in non-pyrolyzed state, and consequently the applied coatings are defective.

40|$|The {{interdependence}} between plasma {{spray process}} parameters and porosity of YSZ coating microstructures was investigated with simultaneous {{consideration of the}} deposition efficiency. Based on a factorial experimental plan, the argon plasma gas flow, the current, the interaction of argon flow and current, and the <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> for the Triplex H plasma gun were found to yield the main contributions to porosity {{as well as to}} deposition efficiency. Each of these three process parameters has a significant individual effect on the in-flight particle velocities and temperatures. The contribution to the effects on porosity arises almost exclusively from the particle temperature. Regarding the deposition efficiency, the larger contribution originates from the particle velocity. To achieve a targeted high porosity at reasonable deposition efficiency a simple linear regression model was applied yielding an argon flow of 50 sIpm and a current of 470 A at a <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> of 200 mm as the optimum parameter set. The average particle temperature estimated for this optimum is just above the melting temperature. At this setting, a porosity of 17. 7 % and a deposition efficiency of 32. 5 % may be expected. At a greater <b>spray</b> <b>distance</b> and lower power density (lower current and/or higher argon plasma gas flow) the deposition efficiency was observed to drop considerably.
