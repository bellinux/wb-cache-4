40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{analysis}} and fabrication of plastic hypodermic needles. The hypotheses for this work are that replacing metal hypodermic needles with plastic ones will reduce or eliminate {{the possibility of the}} second-hand infections from needle sticks and unsterlized reuse and will be more cost and time efficient to recycle. The most critical structural failure mode for plastic needles is buckling due to their shape (thin walled hollow column). The consideration of buckling is critical to avoid structural failure and to ensure reliability for medical applications. The buckling strength of a cannula is analyzed by analytic (Euler buckling theory) and finite element analysis (FEA) methods. A 22 gage needle model (OD 0. 7 mm, ID 0. 4 mm, Length 12. 7 mm) was analyzed. Euler buckling theory was used to calculate the critical buckling load. Numerical approaches using finite element analyses showed very similar results with analytic results. A skin model was introduced to simulate boundary conditions in the numerical approaches. To verify the results of the analyses, cannulas with the same cross-sectional dimensions were fabricated using a micro injection molding technique. To make the parts hollow, a core assembly of <b>straightened</b> <b>wire</b> was used. Using the tip of a 22 gage needle, cannulas with the inverse shape of an actual hypodermic needle were made. The structural (buckling) characteristics of cannulas were measured by a force-displacement testing machine. When buckling occurred, an arch shape was visible and there was an abrupt change in the load plot. Test results showed the relation between the needles length and the buckling load, which was similar to that predicted by Euler buckling theory. However, test values were 60 % of the theoretical or analytical results. Several reasons to explain these discrepancies can be found. The first is that an unexpected bending moment resulted from an eccentric loading due to installation off-center {{to the center of the}} testing machine or to the oblique insertion. A cannula that was initially bent during ejection from the mold can add an unexpected bending moment. The quality control of cannulas can be another reason. Bent or misaligned core wires produce eccentric cannulas, and the thinner wall section can buckle or initiate fracture more easily. The last reason may be that Euler buckling theory is not fully valid in short cannula, because the axial stress reaches yield stress before buckling occurs. Inelastic deformation occurs (i. e., the modulus is reduced) during compression in short cannula. The Johnson column formula is introduced to explain this situation. Especially for the nylon nanocomposite material tested, a loss in modulus due to moisture absorption may be another explanation for the discrepancies. M. S.

40|$|Now days, {{there are}} wide verity of wire {{products}} like welding electrode, weld mesh, heat treated kitchen baskets, automobile spark plugs and exhaust valves etc. For manufacturing all aboveproducts, wire {{is used as}} primary element and is to be straighten from coil form.

50|$|Pekka Janhunen from FMI has {{invented a}} type of solar sail called the {{electric}} solar wind sail. Mechanically it has {{little in common with}} the traditional solar sail design. The sails are replaced with <b>straightened</b> conducting tethers (<b>wires)</b> placed radially around the host ship. The wires are electrically charged to create an electric field around the wires. The electric field extends a few tens of metres into the plasma of the surrounding solar wind. The solar electrons are reflected by the electric field (like the photons on a traditional solar sail). The radius of the sail is from the electric field rather than the actual wire itself, making the sail lighter. The craft can also be steered by regulating the electric charge of the wires. A practical electric sail would have 50-100 <b>straightened</b> <b>wires</b> with a length of about 20 km each.|$|R

50|$|All {{miniature}} bulbs, {{including some}} LED sets, have a wedge base, though their designs are inconsistent with one another, making it somewhat {{difficult for the}} average consumer to change bulbs. To replace a bulb, the plastic base of the bulb must usually be changed by <b>straightening</b> the two <b>wires</b> and pulling the glass part out. Most replacement bulbs do not even include the bases anymore, despite getting only ten in a package and being charged nearly half {{the price of a}} new string of 100. For this reason, many Americans treat miniature holiday lights as disposable. In addition, colored lights tend to fade with even brief exposure to weather. Many LED sets are permanently wired, with bases that look like conventional pull-out bulbs.|$|R
40|$|When {{the tip of}} a {{point cathode}} is locally heated by a laser or {{electron}} beam irradiation to a high temperature below the melting point, the cathode can be operated at a fairly high emission current density {{for a long period of}} time because the cathode evaporation is locally confined to the tip. The temperature distribution and the shape variation of a <b>straightened</b> tungsten <b>wire</b> cathode are examined with a numerical method under different heating conditions. When a portion of the conical tip of the cathode is kept at a constant high temperature, evaporation occurs from the cone apex, although the portion is near the cone base. During evaporation, the tip maintains a conical shape, and the apex temperature is nearly constant. The same results are obtained when an incident heat energy is given in a large area of the cathode tip. There are large allowances in the heating position and area, which promise a long lifetime of the cathode. Numerical method and results are described. Key words: electron source, point cathode, temperature distribution, cathode evaporation, beam heating When the tip of the point cathode is locally heated by a laser or electron beam irradiation, the working life of th...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Inserting {{a guiding}} {{catheter}} into a tortuous artery for neurointerventional procedures can be difficult. In our technique, the carotid artery is manually compressed to stabilize and/or <b>straighten</b> the inserted <b>wire</b> before advancing the guiding catheter. Although {{this technique is}} not risk-free and {{care must be taken}} to avoid vascular injury by excessive compression, it is useful for the insertion of a guiding catheter into the carotid artery. The insertion of a guiding catheter system into the desiredarterial site is the first, and one of themost important, steps for successful endovascular treatment. Here we present our “carotid-compression technique ” that facilitates insertion of the guiding catheter into the tortuous carotid artery. Technical Considerations In patients with severe atherosclerosis, the insertion of a catheter, especially a guiding catheter, into the common carotid artery (CCA) can be difficult. Anatomic factors such as a long distance between the origin of the carotid artery and the top of the ascend-ing aorta and sharpness of the angle formed by the CCA and th...|$|R

In this gun, a <b>straightened</b> thin tungsten <b>wire</b> is used as the cathode and only the tip part is locally heated by a bombarding electron beam (5 keV, g 1 mA) from a heater assembly set inside the Wehnelt electrode. Experiments showed that (1) {{the temperature of the}} cathode tip is raised to 3, 100 K at a bombarding power of 3 W and to the melting point (3, 650 K) at 5 W, (2) although secondary and backscattered electrons are produced by the electron bombardment and mixed with the thermally emitted electrons, the amount could be suppressed to a practically negligible level, (3) the gun gives a stable operation at a brightness as high as 6. 4 x 10 * A/cm'sr at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV, and (4) the local heating greatly improves the cathode life and attains the continuous oper-ation at least over 1 hour at the above brightness level.
