5|$|Canada's {{first such}} public transit system, GO Transit began regular {{passenger}} service on May 23, 1967 {{as a part}} of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Since then, it has grown from a <b>single</b> <b>train</b> line to seven, and expanded to include complementing bus service. GO Transit has been constituted in a variety of public-sector configurations, today existing as an operating division of Metrolinx, a provincial Crown agency with overall responsibility for integrative transportation planning within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existing}} double track {{all the way}} from Oslo to Moss, a further upgrade southwards {{will not be able to}} increase capacity past the current <b>single</b> <b>train</b> per hour to Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. The most optimistic plans involve finishing the first upgrades of track south of Moss simultaneously with the Follo Line. The Rail Administration and Ministry of Transport is working on proposals for a high-speed railway between Oslo and Gothenburg in Sweden. This line would most likely use the Follo Line for the initial distance from Oslo.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few months after the WDWRR opened to the public, Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, modeled after the former Victorian-style Saratoga Springs station in Saratoga Springs, New York, was the only stop for {{passengers}} along its route, making only complete round trips possible. On May 1, 1972, the first Frontierland Station opened just northwest of Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn and Café in the Frontierland section on the park's western edge. It {{was one of the last}} changes made to the WDWRR prior to the retirement of Roger Broggie on October 1, 1973. Frontierland Station was demolished in November 1990 to make way for the new Splash Mountain attraction and was replaced by the current Frontierland Station, which opened in December 1991 just north of the original station site. During construction of the Splash Mountain attraction and the current Frontierland Station, the WDWRR was temporarily renamed Backtrack Express and operated a <b>single</b> <b>train,</b> which only traveled back and forth along the section of track between the Main Street, U.S.A. section and the Mickey's Starland section. Between 1976 and 1977, the Auto-Train Corporation sponsored the WDWRR.|$|E

25|$|The {{station is}} served by long-distance trains {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways. Because of the limit catchment, only a <b>single</b> <b>train</b> in each direction serves the station each day. This is aimed at commuting to Kristiansand—a morning train to town and an afternoon train from town. These trains continue onwards to Oslo and Stavanger, respectively. Travel time to Kristiansand is 18 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The third {{system is}} used by the subway system. This is called the Wayside system. Replacing the old devices which communicated by the third rail are new UHF MPT-1327 Trunking radio sets. The Subway system is divided into three {{separate}} systems, each representing its respective subway line. This new trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a <b>single</b> <b>train,</b> a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line. Line 3 Scarborough is not included in this system. They continue to use a single channel UHF system, much the same as the system used by operations staff.|$|E
40|$|In many signal {{detection}} applications, probabilistic methods {{are used to}} model and detect signals in order to account for variances within the signal class. However, probabilistic methods require training data in order to operate adequately, which is not always readily available. This paper presents a method of detecting probabilistic signals using a <b>single</b> <b>training</b> example to form a kernel matrix for use within a compact subspace detector. Results indicate that this method performs well in detecting chirp signals, providing a proof of concept for detection of probabilistic signals using a <b>single</b> <b>training</b> example...|$|R

25|$|Carriages with {{corridors}} were rotated {{as necessary}} to put those corridors {{on the south side}} when running through Flinders Street Station; this ensured the new seat-booking system correctly identified window seats and direction of travel. Cars in sets were lettered A through D for the four-car sets, and if multiple sets were used on a <b>single</b> <b>train</b> then the west-end cars would be relettered to suit. For example, an eight-car train through Flinders Street station would have been labelled cars H through A from west end. Sets were constructed to have roughly equal capacity where possible, with the ABE to BE conversions and the long-type BW cars used in Z sets to boost capacity.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of RDCs were {{owned and operated by}} railroads in the United States. They could be found on branch lines, short-haul intercity routes, commuter routes, and even long-distance trains. The Western Pacific Railroad used a pair of RDC-2s to operate the Zephyrette, a supplement to the California Zephyr. The two cars ran between Oakland, California and Salt Lake City, Utah, , three days a week. Examples of shorter intercity services were the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's Choctaw Rocket and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Daylight Speedliner. The latter ran between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and included full dining service. A notable example of the RDC's flexibility occurred on the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines, where a <b>single</b> <b>train</b> would depart Camden, New Jersey and split into multiple trains to serve different destinations on the Atlantic coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{was thus}} rendered inoperable, and {{what remained of}} it was transferred to Israel Railways upon the company's founding. The company made minor repairs along the line, which allowed trains to travel between Haifa and Afula. Service on the new shortened line was terminated in 1949. Two main reasons were the lack of financial feasibility, and the non-standard narrow gauge of the railway. In 1950-51, the line was used occasionally for tourism. Its last use was registered in September 1951, for training exercises by the Israel Defense Forces. In 1954, the rolling stock was dismantled and sold. An old steam locomotive and a <b>single</b> <b>train</b> car were the only remains, and are displayed at the Israel Railway Museum. A short section of the railway from the Haifa East rail yard to Nesher continued operating past 1951, having been converted by the British in the 1920s to dual gauge {{in order to allow}} standard gauge equipment to reach the Nesher cement factory, although this section too was eventually abandoned in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) {{is mainly}} {{detected}} and managed in primary care, but the care is considered suboptimal. We present the rationale, design and baseline {{results of the}} Treatment Optimisation in Primary care of Heart failure in the Utrecht region (TOPHU) study. In this study we assess {{the effect of a}} <b>single</b> <b>training</b> of GPs in the pharmacological management of patients with HF. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomised controlled trial. Thirty primary care practices are randomly assigned to care as usual or intervention defined as a <b>single</b> <b>training</b> in the up-titration and management of HF drug therapy according to the heart failure guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Patients with a GP's diagnosis of HF will be re-evaluated by an expert panel of two cardiologists and a GP with expertise in HF to come to a definite diagnosis of HF according to the ESC heart failure guidelines. Those with definite HF will be analysed in this study. Drug use will be measured after six months, health status after twelve months, and heart-related hospital admissions and all-cause mortality after two years. DISCUSSION: Our cluster randomised trial will show whether a <b>single</b> <b>training</b> of GPs improves the pharmacological management of patients with HF and confers beneficial effects on health status after one year, and cardiac hospital admissions and all-cause mortality after two years of follow-up.
