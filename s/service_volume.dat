40|$|The volume-outcome {{relationship}} has been discussed for over 30 years; however, the findings are inconsistent.

A population-based, cross-sectional multilevel study was conducted. Two definitions of physician and hospital volume were used: (1) the cumulative PCI volume in a previous year before each PCI; (2) the cumulative PCI volume within the study period. The volume was further treated in three ways: (1) a categorical variable based on the American Heart Association’s recommendation; (2) a semi-data-driven categorical variable based on k-means clustering algorithm; and (3) a data-driven categorical variable based on the Generalized Additive Model. The results showed that, after adjusting the patient-, physician-, and hospital-level covariates, physician volume was associated inversely with PCI 30 -day mortality, but hospital volume was not, no matter which definitions and categorization methods of <b>service</b> <b>volume</b> were applied.

40|$|Besides {{providing}} position, navigation, {{and timing}} (PNT) services to traditional terrestrial and airborne users, GPS {{is also being}} increasingly used {{as a tool to}} enable precision orbit determination, precise time synchronization, real-time spacecraft navigation, and three-axis attitude control of Earth orbiting satellites. With additional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations being replenished and coming into service (GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo), it will become possible to benefit from greater signal availability and robustness by using evolving multi-constellation receivers. The paper, "GPS in the Space Service Volume," presented at the ION GNSS 19 th International Technical Meeting in 2006 (Ref. 1), defined the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume,</b> and analyzed the performance of GPS out to seventy thousand kilometers. This paper will report a similar analysis of the signal coverage of GPS in the space domain; however, the analyses will also consider signal coverage from each of the additional GNSS constellations noted earlier to specifically demonstrate the expected benefits to be derived from using GPS in conjunction with other foreign systems. The Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> is formally defined as the volume of space between three thousand kilometers altitude and geosynchronous altitude circa 36, 000 km, as compared with the Terrestrial <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> between 3, 000 km and the surface of the Earth. In the Terrestrial <b>Service</b> <b>Volume,</b> GNSS performance is the same as on or near the Earth's surface due to satellite vehicle availability and geometry similarities.

Besides the technical discussion, we also present diplomatic efforts to extend the GPS Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> concept to other PNT service providers in an effort to assure that all space users will benefit from the enhanced interoperability of GNSS services in the space domain.

40|$|Besides {{providing}} position, velocity, {{and timing}} (PVT) for terrestrial users, the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is also being}} used to provide PVT information for earth orbiting satellites. In 2006, F. H. Bauer, et. al., defined the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> in the paper GPS in the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume,</b> presented at ION s 19 th international Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division, and looked at GPS coverage for orbiting satellites. With GLONASS already operational, and the first satellites of the Galileo and Beidou/COMPASS constellations already in orbit, {{it is time to}} look at the use of the new Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) coming into service to provide PVT information for earth orbiting satellites. This presentation extends GPS in the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> by examining the coverage capability of combinations of the new constellations with GPS GPS was first explored as a system for refining the position, velocity, and timing of other spacecraft equipped with GPS receivers in the early eighties. Because of this, a new GPS utility developed beyond the original purpose of providing position, velocity, and timing services for land, maritime, and aerial applications. GPS signals are now received and processed by spacecraft both above and below the GPS constellation, including signals that spill over the limb of the earth. Support of GPS space applications is now part of the system plan for GPS, and support of the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> by other GNSS providers has been proposed to the UN International Committee on GNSS (ICG). GPS has been demonstrated to provide decimeter level position accuracy in real-time for satellites in low Earth orbit (centimeter level in non-real-time applications). GPS has been proven useful for satellites in geosynchronous orbit, and also for satellites in highly elliptical orbits. Depending on how many satellites are in view, one can keep time locked to the GNSS standard, and through that to Universal Time as long as at least one satellite is in view (the longest duration with no satellites in view is important in determining the maximum clock drift from GNSS time). Instantaneous position requires four satellites in view, but because orbital motion is predictable, it is possible to build up knowledge of the orbital position gradually through time without a need for constant four satellite coverage. However, it is desirable to have four satellite coverage when performing satellite maneuvers, since there can be significant changes in velocity, leading to large changes in orbit parameter, causing substantial divergence in position over time. The Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> has been defined as the volume between three thousand km altitude and geosynchronous altitude, and can be divided into medium orbit services between three thousand km altitude and eight thousand km altitude, and high orbit services above eight thousand km. The Terrestrial <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> includes the Earth s surface, the atmosphere, and space below the altitude of three thousand km. The Terrestrial <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> is the volume within which the GNSS systems will have very similar performance to the Earth surface, and satellites need only use the signals specified to provide terrestrial performance. Above three thousand km the use of signals passing by the Earth s limb becomes important, so it is desirable to have additional information on signal strength, phase delay, and group delay covering wider beam angles than are needed for terrestrial service (and which can be obtained by monitoring GNSS signals from the Earth s surface). This presentation will look at each of the new GNSS constellations in combination with GPS (GLONASS with GPS, Galileo with GPS, Beidou/COMPASS with GPS), and also at the combination of all four GNSS systems. The presentation will largely follow the format of GPS in the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume,</b> presenting data on the availability of one, two, three, or four of the various combinations of GNSS constellation satelles at approximately two thousand grid points evenly spaced and fixed in longitude and latitude, the duration of the longest single-fold outages (intervals when no satellites are available), and the duration of the longest four-fold outages (intervals when fewer than four satellites are available) at several altitudes. Following the original paper, we will use the altitudes of three hundred km (typical LEO satellite, and within the Terrestrial <b>Service</b> <b>Volume),</b> at three thousand km (border between Terrestrial <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> and Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume),</b> at eight thousand km (the border between medium and high orbit service within the Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume),</b> at fifteen thousand km (just below the GNSS constellations), at twenty five thousand km (just above the GNSS constellations), at thirty six thousand, five hundred km (limit of Space <b>Service</b> <b>Volume</b> definition, geosynchronous altitude), and at seventy thousand km (to show the potential usefulness of GNSS beyond geosynchronous altitude) ...|$|E
40|$|During the 1980 s, {{unit cost}} {{inflation}} more than swallowed {{up all the}} increased spending on local authority social services, leaving a 10 per cent net reduction in <b>service</b> <b>volumes.</b> This increase can be only partly explained by increased labour prices and increased client needs resulting from the implementation of community care. Explanations in terms of quality and efficiency changes are explored in relation to individual services, and {{there appears to be}} a prima facie case that efficiency reduced during the 1980 s. Variation between local authorities in the costs of apparently similar services rose during the 1980 s. An analysis of these variations shows that those authorities which experienced the greatest rise in unit costs also had the greatest reduction in <b>service</b> <b>volumes.</b> Unit cost containment has been greatest where there was grant reduction and a declining local tax base, while volume declined most where there was rate-capping. The rising variation in unit costs has been responsible for the widening gap between standard spending assessments and what local authorities have wanted to spend on personal social services. If these increased variations reflect widening efficiency standards, then reversing this trend will require that social services department managements have both the motivation and capacity to implement unit cost monitoring and control...|$|R
