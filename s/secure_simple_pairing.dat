40|$|Future {{networks}} everywhere will {{be connected}} to innumerable Internet-ready home appliances. A device accepting connections over a network {{must be able to}} verify the identity of a connecting device in order to prevent device spoofing and other malicious actions. In recent works, some major existing home network specifications consider device-specific security functions. For example, UPnP Security [1] has a sophisticated mechanism to guarantee personal ownership of a device. UPnP Security defines a special terminal device called “Security Console ” to set up security configurations on each device remotely. UPnP Security also has an inter-device authentication and authorization mechanism using a public key pair, Security ID and ACL. Bluetooth [2] has a <b>secure</b> <b>simple</b> <b>pairing</b> mechanism to take ownership of a device. After the taking ownership of the device, two devices generate a shared secret (called a link key) for future mutual authentication. As mentioned above, some major specifications already consider a security mechanism for devices. We have also proposed a novel security mechanism not for human being but for devices [3]. In this report, we show a practical tiny security surveillance system for conventional home appliances to achieve our proposed inter-device authentication and authorization framework. 2 Multiple Ownership Mode...|$|E
40|$|Various {{wireless}} technologies, such as RF, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, {{have been}} applied to sensor communications. However, the applications of Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks (WSN) have a security issue. In one pairing process during Bluetooth communication, which is known as <b>simple</b> <b>secure</b> <b>pairing</b> (SSP), the devices are required to specify I/O capability or user interference to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This study proposes an enhanced SSP in which a nonce to be transferred is converted to a corresponding signal interval. The quantization level, {{which is used to}} interpret physical signal intervals, is renewed at every connection by the transferred nonce and applied to the next nonce exchange so that the same signal intervals can represent different numbers. Even if attackers eavesdrop on the signals, they cannot understand what is being transferred because they cannot determine the quantization level. Furthermore, the proposed model does not require exchanging passkeys as data, and the devices are secure in the case of using a fixed PIN. Subsequently, the new quantization level is calculated automatically whenever the same devices attempt to connect with each other. Therefore, the pairing process can be protected from MITM attacks and be convenient for users...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Bluetooth {{technology}} {{is widely used}} by organizations and individuals to provide wireless personal area network (WPAN). This is because the radio frequency (RF) waves can easily penetrate obstacles and can propagate without direct line-of-sight (LoS). These two characteristics have led to replace wired communication by wireless systems. However, there are serious security challenges associated with wireless communication systems because they are easier to eavesdrop, disrupt and jam than the wired systems. Bluetooth technology started with a form of pairing called legacy pairing prior to any communication. However, due to the serious security issues found in the legacy <b>pairing,</b> a <b>secure</b> and <b>simple</b> <b>pairing</b> called SPP was announced with Bluetooth 2. 1 and later since 2007. SPP has solved the main security issue which is the weaknesses of the PIN code in the legacy pairing, however {{it has been found}} with some vulnerabilities such as eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Since the discovery of these vulnerabilities, some enhancements have been proposed to the Bluetooth Specification Interest Group (SIG) which is the regulatory body of Bluetooth technology; nevertheless, some proposed enhancements are ineffective or are not yet implemented by Manufacturers. Therefore, an improvement of the security authentication in Bluetooth connection is highly required to overcome the existing drawbacks. This proposed protocol uses Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA- 256). The implementation of this proposal is based on the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as software and a Bluetooth (BT) Shield connected to an Arduino Uno R 3 boards as hardware. The result was verified on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with C sharp as default environment. It has shown that the proposed scheme works perfectly with the used hardware and software. In addition, the protocol thwarts the passive and active eavesdropping attacks which exist during SSP. These attacks are defeated by avoiding the exchange of passwords and public keys in plain text between the Master and the Slave. Therefore, this protocol is expected to be implemented by the SIG to enhance the security in Bluetooth connection...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comThis paper analyzes the security of Bluetooth v 4. 0 ’s <b>Secure</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Pairing</b> (SSP) protocol, for both the Bluetooth Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) operational modes. Bluetooth v 4. 0 is {{the latest version of}} a wireless communication standard for low-speed and low-range data transfer among devices in a human’s PAN. It allows increased network mobility among devices such as headsets, PDAs, wireless keyboards and mice. A pairing process is initiated when two devices desire to communicate, and this pairing needs to correctly authenticate devices so that a secret link key is established for secure communication. What is interesting is that device authentication relies on humans to communicate verification information between devices via a human-aided out-of-band channel. Bluetooth v 4. 0 ’s SSP protocol is designed to offer security against passive eavesdropping and man-inthe- middle (MitM) attacks. We conduct the first known detailed analysis of SSP for all its MitM-secure models. We highlight some issues related to exchange of public keys and use of the passkey in its models and discuss how to treat them properly...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of more types of devices which have Bluetooth as a primary option to communicate, the importance of secure communication is growing. Bluetooth provides a short range wireless communication between devices making convenient for users and thus eliminating the need for messy cables. The proliferation of the Bluetooth devices in the workplace exposes organizations to security risks. Bluetooth technology and associated devices are susceptible to general wireless networking threats, such as denial of service attack, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation. Preventing unauthorized users from secure communication is a challenge to the pairing process. The Man-in-the-Middle attack is based on sending random signals to jam the physical layer of legitimate user and then by falsification of information sent during the input/output capabilities exchange; also the fact that the security of the protocol is likely to be limited by the capabilities of the least powerful or the least secure device type. In addition, proposed a countermeasure that render the attack impractical. We have shown that, the proposed method can withstand the MITM attack and achieving all the security needs like authenticity, confidentiality, integrity and availability as well as it is an improvement to the existing Bluetooth <b>secure</b> <b>simple</b> <b>pairing</b> {{in order to make it}} more secure...|$|E
