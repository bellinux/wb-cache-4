We demonstrated that a cysL mutant and a cysJI mutant have similar phenotypes. Both are unable to grow using sulfate <b>or</b> <b>sulfite</b> as the sulfur source. The level of expression of the cysJI operon is higher in the presence of sulfate, <b>sulfite,</b> <b>or</b> thiosulfate than in the presence of cysteine.

In the presence of thiosulfate, the expression of the cysJI operon was reduced 11 -fold, whereas the expression of the cysH and cysK genes was increased, in a cysL mutant. A cis-acting DNA sequence located upstream of the transcriptional start site of the cysJI operon (positions − 76 to − 70) was shown to be necessary for sulfur source- and CysL-dependent regulation. CysL also negatively regulates its own transcription, a common characteristic of the LysR-type regulators.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a short review of recent research that established {{the ability of}} sulfate‐reducing bacteria to utilize sulfonic acids as terminal electron acceptors (TEA) for anaerobic respiratory growth. Newer studies of the bacterium most intensively investigated, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, strain ICI, are also reported. When either of two sulfonic acids examined—isethionate (2 ‐hydroxyethanesulfonate) or cysteate (alanine‐ 3 ‐sulfonate) —served as sole TEA, key changes in the cells’ enzymo‐logical profile occurred: decreased production of two enzymes involved in sulfate reduction, namely, ATP sulfurylase and APS reductase. Similar reduction in content of these enzymes was seen when either <b>sulfite</b> <b>or</b> fumarate served as TEA. Protein profiles (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) of extracts of cells grown with different TEA revealed {{the presence of a}} 97 ‐kD polypeptide apparently unique to isethionate‐grown cells; a different polypeptide was noted in extracts of cysteate‐grown cells. The absence of such stained bands in extracts of sulfate‐grown cells suggests that these polypeptides are involved in utilization of sulfonic acids as TEA. H 2 threshold values of cells growth with isethionate as TEA were significantly lower than for cells growing with sulfate <b>or</b> <b>sulfite,</b> suggesting that energy may be conserved in the cleavage of isethionate's C‐S linkage.
