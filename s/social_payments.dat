[...] According to official government statistics from Rosstat, the [...] "shadow economy" [...] occupied only 15% of Russia's GDP in 2011, and this included unreported salaries (to avoid taxes and <b>social</b> <b>payments)</b> {{and other types of}} tax evasion. According to Rosstat's estimates, corruption in 2011 amounted to only 3.5 to 7% of GDP. In comparison, some independent experts maintain that corruption consumes as much of 25% of Russia's GDP. A World Bank report puts this figure at 48%. There is also an interesting shift in the main focus of bribery: whereas previously officials took bribes to shut their eyes to legal infractions, they now take them simply to perform their duties. Many experts admit that in recent years corruption in Russia has become a business.

30|$|To {{assure that}} we are {{comparing}} minimum wage standards on a comparable basis, the minimum-to-average wage ratios in Table  2 have accounted {{for the fact that}} some provinces include <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> and housing provident funds as part of the wage when calculating minimum wages.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the statistics that {{are commonly used}} to assess whether immigrants {{are more or less}} likely than people born in Australia to be receiving <b>social</b> security <b>payments.</b> The paper shows that many earlier discussions of this issue which have concluded that immigrants are substantially over-represented in the social security system have involved invalid comparisons. These have tended to systematically over-estimate the extent to which immigrants receive <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> and under-estimate the level of social security receipt among the Australian-born population. The paper presents new estimates of receipt of <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> in 1989 through a comparison of administrative data from the Department of Social Security and population estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The paper adjusts for the errors identified in earlier analysis of the issues. It is concluded that while {{a relatively small number of}} overseas birthplace groups do appear to be more likely to be receiving <b>social</b> security <b>payments,</b> the extent to which this occurs is much smaller than previously estimated. It is also concluded that most groups of immigrants appear to be less likely to be receiving <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> than are people born in Australia...|$|R

50|$|From 2013 onwards, working-age <b>social</b> {{security}} <b>payments</b> {{were limited}} to a maximum annual increase of 1% instead of being increased annually according to the rate of inflation. The policy of suspending the <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> of unemployed claimants who were judged not to be adequately seeking work was continued, and the frequency and severity of the sanctions was increased. From 2016 a four-year freeze on all working-age <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> was introduced. It was anticipated that it would affect 11 million UK families and reduce expenditure by £9 billion, a figure later increased to £13 billion. The Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 abolished the Work-Related Activity Component of Employment and Support Allowance for new claimants from April 2017. This reduced the weekly <b>social</b> security <b>payments</b> for the disabled people affected by £29.05 a week (at 2017/18 rates).
