40|$|Capital {{flows and}} the {{economic}} and financial risks they potentially create can be been analysed extensively with the statistical frameworks, methodologies, compilation guidelines and data collections based on the residency principle. However, the changing landscape resulting from globalisation in the real and financial sectors call for a complementary framework {{based on the principle}} of nationality in order to shed light on new types of financial risks associated with international financial operations. The BIS has been collecting and disseminating data on international banking positions and flows for over half a century. This is done {{under the auspices of the}} BIS Committee on the Global Financial System on which the central banks of the most important financial centers are represented. The data include balance sheet positions of internationally active banks on both a residency and nationality basis with key breakdowns that are not available for other capital flow data, for instance in terms of currency as well as the country and <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterparty.</b> Recently a number of enhancements have been agreed to the BIS data, such as the separate identification of non-bank financial institutions and non-financial corporation as the counterparty sector. Additional data will also show banks ’ domestic positions (and thus their total balance sheet). The new data will allow policy makers and market analysts to monitor banking positions and flows- and associated risks- in much more detail...|$|E

40|$|The {{price of}} {{financial}} derivative with unilateral counterparty credit risk {{can be expressed}} {{as the price of}} an otherwise risk-free derivative minus a credit value adjustment(CVA) component that can be seen as shorting a call option, which is exercised upon default <b>of</b> <b>counterparty,</b> on MtM <b>of</b> the derivative. Therefore, modeling volatility of MtM and default time <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> is key to quantification <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk. This paper models default times <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> and reference with a particular contagion model with stochastic intensities that is proposed by Bao et al. 2010. Stochastic interest rate is incorporated as well to account for positive correlation between spread and interest. Survival measure approach is adopted to calculate MtM of risk-free CDS and conditional survival probability <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> in defaultable environment. Semi-analytical solution for CVA is attained. Affine specification of intensities and interest rate concludes analytical expression for pre-default value of MtM.

30|$|First, the {{so-called}} contra-assets (CA) are valued as the expected counterparty default losses and funding expenditures.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that Commodities futures and forward prices, in principle, agree under some simplifying assumptions. One {{of the most}} relevant assumptions is the absence <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk. Indeed, due to margining, futures have practically no counterparty risk. Forwards, instead, may bear the full risk of default for the counterparty when traded with brokers or outside clearing houses, or when embedded in other contracts such as swaps. In this paper we focus on energy commodities and on Oil in particular. We use a hybrid commodities-credit model to asses impact <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk in pricing formulas, both in the gross effect of default probabilities and on the subtler effects of credit spread volatility, commodities volatility and credit-commodities correlation. We illustrate our general approach with a case study based on an oil swap, showing that an accurate valuation <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk depends on volatilities and correlation and cannot be accounted for precisely through a pre-defined multiplier. ...|$|R
50|$|Credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) is {{the difference}} between the risk-free portfolio value and the true portfolio value that takes into account the possibility <b>of</b> a <b>counterparty’s</b> default.

Using long-term supply contracts collected from SEC filings, we test whether three sources <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk - financial exposure, product quality risk, and redeployability risk - are priced in the equity returns of linked firms. Our {{results show that}} equity holders require compensation for exposure to all three sources of risk. Specifically, offering trade credit to counterparties and investing in relationship-specific assets increase the firm's exposure to counterparty risk. Further, we show that contracts with protective financial covenants and product warranties mitigate the transmission of risk. Overall, we provide evidence on the channels of supply-chain risk, and we show that shareholders recognize the role of contractual features in mitigating counterparty risk...|$|R

40|$|The global {{over-the-counter}} derivatives market {{reached a}} staggering 14. 5 trillion US dollars in gross market value {{at the end}} of December 2007. Although OTC derivatives are extremely useful and versatile in transferring risks, {{it appears to be a}} double-edged sword. For every derivative transaction concluded in the OTC market, there are two parties involved – each of which is exposed to the other defaulting on the agreed terms and conditions <b>of</b> the contract. <b>Counterparty</b> credit risk is defined as the loss that will be incurred in the event that a counterparty fails to honour its financial obligations. This dissertation provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk measurement from a theoretical point of view and puts an emphasis on the demonstration of the current solutions used in practice to address this problem. The author applies a bottom up approach to the problem by defining counterparty credit risk exposure on a contract (single-trade) level and expands this definition on a step-by-step basis to incorporate portfolio effects, such as correlation among underlying market variables as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as netting and collateral agreements, in measuring counterparty credit risk exposure on a counterparty level. The author also discusses related concepts which impact counterparty credit risk such as wrong-way risk and proposes an enhancement to the framework introduced by Finger (2000) for incorporating wrong-way risk into existing measures <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk exposure. Finger‟s framework is enhanced by the introduction of a structural model approach which can be used in establishing a functional and intuitive relationship between the probability of default <b>of</b> the <b>counterparty</b> and the underlying market variable to the derivative contract under consideration. This approach is also applied to a typical South African situation through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The topic <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk modelling is a very relevant topic in modern finance, especially since the advent of Basel 2 which this dissertation also touches on in terms of the applications <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk modelling and how this relates to the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by bank regulators.

40|$|Counterparty risk {{denotes the}} risk that a party {{defaults}} in a bilateral contract. This risk not only depends on the two parties involved, {{but also on the}} risk from various other contracts each of these parties holds. In rather informal markets, such as the OTC (over-the-counter) derivative market, institutions only report their aggregated quarterly risk exposure, but no details about their counterparties. Hence, {{little is known about the}} diversification <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk. In this paper, we reconstruct the weighted and time-dependent network <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk in the OTC derivatives market of the United States between 1998 and 2012. To proxy unknown bilateral exposures, we first study the co-occurrence patterns of institutions based on their quarterly activity and ranking in the official report. The network obtained this way is further analysed by a weighted k-core decomposition, to reveal a core-periphery structure. This allows us to compare the activity-based ranking with a topology-based ranking, to identify the most important institutions and their mutual dependencies. We also analyse correlations in these activities, to show strong similarities in the behavior of the core institutions. Our analysis clearly demonstrates the clustering <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> risk in a small set of about a dozen US banks. This not only increases the default risk of the central institutions, but also the default risk of peripheral institutions which have contracts with the central ones. Hence, all institutions indirectly have to bear (part <b>of)</b> the <b>counterparty</b> risk <b>of</b> all others, which needs to be better reflected in the price of OTC derivatives.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to give an overview of creditvaluation adjustment (CVA) and adjacent concepts. Firstly, the historicalevents that preceded the initiative to reform the Basel regulations and tointroduce CVA as a core component <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> credit risk are illustrated. After some conceptual background material, a journey is taken through theregulatory aspects of CVA. The three most commonly used methods for calculatingthe regulatory CVA capital charge are explained in detail and potentialchallenges with the methods are addressed. Further, the document analyses ingreater depth two of the methods; the internal model method (IMM) and thecurrent exposure method (CEM). The differences between these two methods areexplained mathematically and analysed. This comparison is supported bysimulations of portfolios containing interest rate swap contracts with differenttime to maturity and <b>of</b> <b>counterparties</b> with varying credit ratings. Oneconcluding observations is that credit valuation adjustment is a measure <b>of</b> centralimportance within <b>counterparty</b> credit risk. Further, it is shown that IMM has someimportant advantages over CEM, {{especially when it comes}} to model connection withreality. Finally, some possible future work to be done within the topic area is suggested...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} static contingent-claim model {{that allows for}} {{examining}} the optimal capital structure with the joint arguments <b>of</b> <b>counterparty</b> default risk and market incompleteness.

We show that the effects <b>of</b> <b>counterparty's</b> default clearly diminish the uses of debt, which indirectly explains the so-called under-leveraged puzzle.

50|$|Another {{dimension}} of CFD risk is counterparty risk, {{a factor in}} most over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives.

This means that a CFD trader could potentially incur severe losses, even if the underlying instrument moves in the desired direction. OTC CFD providers are required to segregate client funds protecting client balances in event of company default, but cases such as that of MF Global remind us that guarantees can be broken.
