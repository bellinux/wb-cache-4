500|$|Despite {{settling}} {{some of his}} debts, Morris {{once again}} found himself in financial trouble, with unexpected tax bills and arguments with Hulton over payments. [...] In 1955 he sold the copyright of his signature to Hulton for £7,250 (a portion {{of which was a}} loan). [...] 45% of his £5,000 per annum salary was paid to the taxman. [...] With only one other profit-making magazine (Farmers Weekly), Hulton sought to curb Eagles costs, complaining about the use of taxis, expensive stationery, electricity and telephone bills, restaurant bills, and <b>staff</b> <b>expenses.</b> [...] At their 1957 AGM Hulton's Chairman reported a fall in profits, from £298,000 to £36,000, blaming reduced revenue from another of their magazines, Picture Post, and increased production costs. [...] Several of Morris's friends later left the company, and following a short period of internal turmoil Morris gave up the editor's chair in 1959. [...] The following year Eagle was taken over by Odhams Press. [...] Hampson's studio (by then in Epsom) was disbanded, and following creative differences he retired from the comic. [...] His duties on Dan Dare were taken up by Frank Bellamy, described by Morris as [...] "a most fastidious artist and scrupulous draftsman, and like Hampson at his best, often consumed with anxiety." [...] With Keith Watson and Don Harley, the three worked from a studio in Fleet Street. [...] The front cover was redesigned, the Eagle name appearing {{across the top of the}} page rather than in one corner, coinciding with a new-look Dare. [...] Many readers found Bellamy's changes to Dare (made at the behest of Eagles publisher) objectionable. [...] Bellamy was succeeded by Harley, who in 1962 was followed by Watson, who had returned from a short stint working on Eagles rival, Lion. [...] Watson stopped drawing Dan Dare in 1967, and was succeeded by Bruce Cornwell. [...] Following Hampson's departure, the emphasis on Dan Dare's exploration of the Solar System had changed instead to include interstellar travel. [...] Continuity became strained, and production on Dan Dare ceased in 1967, when it was replaced by reprints from earlier editions.|$|E

[...] "A spokeswoman for the revival, Lynne Breidenbach, said the offerings have covered their enormous operating costs. Before the move to the airport grounds, she said the ministry paid a daily rental fee of $15,000 for the local convention center, as well as comparable fees for use of a stadium. His spokesperson didn’t know how much the current setup costs. The offerings, said Breidenbach, have not contributed to a significant infusion of cash for Bentley or his ministry."

It is a modest salary and is in the five-figure range", and that Fresh Fire Ministries is audited annually.

50|$|To {{avoid the}} need for transponders, some systems, notably the 407 ETR (Electronic Toll Route) near Toronto, use {{automatic}} number plate recognition. Here, a system of cameras captures images of vehicles passing through tolled areas, {{and the image of}} the number plate is extracted and used to identify the vehicle. This allows customers to use the facility without any advance interaction with the toll agency. The disadvantage is that fully automatic recognition has a significant error rate, leading to billing errors and the cost of transaction processing (which requires locating and corresponding with the customer) can be significant. Systems that incorporate a manual review stage have much lower error rates, but require a continuing <b>staffing</b> <b>expense.</b>|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} the results of our study, our {{suggestion}} for future ultrasound courses would be to incorporate shorter presentations of less than 20  min with up to five key messages. Theoretical and hands-on sessions should either alternate or be divided into a theoretical morning session and a hands-on session in the afternoon. Alternating between theory and hands-on session might prevent fatigue and enhance retention of knowledge [19]. However, an alternating program has a higher <b>staff</b> <b>expense</b> as all trainers are required to be available all day and be able to teach every topic. Pre- and post-course training should be incorporated, for example, in the form of webcasts to define a learning pathway and repeat important learning targets using a blended learning concept.|$|R

5000|$|I am {{sure that}} the success of Eagle (a {{sell-out}} of 900,000 copies of its first issue) was due to the insistance sicon quality. Where Eagle was concerned, the quality of the paper, printing, artwork and writing set a new standard. There were bright colours, well-drawn pictures and exciting stories. Technically, the Eagle strips marked an advance on the standards of that time (standards that had stood still for years) when most strips were not true strips but merely pictures with captions underneath. Marcus Morris (1977) Despite settling some of his debts, Morris once again found himself in financial trouble, with unexpected tax bills and arguments with Hulton over payments.

40|$|This study applied {{engineering}} {{techniques to}} develop a nurse scheduling model that, while maintaining {{the highest level of}} service, simultaneously minimized hospital-staffing costs and equitably distributed overtime pay. In the mathematical model, the objective function was the sum of the overtime payment to all nurses and the standard deviation of the total overtime payment that each nurse received. Input data distributions were analyzed in order to formulate a simulation model to determine the optimal demand for nurses that met the hospital’s service standards. To obtain the optimal nurse schedule with the number of nurses acquired from the simulation model, we proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) with two-point crossover and random mutation. After running the algorithm, we compared the expenses and number of nurses between the existing and our proposed nurse schedules. For January 2013, the nurse schedule obtained by GA could save 12 % in <b>staffing</b> <b>expenses</b> per month and 13 % in number of nurses when compare with the existing schedule, while more equitably distributing overtime pay between all nurses...|$|R
40|$|Public {{institutions}} of {{lower secondary education}} are financed mainly from the public resources allocated from the local budget. Expenditures incurred from these resources have a maximum limit and a destination {{set out in the}} budget of each educational unit. The revenue and expenditure budget or only the expenditure budget of a lower secondary education institution provides for the maximum amounts to be used for the expenses made throughout a budgetary exercise. Therefore, reducing the share of social security contributions from your employer by five percentage points would affect the budget of such institutions as it would lead to a modification of the social insurance contributions expenses. In this paper we have described the structure of the current expenditure of a lower secondary education institution, especially with regard to <b>staff</b> <b>expenses,</b> because they hold the largest share in the total expenditure constantly incurred by the units concerned and are affected by the social security rate change. We have also presented the theoretical aspects related to the <b>staff</b> <b>expenses,</b> the budgetary execution phases that <b>staff</b> <b>expenses</b> must cover, the accounting treatment of costs of employers' social insurance contributions, the recognition of employers’ expenses for the social insurance State contributions in the bookkeeping of lower secondary education institutions, as well as the influence of changes in rates of the social security State contributions from the employer on the staff expenditure of the institutions mentioned...|$|E
