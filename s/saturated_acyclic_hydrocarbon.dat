5000|$|Tetramethylbutane, {{sometimes}} called hexamethylethane, is a hydrocarbon with formula C8H18 or (H3C-)3C-C(-CH3)3. It {{is the most}} heavily branched and most compact of the many octane isomers, {{the only one with}} a butane (C4) backbone. Because of its highly symmetrical structure, it has a very high melting point and a short liquid range; in fact, it is the smallest <b>saturated</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> that appears as a solid at a room temperature of 25 °C.

2500|$|In organic chemistry, an alkane, or {{paraffin}} (a historical {{name that}} also has other meanings), is an <b>acyclic</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms {{arranged in a}} tree structure {{in which all the}} carbon-carbon bonds are single.

50|$|Saturated {{hydrocarbons}} are {{the simplest}} of the hydrocarbon species. They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen. The formula for <b>acyclic</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (i.e., alkanes) is CnH2n+2. The most general form of saturated hydrocarbons is CnH2n+2(1-r), where r {{is the number of}} rings. Those with exactly one ring are the cycloalkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched species. Substitution reaction is their characteristics property (like chlorination reaction to form chloroform). Hydrocarbons with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae are called structural isomers. As given in the example of 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues, branched hydrocarbons can be chiral. Chiral saturated hydrocarbons constitute the side chains of biomolecules such as chlorophyll and tocopherol.|$|R

Results of this study reveal contrasting binding nature of the <b>acyclic</b> and cyclic <b>hydrocarbons</b> towards CNSs. While the saturated molecules show stronger binding affinity in acyclic hydrocarbons; the unsaturated molecules exhibit higher binding affinity in cyclic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> In addition, <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> exhibit stronger binding affinity towards the CNSs when compared to their corresponding cyclic counterparts. The computed results excellently corroborate the experimental observations. The interaction of hydrocarbons with graphene is more favourable when compared with CNTs.

40|$|<b>Saturated</b> <b>acyclic</b> alkanes show steric strain if {{they are}} highly {{branched}} and, in extreme cases, fall apart rapidly at room temperature. Consequently, attempts to {{count the number of}} isomeric forms for a given molecular formula that neglect this physical consideration will inevitably overestimate the size of the available chemical space. Here we derive iterative equations to enumerate the number of isomers (both structural and optical are considered separately) for the alkane series that take into account the inherent instability of certain carbon skeletons. These function by filtering out certain substructures from the graph representation of the molecule which {{have been found to be}} thermodynamically unstable.

40|$|Lycopene is an <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{carotenoid}} containing 11 conjugated double {{bonds in}} the all-trans form. It lacks provitamin A activity, but has an exceptionally high singlet oxygen quenching ability. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble, transported in the blood by lipoproteins and appear to concentrate in tissues where lipoprotein uptake is high, as in the adrenals, testes, liver, kidney, and prostate. Increased plasma concentrations of lycopene {{have been shown to}} elevate lycopene metabolites and reduce lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation. Lycopene predominantly occurs in fresh tomatoes and tomato products such as tomato juice and tomato sauce. Its bioavailability is increased in cooked or processed tomato products and when consumed with oils. Epidemiological studies of lycopene and cancer have correlated increased tomato intake with lower incidence of gastrointestinal, stomach, and prostate cancers while decreasing serum values of lycopene increases the risks for various types of cancer.

40|$|International audienceThe methyl cation and CF(3) (+) attack <b>saturated,</b> <b>acyclic</b> ketones to make vibrationally excited adduct ions. Despite {{their high}} {{internal}} energies and short lifetimes, these adducts undergo deep-seated rearrangements that parallel slower processes in solution. Observed pathways include alkene and alkane expulsions, {{in addition to}} (in the case of CF(3) (+)) the precedented loss of CF(2) O + HF. For {{the vast majority of}} ketones, the principal charged products are the CF(3) (+) adducts of lighter carbonyl compounds, ions that are not easily prepared by other avenues. Evidence for ion structures comes from collisionally activated unimolecular decomposition and bimolecular ion-molecule reactions. Typical examples are di-n-propyl and diisopropyl ketones (both of which produce CH(3) CH=OCF(3) (+) as the principal ion-molecule reaction product) and pentamethylacetone (which produces (CH(3)) (2) C=OCF(3) (+) as virtually the sole ion-molecule reaction product).

50|$|Hydrocarbons, {{being an}} {{extremely}} {{great source of}} energy due to their strong chemical bonds, were {{a great source of}} study in the Aegean Sea oil spill. Chemical markers were placed in a sample of the crude oil spilled, and an interesting data was revealed. Alkanes and <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> both having single bonds, appeared to have deteriorated in only six months, while triterpane and steranane were still present after years of weathering. Both triterpane and steranane have multiple bonds, which is the reason they were still present after so many years. As a conclusion for the study, they stated that chemical markers are a great source to use against oil spills. Apparently, they allow a scientist to determine how long the oil has contaminated the sea water, and how the sea water affected the oil collected with water. For instance, thousands of cubic meters of oil were collected through oil booms. Meaning, the oil is mixed with water and that a cleansing process must take place in order to use the oil once again. Chemical markers may now be placed into to the oil to determine how much the oil must be cleaned in order for it to be satisfactory.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetastable ion decompositions of TMS+ adducts {{of all the}} <b>saturated,</b> <b>acyclic</b> C- 5 -C- 7 ketones and of {{selected}} ketone conjugate acid ions are compared. The proportion of ions that result from rearrangement of the carbon skeleton tends to increase {{with the size of}} the starting ketone. Parent ions derived from alpha-branched ketones can be subdivided into pairs that rearrange and decompose via common intermediates. In addition to pathways outlined by previous workers, the present study delineates the involvement of ion-neutral complexes and also presents evidence for 1, 4 -hydride shift. Inclusion of this latter mechanism accentuates the parallelism between the rearrangements of gaseous TMS+ adducts and those of protonated ketones in solution. Loss of (CH 3) (3) SiOH from TMS+ adducts occurs primarily via 1, 2 -shift followed by 1, 3 -elimination, just as water loss takes place from ketones in superacid solution. In most cases the product from this elimination is an allylic cation, but 1, 4 -hydride shift appears more likely to produce a cyclopropylcarbinyl ion. Density functional calculations give relative energies of pertinent intermediates, products, and transition states for cationic rearrangements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{localized}} charge distributions defined previously {{are used}} to calculate INDO bond moments and energies {{of a variety of}} CH bonds in <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The polarity of all bonds discussed is c+H-. It is found that each basic type of CH bond (primary, vinyl, ethynyl) has an overflow of electron density (a 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2) out of the bond region which resides on and is characteristic of those atoms trans and coplanar to the bond. It is demonstrated that, since these tails are virtually independent of each other, the basic bond moments can be used to construct a model which predicts all calculated bond moments and orientations to a high degree of accuracy. While the total energies of the bonds ei (where the molecular energy E = iei) are not very transferable, the intra bond and interference energies can be predicted rather well using a similar model. The trends in the bond moments are discussed in terms of the point charge and polarization contributions, and the interference energies are shown to correlate well with the trends in experimental CH bond energies. The trends in both properties are principally determined by the loss of interference density within the bond due to the presence of overflow atoms...|$|R

Distinct isomers of <b>acyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (polyenes) {{are now under}} focus.

Terms to within the sixth order (k= 6) inclusive are shown to be of importance for discrimination between similar isomers.

Conjugated paths of various lengths (i. e. linear chains consisting of C=C and C-C bonds alternately) are shown {{to be the most important}} (but not the only) fragments contributing to stabilization of any acyclic pi-electron system. Again, new types of fragments (substructures) are revealed (viz. the so-called composite conjugated paths) that contribute to destabilization of the system concerned. As a result, formation of the total energy of an acyclic pi-electron system is concluded to be governed by an interplay between stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Accordingly, the perturbative approach applied offers us an extension of the concept of conjugated paths.

MPL has a main phase transition between − 15 and − 30 °C. Non-hydrated and hydrated samples of MPL 59 have been studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA). Non-hydrated MPL 59 does not exert any phase transition. Computer simulation of an unhydrated MPL molecule with four pentacycles and another without pentacyclations demonstrates similar behavior, i. e. the MPL molecules form coils with both polar ends getting closely together. The molecule without pentacyclation coils faster than that with pentacycles. With hydrated samples, DTA scanning conditions were varied. Under certain conditions, the shape of the calorimetric scans, i. e. occurrence of an additional (endotherm) phase transition peak at + 17 °C and enthalpy changes of the phase transitions indicate a (metastable) solid-analogue phase in MPL 59 in addition to the well-known liquid–crystalline phase.

Soil chemical analysis revealed high sulfate concentrations and low pH values (pH 2. 8 to 3. 8), which are characteristic of acid-sulfate geothermal activity. The hydrocarbon composition of the seep soils consisted almost entirely of <b>saturated,</b> <b>acyclic</b> alkanes (e. g., n-alkanes with chain lengths of C 15 to C 30, as well as branched alkanes, predominately pristane and phytane). Bacterial populations present in the seep soils were phylogenetically characterized by 16 S rRNA gene clone library analysis. The majority of the sequences recovered (> 75 %) were related to sequences of heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria, including Acidisphaera spp. and Acidiphilium spp. of the α-Proteobacteria. Clones related to the iron- and sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotroph Acidithiobacillus spp. were also recovered {{from one of the}} seep soils. Hydrocarbon-amended soil-sand mixtures were established to examine [14 C]hexadecane mineralization and corresponding changes in the bacterial populations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16 S rRNA gene fragments. Approximately 50 % of the [14 C]hexadecane added was recovered as 14 CO 2 during an 80 -day incubation, and this was accompanied by detection of heterotrophic acidophile-related sequences as dominant DGGE bands. An alkane-degrading isolate was cultivated, whose 16 S rRNA gene sequence was identical to the sequence of a dominant DGGE band in the soil-sand mixture, as well as the clone sequence recovered most frequently from the original soil. This and the presence of an alkB gene homolog in this isolate confirmed the alkane degradation capability of one population indigenous to acidic hydrocarbon seep soils...|$|R

Gas samples were collected from the first successful deployment of a pressure core barrel (PCB) in a hydrate region. The pressure decline curves from {{two of the four}} PCB retrievals at in situ pressures suggested the presence of small amounts of gas hydrates. Compositional and isotopic measurements of gases from several points along the pressure decline curve indicated that (1) biogenic methane (d 13 C = - 68 per mil; C 1 /C 2 = 5000) was the dominant gas (> 90 %); (2) little fractionation in the C 1 /C 2 ratio or the C carbon isotopic composition occurred as gas hydrates decomposed during pressure decline experiments; (3) the percent of C 3, i-C 4, and CO 2 degassed increased as the pressure declined, indicating that these molecules may help stabilize the hydrate structure; (4) excess nitrogen was present during initial degassing; and (5) C 1 /C 2 ratios and isotopic ratios of C gases were similar to those obtained from conventional core sampling. The PCB gas also contained trace amounts of <b>saturated,</b> <b>acyclic,</b> cyclic, and aromatic C 5 -C 14 hydrocarbons, as well as alkenes and tetrahydrothiophenes. Gas from a decomposed specimen of gas hydrate had similar molecular and isotopic ratios to the PCB gas (d 13 C of - 68 per mil for methane and a C 1 /C 2 ratio of about 6000).

Furthermore, the first chapter includes some history and perspective pertaining to the field of marine natural products and natural products in general. Chapter 2 is an analysis of sponge metabolites derived from several Indo-Pacific collections of Diacarnus cf spinopoculum. A series of new terpenes of the nuapapuin class (norditerpene peroxides) and muqubilin class (norsesterterpene peroxides) were isolated, along with the new dinorditerpenone muquketone. When these and other related isolates were screened for in vitro cytotoxicity, the diterpenes nuapapuin A methyl ester and nuapapuin 8 displayed selective behavior and thus were selected for in vivo evaluation. Chapter 3 is divided into two parts both involving the processing of organisms which contained small alkaloids. Part I details the study of Clathria basilana from which no chemistry was previously published. Five specimens were examined, but only one was found to contain the unique quinolizine, clathryimine A. When heated, this compound gave rise to the degradation product clathryimine B. Part 2 describes the isolation of phenethylguanidine analogs, the dihydrotubastrines, from a zoanthid-infested specimen of Petrosia cf. comignata.

However, {{the influence of}} fluorination on hydrogen-bond (HB) properties of adjacent functional groups, {{as well as the}} HB-accepting capacity of fluorine itself, is still not completely understood. Although the formation of OH???F intramolecular HBs (IMHBs) has been established for conformationally restricted fluorohydrins, such interaction in flexible compounds remained questionable. Herein is demonstrated for the first time—and in contrast to earlier reports—the occurrence of OH???F IMHBs in <b>acyclic</b> <b>saturated</b> ?-fluorohydrins, even for the parent 3 -fluoropropan- 1 -ol.

40|$|Relative {{strengths}} of surface interaction for individual carbon atoms in <b>acyclic</b> and cyclic <b>hydrocarbons</b> adsorbed on alumina surfaces are determined using chemically resolved 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) T 1 relaxation times. The ratio of relaxation times for the adsorbed atoms T 1,ads to the bulk liquid relaxation time T 1,bulk provides {{an indication of the}} mobility of the atom. Hence a low T 1,ads/T 1,bulk ratio indicates a stronger surface interaction. The carbon atoms associated with unsaturated bonds in the molecules are seen to exhibit a larger reduction in T 1 on adsorption relative to the aliphatic carbons, consistent with adsorption occurring through the carbon-carbon multiple bonds. The relaxation data are interpreted in terms of proximity of individual carbon atoms to the alumina surface and adsorption conformations are inferred. Furthermore, variations of interaction strength and molecular configuration have been explored as a function of adsorbate coverage, temperature, surface pre-treatment, and in the presence of co-adsorbates. This relaxation time analysis is appropriate for studying the behaviour of hydrocarbons adsorbed {{on a wide range of}} catalyst support and supported-metal catalyst surfaces, and offers the potential to explore such systems under realistic operating conditions when multiple chemical components are present at the surface...|$|R

Several pairs of smallest graphs and compounds are identified that cannot be distinguished using selected combinations of invariants such as combinations of Balaban’s index J and graph matrix eigenvalues. As the most important result, it can now be stated that the computer program NIMSG, using J and distance eigenvalues, is safe within the domain of mono- through tetracyclic saturated hydrocarbon substructures up to n = 10 (oligocyclic decanes) and of all acyclic alkane substructures up to n = 19 (nonadecanes), i. e. it will not miss any of these substructures. For the regions surrounding this safe domain, upper limits are found for the numbers of substructures that may {{be lost in the}} worst case, and these are low. This taken together means that the computer program can be reasonably employed in chemistry whenever one is interested in finding the saturated hydrocarbon substructures. As to unsaturated and heteroatom containing substructures, there are reasons to conjecture that the method’s resolving power for them is similar. ...|$|R
