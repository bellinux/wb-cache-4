5|$|Von Kressenstein had {{prepared}} successive lines of defence during his advance towards Romani, and despite losing one artillery battery {{and more than}} one third of his soldiers, fought a series of effective rearguard actions which <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> pursuit by British Empire mounted troops and enabled his force to retreat back to El Arish.|$|E
5|$|Although CNT {{had secured}} fully {{complete}} plans from Weser, the Austro-Hungarian design modifications delayed {{the start of}} construction. Additional changes after construction had begun <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> boats' progress. Compounding this were shortages of both material and skilled shipyard workers, further slowing construction. As a result, neither {{of the first two}} boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the second pair was cancelled before either was laid down. U-48 was 70% complete at the war's end, while U-49 was only 55% complete. Both boats were scrapped in place in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E

Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested.

He performed relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> completion of the divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was {{subject to the same}} environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very slowly towards the coast.|$|E

Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer-range and smaller-calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden Field.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition {{from the}} North Vietnamese was {{light and the}} primary problem that {{hampered}} the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered an NVA blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.|$|E
5|$|Relief {{efforts were}} {{initiated}} by Japanese and American governments immediately following Typhoon Vera. Due to the inundation {{caused by the}} typhoon, localized epidemics were reported, including those of dysentery and tetanus. The spread of disease and blocking debris <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> ongoing relief efforts. Due to the unprecedented damage and loss of life following Vera, the National Diet passed legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters. This included {{the passage of the}} Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961, which set standards for Japanese disaster relief, including the establishment of the Central Disaster Prevention Council.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the Navier-Stokes equation between planar plates, the equation of motion of the Binghamian grouts is deduced in smooth and inclined fissures.

And the greater the pressure is, the greater the speed is, as a result, the Binghamian grouts has a further infiltration. The velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts {{has nothing to do with}} fissure inclination.

5|$|The German {{commander}} Albert Kesselring {{fought a}} stubborn delaying action, gradually withdrawing his armies north with three Allied columns in pursuit, the 6th Armoured Division leading the most westerly spearhead of the Eighth Army in the centre. The mountainous terrain and the {{effective use of}} anti-tank weapons by the retreating Germans made the Allies' superiority in armour less decisive and <b>slowed</b> <b>the</b> Allied advance north to {{the banks of the}} Arno between June and August 1944, during which time the Rhodesian tank squadrons took part in Allied victories at Castellana, Bagnoregio and Chiusi.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 October, when the Kaiser-class battleships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula.
