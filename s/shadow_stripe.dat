50|$|Damara zebras are {{described}} as being striped on the head, the neck, and the flanks, and sparsely down the upper segments of the limbs then fading to white. One or two <b>shadow</b> <b>stripes</b> rest between the bold, broad stripes on the haunch. This main, distinguishing characteristic sets the Zuzuland Zebra apart from the other subspecies. Gray (1824), observed a distinct dorsal line, the tail only bristly at the end, and the body distinctly white. The dorsal line is narrow and becomes gradually broader in the hinder part, distinctly margined with white on each side.|$|R
5000|$|This {{northern}} subspecies is vertically striped in front, horizontally on {{the back}} legs, and diagonally on the rump and hind flanks. <b>Shadow</b> <b>stripes</b> are absent or only poorly expressed. The stripes, {{as well as the}} inner-spaces, are broad and well defined. Northerly specimens may lack a mane. Grant’s zebras grow to be about 120 to 140 cm tall, and generally weigh about 300 kg. [...] The zebras live in family groups of up to 17 or 18 zebras, and they are led by a single stallion. Grant’s zebras live an average of 20 years.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the pelt of an {{apparently}} melanistic tiger was confiscated from a hunter and smuggler at Tis Hazari, south Delhi. The {{top of the}} head and back were black, while the sides showed <b>shadow</b> <b>striping</b> on a black background color. The pelt was exhibited at the National Museum of Natural History, New Delhi, in February 1993. In 1993, a young boy shot a melanistic female tiger in self defence with a bow and arrow, near the village of Podagad, west of Similipal Tiger Reserve. Initial examination suggested the background color was black with white abdominal stripes and tawny dorsal stripes. According to Valmik Thapar in Tiger: The Ultimate Guide, the only proof of black tigers is a skin with a black head and back. K. Ullas Karanth wrote in The Way Of The Tiger that a partially black tiger was recently killed by poachers in Assam.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Chapmans zebra (Equus quagga chapmani) is a {{subspecies}} of Plains Zebra. It can {{be distinguished}} from other groups by the ochre or off-white base colour, distinct <b>shadow</b> <b>stripes</b> and legs that are striped almost down to the hooves. Its populations may be found throughout the southern Africa in almost all biotopes. This subspecies of zebra usually forms small family groups [...] harems, consisting of a single stallion, from one up to six mares, and their recent offspring. This family group is accompanied by bachelor groups formed by bachelor males and older offspring. Harems are highly stable; changes in their composition are rather rare. Zebras were monitored for two days using the method of interval recording, once {{in a period of}} time from a week to a month. The monitoring took place in ZOO Liberec. From the observation is evident that most of the time is spent on food intake. The evaluation of contact counts (minus contacts identified as aggression) implied the existence of individual preference. Taking into account some factors such as the mares` age, consanguinity, oestrus and the weather we demonstrate that neither of these factors has influence on the preference of individual mares by the stallion. This question should be addressed further by monitoring other groups of Plains Zebra, either wild animals or animals in human care. It might be useful to consider other factors possibly having influence on the individual preference of the stallion...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{greenhouses}} built with solar panels {{integrated into the}} roof. In summer time this will operate very well, although broad <b>shadow</b> <b>stripes</b> can result in growth and yield differences. In winter the amount of sunlight is further limited by the solar panels and will result in further reduction of light accession to the cultivation space. As a result, the crops suffer from growth problems. These drawbacks are eliminated by the application of Concentrating Power Systems (CSP) with Fresnel lenses. A Fresnel lens works like a normal lens but is much thinner. When the sun shines, the lens receives both direct and indirect sunlight. The lens will concentrate all direct sunlight, which can be collected as thermal energy in the focal point. This absorbed radiation can be converted with an absorption cooler into cold water for cooling. This cold water can cool the greenhouse without the need of water use. The indirect solar radiation, the diffuse light will not focus and is therefore available as a fairly constant light source in the building or in the greenhouse. The capture of all direct radiation at high intensities will diminish the incoming heat load, which is useful for a better internal climate control of greenhouses and buildings. This lower heat load {{makes it easier to}} keep the greenhouse cool with the absorber. In this study the details of energy flows and thermal conversion with absorption cooler is determined. Calculation shows a 47 % heat load reduction (from 337 W/m 2 to 157 W/m 2) with the Fresnel lenses in the covering of the greenhouse. In the case of the collector in focus, only 48 % of the captured direct radiation, available as thermal energy, is required to cool the greenhouse further with an absorption cooler. Cooling a greenhouse can result in up to 90 % reduction in water consumption of the cultivation. The possibility of light regulation is another important advantage the Fresnel lenses have. The light amount can vary between 15 – 77 % of the incoming radiation. The access of the generated energy can be used for extra illumination (light and energy regulation) and/or energy supply and/or a desalination system...|$|R
60|$|Towards {{morning he}} slept, {{and then for}} days and nights, how many he did not know, {{it seemed to him}} that he did not wake but dreamed through a {{changing}} time when he was dimly aware of contending voices: voices of his believers, the Little Flock, and voices of his unbelievers, the Herd of the Lost, pleading and threatening in the forest round his place of refuge. His followers were trying to bring him food and raiment, and his enemies were preventing them and boasting that they would keep guard over his refuge till they starved him out. Then all again was a blur, a texture of conscious and unconscious misery till a night came when the woof broke and trailed away from him, and he lifted himself on his elbow and after he had drunk a long draft from the spring, found tremulous strength to get to his feet. He tried some steps in the open space, where the light of the full moon fell, and found that he could walk. He reached the tangled entrance to his covert, and stealthily put the vines aside. He peered out into the <b>shadows</b> <b>striped</b> with moonshine and could see no one, and he was going to venture farther, when he stopped stone still at the figure of a man crouched in the middle of the causeway. The man's head was fallen forward and his gun lay across his lap; he must be one of the guards that his enemies had set on his refuge to keep him there and starve him out; and he must be asleep. Dylks stooped and peered into his face and knew the man for one of the Hounds who had often disturbed his meetings, and now he looked about in the rage that surged up through his penitence and self-pity for a stone or a club to strike him senseless, or dead if need be. But there was no such weapon that he could see, and the risk of a struggle was greater than the risk of trying to pass the man without waking him. After long doubt he tried with one foot and then another and the man did not wake; then he crept slowly by, and then with softly dragging steps he got farther from the sleeper and pushed on through the woods in the direction of the turnpike, as he imagined it. But he came out in a clearing where a new log cabin showed clear in the open under the moon.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of establishing an animal model of chronic radiation-induced lung injury. MethodsTwenty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups (the right lung irradiation group, the whole lung irradiation group and the control group). Animal model of radiation-induced lung injury was established by high-does radiotherapy in the irradiation groups, then all rabbits underwent CT and pathological examinations at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 weeks, respectively after radiation. ResultsWithin 4 weeks of irradiation, some rabbits in the right lung irradiation group and whole lung irradiation group died. CT and pathological examinations all showed acute radiation pneumonitis. At 8 – 12 weeks after irradiation, CT scanning showed ground glass samples signs, patchy <b>shadows</b> and fibrotic <b>stripes.</b> Pathological examination showed the fibrosis pulmonary alveolar wall thickened obviously. ConclusionsThe clinical animal model of chronic radiation-induced lung injury which corresponds to practical conditions in clinic can be successfully established...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{images with}} clouds, <b>shadows</b> or <b>stripes</b> are usually {{considered}} as defective data which limit their application for change detection. This paper proposes {{a method to}} fuse a series of defective images as evidences for change detection. In the proposed method, post-classification comparison process is firstly performed on multi-source defective images. Then, the classification results of all the images, together with their corresponding confusion matrixes are {{used to calculate the}} Basic Belief Assignment (BBA) of each pixel. Further, based on the principle of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, a BBA redistribution process is introduced to deal with the defective parts of multi-source data. At last, evidential fusion and decision making rules are applied on the pixel level, and the final map of change detection can be derived. The proposed method can finish change detection with data fusion and image completion in one integrated process, which makes use of the complementary and redundant information from the input images. The method is applied to a case study of landslide barrier lake formed in Aug. 3 rd, 2014, with a series of multispectral images from different sensors of GF- 1 satellite. Result shows that the proposed method can not only complete the defective parts of the input images, but also provide better change detection accuracy than post-classification comparison method with single pair of pre- and post-change images. Subsequent analysis indicates that high conflict degree between evidences is the main source of errors in the result. Finally, some possible reasons that result in evidence conflict on the pixel level are analysed...|$|R
2500|$|The Bulls {{have three}} {{different}} uniforms: a white uniform, a red uniform, {{and a black}} alternate uniform. The design of the white and red sets are nearly identical, with the team name featured on the front over the number, and the player's last name over {{the number on the}} back and under the Bulls' logo. The shorts have the Bulls logo in a diamond shaped design {{on the sides of the}} legs. The red and white uniforms have remained mostly unchanged since 1966, with minor modifications from off-centered numbers, drop <b>shadows</b> and side <b>stripes</b> to white lettering and [...] "Chicago" [...] wordmark on the road uniforms. The present red/white uniform design was unveiled in the 1985–86 season, first using screen printing (with the player names in block lettering without the additional trim), before returning to the traditional sewing methods (player names are in serifed block lettering and with added trim). The Bulls logo was added atop the player's name in 2004. In the 2014–15 season, a gold tab representing the Bulls' six championships was added on the back hemline, while the NBA logo replaced the Bulls logo atop the player's name.|$|R
