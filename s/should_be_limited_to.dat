5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, {{on a visit to}} London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E

25|$|People with A-T have an {{increased}} sensitivity to ionizing radiation (X-rays and gamma rays). Therefore, X-ray exposure <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> times when it is medically necessary, as exposing an A-T patient to ionizing radiation can damage cells {{in such a way}} that the body cannot repair them. The cells can cope normally with other forms of radiation, such as ultraviolet light, so there is no need for special precautions from sunlight exposure.|$|E
25|$|Charge {{generation}} increases {{at higher}} fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes 8inches (200mm) or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes pipe flow velocity limits. Because water content {{has a large}} impact on the fluids dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> 1 meter per second.|$|E
25|$|Divorce and {{subsequent}} remarriage is accepted, with reservations. Abortion is accepted, because the church deems {{that the woman}} {{has the right to}} decide to terminate the pregnancy but the woman is not allowed to make the decision alone. Abortion <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> serious cases where the birth would cause serious danger or suffering either to the family or the child. Such cases should be defined in legislation, which is the case in Finland. However, the woman pondering abortion should get all possible support before and after the decision, regardless of its outcome.|$|E

25|$|It is {{recommended}} in NICE guidance of June 2001 {{that it should}} be used for nonsmall cell lung cancer in patients unsuitable for curative treatment, and in first-line and second-line treatment of ovarian cancer. In September 2001, NICE recommended paclitaxel should be available for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the failure of anthracyclic chemotherapy, but that its first-line use <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> clinical trials. In September 2006, NICE recommended paclitaxel should not be used in the adjuvant treatment of early node-positive breast cancer. In 2005, its use in the United States for the treatment of breast, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancers was approved by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with {{a single}} vault have {{interchangeable}} containers to collect the fecal material. Depending {{on the size of}} the vault, two or more containers can be stored inside. Containers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a maximum volume of approximately 50 litres, so that they still can be manually moved when they fill up. Once a container is full, it can be left for further dehydration or removed for further treatment. Removal of the container requires care due to fresh, potentially pathogen-loaded feces being on top of the pile in the container. Because of the limited ventilation within a plastic bucket, such single-vault UDDTs may not reduce the pathogen load as effectively as double-vault UDDTs. Therefore, a post-treatment of the fecal material is usually required. This can be achieved through further dehydration, composting processes or heat treatments.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} of the committee were that pensions allowances and payments should not in future be granted in perpetuity, {{on the ground that}} such grants <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the persons actually rendering the service, and that such reward should be defrayed by the generation benefited; that offices with salaries and without duties, or with merely nominal duties, ought to be abolished; that all existing perpetual pensions and payments and all hereditary offices should be abolished: that where no service or merely nominal service is rendered by the holder of an hereditary office or the original grantee of a pension, the pension or payment should in no case continue beyond the life of the present holder and that in all cases the method of commutation ought to ensure a real and substantial saving to the nation (the existing rate, about 27 years purchase, being considered by the committee to be too high). These recommendations of the committee were adopted by the government and outstanding hereditary pensions were gradually commuted, the only ones left outstanding being those to Lord Rodney (£2,000) and to Lord Nelson (£5,000), both chargeable on the Consolidated Fund.|$|E

25|$|In late December 1915, Major Bornemann, {{commander}} of the 26th Division field artillery, wrote a report in which he described failures of communication, which led to an advantage created by the blowing of a mine being squandered by the artillery. Bornemann wrote that artillery battery observation posts had been left unmanned, {{on the assumption that}} they had been superseded by artillery liaison officers in the front line. Reporting had been inadequate due to complacency and reports should have been circulated to all headquarters rather than individual officers assuming that the information had been communicated. The artillery should avoid settling into routine firing, since prisoners had reported that its predictability made it easy to evade and limiting firing to the area in front of batteries should cease and oblique firing into adjacent sectors begin, to ensure that British artillery could not fire with impunity from the flanks. Concentrations of fire consumed too much ammunition on local targets and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> provide ammunition for firing on other targets, to disrupt British operations and to reassure German infantry {{that they would not be}} abandoned by the artillery.|$|E
25|$|Fifth, {{the holders}} of a {{floating}} charge holders must be paid. Like a fixed charge, a floating charge {{can be created}} by a contract with a company before insolvency. Like with a fixed charge, this is usually done {{in return for a}} loan from a bank. But unlike a fixed charge, a floating charge need not refer to a specific asset of the company. It can cover the entire business, including a fluctuating body of assets that is traded with day today, or assets that a company will receive in future. The preferential categories were created by statute to prevent secured creditors taking all assets away. This reflected the view that the power of freedom of contract <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> protect employees, small businesses or consumers who have unequal bargaining power. After funds are taken away to pay all preferential groups and the holder of a floating charge, the remaining money due to unsecured creditors. In 2001 recovery rates were found to be 53% of one's debt for secured lenders, 35% for preferential creditors but only 7% for unsecured creditors on average. Seventh comes any money due for interest on debts proven in the winding up process. In eighth place is money due to company members under a share redemption contract. Ninth are debts due to members who hold preferential rights. And tenth, ordinary shareholders, have the right to residual assets.|$|E
500|$|Gage {{later came}} {{to change his}} opinion about {{the source of the}} unrest, believing that {{democracy}} was a significant threat. He saw the movement of colonists into the interior, beyond effective Crown control, and the development of the town meeting as a means of local governance as major elements of the threat, and wrote in 1772 that [...] "democracy is too prevalent in America". [...] He believed that town meetings should be abolished and recommended that colonisation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the coastal areas where British rule could be enforced.|$|E
