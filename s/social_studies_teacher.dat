There is a disconnection between what <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> think they do and what actually happens on the ground.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a {{critical}} textbook usage method so that <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> can conduct unit development study. Critical textbook usage is the method by which we teach students the relative and political nature of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> textbooks, enabling them to understand that textbooks do not represent the neutral and absolute truth. The author, on the basis of this method, develops a lesson plan for teaching junior high school students that the textbook’s explanations contain only some of the truth about why the Sino-Japanese War was prolonged. The results demonstrate a strategy for disseminating unit development <b>study</b> among <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> under the situation where they are legally required to use authorized textbooks. Unit development study is the most effective methodology to develop students into democratic citizens who do not blindly obey authorities and superstitions. However, it is difficult to widely disseminate this methodology among teachers because it requires them to develop lessons without a textbook. <b>Social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> therefore must realize that developing lessons by using only a textbook instills in students the belief that it contains the neutral and absolute truth, thus failing to develop them into democratic citizens. The method proposed in this <b>study</b> makes <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>teachers</b> aware of the importance of conducting unit development study by changing their method of using a textbook in lessons. 本研究の目的は，批判的教科書活用論という教科書活用法を提起することによって，教育内容開発に取り組む教師文化を醸成することと，その手立てを具体的に示すことである。批判的教科書活用論とは，教科書記述が多様な解釈の一つに過ぎない相対的真理であることや，社会の現実を生産・変革する政治的実践であることを学習させることによって，その記述が中立公平な絶対的真理ではないことを子どもに理解させる社会科授業作りの方法である。本研究では，この授業作りの方法に基づいて，日中戦争が長期化した理由を説明する教科書記述が，多様な歴史解釈の一つに過ぎない相対的真理であることを学習させる中学校歴史学習の授業モデルを開発した...|$|R
