25|$|Acro dancers {{most often}} wear jazz dance shoes, which are {{commonly}} referred to as acro shoes by acro dancers. Acro shoes are called jazz boots, jazz ankle boots, jazz booties and other names, by their various manufacturers. They are typically laceless, slip-on shoes, with tight-fitting leather uppers that are designed to prevent the dancer's feet from shifting inside the shoes. Because of their thin, pliable leather uppers and split soles, acro shoes have excellent flexibility, thus enabling dancers to attain both good dance form and acrobatic control. The sole is made of soft, composite rubber so as to provide both high traction and cushioning, and it provides excellent protection from <b>skin</b> <b>abrasion</b> as it covers the entire bottom of the foot.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the most}} common types of acro {{footwear}} provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from <b>skin</b> <b>abrasion.</b> Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the hard floor. Cushioning serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. Cushioning is especially important when a Marley floor is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 356 piglets from one farm were {{examined}} for foot and skin lesions {{every day for}} the first 10 days after birth, and then on alternate days until they were weaned. Over a period of 24 days 100 per cent of the piglets examined developed sole bruising, and 49. 1 per cent developed sole erosions. Sole bruising lasted for an average of 13 days and sole erosions for seven days. At the beginning of the study, a higher proportion of piglets had mild sole bruising; from three to nine days of age piglets had moderate sole bruising but from days 10 to 20 mild bruising was again observed more frequently. Skin lesions were observed on the carpal aspect of the front limbs; 60. 9 per cent of the piglets developed <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions,</b> 70. 7 per cent developed healed wounds and 90 per cent developed hairless patches. The <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions</b> lasted on average for six days, the healed wounds for five days and the hairless patches for eight days. Piglets which developed sole bruising and/or sole erosions {{on the first day of}} life were significantly heavier than those which did not Continuous observations of the piglets' behaviour during the first six days of life showed that sole bruising increased as the total time spent in the creep area or lying near the sow on the solid floor increased. During the first three days of life <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions</b> increased as the total time spent lying in the creep area increased. There was a positive correlation between the total time piglets spent suckling and the incidence of carpal <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions</b> between four and six days of age.

50|$|Exophiala phaeomuriformis {{is a rare}} causative {{agent of}} phaeohyphomycosis in cutaneous, {{subcutaneous}} and deep tissues, and is responsible for 6.4% of infections caused by black yeasts. Infection usually occurs following <b>skin</b> <b>abrasion</b> or penetrating injuries. Exophiala phaeomuriformis can also cause corneal infection following eye exposure to contaminated water. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are considered abnormally susceptible to Exophiala infections, including E. phaeomuriformis. It {{has been suggested that}} differences in the microbiota profiles of CF patients may be responsible for this predisposition. Treatment of E. phaeomuriformis involves a combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy. A range of antifungal agents including caspofungin, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin B are active against this species. Due to its pathogenic potential, E. phaeomuriformis is regarded as a Biosafety Risk Group 2 agent in the laboratory.|$|E

5000|$|The mask {{required}} to deliver CPAP {{must have an}} effective seal, and be held on very securely. The [...] "nasal pillow" [...] mask maintains its seal by being inserted slightly into the nostrils and being {{held in place by}} various straps around the head. Some full-face masks [...] "float" [...] on the face like a hover-craft, with thin, soft, flexible [...] "curtains" [...] ensuring less <b>skin</b> <b>abrasion,</b> and the possibility of coughing and yawning. Some people may find wearing a CPAP mask uncomfortable or constricting: eyeglass wearers and bearded men may prefer the nasal-pillow type of mask. Breathing out against the positive pressure resistance (the expiratory positive airway pressure component, or EPAP) may also feel unpleasant to some patients. These factors lead to inability to continue treatment due to patient intolerance in about 20% of cases where it is initiated. Some machines have pressure relief technologies that makes sleep therapy more comfortable by reducing pressure at the beginning of exhalation and returning to therapeutic pressure just before inhalation. The level of pressure relief is varied based on the patient’s expiratory flow, making breathing out against the pressure less difficult. Those who suffer an anxiety disorder or claustrophobia are less likely to tolerate PAP treatment. Sometimes medication will be given to assist with the anxiety caused by PAP ventilation.|$|E
50|$|Many assessors, {{including}} Marie Ragone and Diane Fenex, considered straitjackets to be {{a humane}} form of treatment, far gentler than the chains patients encountered in prisons.

Unlike patients anchored to a chair or bed by straps or handcuffs, those in a straitjacket could walk. Some registered nurse specialists even recommended restrained individuals stroll outdoors, thereby reaping the benefits of both control and fresh air.|$|R
40|$|During winter 1994 - 95, {{four and}} three sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were {{stranded}} along the Belgian and the Dutch coasts, respectively. Necropsies and tissue samplings were collected 24 hrs post mortem. Lesions on several whales included round and linear skin scars, ventral <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions,</b> acute <b>skin</b> ulcers, acute ulcerative stomatitides, acute to chronic external otitides, and passive visceral congestion. In addition, these sperm whales {{appeared to be}} debilitated with severe weight deficit, had blubber thickness reduction, the absence of abdominal fat, and the intestinal tracts were almost empty. Three categories of lesions and their possible relation with the stranding were evaluated. Cutaneous scars observed on the seven whales appeared to have no relation with the stranding. The poor body condition and acute integument ulcerative lesions were present before the stranding. Ventral <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions</b> and visceral passive congestion were caused by the strandings. Absence of food in the alimentary tracts, evidence of weight loss and blubber thickness reduction were compatible with an extended presence of the sperm whales in the North Sea, where adequate food is not available. This might lead to progressive weakness, predisposing the animals to secondary pathogens such as viral diseases. Finally, the coastal configuration of the southern North Sea makes it a trap for sperm whales which have entered the area during their wanderings. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{literature}} review is to compile research about common health events that occur at summer camp and the associated immune system processes. By creating a link between typical summer camp injuries, illnesses, and the resulting immune responses, this review can educate youth, parents, and camp staff about {{health and safety of}} children attending summer camps. Research in these areas was assembled in three ways: first, by analyzing my own experience as a camper, counselor, and administrative team member; second, by applying content from courses "Physiology of the Immune System" and "Infancy and Childhood Development"; and third, by examining research previously done and posted in various journals, books, and websites. Using the fictional camper, Calvin, he experiences four common issues; <b>skin</b> <b>abrasions,</b> insect bites, parasite ingestion, and contact dermatitis. <b>Skin</b> <b>abrasions</b> result in release of cytokines that stimulate an acute inflammatory response. With the activation of the plasma-kinin and coagulation cascades, the inflammation is kept local and the wound heals. Insect bites lead to activation of antibodies, which are able to clear countless extracellular infections due to high variability and specificity. Similarly, a special class of antibodies, specifically IgE, clears parasite infections. Lastly, contact dermatitis results from a type IV immune response, in which T-helper cells react excessively. Further research is required to report sufficient safety and preventive practices...|$|R
