The rolls used to <b>supercalender</b> uncoated paper usually consist of cast iron and highly compressed paper, while the rolls used for coated paper are usually cast iron and highly compressed cotton. The finish produced varies according to the raw material used to make the paper and the pressure exerted on it, and ranges from the highest English finish to a highly glazed surface. <b>Supercalendered</b> papers are sometimes used for books containing fine line blocks or halftones because they print well from type and halftones, although for the latter they are not as good as coated paper.|$|R

40|$|Many European and North American <b>Supercalendered</b> (SC) paper {{manufacturers}} have begun using precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) fillers or are running trials to evaluate PCC. The drivers for this interest are the optical and bulk advantages that PCC {{can bring to}} this grade as well as overall cost savings. These drivers give the SC producer some key advantages in the increasingly competitive publication papers market. To most effectively use PCC fillers, {{it is best to}} take a “holistic “ approach to the conversion. This requires that all aspects of the paper production process are examined including the pulp/bleach plant, the paper machine, the <b>supercalenders,</b> and the printing processes used to print the paper. When this planning is properly done, low risk trials can be run and conversions can be completed rapidly with a relatively short “learning curve”. PCC and the SC Paper Market As shown in Table 1 below, a number of mills producing SC and soft-nip calendered (SNC) grades have either converted to alkaline or have recently run trials with calcium carbonate fillers. These mills have considered both PCC and ground calcium carbonate (GCC), but are primarily focusing on PCC because of the overall superior optical and printability properties obtained with PCC.

50|$|When the {{railroad}} was extended through Madison in 1875, larger mills were built. The first Madison Woolen Mill {{was constructed in}} 1881 near the bridge between Madison and Anson, with the firm's second mill built nearby in 1887. In 1890, the Manufacturing Investment Company built a sulfite mill, but it failed. It was taken over in 1899 by the Great Northern Paper Company, which rebuilt the plant to produce wood pulp and paper. Like many New England textile manufacturers, the town's woolen mills eventually went out of business, but the pulp and paper mill remains today as the Madison Paper Industries which will close by May 2016 due to low demand for <b>supercalender</b> paper and Canadian competition.|$|R

Investments from 1958 to 1963 cost NOK165 million. By 1964 the company was producing 130,000 tonnes annually of various paper grades, up four-fold since 1950. The company had 3,000 employees, of which about 1,000 worked in the forests.|$|R
25|$|Norske Skog's board {{decided in}} December 1990 {{to close the}} sulfite pulp mill and build a new {{magazine}} paper machine, PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact {{as well as by}} a steady diminishing demand for chemical pulp. The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the main facility. Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight coated paper, but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to <b>supercalender.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoupled {{transfers}} of aroma compounds and water vapour were investigated by varying the relative humidity gradient of storage (50 % or 90 %) of two paper packaging at 25 degrees C. These papers differed in their coating surface: both were identically impregnated then <b>supercalendered,</b> {{and only one}} was twice coated {{on both sides with}} a synthetic barrier substance. Permeability and solubility coefficients were determined. The coating treatment was more effective to decrease the permeabilities of water vapour and ethyl ester than the effect of RH. On the contrary, the RH modified the water content of the treated papers and affected more strongly their permeability and solubility to cis- 3 -hexenol and benzaldehyde. The cis- 3 -hexenol transfer through the non-coated paper and the benzaldehyde transfer through the coated paper decreased due to a probable competition with sorbed water although it increases for the cis- 3 -hexenol of a plasticisation phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{refining}} trial was conducted using the ATMP (Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp) refining concept with White spruce as raw material. Low-intensity TMP and high-intensity TMP with mechanical pre-treatment of chips {{were compared to}} ATMP (Mg+P), where development of fibres was enhanced using hydrogen peroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The main goal of the trial was to evaluate the potential of using ATMP process for production of SC (<b>supercalendered)</b> magazine paper. SC paper is especially demanding {{when it comes to}} the paper surface structure which is strongly influenced by the development of fibre properties. Improvement in individual fibre properties such as flexibility, fibre split index and fibre surface area index achieved using ATMP process was found to translate into decreased surface roughness and air permeability of calendered laboratory sheets. Both the refining process configuration and the addition of process chemicals were found to have significant impacts though the process configuration had major role. The influence of process chemicals on PPS was mainly pronounced after second stage refining. The magnitude of surface roughening (fibre rising) was found to be influenced mainly by the process configuration...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the novel wood chip {{refining}} process called AdvancedThermomechanical Pulp (ATMP) refining. ATMP consists of mechanical pretreatmentof chips in Impressafiner and Fiberizer prior to first stage refining atincreased intensity. Process chemicals (this study was concentrated on hydrogenperoxide and magnesium hydroxide) are introduced into the first stage refiner. It is known that the use of chemicals in TMP process and first stage refining atelevated intensity can reduce the energy demands of refining. The downside is thatthey also alter the character of the produced pulp. Reductions in fibre length andtear index are usually the consequences of refining at elevated intensity. Additionof chemicals usually leads to reduction of the light scattering coefficient. Usingstatistical methods it was shown {{that it is possible to}} maintain the TMP character ofthe pulp using the ATMP process. This is explained by a separation of thedefibration and the fibre development phases in refining. This separation allowsdefibration of chips to fibres and fibre bundles without addition of chemicals orincrease in refining intensity. Chemicals are applied in the fibre developmentphase only (first stage refiner). The energy demand in refining to reach tensileindex of 25 Nm/g was reduced by up to 1. 1 MWh/odt (42 %) using the ATMPprocess on Loblolly pine. The energy demand in refining of White spruce, requiredto reach tensile index of 30 Nm/g, was reduced by 0. 65 MWh/odt (37 %). Characterizations of individual fibre properties, properties of sheets made fromlong fibre fractions and model fibre sheets with different fines fractions werecarried out. It was established that both the process equipment configuration (i. e. the mechanical pre‐treatment and the elevated refining intensity) and the additionof process chemicals in the ATMP process influence fibre properties such as external and internal fibrillation as well as the amount of split fibres. Improvementof these properties translated into improved properties of sheets, made from thelong fibre fractions of the studied pulps. The quality of the fines fraction alsoimproved. However, the mechanisms of improvement in the fines quality seem tobe different for fines, generated using improved process configuration andaddition of process chemicals. The first type of fines contributed to better bondingof model long fibre sheets through the densification of the structure. Fines whichhave been influenced by the addition of the process chemicals seemed in additionto improve bonding between long fibres by enhancing the specific bond strength. The improved fibre and fines properties also translated into better airpermeability and surface roughness of paper sheets, properties which areespecially important for <b>supercalendered</b> (SC) printing paper. The magnitude offibre roughening after moistening was mainly influenced by the processequipment configuration while the addition of process chemicals yielded lowestfinal surface roughness due to the lowest initial surface roughness. There was nodifference in how fines fractions from the studied processes influenced the fibreroughening. However, fines with better bonding yielded model fibre sheets withhigher PPS, probably due to their consolidation around fibre joints. Hence, thedecrease in PPS can probably be attributed to the improvements in the long fibrefraction properties while the improvement of fines quality contributed to thereduction of air permeability. The process chemicals, utilized in the ATMP process (Mg(OH) 2 and H 2 O 2) alsoproved to be an effective bleaching system. Comparable increases in brightnesscould be reached using the ATMP process and conventional tower bleaching. Maximum brightness of the pulp was reached after approximately 10 minutes ofhigh‐consistency storage after refining or 40 minutes of conventional bleaching. This study was conducted using a pilot scale refiner system operated as a batchprocess. Most of the experiments were performed using White spruce (Piceaglauca). In Paper I, Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) was used. It is believed that theresults presented in this thesis are valid for other softwood raw materials as well,but this limitation should be considered...|$|R
