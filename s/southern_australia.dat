5|$|Although {{the bird}} is not {{considered}} endangered over {{the majority of its}} range, populations are showing some decline, especially in <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> and local action plans are being undertaken in some areas. It is the official bird emblem of the state of Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} arid regions across <b>southern</b> <b>Australia</b> are nomadic; they follow {{water and food}} supply {{around the country in}} an {{irregular}} pattern, unrelated to season but related to rainfall. Several years may pass between visits to an area by a particular species.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 2016, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that a man had found what could possibly be debris from the aircraft at a location on Kangaroo Island, <b>southern</b> <b>Australia.</b> South Australian police collected the shoebox-sized piece and {{it was to be}} delivered to the ATSB for further investigation. The examination found out it was not from the missing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The species {{occurs in}} <b>southern</b> Western <b>Australia,</b> <b>southern</b> South <b>Australia,</b> and western Victoria.|$|R
50|$|This nerite is {{endemic to}} the <b>southern</b> coastlands of <b>Australia,</b> {{including}} South <b>Australia,</b> <b>southern</b> Western <b>Australia</b> , Victoriaand Tasmania. N. atramentosa occurs {{to the west}} of Wilsons Promontory in western Victoria, South <b>Australia</b> and <b>southern</b> Western <b>Australia.</b> The closely related species Nerita melanotragus occurs in eastern Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania.|$|R

5|$|Brolgas are {{widespread}} and often abundant in north and north-east Australia, especially north-east Queensland, and are common {{as far south}} as Victoria. They are also found in southern New Guinea and as rare vagrants in New Zealand and the northern part of Western Australia. The population in northern Australia is estimated at between 20,000 and 100,000 birds and in <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> 1,000 birds. The numbers of individuals in New Guinea are unknown. Until 1961, Brolgas were thought to be the only species of crane in Australia, until the Sarus Crane showed up.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} cartilaginous fishes off <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> the sparsely-spotted stingaree has a relatively wide distribution extending from Crowdy Head in New South Wales to Lancelin in Western Australia, including the entirety of Tasmania. Its range has expanded southward {{in the past few}} decades, apparently due to climate change. In Port Phillip, its numbers increased from 1970 to 1991, likely as a result of fisheries depleting its ecological competitors.|$|E
5|$|Propagated {{from seed}} {{collected}} by William Baxter in <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825. Due to its frost-tenderness, {{it was mostly}} restricted to greenhouse cultivation. In 1873, a variety known as Epacris impressa alba was recorded as being grown commercially for cut flowers in Boston in the United States. While initially popular – over seventy cultivars appeared in the literature at the time – most have since disappeared.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} found in New South Wales, Victoria, southeastern South <b>Australia,</b> <b>southern</b> Western <b>Australia,</b> and Tasmania. It has also been {{recorded}} from New Zealand.|$|R

5|$|The Koori {{people of}} Victoria also knew Altair as Bunjil, the wedge-tailed eagle, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the black swans. The {{people of the}} Murray River knew the star as Totyerguil. The Murray River was formed when Totyerguil the hunter speared Otjout, a giant Murray cod, who, when wounded, churned a channel across <b>southern</b> <b>Australia</b> before {{entering}} the sky as the constellation Delphinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{black swan}} (Cygnus atratus) is widely {{referenced}} in Australian culture, although {{the character of}} that importance historically diverges between the prosaic in the East and the symbolic in West. The black swan is also of spiritual significance in the traditional histories of many Australian Aboriginal peoples across <b>southern</b> <b>Australia.</b> Metaphoric references to black swans have appeared in European culture since long before the real-life discovery of Cygnus atratus in Australia in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The first {{herbarium}} {{collection of}} B.epica {{was not made}} until October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. Nelson was stimulated to make that revision from {{an interest in the}} problem of disjunct plant distributions in <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> and therefore collected specimens of a range of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of B.epica in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as B.media, and later lodged it in the herbarium at Canberra under that name.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, the copper shark is rare and little fishery {{information}} is available, {{leading to an}} assessment of Data Deficient. However, catch declines across all shark and ray species have been documented in the heavily-fished Gulf of California. Off East Asia, the copper shark has been assessed as Vulnerable; though species-specific data is unavailable, shark populations overall have been decimated in the region. The number of large adults have been too low to sustain targeted fisheries since the 1970s, {{and most of the}} current shark catch consists of small juveniles. Additional threats to this species include the degradation and destruction of its coastal nurseries from development, pollution, and aquaculture, mortality from shark nets used to protect beaches in South Africa and Australia, and persecution by fish farmers in <b>southern</b> <b>Australia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Late on 10April, {{the center}} of Olivia passed near Barrow Island at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed near Varanus Island as a {{high-end}} Category4 or low-end Category5 cyclone. Within several hours of passing by Varanus Island, Olivia made landfall near Mardie at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken overland. Accelerating to the southeast, the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force. During the afternoon of 11April, Olivia weakened to a tropical low over <b>southern</b> <b>Australia.</b> It moved over the Great Australian Bight and lost its identity as a gale-force low on 12April, after it was absorbed by a trough.|$|E
5|$|Records of the {{bramble shark}} are fairly rare and {{originate}} from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, {{save for the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. Most {{have come from the}} eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland <b>Southern</b> <b>Australia</b> and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to <b>southern</b> <b>Australia.</b> During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth. At {{this stage}} of the war, the Allies were {{advancing}} north and the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased. Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop if it was not either given {{a more active role in}} the war or transferred to <b>southern</b> <b>Australia</b> for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E

5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms {{in the north and}} their absence in the southeast of the continent. Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago {{at the end of the}} Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central <b>southern</b> <b>Australia</b> east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,00013,000years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards. This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} gregarious on migration, {{travelling}} in large flocks that can contain {{hundreds or thousands}} of individuals. Huge dense groups form on the wintering grounds; one flock in Senegal contained a million birds. A minority winter further east to Burma, south China, New Guinea and scattered parts of <b>southern</b> <b>Australia,</b> or on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and wintering ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year. Non-breeding birds may also remain year round in the tropical wintering quarters. The Ruff is an uncommon visitor to Alaska (where it has occasionally bred), Canada and the contiguous states of the US, and has wandered to Iceland, Middle America, northern South America, Madagascar and New Zealand. It has been recorded as breeding well south of its main range in northern Kazakhstan, a major migration stopover area.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis {{occurs in}} two disjunct ranges in <b>southern</b> <b>Australia.</b> In {{southwest}} Western Australia, {{it has been}} recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance. In the southeast of the continent, it is found from eastern South Australia, {{where it has been}} recorded from Mount Gambier and the Fleurieu Peninsula, the Mount Lofty Ranges around Adelaide, the Murraylands, and north to the Flinders Ranges and from Lincoln National Park at the apex of the Eyre Peninsula, through to southeast Queensland. It also occurs in Tasmania. It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests, in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of Wyperfeld National Park and subalpine areas of Mount Buffalo National Park, as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Outside Australia, it has been recorded from Norfolk Island. In 2012, it was reported for the first time from Kerala, India, where it was discovered growing on a coconut tree stump.|$|E
