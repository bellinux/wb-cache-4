5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} suggest that he most likely did {{it as part of}} a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was <b>smoothing</b> <b>the</b> back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold in record numbers, finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by <b>smoothing</b> <b>the</b> lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E
5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. <b>Smoothing</b> <b>the</b> edges of their style {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E
30|$|A {{new method}} to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state with Gaussian mixture {{measurement}} likelihood-integrated track splitting (GMM-ITS) {{in the presence}} of clutter for a high pulse repetition frequency (HPRF) radar is proposed. This method <b>smooths</b> <b>the</b> target state at fixed lag N and considers all feasible multi-scan target existence sequences in the temporal window of scans in order to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state. <b>The</b> <b>smoothing</b> window can be of any length N. The proposed method to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state at fixed lag is also applied to the enhanced multiple model (EMM) tracking algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the performance of fixed lag smoothing GMM-ITS significantly improves false track discrimination and root mean square errors (RMSEs).|$|R

5|$|The Colorado River and {{its tributaries}} often nourish {{extensive}} corridors of riparian growth as they traverse the arid desert regions of the watershed. Although riparian zones represent a relatively small proportion of the basin and {{have been affected by}} engineering projects and river diversion in many places, they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin. The most prominent riparian zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam, especially in the Colorado River Delta, where riparian areas support 358 species of birds despite the reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as tamarisk (salt cedar). Reduction of the delta's size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the vaquita porpoise, which is endemic to the gulf. Human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new riparian zones by <b>smoothing</b> <b>the</b> river's seasonal flow, notably through the Grand Canyon.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state at fixed lag N. It applies <b>the</b> proposed <b>smoothing</b> algorithm on both GMM-ITS and EMM algorithms to obtain <b>the</b> <b>smoothing</b> benefits for an HPRF radar. In this technique, {{a relatively small}} window of scans is defined in each <b>smoothing</b> interval. <b>The</b> target trajectory state and target existence state are smoothed at fixed lag N in <b>the</b> <b>smoothing</b> interval. This technique considers all feasible multi-scan target existence events and smoothed state estimates (using the augmented state GMM-ITS update) calculated at all intermediate scans in <b>the</b> <b>smoothing</b> interval in order to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> target hybrid state at fixed lag N.|$|R

25|$|Coiling is {{the most}} common means of shaping {{ceramics}} in the Americas. In coiling, the clay is rolled into a long, thin strands that are coiled upon each other to build up the shape of the pottery. While the potter builds the coils up, she also blends them together until there was no trace of the ropes of clay entwined to form the pot, no deviation in the thickness of the walls, and therefore no weaknesses. Potter's wheels were not used prior to European contact and are only used today by a limited number of Native American artists. Pinch pots and other small clay objects could be formed directly by hand. Hohokam potters and their descendents in the American Southwest employed the paddle-and-anvil technique, in which the interior clay wall of a pot was supported by an anvil, while the exterior was beaten with a paddle, <b>smoothing</b> <b>the</b> surface. In precontact South America, ceramics were mass-produced using molds.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Britain and America {{was at a}} breaking point when Buddington salvaged Resolute. They were {{on the brink of}} their third war. President Franklin Pierce addressed Congress to say he had ceased to have diplomatic relations with Britain. He closed the British embassies and sent the ambassadors home. Tensions continued to mount. Suddenly one of the most vocal hawks, Senator James Murray Mason, from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the government to buy Resolute, refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President Pierce signed it into law. Resolute was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at Spithead on December 12, 1856. After Resolute was towed to Cowes so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856. Soon the talk of war ceased, and the gift of Resolute was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. Henry Grinnell, a New York merchant and ship owner who had grown up in New Bedford, had supported the purchase of Resolute to be used as the gift, and both he and Lady Franklin had hoped the Navy would use the ship for a new search for Sir John Franklin's expedition. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy was no longer willing to spend money on what they now believed would be a fruitless search. It was impossible to believe that any of the Franklin men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic. Belcher's abandonment of four seaworthy ships was the last straw. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use Resolute for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing Resolute after the important role the ship had played in <b>smoothing</b> <b>the</b> turbulent waters between her and America. Resolute stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at Chatham Dockyard in 1879.|$|E

2500|$|The wing {{design of}} the Buccaneer was a {{compromise}} between two requirements: a low aspect ratio for good gust response, and high aspect ratio to give good range performance. [...] The small wing was suited to high-speed flight at low altitude; however, a small wing did not generate sufficient lift that was essential for carrier operations. [...] Therefore, BLC was used upon both the wing and tailplane, having the effect of energising and <b>smoothing</b> <b>the</b> boundary layer airflow, which significantly reduced airflow separation {{at the back of}} the wing, and therefore decreased stall speed, and increased effectiveness of trailing edge control surfaces, including flaps and ailerons.|$|E
