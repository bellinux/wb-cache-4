The development of techniques for the removal and recovery of metals from industrial effluent taking account {{of the consequences of}} the definition of waste in the Basel Convention on transfrontier <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> is reported. The use of fluidised bed cell electrolysis in the recovery of metals from dilute solutions is investigated, and the conditions for recovery optimised. For the first time the application of a novel activated carbon cloth concentrator cell to recover metals from effluent solutions is reported and the conditions for its use optimised. Comparative studies using conventional mesh and plate electrodes, and novel activated carbon cloth electrode for the recovery of cobalt from dilute solution, and copper from three different hydrometallurgical solutions viz (i) Cu/Zn, (ii) Cu/Zn/Fe and (iii) Cu/Zn/Cd containing effluents were carried out. Application of concentrator cell technology including activated carbon cloth and ion exchange resin to the recovery of metals, including precious group metals, from industrial as-supplied samples is reported. Optimisation leads to successful recovery of iridium and palladium from very dilute solutions. The alternative recovery of metal as added-value chemicals is also investigated. The Basel Convention is concerned with transfrontier <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from developed to developing countries and has produced a need to investigate the leachability of metals in various forms. In this work the leachability of copper and zinc is studied under various conditions that model environmental situations and the results have been used to develop a methodology to determine whether a metal containing material would be subject to a shipment ban under the Convention. As part of the development of the methodology, leaching studies were also carried out on single chemical compounds of copper, zinc, cadmium and lead, and their bioavailability determined...|$|E

40|$|With growing global {{concerns}} {{of climate change}} and social inequality, there is a recognition that the ambiguous concept of sustainable development needs to {{be integrated into the}} highest echelons of the decision making process. The technique of sustainability appraisal (SA) has been implemented within the UK planning system, although there are still difficulties regarding the understanding of its nature and technicalities. Such diverse approaches to SA are creating a dynamic sustainability tool but inadequate implementation is diluting its impact and confusing its position. This research examines what differentiates SA from other forms of environmental assessment, environmental impact assessment (ElA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The major differences surround the innovative approach of testing an appraisal framework before defining the baseline and its geographical scope. It is believed that SA could take a proactive approach and be introduced during the initial drafting stages of plans and policy. The methodology is tested using a case study of the solid waste strategy from Jersey in the Channel Islands. Three possible options are being addressed: {{the construction of a new}} energy from waste plant utilising incineration technology, an increased recycling scheme incorporating kerbside collection and the <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> off island to either Guernsey or France.

The provisions of Annex III of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol) are reviewed, in particular the requirement to remove waste from Antarctica and clean up past waste disposal sites and abandoned infrastructure. It is noted that the language used in the Protocol, {{and the absence of}} clearly defined environmental standards for the region, make examination of the compliance of signatories problematic. Australian, French, Russian, Chinese and Japanese program policy and operations in East Antarctica are discussed. Issues related to the on-site processing, containment and <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> are considered in an Integrated Solid Waste Management System framework. Particular reference is made to the differing demands presented by the erection and demolition of facilities, the handling of annually generated and principally non-hazardous domestic waste, and the clean up of abandoned, and often contaminated, sites. A lack of sufficiently-detailed, reliable and consistently-described data on the composition and production of waste, the volumes accumulated, and the effects and efficiency of Antarctic operations, currently hinders strategic planning. Nevertheless it is suggested that a collaborative approach to the removal of waste from coastal sites between 30 Â°E (Syowa station) and 140 Â°E (Dumont d'Urville) is logistically feasible and attractive on environmental, practical and economic grounds. Australia is appropriately positioned, geographically and in the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), to take a lead role in promoting and implementing a coordinated, regional approach. Concomitantly it is argued that ATCPs need to give greater attention to philosophical and theoretical issues related to operating in Antarctica, the debate involving enquiry beyond that associated with scientific objectivity and analysis.

The Agreement pertains to the exchange of information before a final decision is made on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant application for a permit under the ''New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act''. The Agreement will terminate upon the effective date of a final ''New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act'' permit for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. In keeping with the principles and terms of the Agreement, this report describes the waste stream data and information compilation process, and the physical and chemical analyses that the U. S. Department of Energy has performed on selected containers of transuranic debris waste to confirm that the waste is nonhazardous (non-mixed). This also summarizes the testing and analytical results that support the conclusion that the selected transuranic debris waste is not hazardous and thus, not subject to regulation under the ''Resource Conservation and Recovery Act'' or the ''New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act''. This report will be submitted to the New Mexico Environment Department no later than 45 days before the first <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from the Hanford Site to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, unless the parties mutually agree in writing to a shorter time. The 52 containers of transuranic debris waste addressed in this report were generated, packaged, and placed into storage between 1995 and 1997. Based on reviews of administrative documents, operating procedures, waste records, generator certifications, and personnel interviews, this transuranic debris waste was determined to be nonhazardous. This determination is supported by the data derived from nondestructive examination, confirmatory visual examination, and the results of container headspace gas sampling and analysis. Therefore, it is concluded that this transuranic debris waste, which consists of 52 containers from waste streams NPFPDLIA, NPFPDLIB, NPFPDLIC, and NPFPDLID, is not hazardous waste, and no hazardous waste numbers specified in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 261, have been assigned.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide {{information}} needed by the DOE to assess WIPP's environmental performance and to convey that performance to stakeholders {{and members of the}} public. This report has been prepared in accordance with DOE Order 231. 1 A and DOE guidance. This report documents WIPP's environmental monitoring programs and their results for 2003. The WIPP Project is authorized by the DOE National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96 - 164). After more than 20 years of scientific study and public input, WIPP received its first <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> on March 26, 1999. Located in southeastern New Mexico, WIPP is the nation's first underground repository permitted to safely and permanently dispose of TRU radioactive and mixed waste (as defined in the WIPP LWA) generated through the research and production of nuclear weapons and other activities related to the national defense of the United States. TRU waste is defined in the WIPP LWA as radioactive waste containing more than 100 nanocuries (3, 700 becquerels [Bq]) of alpha-emitting transuranic isotopes per gram of waste, with half-lives greater than 20 years. Exceptions are noted as high-level waste, waste that has been determined not to require the degree of isolation required by the disposal regulations, and waste the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has approved for disposal. Most TRU waste is contaminated industrial trash, such as rags and old tools, and sludges from solidified liquids; glass; metal; and other materials from dismantled buildings. A TRU waste is eligible for disposal at WIPP if it has been generated in whole or in partby {{one or more of the}} activities listed in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 United States Code [U. S. C. ] Â§ 10101, et seq.), including naval reactors development, weapons activities, verification and control technology, defense nuclear materials production, defense nuclear waste and materials by-products management, defense nuclear materials security and safeguards and security investigations, and defense research and development. The waste must also meet the WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria. When TRU waste arrives at WIPP, it is transported into the Waste Handling Building. The waste containers are removed from the shipping containers, placed on the waste hoist, and lowered to the repository level of 655 m (2, 150 ft; approximately 0. 5 mi) below the surface. Next, the containers of waste are removed from the hoist and placed in excavated storage rooms in the Salado Formation, a thick sequence of evaporite beds deposited approximately 250 million years ago (Figure 1. 1). After each panel has been filled with waste, specially designed closures are emplaced. When all of WIPP's panels have been filled, at the conclusion of WIPP operations, seals will be placed in the shafts.

25|$|In November 2008, a <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> {{radioactive}} <b>waste</b> from German {{nuclear plants}} {{arrived at a}} storage site near Gorleben after being delayed by large protests from nuclear activists. More than 15,000 people {{took part in the}} protests which involved blocking trucks with sit-down demonstrations and blocking the route with tractors. The demonstrations were partly a response to conservative calls for a rethink of the planned phaseout of nuclear power stations.|$|R
40|$|Illegal waste dumping {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} problem in {{environment}} protection. <b>Shipments</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> are left in wastelands, forests or dumped into the sea. These activities are difficult to suppress because technologies available to track the waste, and hence the people responsible, are very limited. (1) This research focuses on developing an effective, low-cost way of labelling and detecting bulk waste material shipments. The technology is based on an easily retrievable material in the form of micro/nano magnets which are used as carrier for the spectral signal transducers (e. g. dyes and pigments). These pigment carrying magnetic particles are chemically and physically stable, can form unique spectral pattern to use as identifier tag. The project is divided into two parts: (i) the modification of the magnet particles with various dyes and pigments to form spectral codes (ii) the development of analytical technique for code readou...|$|R
