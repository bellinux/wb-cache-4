5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> approximately 30 in square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb anchor box by a wire rope mooring cable stored on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives for}} this project were to explicitly define the anchor bolt corrosion problem {{in the state of}} Georgia and recommend action to the Georgia Department of Transportation. The bearing assembly of concern is the plate bearing assembly, in which carbon steel and/or bronze plates are anchored by either carbon steel or stainless <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts. Inspection report data revealed that anchor bolt corrosion was ubiquitous for all environments in Georgia; the problem was reported for 27 % of the steel girder bridges throughout the state. Based on a synthesis of the field investigations, bolt failure analyses, laboratory experimental testing, and review of GDOT inspection report surveys, the corrosion of carbon <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts is caused universally by concentration cell corrosion. Other corrosion mechanisms of concern are galvanic and crevice corrosion, which are both enhanced by the current bearing design. Corrosion protection provided through zinc galvanization cannot sufficiently protect the carbon steel bolt for its entire service life. Corrosion potential and cyclic polarization data confirmed that ASTM Type 304, Type 316, Type 2101, and Type 2205 were protected from concentration cell and localized corrosion in the simulated bearing environment. Therefore, it is recommended that the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts of these types be use in future designs and that the bolts should be electrically separated from all dissimilar metals using a Nylon or Teflon washer to prevent preferential corrosion of carbon steel. It is further recommended that the bronze lube plate should be eliminated entirely and that the bearing type should be a reinforced elastomeric bearing. Maintenance of existing sliding plate bearings should include regular cleaning by brushing away debris from the bearing surfaces, and bridges with carbon <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts should be retrofitted to provide additional lateral restraint according to current maintenance procedures.

40|$|Abstract: Steel is {{commonly}} used as the materials of anchor bolts in permanent anchoring works. The nature the <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolt easy to be corroded, however, poses a serious potential safety hazard to the anchoring system mainly including <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts. To use GFRP(glass fiber reinforced polymer) anchor bolts instead of reinforcing bars is an effective means to deal with corrosion. Based on the test of accelerating aging in high solubility, the physical and mechanical performance tests are conducted on GFRP bolts in normal, acid, alkalis and salt conditions, from which the change law of physical and mechanical property can be studied for bolts in different corrosion conditions. As shown from the test results, the weight of GFRP bolt is reduced after it is corroded {{and the rate of}} weight loss increases as the corrosion time extends. Thick swelling can be seen on bolts in alkalis conditions. Loss rate of tensile strength and increase rate of elastic modulus are greater in alkalis conditions than in acid conditions, the former reaching 13. 76 % and the latter 9. 83 %. As for bolts in acid conditions, tensile strength decreases as the corrosion time extends while the rate and amount of loss is less than that of bolts in acid and alkalis conditions. The tensile strength decreases as the solubility of corrosion solution increases. The loss rate of tensile strength is the most for bolts in alkalis conditions; it comes second in acid conditions and the least in salt conditions. The elastic modulus of bolts in acid conditions and alkalis conditions increases while the rate is comparatively low as the solubility gets higher. Elastic modulus of bolts in salt conditions decreases as the solubility rises with lower rate and smaller amount of loss. These results supply test foundation for application of GFRP bolts in complicated geological conditions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} and analytical {{study on the}} punching strengthening of reinforced concrete two-way slabs using external steel plates is presented. Five reinforced concrete square slabs of 100 mm thickness were tested over simply supported four sides of 1000 mm span under central square patch load of 100 mm size up to failure. One control slab was tested without strengthening; however, four tested slabs were strengthened using four configurations of square steel plates provided with <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> shear studs. Such configurations considered two different plate thickness, two plate side dimensions and different arrangement and diameter of shear studs. The strengthened four slabs showed improved stiffness and punching shear capacity. The magnitude of improvement depended on the plate dimensions and the studs diameter and arrangement.

The proposed approach {{was applied to the}} tested specimens {{with the use of the}} punching shear strength equations adopted by several codes of practice and proved to be in good agreement with the test results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} finite element results of {{investigations into the}} stiffness and strength of three discrete interface connections between simple steel frames and precast concrete infill panels serving as lateral bracing. The ability of the connections to resist compression and tension allows them to introduce substantial lateral stiffness and strength into so called semi-integral infilled frames. The discrete connection between a steel frame and a concrete panel consists of two parts: a <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> plate welded to multiple anchor bars which are cast in the concrete panel and a gusset plate welded to the frame. For a complete framepanel connection the anchor plate is bolted to the gusset plate thereby allowing composite action of the steel-concrete structure.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this paper is to characterize the mechanical behavior of a new embedded point-fixing device for laminated glass. This kind of support is based on the principle known as “interlayer junction” in which the anchor is bonded to the interlayer and embedded in the glass panes during the lamination process. The purposes of this innovative point-fixing system are mainly focused on interior architecture applications: e. g. balustrades, stairs, doors, elevators, design furniture, etc., taking advantage of the beautiful aesthetic of an “all-glass” element. This {{is due to the fact}} that, contrary to traditional point-fixings bolted connections, the countersunk hole is not passing through the outer glass layer, so that the truncated cone stainless <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> looks like embedded in the glass mass. A comprehensive experimental investigation on the load-bearing capacity under the combined action of axial and shear force has thus been performed. Finally, design criteria are provided and applied to a case study with demonstration purpose only. In addition to the interaction diagrams given for combined load cases between axial and shear force also a simplified analytical failure criterion, which is intended for use in the practical design, is proposed...|$|E
