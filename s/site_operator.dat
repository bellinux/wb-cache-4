25|$|In 2000 {{the owners}} and {{operators}} of Playgirl.com and scores of other adult sites were charged by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with illegally billing thousands of consumers for services that were advertised as free, and for billing other consumers who never visited the web sites at all. Nevadan Voice Media Incorporated, which ran several adult sites, was also charged by the Commission. Sites often suffer from unauthorized, non-paying surfers who use stolen passwords, which can use month's worth of bandwidth in a day, costing the <b>site</b> <b>operator</b> {{hundreds or thousands of}} dollars' worth of additional bandwidth fees, all for traffic that returns no money at all. The 2002 Paragon Electric Co., Inc. v. Buy This Domain case ruled that linking domain names to pornographic sites is not per se conclusive of bad-faith registration and use, although it does raise that presumption.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "self" [...] part of {{the name}} {{comes from the fact}} that the user is attacking himself or herself.

However, the attacks don't have much else in common, because XSS is an attack against the website itself (which users cannot protect themselves against but can be fixed by the <b>site</b> <b>operator</b> making their site more secure), whereas self-XSS is a social engineering attack against the user (which savvy users can protect themselves against but the <b>site</b> <b>operator</b> cannot do anything about it).|$|E
