2500|$|To ensure {{survivability}} to {{and effectiveness}} against a target, the LRASM {{is equipped with}} a BAE Systems-designed seeker and guidance system, integrating jam-resistant GPS/INS, passive RF and threat warning receiver, an imaging infrared (IIR infrared homing) seeker with automatic scene/target matching recognition, a data-link, and passive Electronic <b>Support</b> <b>Measure</b> (ESM) and radar warning receiver sensors. [...] Artificial intelligence software combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. [...] Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real-time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. [...] Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. [...] Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low IR signature reduces detectability. [...] Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship. [...] An LRASM can find its own target autonomously by using its active radar homing to locate ships in an area, then using passive measures once on terminal approach. [...] Like the JASSM, the LRASM is capable of hitting land targets.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} support {{is central to}} data mining. While the {{definition}} of support in transaction databases is intuitive and simple, {{that is not the}} case in graph datasets and databases. Most mining algorithms require the support of a pattern to be no grater than that of its subpatterns, a property called anti-monotonicity or admissibility. This study examines the requirements for admissibility of a <b>support</b> <b>measure.</b> <b>Support</b> <b>measure</b> for mining graphs are usually based on the notion of an instance graph-a graph representing all the instances of the pattern in a database and their intersection properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> admissibility, based on operations on instance graphs, are developed and proved. The sufficient conditions are used to prove ad admissibility of one support measure-the size of the independent set in the instance graph. Conversely, the necessary conditions are used to quickly show that some other support measures, such as weighted count of instances, are not admissible...|$|E
