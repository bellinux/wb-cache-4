50|$|After {{the end of}} the war and the {{withdrawal}} of British and Australian troops, the region experienced a long period of economic recession after 1866. Most Maori had moved to the King Country and European settlers were more attracted to the South Island with its large gold discovery in Otago and the more easily farmed Canterbury Plains. The Waikato had poor land access and was not suitable for sheep farming which dominated livestock production in New Zealand until the 1890s invention of refrigeration. Dairying and the completion of the main trunk railway line at the turn of the century lead to a small, steady increase in population. After 1900 the Waikato continued to grow as a dairying region benefiting from the flow of capital earned from the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> and cheese mainly to Britain.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to consider and illustrate the potential usefulness of the method of analysis known as Dynamic Programming in one field of market analysis. The illustrative problem solved is that of maximising revenue from New Zealand <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> on the United Kingdom market. Since April 1962 the United Kingdom has restricted imports <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> by placing quotas for twelve month periods on importing countries. It is reasonable to assume that under normal supply conditions, these quotas will be fulfilled. Under abnormal conditions, such as those due to the winter experienced in the Northern Hemisphere in 1962 - 63, a good market information service should make it possible to predict the expected level <b>of</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> from the countries concerned. United Kingdom producers are not subject to any restriction as to the quantity <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> sold on the home market, but the expected level of supply should be predictable in any year.

Generally, Charlotte and her {{siblings}} used Cincinnati, Ohio real estate, inherited from her father David, mortgages on their plantations, and whatever else they had to support themselves after the war. At times the Marshall descendants only had the small income from the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> and eggs from their farming operation to keep them going. Beginning in 1932, charging tourists for tours of the antebellum Natchez planters' homes during the annual Pilgrimage tours brought in much needed money to keep the homes going. A cotton plantation scene from the movie Show Boat (1951 film) was filmed on Lansdowne Plantation. During the 1950s the Marshall descendants sold off the last of their cotton lands. Lansdowne {{has been added to}} the National Register of Historic Places since July 24, 1978.

40|$|Market-oriented {{smallholder}} dairy in Fogera has {{an opportunity}} for growth because of growing urban population in the district itself {{as well as in}} the wider Bahr Dar–Gondar milkshed. IPMS in 2005 introduced a participatory market-oriented dairy value chain development approach with partner organizations. IPMS together with its partners also identified gaps in the dairy value chain through Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) and also designed interventions involving key value chain actors. This approach included increased use of knowledge capturing and sharing by the extension services. Major production interventions were the development of communal grazing areas through clearance of noxious weed called Hygrophilla auriculata and introduction of area enclosure, backyard fodder development and increased use of rice crop residues. Input service supply interventions included community-based trypanosomosis control and bulls stations. IPMS and its partners also provided the required support for establishment of two milk processing marketing cooperatives. Communal grazing area development is now practised in 16 villages (PAs) and harvested biomass production was estimated at 7 to 11 t of DM/year. As a result of the cut-and-carry system, the proportion of legumes increased, thus improving its nutritive value. The increased availability of the rice straw and bran resulting from rice value chain development in Fogera has also impacted dairy production. Urea treatments of rice straw as well as supplementary feeding with rice bran were demonstrated in 13 PAs. An on-farm experiment conducted by an MSc student indicated doubling of daily milk yields. However, use of straw could be increased further if urea for the treatment of straw could be made available in the dry season. Trypanosomosis control introduced in infested areas has significantly reduced the number of infected animals and the program is now institutionalized by regional, district and NGO partners. The introduction of bull stations resulted in increased number of improved Fogera breed cows and crossbreed with Holstein-Frisians. However, the number of improved dairy cows is still low and the District should consider the recently introduced mass insemination approach with the help of hormones. Marketing and processing of milk in urban and peri-urban areas through formation of small cooperatives has started; however, impact is still limited due to lack of business orientation, and alternative marketing outlets for individual producers. While some linkages were made with the larger Bahr Dar milkshed, more attention needs to be paid to this market once milk production increases. A household survey conducted in 2009, which assessed the combined impact of all interventions, showed significant differences in milk quantities sold by adopter and non-adopter households in the urban areas and doubling of butter production/sales in the rural areas. It is noted that this additional butter sales benefits rural women since they manage the production and <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter.</b> Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the years}} the demand for butter in Canada has {{decreased}} resulting in a surplus <b>of</b> <b>butter.</b> In 1965 the per capita consumption <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in Canada was 8. 23 Kg which decreased by about 70 % to 2. 66 Kg in 1994. Previous research indicates that consumers are switching from butter to margarine due to concerns about heart disease and high cholesterol levels in butter. Therefore, a market {{study was conducted in}} Montreal to estimate the potential demand for a new product called "modified" butter which would create 50 % less cholesterol in the body than regular butter. When the concept <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> was introduced, out of 157 respondents about 80 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} they would buy "modified" butter. Also, the total quantity of margarine demanded in a month decreased by 47 % and the regular butter demand decreased by 85 %. The market share <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> comes to about 67 %. The average of the price that the consumers are willing to pay for a kilogram <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> is $ 7. 50. A detailed cost analysis shows that the production cost <b>of</b> ``modified'' <b>butter</b> at the experimental level is high, but the average costs show a decreasing trend when the scale of production is increased. If the economies of scale were to continue along the derived cost curves, 7 tons <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> would have to be produced to reach the break-even point of $ 7. 50 /Kg cost of production. This shows the industrial potential of producing large quantities <b>of</b> ``modified'' <b>butter</b> by taking advantage of the economies of scale. Furthermore, the overall <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> (regular butter plus ``modified'' butter) would increase by about 25 % which would boost the consumption <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in Canada...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{estimation}} of the demand function for most industrial, and many agricultural, products is inhibited by price fixing or price stabilizing arrangements which prevent observation of {{the full range of}} possible price-quantity combinations.

In the period 1958 to 1961 estimates <b>of</b> retail <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> are available, and these permit the {{estimation of}} the demand for butter at retail. The time lag between production and consumption decisions means that there is no problem of identification.
