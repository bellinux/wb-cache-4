40|$|The {{effect of}} various <b>steeping</b> {{conditions}} (time, temperature and aeration) {{on the quality}} of sorghum malt for brewing (in terms of diastatic power, free amino nitrogen and hot water extract) was examined. <b>Steeping</b> time and temperature had a highly significant effect on sorghum malt quality. In general, malt quality increased with <b>steeping</b> time (from 16 – 40 h). Malt diastatic power increased with <b>steeping</b> temperature (up to 30 °C) and free amino nitrogen and extract content peaked at a <b>steeping</b> temperature of 25 °C. Aeration during <b>steeping</b> appeared to enhance the extract and free amino nitrogen content of the finished malt. Sorghum malt quality was found to be directly related to the steep-out moisture of the grain. 1997 Academic Press Limite...|$|R
50|$|<b>Steepest</b> descent. Although a {{reduction}} in the sum of squares is guaranteed when the shift vector points in the direction of <b>steepest</b> descent, this method often performs poorly. When the parameter values are far from optimal the direction of the <b>steepest</b> descent vector, which is normal (perpendicular) to the contours of the objective function, {{is very different from the}} direction of the Gauss-Newton vector. This makes divergence much more likely, especially as the minimum along the direction of <b>steepest</b> descent may correspond to a small fraction of the length of the <b>steepest</b> descent vector. When the contours of the objective function are very eccentric, due to there being high correlation between parameters, the <b>steepest</b> descent iterations, with shift-cutting, follow a slow, zig-zag trajectory towards the minimum.|$|R

5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas.

The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby <b>Steep</b> Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In <b>Steep,</b> hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in <b>Steep</b> Marsh.|$|E
25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are <b>steeped</b> hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are <b>steeped</b> cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). <b>Steeping</b> too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the <b>steeping</b> technique. Two important techniques are to warm the <b>steeping</b> container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Among various hard {{decision}} based Bit Flipping (BF) algorithms for decoding Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes such as Weighted Bit Flipping (WBF), Improved Reliability Ratio Weighted Bit Flipping (IRRWBF) etc., the <b>Steepest</b> Descent Bit Flipping Algorithm (SDBF) achieves better error performance. In this paper, {{the performance of}} the <b>Steepest</b> Descent Algorithm for both single <b>steepest</b> descent and Multi <b>steepest</b> descent modes is analysed. Also the performance of IEEE 802. 16 e standard is analysed using <b>Steepest</b> Descent Bit Flipping (SDBF) decoding algorithm. SDBF requires fewer check node and variable node operations compared to Sum Product Algorithm (SPA) and Min Sum Algorithm (MSA). The SDBF achieves a coding gain of 0. 1 ~ 0. 2 dB compared to Single-SDBF without requiring complex log and exponential operations...|$|R
