After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, to Brian and Heather Stewart and has a younger brother named Connor. Breanna began playing {{basketball}} at an early age; in fifth grade, she decided to improve her game. Now six feet four inches tall, {{she had always been}} tall for her age, which often meant coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder. However, her father thought it would help if she had ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. Even after heading off to college, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> the routine at home.|$|E
500|$|Well {{before leaving}} England, Wilson {{was married to}} Elizabeth Mansfield, the {{daughter}} of Sir John Mansfield, and had at least two children born in England, but his wife had initially refused to come to New England with him. [...] Her refusal {{was the subject of}} several letters sent from John Winthrop's wife, Margaret, to her son John Winthrop, Jr., in May 1631. [...] Wilson then made a trip back to England from 1631 to 1632. Though his biographer, in 1870, stated that <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not come back to New England with Wilson until 1635, Anderson in 1995 pointed out that the couple had a child baptized in Boston in 1633; therefore she had to have come with Wilson during this earlier trip.|$|E

500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1947, Cameron {{travelled}} from New York to Paris aboard the SS America {{with the intention of}} studying art at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, which she hoped would admit her with a letter of recommendation from Pasadena's Art Center School. She also wanted to visit England and meet with Crowley and explain to him Parsons' Babalon Working. [...] Cameron learned upon her arrival in Paris that Crowley had died and that she had not been admitted to the college. She found post-war Paris [...] "extreme and bleak", befriended Juliette Gréco, and spent three weeks in Switzerland before returning home. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons suggested that she read Sylvan Muldoon's books on astral projection and encouraged her to read James Frazer's The Golden Bough, Heinrich Zimmer's The King and the Corpse, and Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Although <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not accept Thelema, she became increasingly interested in the occult, and in particular the use of the tarot.|$|E
500|$|In the comics, the Rippers are {{considerably}} more kangaroo-like. However, Talalay wanted real actors rather than stuntmen in suits playing the roles. She asked Hewlett to redesign the Rippers {{to make them}} more human, allowing them to have the actual actors' facial expressions. Requests were sent out to [...] "all the major make-up and effects people", including Stan Winston, whose prior work included the Terminator films, Aliens, and Jurassic Park. Talalay said that while she considered Winston to be the best, she did not expect to hear back from him. When she did, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not think that {{she would be able to}} afford his studio on her budget. A meeting was arranged and Winston insisted on being given the project, saying the Rippers would be: [...] "the best characters we've had the opportunity to do." [...] Winston's studio cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget. Eight Rippers featured in the film: half were given principal roles, the others were mainly in the background. Each Ripper had articulated ears and tails which were activated by remote control, and the background Rippers also had mechanical snouts which could be activated either by remote control or by the movement of the actors' mouths. Each Ripper's make-up took about four hours to apply. Three technicians from Winston's studio were required to work on each Ripper's articulations during filming; no puppets or digital effects were used for the Rippers.|$|E
2500|$|Curtiss and Fromkin {{wrote that}} by 1973 Genie {{seemed to be}} slowly {{improving}} her articulation {{and that she had}} clearly strengthened and gained more control over her voice, and by at least the middle of that year she could distinguish and articulate all the sounds of General American. During that year she started to use pitch variation in addition to vowel duration to indicate stress, with the latter remaining the primary method for doing so but becoming much less obtrusive and exaggerated, but <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not vary pitch or volume to indicate either questions or imperative sentences. While her voice remained largely monotonic she began including [...] more speech patterns and intonation, sometimes in spontaneous speech but more consistently in imitation. Despite this <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not use either voiced or voiceless dental fricatives in spontaneous speech, though she had imitated them since June 1972, and inconsistently used affricates in spontaneous speech.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Congdon, {{of direct}} Virginian ancestry, was named Lee by a state's-rights mother, who sent her abroad to [...] "study art." [...] She ended by {{pretending to be}} a sculptor--and <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> {{occasionally}} model a figurine of her friends or her friends' babies; mainly, she was the aider and abettor of her husband, a really clever portrait-painter, whose ill health had driven him from New York to Colorado, and who was making a precarious living in the Springs--precarious for the reason that on bright days he would rather play golf than handle a brush, and on dark days he couldn't see to paint (so he said). In truth, he was not well, and his slender store of strength did not permit him to do as he would. To cover the real seriousness of his case he loudly admitted his laziness and incompetency.|$|E

Sitting down on it with the {{scissors}} in her hand, <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not cut out that recipe, but remained as before, taking in small, definite things, and feeling with an inner trembling that dear Felix and Alan and Nedda would soon be here; and the little flush rose again in her cheeks, and again her lips and hands moved, expressing and compressing what was in her heart. And close behind her, a peacock, straying from the foundations of the old Moreton house, uttered a cry, and moved slowly, spreading its tail under the low-hanging boughs of the copper-beeches, as though it knew those dark burnished leaves were the proper setting for its 'parlant' magnificence.|$|E

And therefore I do not ask you to take any steps towards breaking your engagement. The offer must come from Mr. Fitzgerald, and I have no doubt that it will come. He, as a man of honour, will know that he cannot now offer to marry you; and he will also know, as a man of sense, that it would be ruin for him to think of--of such a marriage under his present circumstances." ...|$|E

6000|$|What Gerald {{understood}} by Lanfear's words {{might not have}} been their meaning, but what Lanfear meant was that there was now an interfusion of the past and present in her daily experience. <b>She</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not remember, but she had moments in which she hovered upon such knowledge of what had happened as she had of actual events. When she was stronger she seemed farther from this knowledge; when she was weaker she was nearer it. So it seemed to him in that region where he could be sure of his own duty when he looked upon it singly as concern for her health. No inquiry for the psychological possibilities must be suffered to divide his effort for her physical recovery, though there might come with this a cessation of the timeless dream-state in which she had her being, and she might sharply realize the past, as the anaesthete realizes his return to agony from insensibility. The quality of her mind was as different from the thing called culture as her manner from convention. A simplicity beyond the simplicity of childhood was one with a poetic color in her absolute ideas. But this must cease with her restoration to the strength in which she could alone come into full and clear self-consciousness. So far as Lanfear could give reality to his occupation with her disability, he was ministering to a mind diseased; not to [...] "rase out its written trouble," [...] but if possible to restore the obliterated record, and enable her to spell its tragic characters. If he could, he would have shrunk from this office; but all the more because he specially {{had to do with the}} mystical side of medicine, he always tried to keep his relation to her free from personal feeling, and his aim single and matter-of-fact.|$|E
