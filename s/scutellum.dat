5|$|Cicadas {{are large}} insects made {{conspicuous}} by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterised by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and {{three to six}} segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on {{the rear of the}} forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hindwing. Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae differ from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the <b>scutellum,</b> and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} <b>scutellum)</b> and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal plate of the prothorax) is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton plate of the mesothorax) is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{resemblance}} to beetles, jewel bugs are hemipterans or true bugs. The <b>scutellum</b> {{is an extension}} of the thorax, unlike the elytra of beetles which are hardened forewings. As such, jewel bugs have four membranous wings underneath the <b>scutellum</b> in contrast to two in beetles. The <b>scutellum</b> in jewel bugs also does not have a division in the middle and thus does not 'split open' when they take flight like in beetles.|$|E
25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a <b>scutellum.</b> The <b>scutellum</b> is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} {{portion of}} the fly's metathorax, or <b>scutellum,</b> has a pair of stout processes, and often the laterotergite (one {{of a number of}} lateral flanges) of the postnotum (a small dorsal sclerite on the insect thorax posterior to the notum) has a dome-like swelling or spine-like process. The anterior femora of the legs are stout, with ventral spines. Adult males have lost tergites seven and eight, and the seventh sternite forms a complete ventral band.|$|E
25|$|The {{proboscis}} is dark colored, {{the upper}} {{surface of the}} end segment of the palps is covered in silvery scales, and the labium does not feature a light line on its underside. The compound eyes are distinctly separated from one another. The scute, the dorsal portion of an insect’s thoracic segment, is black alongside the characteristic white midline. On {{the side of the}} thorax, the <b>scutellum,</b> and the abdomen are numerous spots covered in white-silvery scales.|$|E
25|$|The head of tessaratomids is {{generally}} small and triangular, with the antennae having 4 to 5 segments (though some of them, for example Siphnus, have relatively large heads). The <b>scutellum</b> (Latin for 'little shield', the hard {{extension of the}} thorax covering the abdomen in hemipterans) is triangular and does not cover the leathery middle section of the forewing but is often partially covered by the prothorax. The tarsi (the final segments of the legs) have 2 to 3 segments. They are most reliably distinguished from pentatomids by having six exposed abdominal spiracles instead of five.|$|E
25|$|Given that A. florea is {{more widely}} {{distributed}} and A. andreniformis is considerably more aggressive, honey is, if at all, usually harvested {{from the former}} only. They are the most ancient extant lineage of honey bees, maybe diverging in the Bartonian (some 40million years ago or slightly later) from the other lineages, but {{do not seem to}} have diverged from each other a long time before the Neogene. Apis florea have smaller wing spans than its sister species. Apis florea are also completely yellow {{with the exception of the}} <b>scutellum</b> of workers, which is black.|$|E
25|$|Monocotyledonous {{plants have}} two {{additional}} {{structures in the}} form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and adventitious roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, <b>scutellum</b> (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.|$|E
25|$|Present on the thorax {{are three}} {{contrasting}} black and grey longitudinal stripes; these stripes do not continue onto the abdomen. Sarcophaga have 4, {{rather than the}} normal 2 or 3, notopleural bristles, and 3 sternopleural bristles. A prominent row of black bristles (setae) {{can be found on}} each side of the thorax, just above the base of the hind leg and just under the base of the wing. These two sets of bristles are what differentiate Sarcophagidae from Muscidae. S. bullata lacks the postscutellum, the large swelling underneath the <b>scutellum</b> of the thorax, which distinguishes the flesh fly from Tachinid. S. bullata have black legs, translucent wings, and do not have a costal spine.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the lateral}} and {{posterior}} {{aspects of the}} mesosoma, the pubescence is short, white, and sparsely distributed. [...] The hairs are more densely collected around the [...] lobes. [...] There are a paucity of pale, very short hairs on the [...] [...] The hairs are stiffer, whiter and longer on the <b>scutellum.</b> [...] Punctate markings across the mseoscutum and <b>scutellum</b> are coarse, deep, and closely arranged. [...] The spaces between the mesoscutum and <b>scutellum</b> are shiny and very narrow. [...] Punctate markings are finer on the axilla, where they are closely arranged. [...] The pleura demonstrate punctate markings which are coarse and deep. [...] These are densely arranged anteriorly. [...] The pleura are shiny between the punctate markings. [...] Lateral aspects of the propodeum are dull. [...] They are overall smooth, except some fine and shallow punctures. These are closely arranged. [...] The first tarsal segments are shorter and narrower than the tibiae. Yellow spurs are present on the legs. [...] There are minute and closely spaced punctures on the skeletal plate covering the costal vein of the wing (tegula). [...] The black veined wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.|$|E
500|$|In nymphs {{and adults}} {{of the family}} Ixodidae, the [...] is {{prominent}} and projects forwards from the body, a feature not present in the Argasidae. The eyes {{are close to the}} sides of the scutum, and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs. The hard, protective <b>scutellum,</b> characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.|$|E
500|$|The queen {{shares the}} same colour variation, body {{sculpture}} and [...] of a worker, {{but they are}} usually larger. Queens show reduced thoracic development, and Clark described them as [...] "subapterous", suggesting that wings {{are present in the}} females as undifferentiated wing buds. However, queens collected from Manjimup bore well developed wings. The head, epinotum, mesonotum and pronotum are finely striate-. The head is {{as long as it is}} broad with a straight occipital border. The mandibles are slightly shorter than the head with a concave border. The pronotum is broader than its total length by one-third and the mesonotum is broader by one-sixth, being almost circular in shape and clearly convex. The epinotum is also broader, but only slightly. The gaster is slightly broader, and the postpetiole is one-fifth broader than long. The <b>scutellum</b> is oval and almost twice as broad as long. Male specimens have been rarely collected, and those that are available are too badly damaged for a proper examination. However, the colour and pilosity of male and worker specimens show little differentiation.|$|E
500|$|S. freyi ants are small, {{measuring}} [...] The mandibles are wasp-like, its 12-segmented antennae are {{far apart}} {{from each other}} and the second funicular segment is longer than all the other segments. This is unusual for ants, but such case occurs in Nothomyrmecia macrops. The scapes are very short at [...] The compound eyes are very long and convex, situated on the middle side of the head. The clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the [...] "face" [...] of an arthropod or insect) is broad and convex and the ocelli (photoreceptors) are well developed. The mesosoma is slender and closely resembles those of Methocha malayana, measuring [...] The mesonotum is also long and slender with a distinct convexed scutum and <b>scutellum,</b> but these two features are separated from each other by an axillary region. Spiracles are present on the metathorax, but they are situated just below the <b>scutellum.</b> The petiole has a raised node and separated from the propodeum and the gaster. The gaster measures , and an acute protruding stinger, measuring [...] is present. The legs are long and slender with two tibial spurs present at each tibia, and the tarsal claws have a median tooth. The two worker specimens have little morphological differences, but they range in size. The head and segments of the antenna tend to be smaller in the holotype specimen while in the paratype they are slightly larger. The pubescence is short but scattered throughout the body, measuring [...] The colour of the specimens appears to be light-brown. The metapleural gland exhibits a notably wide and oval-shaped orifice, (openings into the body). The separation between the orifice and the posterior portion of the propodeum is twice the diameter than the orifice itself. The cuticle situated in the anterior portion (referring to what is in front) of the orifice is thinner in contrast to the cuticle surrounding the mesosoma, where it is notably transparent. An oddly shaped chamber can be seen beneath the cuticle, but this is most likely the atrium (chamber with a hardened, thickened wall). The gland itself is covered in a whitish mass and is located in the [...] region (meaning in front and toward the back) of the subcuticular chamber. The gland is said to be shrunken from its original size.|$|E
500|$|There are short, white {{pubescent}} hairs sporadically distributed {{along the}} lateral and posterior {{aspects of the}} mesosoma. [...] They are more densely arranged along the upper surface of the prothorax. [...] Hairs on the mesoscutum are short and infrequent. [...] The hairs on the <b>scutellum</b> are longer and stiffer. [...] Deep, ragged puncture marks are spaced closely together across the mesoscutum. [...] The spaces between each punctate marking are less than the diameters of the marks. [...] They are less closely associated on the scutellem. [...] At the axilla, the markings are less ragged in appearance and are spaced very close together. [...] The pleural surfaces are shiny, with puncture marks along the lower aspects being deep and ragged. [...] Higher up, these markings are less ragged and less sparsely distributed. [...] The lateral aspects of the propodeum are generally of a smoother texture, although there are crisp and shallow markings closely spaced. [...] The spine along the anterior coxal aspect is nearly obliterated. [...] The coxa are covered in dense white hairs. [...] The anterior tarsus is dark. [...] There are long brown hairs on the fronts {{of the first three}} tarsomeres. [...] The more typical fringe of hairs along the posterior aspect is absent. There is a robust mid-tibial spur. [...] The slim middle and posterior tarsi show yellow spurs. [...] There are tiny puncture marks closely spaced together on the tegula. [...] The black veined wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.|$|E
500|$|The mesosoma is [...] {{wide and}} covered in erect setae (on the dorsal surfaces). On the propodeum, the setae are {{slightly}} recurved. The neck is long and one-quarter {{the length of the}} thorax (when excluding the propodeum). V-shaped sulci are present on the dorsomedial portion of the pronotum. The promesonotal suture (a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism) is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the <b>scutellum</b> is approximately half the length of the scutum, and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular-shaped foveae that is located nearby the median line. The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow foveae. The pronotum contains little to no foveae or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C-shaped grooves and foveae. The propodeum measures [...] long and sports a slit-like spiracle which faces to the rear; the posterior margin of the propodeum is shelf-like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter (leg part attached rigidly to the femur) and femur on both the meso- and metathoracic legs (the middle and hindmost pair of legs). On the ventral margin, a subapical tooth can be seen on the large claws. The metasoma is mostly obscured by a large bubble. A large stinger appears to be present.|$|E
2500|$|Jewel bugs {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} oval-shaped bugs {{with a body}} length averaging at [...] They can easily be distinguished from stink bugs (Pentatomidae) because the shield-like enlarged last section of their thorax (known as the <b>scutellum,</b> Latin for [...] "little shield") completely covers the abdomen and the wings.|$|E
2500|$|The tergal {{plates of}} the thorax are simple {{structures}} in apterygotes {{and in many}} immature insects, but are variously modified in winged adults. The pterothoracic nota each have two main divisions: the anterior, wing-bearing alinotum and the posterior, phragma-bearing postnotum. Phragmata (singular: phragma) are plate-like apodemes that extend inwards below the antecostal sutures, marking the primary intersegmental folds between segments; phragmata provide attachment for the longitudinal flight muscles. Each alinotum (sometimes confusingly {{referred to as a}} [...] "notum") may be traversed by sutures that mark the position of internal strengthening ridges, and commonly divides the plate into three areas: the anterior prescutum, the scutum, and the smaller posterior <b>scutellum.</b> The lateral pleural sclerites are believed to be derived from the subcoxal segment of the ancestral insect leg. These sclerites may be separate, as in silverfish, or fused into an almost continuous sclerotic area, as in most winged insects.|$|E
