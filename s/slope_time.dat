50|$|Another recent {{method for}} the {{absolute}} calibration of the AHVRR record {{makes use of}} the contemporary MODIS sensor onboard NASA's TERRA and AQUA satellites. The MODIS instrument has high calibration accuracy and can track its own radiometric changes due to the inclusion of an onboard calibration system for the VIS/NIR spectral region MCST. The following method utilizes the high accuracy of MODIS to absolutely calibrate AVHRRs via simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) of both MODIS/AVHRR and AVHRR/AVHRR satellite pairs as well as MODIS-characterized surface reflectances for a Libyan Desert target and Dome-C in Antarctica et al., 2010. Ultimately, each individual calibration event available (MODIS/AVHRR SNO, Dome C, Libyan Desert, or AVHRR/AVHRR SNO) is used to provide a calibration <b>slope</b> <b>time</b> series for a given AVHRR sensor.

A quasi-one-dimensional {{numerical}} mode 1 {{containing a}} prognostic turbulent kinetic energy parameterization and simplified approximations to horizontal gradients {{is used to}} study interactions of thermally induced nocturnal slope flows with following and opposing ambient winds. It is found that a following ambient wind causes the peak perturbation wind to be weaker and to be realized at a greater height, while an opposing ambient wind leads to a stronger perturbation wind at a lower height. The reason for this response lies in the interactions of the shears of the thermal and ambient components through the mechanical production of turbulent kinetic energy.

The reference clock frequency of the TDC is 100 MHz and the input range is theoretically unlimited. The proposed converter features high accuracy, very small average error and high linear range. Also this converter has some advantages such as low circuit complexity, low power consumption and low sensitive to the temperature, power supply and process changes (PVT) compared with the time to digital converters that used preceding conversion techniques. The proposed converter uses an indirect time to digital conversion method. Therefore, our converter has the appropriate linearity without extra elements. In order to evaluate the proposed idea, an integrating time to digital converter is designed in 0. 18 μm CMOS technology and was simulated by Hspice. Comparison of the theoretical and simulation results confirms the proposed TDC operation; therefore, the proposed converter is very convenient for applications which have average speed and low variations in the signal amplitude such as biomedical signals...|$|E

SWOT, however, will not observe baseflow depth, which limits its value in estimating river discharge {{especially for those}} rivers with heterogeneous channel geometry. In this study, we aim to obtain river depths from spaceborne observations together with in situ data of river discharge. We first obtain SWOT-like observables from current satellite techniques.

The average river depth estimates along the Po River are validated against surveyed cross-section information, which shows a generally good agreement {{in the range of}} ∼ 10 % relative root mean squared error. Furthermore, we analyzed the sensitivity of error in the estimated river depth to errors of individual parameters. We show that the estimated river depth is less influenced by errors of river width and river discharge, while it is strongly influenced by errors in water level. This result gives a perspective to the SWOT mission to infer river depth by coarse estimates of river width and discharge...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if there was a correlation between functional outcome and knee kinematics. Methods: From a cohort of consecutive cases of 150 Oxford medial UKR, patients with fair/poor functional outcome at one year post surgery (OKS < 34, n= 15) were identified and matched for age, sex, pre-operative clinical scores, and follow-up period with a cohort of patients with good/excellent outcome (OKS ≥ 34, n= 15). In vivo kinematic assessment was done using step-up and deep knee bend exercises under fluoroscopic imaging. The fluoroscopic videos were analyzed using MATLAB software to measure the variation in time taken to complete the exercises, Patellar Tendon Angle (PTA) and Bearing Position (BP) with Knee Flexion Angle (KFA).

Volumetric soil water content ([theta]v) in relation to irrigation, plant uptake, and yield in potato hills and replicated plots was studied to evaluate four water management options. Measurements of [theta]v using a hammer driven probe were used to derive a [theta]v index representing the relative [theta]v status of replicated plots positioned along a hill <b>slope.</b> <b>Time</b> series for [theta]v were determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes at 5 and 15  cm depths at the center, shoulder, and furrow locations in potato hills. Sap flow was determined using flow collars in replicated field plots for four treatments: un-irrigated, sprinkler, surface drip, and sub-surface drip irrigation (40  cm depth). Irrigated yields were high/low as the [theta]v index was low/high suggesting [theta]v excess was a production problem in the wetter portions of the study area. The diurnal pattern of sap flow {{was reflected in the}} [theta]v fluctuation it induces at hill locations with appreciable uptake. Hill locations with higher plant uptake were drier as was the case for the 5  cm (dry) depth relative to the 15  cm (wet) depth and for locations in the hill (dry) relative to the furrow (wet). The surface drip system had the lowest water use requirement because it delivers water directly to the hill locations where uptake is greatest. The sub-surface drip system wetted the hill gradually (1 - 2 days). Measurement of the [theta]v index prior to experimental establishment could improve future experimental design for treatment comparisons. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} obtain a noninvasive {{estimation}} of mean pulmonary wedge pressure (MPWP) in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). Background. It has previously been demonstrated that MPWP can be reliably estimated from Doppler indexes of mitral and pulmonary venous flow (PVF) in patients with sinus rhythm. Doppler estimation of MPWP has not been validated in patients with AF. Methods. MPWP was correlated with variables of mitral and pulmonary venous flow velocity as assessed by Doppler transthoracic echocardiography in 35 consecutive patients. The derived algorithm was prospectively tested in 23 additional patients. Results. In all patients the mitral flow pattern showed only a diastolic forward component. A significant but relatively weak correlation (r = − 0. 50) was observed between MPWP and mitral deceleration time. In 12 (34 %) of 35 patients, the pulmonary vein flow tracing demonstrated only a diastolic forward component; a diastolic and late systolic forward flow was noted in the remaining 23 patients (66 %). A strong negative correlation was observed between MPWP and the normalized duration of the diastolic flow (r = − 0. 80) and its initial deceleration <b>slope</b> <b>time</b> (r = − 0. 91). Deceleration time > 220 ms predicted MPWP ≤ 12 mm Hg with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. When estimating MPWP by using the equation MPWP= − 94. 261 PVF deceleration time− 9. 831 Interval QRS to onset of diastolic PVF− 16. 337 Duration of PVF+ 44. 261, the measured and predicted MPWP closely agreed with a mean difference of − 0. 85 mm Hg.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a test of}} a very simple model for predicting beach slope changes. The model assumes that these changes are a function of both the incident wave conditions and the beach slope itself. Following other studies, we hypothesized that the beach slope evolves towards an equilibrium value that depends nonlinearly on wave steepness (H/L). The rate of beach slope response is assumed to depend on both the degree of slope disequilibrium and on the incident wave energy. The model was tested against daily beach slope observations derived from digital images of the nearshore zone. Approximately, 104 images were analyzed over eight, mostly consecutive, month-long periods along a 2 km length of beach. The slope change model was calibrated by fitting it to the daily differences in the alongshore-averaged slopes, which were obtained from a 500 m (alongshore) subset of the observations. An equilibrium slope prediction proportional to the wave steepness (H/L) raised to the − 1 st to − 2 nd power performed best compared to several alternative models. The response rate of beach slope changes depended on the wave height, raised to the 3 rd or 4 th power. A characteristic response time for the system {{was found to be}} 1 – 2 days. The calibrated (i. e. hindcast) model explained 30 – 40 % of the observed slope change variance, indicating that the model was consistent with the data. However, when the model was used to predict the evolution of the beach <b>slope</b> <b>time</b> series (i. e. to forecast), the prediction error variance was equal to or only slightly lower than the observed temporal variability in the slopes.
