50|$|The first {{power station}} on the site was the {{coal-fired}} Littlebrook A Power Station, built by the Kent Electric Power Company in the early 1930s. It was opened in 1939. Coal was initially brought to the station by rail, until a riverside pier was completed. The station was later converted to burn supplementary oil over coal, and remained in use until it closed in 1973. The 'Station had six coal-fired boilers, 3 chain grate and 3 pulverised fuel. The steam raised in the boilers was fed to three steam receivers which in turn supplied three steam turbine generators. Two of the turbines were supplied by CA Parsons at 30 MW each driving a directly coupled air cooled alternator running at 3000 rpm. The third turbine was supplied by BTH running at 1500 rpm driving a 4-pole air cooled alternator. In its last years the 1500 4 pole alternator was decoupled from its turbine and used as a <b>synchronous</b> <b>compensator</b> thereby providing voltage regulation to its local grid.|$|E

Economic and environmental pressures force electric companies to enhance the power transfer capability of the existing transmission lines instead of constructing new ones.

40|$|Static <b>synchronous</b> <b>compensators</b> {{have been}} broadly {{employed}} for {{the provision of}} electrical ac network services, which include voltage regulation, network balance, and stability improvement. Several studies of such compensators have also been conducted to improve the ac network operation during unbal- anced voltage sags. This paper presents a complete control scheme intended for <b>synchronous</b> <b>compensators</b> operating under these abnormal network conditions. In particular, this control scheme introduces two contributions: a novel reactive current reference generator and a new voltage support control loop. The current reference generator has as a main feature the capacity to supply the required reactive current even when the voltage drops in amplitude during the voltage sag. Thus, a safe system operation is easily guaranteed by fixing the limit required current to the maximum rated current. The voltage control loop is able to imple- ment several control strategies by setting two voltage set points. In this paper, three voltage support control strategies are proposed, and their advantages and limitations are discussed in detail. The two theoretical contributions of this paper have been validated by experimental results. Certainly, the topic of voltage support is open for further research, and the control scheme proposed in this paper can be viewed as an interesting configuration to devise other control strategies in future works.
