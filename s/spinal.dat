5|$|At {{each level}} of the <b>spinal</b> column, <b>spinal</b> nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} <b>spinal</b> cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific <b>spinal</b> nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single <b>spinal</b> nerve is called a myotome. The part of the <b>spinal</b> cord that was damaged corresponds to the <b>spinal</b> nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the <b>spinal</b> cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the <b>spinal</b> cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, <b>spinal</b> nerves branch off of the <b>spinal</b> cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the <b>spinal</b> cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific <b>spinal</b> nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the <b>spinal</b> cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{arterial}} bubbles {{may reach}} the <b>spinal</b> cord and grow on site from local gas and produce <b>spinal</b> neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of the <b>spinal</b> {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper <b>spinal</b> cord, from where the <b>spinal</b> cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the <b>spinal</b> {{accessory nerve}} itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|E
5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the <b>spinal</b> {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the <b>spinal</b> cord. This cluster of neurons, called the <b>spinal</b> accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the <b>spinal</b> cord, and stretches from where the <b>spinal</b> cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the <b>spinal</b> column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the <b>spinal</b> column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the <b>spinal</b> cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying <b>spinal</b> column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the <b>spinal</b> cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable <b>spinal</b> column injury.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the <b>spinal</b> accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the <b>spinal</b> cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior <b>spinal</b> artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the <b>spinal</b> tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and <b>spinal</b> cord. As holes form in the <b>spinal</b> dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the <b>spinal</b> epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the <b>spinal</b> column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the <b>spinal</b> canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a <b>spinal</b> tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the <b>spinal</b> fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged the <b>spinal</b> {{column and}} reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the <b>spinal</b> scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the <b>spinal</b> cord and hindbrain. <b>Spinal</b> motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the <b>spinal</b> cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic <b>spinal</b> circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Pancoast tumor pain {{has been}} {{effectively}} treated with dorsal root entry zone lesioning (destruction {{of a region}} of the <b>spinal</b> cord where peripheral pain signals cross to <b>spinal</b> cord fibers); this is major surgery that carries the risk of significant neurological side effects.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and <b>spinal</b> leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are <b>spinal.</b> Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. <b>Spinal</b> leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the <b>spinal</b> cord. Both cranial and <b>spinal</b> spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, <b>spinal</b> stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar <b>spinal</b> nerve 5 (L5) or sacral <b>spinal</b> nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog {{is an example of}} a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the {{coccygeal}} vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a <b>spinal</b> vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped <b>spinal</b> cavity which can put pressure on the <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the <b>spinal</b> cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of <b>spinal</b> cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the <b>spinal</b> component. The <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, <b>spinal</b> or lumbar puncture (e.g. <b>spinal</b> injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the level}} of the aortic arch, the {{distribution}} of blood likely to carry bubbles to neurological tissue such as the brain or the <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|E
5|$|Complications of <b>spinal</b> cord {{injuries}} include pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, neurogenic shock, and paralysis {{below the}} injury site.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports <b>spinal</b> fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have <b>spinal</b> fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding <b>spinal</b> implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a {{systematic}} review {{of studies on}} mattresses concluded that medium-firm, custom-inflated mattresses were best for pain and neutral <b>spinal</b> alignment.|$|E
5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the <b>spinal</b> cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. This {{leads to the}} development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (<b>spinal,</b> bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of the <b>spinal</b> cord is performed to distinguish between Guillain–Barré syndrome and other conditions causing limb weakness, such as <b>spinal</b> cord compression. If an MRI scan shows enhancement of the nerve roots, this may be indicative of GBS. In children, this feature is present in 95% of scans, {{but it is not}} specific to Guillain–Barré syndrome, so other confirmation is also needed.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and <b>spinal</b> immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival <b>spinal</b> cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or <b>spinal</b> manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending <b>spinal</b> manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended <b>spinal</b> manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of <b>spinal</b> polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with <b>spinal</b> polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. <b>Spinal</b> polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spinal</b> polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the <b>spinal</b> column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When <b>spinal</b> neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or <b>spinal</b> cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and <b>spinal</b> cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, {{as well as the}} central canal of the <b>spinal</b> cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve {{is derived from}} the basal plate of the embryonic <b>spinal</b> segments C1–C6.|$|E
5|$|The medulla, {{along with}} the <b>spinal</b> cord, {{contains}} many small nuclei involved {{in a wide variety}} of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{is a major}} {{branch of}} the sacral plexus, with fibers {{originating}} in Onuf's nucleus in the sacral region of the <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American <b>Spinal</b> Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the <b>spinal</b> cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} <b>spinal</b> tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} underlying cause of SCSFLS are {{as a result of}} a connective tissue disorder or <b>spinal</b> drainage problems.|$|E
