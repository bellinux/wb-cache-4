She passed houses which had been wrecked. Trucks clanged and shunted, great lorries rumbled smoothly by. Sea--and Air-planes were moving like great birds far up in the bright haze, and khaki was everywhere. But it was the sea Noel wanted. She made her way westward to a little beach; and, sitting down on a stone, opened her arms to catch the sun on her face and chest. The tide was nearly up, with the wavelets of a blue bright sea. The great fact, the greatest fact in the world, except the sun; vast and free, making everything human seem small and transitory! It did her good, like a tranquillising friend. The sea might be cruel and terrible, awful things it could do, and awful things were being done on it; but its wide level line, its never-ending song, its sane savour, were the best medicine she could possibly have taken. She rubbed the <b>Shelly</b> <b>sand</b> between her fingers in absurd ecstasy; took off her shoes and stockings, paddled, and sat drying her legs in the sun.|$|E
6000|$|The {{rocks of}} St. Paul appear from a {{distance}} of a brilliantly white colour. This is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of seafowl, and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a pearly lustre, which is intimately united {{to the surface of the}} rocks. This, when examined with a lens, is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers, its total thickness being about the tenth of an inch. It contains much animal matter, and its origin, no doubt, is due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds' dung. Below some small masses of guano at Ascension, and on the Abrolhos Islets, I found certain stalactitic branching bodies, formed apparently in the same manner as the thin white coating on these rocks. The branching bodies so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae (a family of hard calcareous sea-plants), that in lately looking hastily over my collection I did not perceive the difference. The globular extremities of the branches are of a pearly texture, like the enamel of teeth, but so hard as just to scratch plate-glass. I may here mention, that on a part of the coast of Ascension, where there is a vast accumulation of <b>shelly</b> <b>sand,</b> an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks, by the water of the sea, resembling, as represented in Plate 4, certain cryptogamic plants (Marchantiae) often seen on damp walls. The surface of the fronds is beautifully glossy; and those parts formed where fully exposed to the light, are of a jet black colour, but those shaded under ledges are only grey. I have shown specimens of this incrustation to several geologists, and they all thought that they were of volcanic or igneous origin! In its hardness and translucency--in its polish, equal to that of the finest oliva-shell--in the bad smell given out, and loss of colour under the blowpipe--it shows a close similarity with living sea-shells. Moreover in sea-shells, it is known that the parts habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal, are of a paler colour than those fully exposed to the light, just as is the case with this incrustation. When we remember that lime, either as a phosphate or carbonate, enters into the composition of the hard parts, such as bones and shells, of all living animals, it is an interesting physiological fact to find substances harder than the enamel of teeth, and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh shell, re-formed through inorganic means from dead organic matter--mocking, also, in shape, some of the lower vegetable productions. (1/6. Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described ("Philosophical Transactions" [...] 1836 page 65) a singular [...] "artificial substance resembling shell." [...] It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly polished, brown-coloured laminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water. It is much softer, more transparent, and contains more animal matter, than the natural incrustation at Ascension; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell.) ...|$|E

50|$|The redeposited {{cementing}} material is most commonly calcareous or siliceous. Limestones, which were originally a loose accumulation of shells, corals, etc., become compacted into firm rock in this manner; {{and the process}} often takes place with surprising ease, as for example in the deeper parts of coral reefs, or even in wind-blown masses of <b>shelly</b> <b>sand</b> exposed merely to the action of rain. The cementing substance may be regularly deposited in crystalline continuity on the original grains, where these were crystalline; and even in sandstones (such as Kentish Rag) a crystalline matrix of calcite often envelops the sand grains. The change of aragonite to calcite and of calcite to dolomite, by forming new crystalline masses {{in the interior of}} the rock, usually also accelerates consolidations. Silica is less easily soluble in ordinary waters, but even this ingredient of rocks is dissolved and redeposited with great frequency. Many sandstones are held together by an infinitesimal amount of colloid or cryptocrystalline silica; when freshly dug from the quarry they are soft and easily trimmed, but after exposure to the air for some time they become much harder, as their siliceous cement sets and passes into a rigid condition. Others contain fine scales of kaolin or of mica. Argillaceous materials may be compacted by mere pressure, like graphite and other scaly minerals.|$|E
50|$|From 1935 {{the central}} {{peninsula}} including {{the area of}} the present primary school was farmed by Pop (Herbert) and Edith Ellen Leach, Edith Leach's parents Nan and Frederick Burton, who had accompanied their daughter Edith to New Zealand in 1919 from Kent, England, and their children Allan, Bert, Gladys, Joan and Mick, who ran a dairy herd of 30-40 cows. The Burton/Leaches lived in the old 2-story Buckland managers homestead which was located on the rise in what is now Clovelly Road, at about number 151D. An old concrete structure referred to as the dairy was still on the site up to the 1963 development. This was a solid concrete structure about 4m by 5m by 3m high, with a wooden floor that had rotted away. The concrete used the <b>shelly</b> <b>sand</b> off a local beach.

As the Leach/Burton family had the use of the large Buckland house this was not needed so the bach was let out to extended family or friends such as the Pattens over the holidays.

40|$|The Lake Poukawa Basin {{is a large}} co-seismic {{depression}} {{located at}} 20 m {{above mean sea level}} in Hawke 2 ̆ 7 s Bay in eastern North Island, New Zealand. We present a detailed environmental history of the basin for the last c. 60 ka based on analyses of the top 105 m of a 200 -m core record. Dating control is provided by radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and U/Th disequilibrium ages. The chronology is supported by nine tephras of inferred age including marker tephras, Kawakawa (22 590 ± 230 yr BP at - 18. 25 m core datum), Tahuna (c. 35 - 43 ka) at - 33. 1 m core datum, and Rotoehu (45 - 50 ka) at - 39. 1 m core datum. Disagreements between some of the older tephra ages and the numerical ages from the OSL and U/Th dating mean that more than one age model can be applied. Three major lithostratigraphic units are identified: a basal calcareous silt with lignitic peats between 105. 28 and 98. 58 m of marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 3 age; an extended sequence of detrital <b>shelly</b> <b>sands</b> and silts, between 98. 58 and 8 m of MIS 3 and 2 age; and a Holocene peat unit (MIS 1) from 8 to 0 m. Alternatively, but less likely, the basal unit may represent stage MIS 5 a and the detrital <b>shelly</b> <b>sands</b> would then contain an amalgam of MIS 4, 3, and 2 deposits. We propose a notably moist phase represented by the peat which our numerical dating model places near the start of isotope stage 3. This suggests the existence of mild conditions during an interstadial in central New Zealand at c. 55 - 50 ka when a podocarp - beech - broadleaf forest of near-interglacial affinity surrounded the basin. The interstadial is marked by both lake and peat formation in the basin. After 50 ka a thermal decline set in, though the climate remained moist initially. Under these conditions, the Poukawa Basin was rapidly infilled by alluvial fan deposits from the surrounding hills. The floor of the basin was occupied by grasses and sedges, responding to both the highly disturbed environment and swampy conditions in the basin. After the deposition of the Rotoehu Ash, effective precipitation declined markedly and woody shrubs expanded across the previously swampy basin floor. The data suggest an apparent thermal decline of c. 6 - 7 °C for much of MIS 2 and the latter half of MIS 3.

Vertical sections from a trench cut across the ridge also attest o its landward migration, with gently landward-dipping interbeds of sand and shell.

The migration rate in the stormy winter monsoon season was generally two or three times greater than that of the remaining season. However, in the summer of 1992, a typhoon entering the Yellow Sea vigorously shifted the ridge landward, causing a displace-merit of up to 11 m in a few days.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Crypfosporidium parvum is a {{waterborne}} pathogen {{known to}} reside in surface waters throughout the US. Recent Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks from drinking water wells {{are the result of}} this contaminant transporting between surface and ground water systems. With a high resistance to typical groundwater treatment procedures, aquifer infiltration by Crypfosporidium poses a serious threat. Since groundwater wells are the main source of drinking water supply in the State of Florida, understanding certain factors that affect the passage of C. parvum into the subsurface would prevent future outbreaks. This study examines Florida’s surficial geology, recharge capacity, and possible sinkhole development as they influence the risk of groundwater contamination. Microscopic Particulate Analysis (MPA) sampling was performed on 71 9 public water systems distributed throughout Florida. Sampling results defined the wells as having high, moderate, or low risk to surface water influence. The results of this study indicated that the hydrogeology of an area tends to influence the MPA Risk Index (RI) of a well. Areas of higher aquifer recharge generally contained the majority of the moderate and highrisk wells. Surficial geologic regions of <b>shelly</b> <b>sand</b> and clay, limestone, and clayey sand contained over 80 % of the high-risk wells.

40|$|International audienceIn the NW Normandy, {{only the}} Cotentin {{peninsula}} has preserved {{record of a}} thick Cenozoic sedimentary series (about 280 m) covered partially by Holocene sediments. As late as the Eocene, the Cotentin basin was open toward the Atlantic Ocean and separated from it by Paleozoic rocky shoals which controlled the tidal currents. During the Cenozoic times, it was a bay or a tidal estuary between the North and the South Cotentin reliefs. The Cenozoic sedimentary series {{may be explained by}} the high eustatic sea-levels due to repetitive transgressions of Atlantic Ocean over the Armorican massif (Middle Lutetian to Bartonian; Lower Oligocene; Middle Miocene; Plio-Pleistocene) which transported <b>shelly</b> <b>sands</b> and gravels (faluns) or tidal quartzose sands. The Cenozoic sedimentary series are also characterized by few sedimentary gaps (Paleocene, Lower to Middle Eocene, Middle to Upper Oligocene, Lower to Upper Miocene, Lower Pliocene) which may be due to deformations, uplifts and erosions. The repetitive Atlantic transgressions over the Armorican massif were extended through the Channel basin to the present-day Seine valley and finally to the Paris basin. These repeated transgressions can account for the presence of shelly or quartzose marine sands in the Seine valley of which few were eroded or remained during the Plio-Pleistocene times.

Initial deposition is characterized by local reworking of marine <b>shelly</b> <b>sands</b> dating to Marine Isotopic Stage 5 e (MIS 5 e).

The allochthonous components reflect soil degradation and vegetation changes around the cave during the last interglacial. Human occupations seems to be somewhat ephemeral in nature, with some stratigraphic units apparently lacking archaeological components, while in others the human-associated deposits (e. g., burned bones, charcoal, and ashes) can be substantial. Ephemeral breaks in sedimentation and/or erosion followed by stabilization are mainly discernible microscopically by the presence of phosphatic-rich laminae interpreted as short-lived surfaces, peaks of increased humidity and colonization by plants. More substantial erosion affects the uppermost Aterian layers, presumably due to localized reconfigurations of the cave 2 ̆ 7 s roof. The subsequent Iberomaurusian deposits are not in their primary position and are associated with well-sorted silts of aeolian origin.

The shelf south of San Nicolas is narrow and sloping and is covered for the most part by terrigenous sand and sandy mud. Eocene Foraminifera have been recovered from a number of submarine outcrops near the island. Several outcrops on {{the outer edge of the}} northern shelf have yielded siliceous casts of what may be Miocene Foraminifera. Recent Foraminifera from the shelf sediments have been investigated and show depth zonation in general agreement with that established by Natland (1933) and more recently by Butcher (1951) ...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the CARLA- 11 core drilled {{along the}} lower Loukkos valley near Larache in {{northern}} Morocco shows a thin level of <b>shelly</b> <b>sand</b> at 465 to 482 cm depth, whose sedimentological features {{are those of}} a high-energy, certainly a tsunami deposit. The level can be subdivided into 3 subunits: Subunit 1 (6 cm) shows a sharp erosive base and comprises basal medium to coarse sands containing numerous marine shell fragments of bivalves, plant fragments and rip-up clasts of organic matter. Subunit 2 (7 cm) is a flame structure consisting of coarse sand containing a layer of organic matter and another one of greyish clay. Subunit 3 (4 cm) is similar to subunit 1 and consists of coarse sands containing numerous complete or broken shells of bivalves, plant fragments and dark organic matter. The deposit is mostly composed of subangular to subrounded quartz grains derived from nearby Miocene sandstones. Benthic and planctonic foraminifera are common within the samples. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show two major lows at 350 cm, and especially at 477 cm within the high-energy deposit. Subunit 1 {{can be interpreted as}} the result of the first wave uprush of a tsunami, the fine mud level of subunit 2 capping subunit 1 can be interpreted as emplaced during a decantation phase, and subunit 2 probably corresponds to a second wave uprush, Subunit 3 might be interpreted {{as the result of the}} backwash (outflow phase). The age of this event can be roughly dated between 5 and 3 ky BP according to recent dating of nearby levels...|$|E
40|$|Seismic profiles, sidescan sonar data, bottom {{photography}} and sampling proved {{for the first}} time that there are giant carbonate mounds (bioherms) in the Rockall Trough. The Pelagia Mounds, on the northern Porcupine Bank, are relatively isolated whereas most of the Logachev Mounds, on the southeast Rockall Bank, form a field of closely spaced, contiguous mounds. They are all found on the upper slope at depths between about 500 and 1200 m and as a result of this study about 500 have been mapped. They have a variety of shapes and the larger ones are very steep-sided, up to 350 m high and 2 km wide at the base. Sediment samples show that the mounds consist of pale coloured muds, mainly aragonite, usually with live and/or dead cold-water corals at the seafloor and with buried dead corals. Coral thickets appear to be detected as a brush-like signature on high resolution profiles and as a speckled pattern on high resolution sidescan sonar records. <b>Shelly</b> <b>sands</b> are found on the seabed between the mounds. Currents in the mound areas are strong enough to transport sands along slope as medium-sized sand waves and to prevent pelagic deposition, thus providing surfaces for initial coral settlement by the winnowing of fines to leave glacial dropstones and exposed rocks. These observations show that the poleward-directed upper slope current of the eastern North Atlantic extends further south than hitherto known and that there is a southwesterly directed current on Rockall Bank. There are waves on the Logachev Mounds, with a wavelength of about 20 – 30 m, that are thought to be moulded in carbonate muds by across-slope directed internal tidal currents and/or cascading currents. Mounds develop above erosional surfaces seen on seismic data. The huge amount of carbonate mud seems to be produced by the rapid growth and breakdown of cold-water corals living in a very favourable environment. Intermediate nepheloid layers formed upstream by the strong currents may provide the food source for the deep water suspension feeders. Conditions for giant mound growth require an ideal balance between current speed and sedimentation rate, among other factors. No evidence for the suggested link to methane seepage has been found so far...|$|R
40|$|According to D’Olier (1981), the Flandrian {{sea-level rise}} caused a {{transgression}} over an initial surface topography whereby the present sandbank positions and shapes reflect ancient transitory islands, coalesced beaches, confluent channel bars and changing coastline positions. It {{is known that}} in this region of the North Sea, most of the underlying Palaeogene units consist of clayey sediments, alternated {{with only a few}} sandy layers. On top of these are, apart from scour hollow infillings with Pleistocene sediments, the sandbanks, which consist of Holocene sediments. A thin gravel lag veneer would form {{the lower part of the}} Holocene sediments followed by a sandy succession. Kirby and Oele (1975) found out that in the nearby Sandettié - Fairy Bank area, there is a well-developed graded succession from flint and shell gravel at the base up to <b>shelly</b> quartz <b>sands.</b> This succession indicates a decrease in energy conditions at the bed during the period of deposition and a subsequent slow regional rise in sea-level. Most probably the succession is a drape over an originally irregular seabed. Moreover, the Holocene thickness is less than 2. 5 m in the swales between the sandbanks, indicating possible source areas where gravel can be found...|$|R
50|$|Several {{environmental}} factors exert important influences on vegetation on the Crow's Nest Peninsula. First, the steep terrain made {{most of the}} site unsuitable for agriculture, so it was never fragmented or plowed. It {{is one of the}} largest unfragmented patches of hardwood forests in Virginia's coastal plain. The steepness also limited logging to a substantial degree. Secondly, the mix of freshwater tidal wetlands, ravine bottoms, steep slopes of various aspect, and high ridgecrests has led to a high biodiversity, including sites important in neotropical bird migration. Lastly, the Lower Tertiary deposits in this part of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain consist largely of glauconitic <b>sand,</b> <b>shelly</b> clay-silt, and some sandy limestone and calcium-rich sands. These contribute to the development of relatively basic, nutrient-rich soils. Basic or calcareous soil environments are uncommon to rare on the Virginia coastal plain and can support vegetation unusual for the region.|$|R
