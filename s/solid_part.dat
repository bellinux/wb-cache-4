2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a <b>solid</b> <b>part</b> from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{capacity}} of transvaginal Doppler ultrasound examination with that of gray scale sonography as an aid in distinguishing benign and malignant pelvic tumors of suspected adnexal origin. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and fifty-one women scheduled for laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery because of a pelvic mass of suspected adnexal origin underwent ultrasound examination including color and spectral Doppler techniques within 8 days preceding the operation. Based on the gray scale ultrasound image, each tumor was classified as being either a unilocular cyst, a multilocular cyst, a unilocular cyst with <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> a multilocular cyst with <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> or a <b>solid</b> tumor. Tumor vascularization was visualized with the color Doppler technique, each tumor being characterized by the color content of the scan, as rated subjectively on a visual analogue scale ('tumor color score'). Blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained by placing the Doppler gate over the colored area with the tumor. The blood flow velocity waveform with the highest time averaged maximum velocity was used to characterize the tumor. The results of gray scale imaging and Doppler ultrasound examination were compared with the histology of the specimen. RESULTS: Ultrasound morphology correctly identified all the malignant tumors, with a false-positive rate of 61 %; none of the 49 unilocular or multilocular cysts without <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> was malignant, whereas 24 % (24 / 102) of the tumors with solid components were. Among multilocular cysts with <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> both tumor color scores and time average maximum blood flow velocities were significantly higher in malignant than in benign tumors, but among solid tumors there was complete overlap in Doppler results between the malignant and benign subgroups. Using Doppler examination to discriminate between benign and malignant multilocular cysts with <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> and ultrasound morphology for differentiation of the remaining tumors, all the malignancies {{in the study were}} detected with a false-positive rate of 32 or 38 % depending on which Doppler variable was used. CONCLUSION: The present technique of Doppler ultrasound examination is helpful only in the differential diagnosis of multilocular cysts with <b>solid</b> <b>parts.</b> Therefore, the degree to which Doppler examination can contribute to the differential diagnosis of pelvic tumors will depend on the proportion of multilocular cysts with <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> in the population studied: the greater this proportion, the greater the potential of the Doppler examination to improve diagnostic accuracy...|$|R

A numerical model to predict the temperature field in a hermetic reciprocating compressor for household refrigeration appliances is presented in this work. The model combines a high resolution three-dimensional heat conduction formulation of the compressorâ€™s <b>solid</b> <b>parts,</b> a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach for the gas line domain and lumped formulations of the shell gas and the lubrication oil. Heat transfer coefficients are determined by applying CFD to the gas line side and correlations from the literature on the shell gas and oil side, respectively. The valve in the gas line simulation is modelled as a parallel moving flat plate. By means of an iterative loop the temperature field of the <b>solid</b> <b>parts</b> acts as boundary condition for the CFD calculation of the gas line which returns a cycle averaged quantity of heat to the <b>solid</b> <b>parts.</b> Using an iteration method which is based on the temperature deviation between two iteration steps, the total number of iterations and consequently the computational time can be reduced.
