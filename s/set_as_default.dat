5000|$|In addition, in {{the first}} release of Windows XP, the [...] "Buy Music Online" [...] feature always used Microsoft's Internet Explorer rather than any other web browser that the user may have <b>set</b> <b>as</b> his/her <b>default.</b> Under {{pressure}} from the United States Department of Justice, Microsoft released a patch in early 2004, which corrected the problem.|$|R
50|$|In {{a choice}} context, a default refers to that option which choosers {{end up with}} {{if they do not}} make an active choice. This notion is similar to the one in {{computer}} science where defaults are settings or values that are automatically assigned outside of user intervention. Setting the default affects how likely people end up with an option. This is called the default effect. More precisely, it refers to changes in the probability that an agent chooses a particular option when it is set as a default as opposed to the situation where this option has not been <b>set</b> <b>as</b> <b>default.</b> For example, different countries have different rules on how to become an organ donor. In countries with the opt-in policy, all citizens are automatically considered as non-donors unless they actively register as donors. In countries with the opt-out policy, all citizens are automatically considered as donors unless they actively seek to be struck from the register. It has been argued that this difference in policy is the main cause of the significant difference in donor rates across the respective countries.|$|E
5000|$|Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was {{released}} on September 9, 2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB 2.0 support, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, [...]NET Framework support, and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming Media Center and Tablet PC editions of XP. The most significant change on SP1 was the addition of Set Program Access and Defaults, a settings page which allows programs to be <b>set</b> <b>as</b> <b>default</b> for certain types of activities (such as media players or web browsers) and for access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player) to be disabled. This feature was added {{to comply with the}} settlement of United States v. Microsoft Corp., which required Microsoft to offer the ability for OEMs to bundle third-party competitors to software it bundles with Windows (such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player), and give them the same level of prominence as those normally bundled with the OS.|$|E

50|$|Opera 26 was {{released}} on December 3, 2014, based on Chromium 39. This is the first new stable version on Linux since 12.16, released on July 4, 2013. This version introduced the ability to import data from other browsers, including bookmarks and passwords. It also features the ability to share selected bookmarks via a URL, and integrated a print preview. Bing {{was removed from the}} default search engine list, and can thus no longer be <b>set</b> <b>as</b> the <b>default.</b>|$|R
50|$|Players {{are given}} four primary battle classes, Jedi, Trooper, Sith, and Mercenary to rank up in and obtain {{exclusive}} rewards. The Trooper class is <b>set</b> <b>as</b> a <b>default</b> for all players and is free, while sinister classes, Sith and Mercenary require a Station Cash purchase of 750 SC to experience. Unlike the other battle classes, Jedi is only accessible through a paid membership without any additional purchase.

While Minimum Interfeature Distance was set to 2, Limit Hits was set to First N and Maximum Hits was set to 500. Most of other parameters were <b>set</b> <b>as</b> <b>default.</b> Eventually, the top 10000 (pharmacophore) molecules were chosen to the docking process.|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} of the personalisation algorithm is initiated when the user has used the application several (X) times, so that the algorithm can record his/her preferences (in order {{that the history of}} his/her previous selections is formed) and create his/her profile. This is when the maximum acceptable walking distance, the least acceptable transportation mean type and the maximum number of acceptable interchanges will have a value, in accordance to the past user selections. This value X can be specified by each service provider, however here, it is <b>set</b> <b>as</b> <b>default</b> to 7; this value was defined as a result of comparative user testing [6].|$|E
30|$|The support vector {{regression}} (SVR) [57], {{a robust}} regressor for function estimation based on support vectors, has been employed by state-of-the-art face-based age estimation [37]. Its basic concept {{is to determine}} a function that has at most ε deviation from the actually obtained target (i.e., ground truth age) for training gait features and is simultaneously as smooth as possible, which makes the SVR less sensitive to outliers. In this study, linear and Gaussian kernels were used and the hyperparameters were <b>set</b> <b>as</b> <b>default</b> values in MATLAB functions. More specifically, we set the following: penalty coefficient C= 18.53 for the Gaussian kernel and C= 1 for the linear kernel, and parameter for ε deviation ε= 1.85. Additionally, we set the kernel scale factor for Gaussian kernel function to 32.88.|$|E

40|$|The current {{economic}} and financial crisis has shaken confidence in funded pension systems in general and in defined contribution (DC) pension plans in particular. The crisis has highlighted the impact of market conditions on retirement savings accumulated in DC pension plans and the uncertainty as to whether those retirement savings may prove adequate to finance retirement – particularly for those close to retirement. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide recommendations on how to ensure adequate retirement income from DC pension plans. In this context, this paper addresses three main questions: 1) How much do people need to save? 2) How can the effects of market risk on DC pension plans be alleviated? 3) How can retirement income be protected during the payout phase? The analysis concludes that in order to deliver adequate retirement income from DC pension plans with a certain degree of certainty, there is a need for comprehensive measures which include: higher contributions; increasing the contribution period by postponing retirement; <b>setting</b> <b>as</b> <b>default</b> options relatively conservative investment policies including life-cycle strategies; and managing risk in the payout phase with inflationindexed life annuities. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The energy bandgap (Eg) {{of silicon}} thin film {{prepared}} by plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD) is greatly dependent on the deposition conditions. Although the influence of some deposition parameters on Eg has been studied individually, {{it is still not}} clear which parameter plays the most important role. Here, a 5 -factor 5 -level factorial experiment was designed and carried out for the deposition parameters: the flow rate of SiH 4, the flow rate of H 2, the plasma power, the total gas pressure, and the substrate temperature. By making main effect analysis to the influences of such 5 factors on Eg, not only the influence of each deposition parameter was obtained, but also the most critical parameters were selected out. It was found that the gas flow rate of SiH 4 and the total gas pressure played the most important roles on determining Eg of silicon thin film. That is to say, in order to obtain an expected Eg for Si thin film prepared by PECVD, much attention should be paid to optimize the two parameters. However, other parameters, including the H 2 flow rate, the plasma power and the substrate temperature, can be <b>set</b> <b>as</b> <b>default</b> values according to the experience. Thus, the optimization workload can be reduced greatly...|$|E

50|$|At the time, {{not having}} a {{standing}} charge for such a comprehensive service, especially the webspace, was a radical step. Further revenue was obtained from advertisements on Freeserve's homepage, which was <b>set</b> <b>as</b> the <b>default</b> page in the customers' web browsers upon installing the Freeserve connection software.

500|$|Windows 8.1 with Bing is a reduced-cost SKU of Windows 8.1 {{that was}} {{introduced}} by Microsoft in May 2014 {{in an effort to}} further encourage the production of low-cost Windows devices, whilst [...] "driving end-user usage of Microsoft Services such as Bing and OneDrive".
