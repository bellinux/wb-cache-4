25|$|Eva Funke {{analyses}} {{the description}} of the Inca state as a utopian bourgeois society in the third volume as a critique of Campe’s contemporary society. Thus {{the description of}} the ruling system, for instance, functions as a mirror to the current systems of the German states and shows a utopian ideal where the bourgeois characteristic of competence is more important than birth. In addition, Funke points to the recurring motif of revolution in Discovery. The trilogy is presenting revolutions as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> avoided because they can hinder achieving one’s goals and are responsible for the downfall of peoples.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E

40|$|At a {{time when}} mental health is finally well and truly a ‘hot topic’, firmly {{embedded}} in the public consciousness, I can’t help feeling that we’re quietly omitting {{a vital part of}} the discussion – our relationship as a nation with alcohol, and how it affects our mental well-being. The term “mental health” is a wide-ranging one, and it can be argued that at the moment it has somewhat negative connotations and is almost synonymous, in public discourse, with mental ill-health and suicide – <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> quickly change.

The overall goal of the coordinators is to facilitate conversations amongst faculty members teaching the required Runes courses to ensure coherence in learning goals and student experiences across them. Each coordinator is responsible for a subset of the major courses and meets with the faculty associated with their set of courses at least once each semester. Collectively, the coordinators collaborate to support coherence across the curriculum and provide instructional support more generally.|$|R

50|$|How the Other Half Lives {{follows a}} general outline for the charity {{writings}} of the nineteenth century: a section on crime, the Protestant virtues and vices (intemperance, idleness, disorder, uncleanliness), miserable conditions of living, disease, the loss of modesty (especially women), {{the dissolution of the}} family, the institutions that would help in their uplift, as well as future sources of reform. The difference was the introduction of photography to prove the squalid conditions, and increase sympathy for the individuals living in these slums. Riis finally convinced the average reader of newspapers that the poor were not so by choice; that the dangerous and unhygienic conditions in which they lived were imposed by society, rather than the result of loose moral standards; that the slums were <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be fixed rather than gaped at or shunned.|$|R

In contrast to the other Benelux states moving towards roles as peacekeepers and mediators, the Netherlands were opposed to the French decision to leave Brussels from the beginning. They quickly aligned themselves with the positions of West Germany and Italy, while recognising the benefits of continued communication with France as the community moved forward. Nevertheless, they were largely in favour of proceeding with official negotiations with only five states and, if possible, making decisions for France {{to come to terms with}} if they rejoined the community in the future.|$|R
50|$|Tiger penis, deer penis, turtle penis, or bull penis is {{consumed}} in restaurants {{in parts of}} China and southeast Asia and is commonly offered as a soup delicacy.

A dried tiger penis is more commonly sold at around $2500 (£1300) in Singapore and Taiwan. The penis can be taken in soup, ground in wine (tiger penis wine), or soaked in rice. One method of preparation, particularly in the Mekong River Delta, is to place a dried tiger penis, with testicles still attached, into a bottle of French cognac or Chinese wine and let it soak for many weeks.

Walsh reported the matter to the Metropolitan for the Diocese of Ferns, Desmond Connell, Cardinal Archbishop of Dublin. A report on the matter was prepared for the Vatican. Comiskey was not interviewed during the preparation of this report. The report concluded that a delict had not been committed as regards the behaviour alleged but the fact that, under the influence of alcohol, Comiskey was alleged to have acted in such a manner was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be addressed to ensure that no repetition of such behaviour could take place.|$|R
