500|$|Bruno {{estimates}} {{one-sixth of}} the effects budget was spent on the Golden Gate Bridge scene, which employed both a miniature of the bridge and computer graphics. The effects team had to work without reference footage due {{to the city of}} San Francisco vetting any filming in the actual bridge, including aerial shooting as the area has restrictions on flying helicopters. Framestore had further challenges in matching the varied weather conditions across the film's plates. As compositing supervisor Matt Twyford detailed, [...] "the elements consisted of cold, rainy night live-action footage from Vancouver, sunny day miniature elements, traditional misty day background plates of San Francisco, and of course the CG bridge and fx elements." [...] Another miniature was for the Grey home, which had a destructable equivalent matched the Canadian location and also had a digital equivalent. A notable effect was the [...] "digital skin-grafting", which rejuvenated the faces of senior actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, made by the Brothers Strause's Lola Visual Effects. Bruno made <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the atomization made by Phoenix was not too vivid and gruesome, instead resembling oatmeal.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl was}} conquered, so they thought, mother and daughter; and Constance, {{with a little}} {{internal}} sigh and a twinge of shame at her cowardice, waited to see the letter read and to save Fan the pain of answering the searching questions which her mother would be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b>|$|E
6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI (with a boyish laugh of delight). That'll do. Thank you. (Looks at {{his watch}} and {{suddenly}} becomes businesslike.) Time's up, Major.

Saranoff: don't get married until I come back: I shall be here punctually at five in the evening on Tuesday fortnight. Gracious ladies--good evening. (He makes them a military bow, and goes.) ...|$|R
60|$|In this, however, {{she was not}} alone. Half {{the ladies}} were {{interested}} about him; his manners were charming, his voice in church beautiful, and his destination as chaplain to a missionary bishop made him doubly interesting; while he himself, even though his mind was set on higher things, was really enjoying his brief holiday, and his sister, Mrs. Henderson, was delighted to promote his pleasure, and garden parties and the like flourished as long as weather permitted; and as Vera was a champion player, she was <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> the tournaments, and to have to practise for them.|$|R
60|$|Thus engaged, Edgar and his man Joe visited {{nearly all}} the wild places round the stormy shores of Great Britain and Ireland. They raised many ships {{from the bottom of}} the sea that had been {{pronounced}} by other engineers to be hopelessly lost. They laid foundations of piers and breakwaters in places where old Ocean had strewn wrecks since the foundation of the world. They cleared passages by blasting and levelling rocks whose stern crests had bid defiance to winds and waves for ages, and they recovered cargoes that had been given up for years to Neptune's custody. In short, wherever a difficult submarine operation had to be undertaken, Edgar Berrington and his man Joe, with, perhaps, a gang of divers under them, were pretty <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> undertake it.|$|R

6000|$|... "I think so. The king is {{not pleased}} at being kept waiting. He is <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{you when you}} arrived. You had better take one of my horses.

60|$|Of {{course this}} news soon reached the king's ears, {{and he was}} very angry, and summoned the Wise Man to take counsel with him.

40|$|Welcome to {{our summer}} 2011 {{edition of the}} ACM-W newsletter. In the last issue, we {{discussed}} how we {{wanted to create a}} newsletter that would appeal to people at every stage in their career — but we needed your help to do this. Thankfully, many of you wanted to join the conversation and add your voice to the newsletter. This is evidenced by ten terrific articles written by members of the community that span everything from high school to undergraduates to 1 st year of graduate school and to mid-career computer scientists. We urge our community to continue to add to the conversations we have started here. Please consider submitting an article proposal for our winter issue with new ideas and perspectives — or challenge some ideas presented here. In addition, in the next newsletter, we will have a special column — “Ask Judy ” where the 2011 ACM-W’s Athena Lecturer, Judy Olson, will answer questions from our community. Dr. Olson has over 40 years of experience in research and industry, thus she can answer any of those sticky questions we are not <b>sure</b> who <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> but really need an answer for. Have a question for Judy? Ask it here...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{was nothing}} very dreadful after all.
