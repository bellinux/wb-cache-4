Since then, the country has made some progress with regard to improving access to water supply: It reached universal access to an improved water source in urban areas, and in rural areas the share of those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, with aging {{equipment}} and poor management, Muni {{developed a reputation}} for poor and erratic service. In 1996 a group called Rescue Muni representing transit riders formed to organize concerns and press for change, advocating for the successful 1999 Proposition E that formed the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and set <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> for Muni. In an effort to improve service, Muni began to replace its troublesome fleet of Boeing-Vertol light rail vehicles with newer Italian Breda light rail vehicles. In 1998, San Francisco residents witnessed a protracted malfunction of Muni Metro during the switch to automatic train control, culminating in an event that {{is known as the}} Muni Meltdown. The two-decade-old fleet of Flyer trolleybuses were replaced with Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI) trolleybuses in the early 2000s. Likewise, the diesel bus fleet saw an infusion of 45 new NABI buses from AC Transit in 1999.|$|E

On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The inflight service began with tartan-clad cabin staff serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row {{as soon as the}} seat belt signs were turned off. This was followed by the main meal, starting with a separately served hors d'œuvre before serving a main course of fillet of beef, Tournedos, lamb or a chicken dish, accompanied by a selection of complimentary wines. Thereafter, a dessert course was served, followed by a choice from a cheese tray and a basket of fresh fruit. The inflight service concluded with tea or coffee being served with complimentary brandies and liqueurs, as well as free cigarettes for those who smoked.|$|E
40|$|Software {{development}} projects rarely are started or proceed without risks involving the technologies used. Typically, many facets {{of a project}} such as system functionality and tool support depend {{on the availability of}} a specific technology. This dependency poses risks: the required technology can disappear within the project 2 ̆ 7 s life cycle or a promised technology may not be available when it 2 ̆ 7 s required. A popular software technology today, Web <b>services</b> <b>standards,</b> is a widely supported approach to implementing a service-oriented architecture. Because Web <b>services</b> <b>standards</b> promise system interoperability and flexibility to large projects, commercial and government organizations are including it as the cornerstone of future computer-based systems.

25|$|Xfinity Voice allows {{communication}} {{over the}} internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of <b>service</b> <b>standards.</b> For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen {{by some as a}} violation of net neutrality, who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe. Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009. In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an information service exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.|$|E

40|$|Several {{international}} studies conducted confirmed that substantial economic benefits {{can be derived}} by improving the water and sanitation <b>services</b> <b>standards</b> in developing countries. The current free basic water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> of the South Africa Government is set at the provision of 6 kl of safe drinking water per household per month, at a point of service, not further than 200 m away from every home. The terms of reference {{of this study was}} defined as the determination of the value proposition of moving up the water ladder from basic to intermediary (yard connection) water <b>services</b> <b>standard.</b> Model outputs confirmed that substantial socio-economic benefits are attainable if the free basic water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> is increased to that of a yard connection. Government and Society, as a whole, benefits extensively, with a benefit/cost ratio of more than 30, when providing a basic service level communal stand pipe connection (4 kl/m). However, optimal benefits (+ 40) can be derived when all households are provided with at least a low pressure, 6 kl/m yard connection. Furthermore, consideration could even be given to increase the standard to 12 kl/m high pressure yard connection, although the step wise benefits/cost ratio is only 2. 6. The respective capital costs for delivering the three water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> options were respectively determined as R 7. 5 b illion (communal standpipe), R 11. 7 b (yard, low pressure) and R 14. 1 b (yard, high pressure).
