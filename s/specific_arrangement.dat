25|$|Spiders have up {{to eight}} eyes, each with a single lens rather than {{multiple}} units as in the compound eyes of insects. The <b>specific</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the eyes {{is one of the}} features used in classifying different species. Most species of the Haplogynae have six eyes, although some have eight (Plectreuridae), four (e.g., Tetrablemma) or even two (most Caponiidae). Sometimes one pair of eyes is better developed than the rest, or even, in some cave species, there are no eyes at all. Several families of hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf spiders, have fair to excellent vision. The main pair of eyes in jumping spiders even sees in color.|$|E
25|$|The Nebra sky disc is a Bronze Age bronze disc {{that was}} buried in Germany, {{not far from the}} Goseck circle, around 1600 BC. It {{measures}} about 30cm diameter with a mass of 2.2kg and displays a blue-green patina (from oxidization) inlaid with gold symbols. Found by archeological thieves in 1999 and recovered in Switzerland in 2002, it was soon recognized as a spectacular discovery, among the most important of the 20th century. Investigations revealed that the object had been in use around 400 years before burial (2000 BC), but that its use had been forgotten by the time of burial. The inlaid gold depicted the full moon, a crescent moon about 4 or 5 days old, and the Pleiades star cluster in a <b>specific</b> <b>arrangement</b> forming the earliest known depiction of celestial phenomena. Twelve lunar months pass in 354 days, requiring a calendar to insert a leap month every two or three years in order to keep synchronized with the solar year's seasons (making it lunisolar). The earliest known descriptions of this coordination were recorded by the Babylonians in 6th or 7th centuries BC, over one thousand years later. Those descriptions verified ancient knowledge of the Nebra sky disc's celestial depiction as the precise arrangement needed to judge when to insert the intercalary month into a lunisolar calendar, making it an astronomical clock for regulating such a calendar a thousand or more years before any other known method.|$|E

500|$|The Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{was found}} {{associated with a}} nest with eggs; its feet {{were placed in the}} centre of what was probably a ring of eggs, with the arms folded across the tops of the eggs {{on each side of the}} body, a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids. The collected part of the nest is about 90cm (35in) wide and 100cm (30in) long; the skeleton occupies the upper 25cm (10in) of the block, whereas the remaining 20cm (8in) is occupied by broken eggs and shells. There is no evidence of plant material in the nest, but there are fragments of undetermined bones. The nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos, which prevents determination of the size, shape, number, and arrangement of the eggs in the nest. It is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below the body, and there do not appear to have been eggs in the centre of the nest. Most eggs (seven distinct eggs have been identified) and egg fragments were recovered either in the lower layer of the nest or under the skull, neck, and limbs of the specimen, and the bones either rested directly on the eggs or were within 5mm (0.2in) of their surfaces. That the skeleton was directly positioned on top of it shows that the nest was not completely covered by sand. Though the placement of the eggs does not suggest a <b>specific</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the nest, most other oviraptorid nests show that the eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles. The eggs of MPC-D107/15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial, or by external factors, such as strong winds, sandstorms, or predators. This also supports the idea that the upper layer of eggs was not buried, as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors.|$|E
2500|$|BPTI was {{important}} {{in the development of}} knowledge about the process of protein folding, the self-assembly of a polypeptide chain into a <b>specific</b> <b>arrangement</b> in 3D. [...] The problem of achieving the correct pairings among the 6 Cys sidechains was shown to be especially difficult for the two buried, close-together SS near the BPTI chain termini, requiring a non-native intermediate for folding the mature sequence in vitro (it was later discovered that the precursor sequence folds more easily in vivo). BPTI was the cover image on a protein folding compendium volume by Thomas Creighton in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{example is}} of the two {{uncharged}} conductive plates in a vacuum, placed a few nanometers apart. In a classical description, {{the lack of an}} external field means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them. When this field is instead studied using the quantum electrodynamic vacuum, it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons which constitute the field, and generate a net force [...] either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the <b>specific</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by second quantization.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people who}} sought {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing <b>specific</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to <b>specific</b> <b>arrangements</b> for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as 'power of women over men'.|$|R

In spite of all these favouring conditions, Mr. Gladstone (March 20, 1843) had to report to his chief that 'the deadness of foreign demand keeps our commerce in a state of prolonged paralysis.' Cobden had not even yet convinced them that the true way to quicken foreign demand was to open the ports to that foreign supply, with which they paid us for what they bought from us.
