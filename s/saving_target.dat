50|$|In {{environmental}} policy, {{white certificates}} are documents certifying {{that a certain}} reduction of energy consumption has been attained. In most applications, the white certificates are tradable and combined with an obligation to achieve a certain target of energy savings. Under such a system, producers, suppliers or distributors of electricity, gas and oil are required to undertake energy efficiency measures for the final user {{that are consistent with}} a pre-defined percentage of their annual energy deliverance. If energy producers do not meet the mandated target for energy consumption they are required to pay a penalty. The white certificates are given to the producers whenever an amount of energy is saved whereupon the producer can use the certificate for their own target compliance or can be sold to (other) parties who cannot meet their targets. Quite analogous to the closely related concept of emissions trading, the tradability in theory guarantees that the overall energy saving is achieved at least cost, while the certificates guarantee that the overall energy <b>saving</b> <b>target</b> is achieved.|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of {{achieving}} the 20 % energy <b>saving</b> <b>target</b> by 2020 {{as well as the}} realization of the EU 2030 target adopted in October rank very high on the EU energy policy agenda. Scenario-based analysis using bottom-up simulation models provides information on the impact of implemented policies as well as future saving potentials. Our analysis has two main objectives: (i) to assess the contribution of implemented policies towards achieving the 2020 energy efficiency target of 20 %; (ii) to assess energy efficiency potentials beyond implemented policies until 2020 and 2030. For both objectives, we apply a bottom-up modelling approach using detailed sector models covering residential and non-residential buildings, industry, residential and tertiary appliances as well as transport. In order to assess the different policy options and saving potentials, we define several scenarios including a baseline (with and without early action and with planned measures), a scenario with additional measures not yet implemented and three scenarios representing saving potentials (from very cost-effective to “near economic”). Our results show that the scenario including early action misses the 20 % energy <b>saving</b> <b>target</b> by 2020 by about 2. 3 %. Including additional measures (and intensifying existing measures) it is possible to reach the 20 % target. Regarding the new 2030 targets of the EU, our modelling approach shows that primary energy consumption can be reduced by 41 % compared to the PRIMES 2007 baseline by fully exploiting the economic energy savings potentials. This is considerably more than the reduction by 27 % as decided by the European Council. The resulting decrease of GHG emissions amounts to more than 45 % in this scenario (assuming a share of renewable of 27 %). The detailed modelling of policies and technologies allows a sector-specific analysis of the contribution of individual policy instruments and technologies towards the above mentioned targets. Only such detailed models allow simulating the different types of energy-efficiency policies (e. g. standards, taxes, ETS, audits, information programs, subsidies) ...|$|E

40|$|As Europe is not {{on track}} in meeting its 2020 energy <b>savings</b> <b>target,</b> there has been quite some debate to make the energy <b>savings</b> <b>target</b> binding instead of indicative. Although the final draft text of the Energy Efficiency Directive left the option of a binding target {{explicitly}} open for the period beyond 2014, this statement has watered down in the adopted Directive: If still not on track mid- 2014, the European Commission will propose "further measures". In this paper, we argue that a binding energy <b>savings</b> <b>target</b> {{could be the first}} EU legal initiative to look beyond 2020 serving as a beacon for other policies such as for renewables and greenhouse gases that need redefinition after 2020. We therefore explore four possible design options of a binding <b>savings</b> <b>target</b> and assess their feasibility. We conclude that a binding target at Member State level (opposed to an EU-wide target like for the EU Emission Trading System (ETS)) is the most feasible. A binding target at Member State level would ensure political accountability and commitment to deliver results while providing flexibility to choose and apply the most suitable tools to achieve the target. It could provide a framework to guide ambitious and coherent implementation of EU energy efficiency policies, as well as the strengthening of national policies. Furthermore, binding targets at Member State level will make Member States take an ambitious position in Brussels when new energy or CO 2 performance standards for appliances and transport modes are to be set.

However, this algorithm needs to traverse all PBSs and all PUEs in the network at any traffic condition, and obviously, such brute-force approach can be inefficient. Note that some PUEs can be transferred several times like playing a football till they finally settle. Besides, the complexity of this algorithm {{is proportional to the}} number of the PBSs and the PUEs, which can be very high and causes considerable network signaling overhead. It was mentioned in [20] that the sleep mode mechanism can be used to improve Hetnets energy efficiency at low and medium traffic load only, which indicates that most of PBSs cannot be switched off during peak traffic (this is also verified by our simulation); hence, most part of the traversal is unnecessary. Based on the utility given in (8), the probability that a PBS with relatively large utility can be switched off is smaller than that of a PBS with relatively small utility, which is intuitive and can be easily testified through simulation.|$|E

In this paper, the energy efficiency scores of some selected dairy farms, using the non-parametric data envelopment analysis approach was assessed. The results for efficient farmers based on two DEA models showed that with an energy conservation policy, farmers can perform better in stock farming. The total energy consumption was 72. 8 GJ/cow and the top two energy consuming inputs as feed intake and electricity drew the fact that promoting input utilization efficiency seems critical. The mean technical efficiency score of 0. 88 made this ample need more apparent. Machinery, electricity and feed were suggested as the main inputs for optimization due to their high contribution in energy saving (46 and 36 %, respectively). The least amount of ESTR (Energy <b>Saving</b> <b>Target</b> Ratio) for human labor indicated that it is employed efficiently.

We found that market behaviour responds to the unique design and context in which TWC schemes are implemented. Contrary to expectations, limited trading is observed so the ‘to-trade-or-not-to-trade’ dilemma is further analysed. A real TWC market has emerged only in Italy, where obliged parties (i. e. energy distributors) show preference towards ‘to-trade’. In Great Britain and France an autarky compliance approach is identified, with obliged parties (i. e. energy suppliers) showing preference towards ‘not-to-trade’ driven by, among many factors, commercial co-benefits of non-trading (e. g. increased competitiveness). At the same time, results show clearer indications of cost-effectiveness for Great Britain than for Italy. In general, high energy-saving effectiveness is observed, but low ambitious saving targets and pitfalls in the regulatory framework {{need to be considered}} to further develop TWC markets. Initial market and institutional conditions strongly suggest that trading might not be an immediate outcome. Ambitious but reachable targets can trigger a more dynamic usage of all flexibilities by eligible parties and thus active behaviour in TWC markets...|$|E

In this study have been used from two approaches constant returns to scale and variable returns to scale model of data envelopment analysis for determining the degrees of technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Moreover, the effect of optimum energy consumption on greenhouse gas emissions has been studied and also the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The results showed that from total number of dairy farms 42. 55 % and 53. 19 % were efficient based on constant returns to scale and variable returns to scale model, respectively. Accordingly, the average score of technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of farmers were calculated 0. 9, 0. 94 and 0. 953, respectively.

Both the theoretical and the empirical results find that: 1) if ESCOs have a lower cost of capital and discount rate, the total investment, and energy saving will increase; 2) ESCOs tend to assume 100 % of the total investment in energy efficiency technologies. Thus providing low cost of capital to ESCO is essential to facilitate the effectiveness of EPC activities in terms of saving energy. The theoretical results also show that if the client has a higher requirement for minimum profit, the investment and the resulted energy saving will decrease. In addition, lower cost of capital for client can also help increase the investment and energy saving of EPC contracts.

40|$|AbstractThe Oxyfuel {{process is}} one {{possible}} solution {{to lower the}} high specific CO 2 emissions of coal-fired power plants. The flue gas generated by this process has a high CO 2 content, due to the missing nitrogen. However the dried flue gas still contains approximately 15 vol% (dry) impurities (NOx, SOx, O 2, N 2 and Ar). To further increase the CO 2 purity the flue gas needs to be treated in a gas processing unit (GPU). Additional downstream gas treatment approaches such as Polymeric Membranes or Pressure Swing Adsorption to capture CO 2 from the offgas of the GPU, can raise the capture rate from 90 % to 99 %. The remaining CO 2 {{and most of the}} impurities contained in the offgas downstream of the GPU are discharged to the environment with the exhaust gas of the GPU. The O 2 contained in the exhaust gas downstream of the GPU amounts to 4 - 5 % of the oxygen supplied by the ASU. The energy demand of the ASU can be lowered if the O 2 contained in this exhaust gas was captured and recycled back to the firing system. The energy saving potential of such a recycle would amount to 4 - 5 % of the ASU energy demand, but only if all O 2 is captured from the exhaust gas and no energy is needed for the capturing process. So the capturing process and its integration into the overall process has a substantial influence on the achievable energy <b>saving.</b> <b>Target</b> of this work is to integrate and model the capture and recycle of the oxygen from the exhaust gas back into the Oxyfuel power plant process...|$|E

Previous studies have illustrated large untapped energy saving potentials from implementing energy management practices in firms. Energy management practices have large effects on energy utilization and also a short pay-back time. According to these studies, energy management practices also effect investment decisions and the outcome of investments in energy efficient technologies. This paper investigates to what extent energy management practices influence firms estimation of energy efficiency potentials. Further it investigates two Swedish policy programs that promote industrial energy management practices: The Programme For improving Energy efficiency in energy-intensive industry (PFE) and the energy audit program and whether these have increased energy management practices in Swedish firms. A multiple case study has been conducted in order to investigate energy practices in firms in different industrial sectors. Employment of energy management varies between firms. The firms estimate equal energy efficiency potentials from implementation of energy efficient technology as for energy management practices. In total the firms estimate energy efficiency potentials of 12 %. The study shows that firms that {{have participated in the}} programs work more actively with energy management. This can be illustrated by the fact that 75 % of the firms that have not participated in any of the programs lack a person responsible for energy management and 50 % also lack a long term energy strategy.

The objective of this work was to study the effect of low temperatures during the night in sweet peppers and to assess the physiological consequences during the following day. Therefore, we subjected sweet pepper plants of two cultivars to 5 or 7 cycles of 12 / 12 h warm light (500 μmol m- 2 s- 1 PAR, 21 °C) and cold dark (6 °C). After the treatment, several measurements were performed on leaves (first in the dark and cold, and one hour after light was switched on) : chlorophyll fluorescence (spot and imaging) and measurements of biomass. Our results showed a decrease in the efficiency of photochemistry in photosystem II (Y(II)) during the dark, cold period related to a stimulation of photoprotection mechanisms in the photosynthetic apparatus. However, 1 h after rewarming in light conditions, leaves had recovered high values of Y(II). In addition, fully expanded leaves increased their specific leaf area and fresh to dry weight ratio during this period. This may indicate that, during the recovery period, dry weight decreased due to redistribution of assimilates to expanding leaves and/or that leaf water content increased. The fast recovery of this crop after several cold nights opens possibilities for new strategies of energy saving in greenhouses.

It also identifies key issues around the methodologies used to calculate the energy <b>saving</b> <b>targets,</b> the proposed policy instruments, and the monitoring, reporting, verification and compliance regime...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{a number}} of {{countries}} have introduced market-based instruments to foster energy efficiency improvements. Some of these schemes are based on quantified energy <b>savings</b> <b>targets</b> for energy distributors or suppliers, coupled with a certification of the energy savings (via white certificates), and a possibility to trade certificates. This policy instrument often targets parts of the sectors (e. g. power generation) that are subject to carbon reduction targets (mainly under cap-and-trade schemes). The paper presents an up-to-date review of white certificate schemes in Europe, and analyses results achieved so far. It discusses design and operational features that are key to achieve the overall <b>saving</b> <b>targets.</b> Delineation of the scheme in terms of eligible projects, technologies and parties, institutional structure and processes to support the scheme are among the issues discussed. The paper analyses the arguments for and against integration of white certificates with CO 2 emission trading in order to achieve the maximum environmental benefit as well as a high degree of economic efficiency, and evaluates the implications of integration in practice.
