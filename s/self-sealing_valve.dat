50|$|After each use, a heparin lock {{is made by}} injecting a {{small amount}} of heparinized saline (an anticoagulant) into the device, {{preventing}} development of clots within the port or catheter. In some catheter designs where there is a <b>self-sealing</b> <b>valve</b> at the far end, the system is locked with just saline. The port can be left accessed for as long as required. The port is covered in a dressing to protect the site from infection and to secure the needle in position.|$|E
40|$|Abstract of WO 9738772 (A 1) The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an apparatus comprising a static part and a movable {{part for the}} separation of a gas or fluid into components. The movable part is for instance formed by a rotatable wheel (4) which is provided with sorbent bed segments (7). The bed segments (7) are separated from each other by wall elements (8) sealing against the part which in relation thereto is movable. According to the invention, each wall element is provided with a <b>self-sealing</b> <b>valve</b> (...|$|E
50|$|A {{quick connect}} fitting, also called a quick {{disconnect}} or quick release coupling, is a coupling {{used to provide}} a fast, make-or-break connection of fluid transfer lines. Operated by hand, quick connect fittings replace threaded or flanged connections, which require wrenches. When equipped with <b>self-sealing</b> <b>valves,</b> quick connect fittings will, upon disconnection, automatically contain any fluid in the line.|$|R
50|$|NiCd {{batteries}} {{usually have}} a metal case with a sealing plate equipped with a <b>self-sealing</b> safety <b>valve.</b> The positive and negative electrode plates, isolated from each other by the separator, are rolled in a spiral shape inside the case. This {{is known as the}} jelly-roll design and allows a Ni-Cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell. Alkaline cells have a bobbin construction where the cell casing is filled with electrolyte and contains a graphite rod which acts as the positive electrode. As a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte (as opposed to the jelly-roll design), the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the maximum current that can be delivered.|$|R
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's <b>self-sealing</b> capabilities, check <b>valves</b> prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|R
