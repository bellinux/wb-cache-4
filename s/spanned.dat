50|$|Each <b>span</b> {{comprises}} 2No. riveted longitudinal {{steel deck}} girders, supporting riveted cross girders, {{which in turn}} support a reinforced concrete slab deck. The bridge has two sets of approach <b>spans,</b> {{each of which has}} three <b>spans,</b> either side of the central main lifting <b>span.</b> Each set of three <b>spans</b> consists of two simply supported end <b>spans</b> which continue as cantilevers approximately 1/5 <b>span</b> into the middle <b>span.</b> The central 3/5 <b>span</b> sections are simply supported drop in <b>spans</b> supported by halving joints. The main <b>span</b> is a structurally independent lifting <b>span.</b> The bearings are inset from the end lifting beams. <b>Spans</b> 1, 3, 5 and 7 are 24.994m c/c of bearings. <b>Spans</b> 2 and 6 are 26.213m, with halving joints 5.334m from both end and a 15.547m suspended <b>span.</b> The central lifting <b>span,</b> <b>Span</b> 4, is 31.242m c/c of bearings, with cantilevers of 3.124m either end to the lifting cross girders.

50|$|Work on {{the western}} {{highrise}} <b>span</b> was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main <b>span</b> that is 750 ft long (at the time, the longest girder <b>span</b> in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of 135 ft. The main <b>span</b> is flanked by two orthotropic back <b>spans</b> which are each 375 ft long, and there are seven orthotropic side <b>spans</b> on the approach to each back <b>span.</b> Each of these side <b>spans</b> are 292 ft long. Although these <b>spans</b> appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor <b>spans</b> and suspended <b>spans.</b> Anchor <b>spans</b> rest on top of two adjacent piers and cantilever over each side slightly, and suspended <b>spans</b> are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor <b>spans.</b> There are an additional nine 208 ft steel <b>spans</b> carrying a concrete deck on the San Mateo side of the highrise, and ten steel <b>spans</b> carrying a concrete deck on the Hayward side, ranging from 186 - 208 ft.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the forward digit <b>span</b> employs a verbal representation of sequences of digits, whereas the backward digit <b>span</b> employs a spatial representation.

50|$|In mathematics, {{a minimum}} {{bottleneck}} <b>spanning</b> tree (MBST) in an undirected graph is a <b>spanning</b> tree {{in which the}} most expensive edge is as cheap as possible.

40|$|Abstract- A <b>spanning</b> tree of a {{connected}} graph is a sub graph {{that is a}} tree and connects all the verticestogether. A single graph can have many different <b>spanning</b> trees. We can also assign a weight to each edge, which is a number representing how unfavorable it is, and use this to assign a weight to a <b>spanning</b> tree by computing {{the sum of the}} weights of the edges in that <b>spanning</b> tree. A minimum <b>spanning</b> tree (MST) or minimum weight <b>spanning</b> tree is then a <b>spanning</b> tree with weight {{less than or equal to}} the weight of every other <b>spanning</b> tree. More generally, any undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum <b>spanning</b> forest, which is a union of minimum <b>spanning</b> trees for its components. Our objective is to find minimum cost (weight) <b>spanning</b> tree using the algorithm which is based on the weight matrix of weighted graph...|$|R
