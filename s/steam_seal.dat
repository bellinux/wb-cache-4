This paper concerned on the research of the surface heat transfer coefficient, which is the key factor affect the precision in thermal stress analysis. The surface heat transfer coefficient is obtained via the numerical calculation for the steam’s flow state and the transient heat transfer between rotor.

The workscope was expanded to include major plant systems that impact the unit`s ability to sustain generation at 140 MW (Units 1 - 3 have operated at average rating of about 90 MW). Assessment was completed Aug. 19, 1994. Boiler pressure parts are in excellent condition except for damage to primary superheater header/stub tubes and economizer inlet header stub tubes. The turbine steam path is in good condition except for damage to LP blading; the spar rotor steam path is in better condition and is recommended for Unit 2.

40|$|Clearance {{control is}} of {{paramount}} importance to turbomachinery designers and is required to meet today's aggressive power output, efficiency, and operational life goals. Excessive clearances lead to losses in cycle efficiency, flow instabilities, and hot gas ingestion into disk cavities.

40|$|Controlling {{interface}} clearances is {{the most}} cost effective method of enhancing turbomachinery performance. Seals control turbomachinery leakages, coolant flows and contribute to overall system rotordynamic stability. In many instances, sealing interfaces and coatings are sacrificial, like lubricants, giving up their integrity {{for the benefit of}} the component. They are subjected to abrasion, erosion, oxidation, incursive rubs, foreign object damage (FOD) and deposits as well as extremes in thermal, mechanical, aerodynamic and impact loadings. Tribological pairing of materials control how well and how long these interfaces will be effective in controlling flow. A variety of seal types and materials are required to satisfy turbomachinery sealing demands. These seals must be properly designed to maintain the interface clearances. In some cases, this will mean machining adjacent surfaces, yet in many other applications, coatings are employed for optimum performance. Many seals are coating composites fabricated on superstructures or substrates that are coated with sacrificial materials which can be refurbished either in situ or by removal, stripping, recoating and replacing until substrate life is exceeded. For blade and knife tip sealing an important class of materials known as abradables permit blade or knife rubbing without significant damage or wear to the rotating element while maintaining an effective sealing interface. Most such tip interfaces are passive, yet some, as for the high-pressure turbine (HPT) case or shroud, are actively controlled. This work presents an overview of turbomachinery sealing.

40|$|LecturePg. 1 - 8 A new {{cogeneration}} installation was in {{the process}} of being commissioned when severe subsynchronous vibration was detected on the generator during no load tests. Subsequently, two rotordynamics problems were discovered. These problems prohibited the steam turbine generator set from reaching full speed. Additional vibration problems were anticipated once the generator was loaded and the steam flows through the turbines increased. The first subsynchronous vibration problem, observed during initial full speed, no-load run attempts, was found to be most severe at the inboard generator bearing and the adjacent turbine bearing. The second problem, uncovered during analysis of the generator vibration problem, was the presence of low-level subsynchronous vibration at a different frequency on both bearings of the high pressure-intermediate pressure (HP-IP) turbine rotor.

A 150 MWe power station, when based on flows from a hot water reservoir at (a) 250 C or (b) 315 C, and with separator pressures of 6 bar, is found to carry about 100 and 200 kg/year respectively in the steam phase.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{demonstration of}} the “Aerostatic Seal” in a half scale rotating facility is described in this paper. The Aerostatic seal is a novel dynamic clearance seal specifically designed for steam turbine secondary gas path applications. The seal responds to radial rotor excursions, so a reduced clearance can be maintained compared to conventional labyrinth seal without damage to the seal. This enables increased turbine performance through reduced leakage and increased tolerance of turbine transient events typically found during start up. The seal {{is an extension of}} the existing retractable seal design already deployed in commercial <b>steam</b> turbines. The <b>seal</b> was tested in the Durham Rotating Seals Rig, which was developed specifically to test this device. The rig featured a rotor designed to run with large eccentricities to model high speed radial rotor excursions, and the seal was instrumented to measure the real time seal response to the rotor. The experimental campaign has conclusively demonstrated the ability of the seal to dynamically respond to the rotor position. The key result is that the seal is able to track the rotor position at high speed, and hence maintain a mean seal clearance that is lower than the rotor eccentricity. Overall this work marks a key milestone {{in the development of the}} Aerostatic Seal, and leads the way to testing in a steam environment and application in steam turbine plant...|$|R

A brush seal with a {{nominal bore diameter}} of 13. 647 cm. (5. 3730 in.) was used. It had a radial concentric interference of 0. 071 cm (0. 0028 in.) and a fence height of 0. 0927 cm (0. 0365 in.). There were 1060 bristles per centimeter of circumference (2690 bristles per inch of circumference). Rotor eccentricities of 0. 003, 0. 010, 0. 038, and 0. 043 cm (0. 001, 0. 004, 0. 015, and 0. 017 in.) were achieved by using bushings with different offsets.

40|$|Developments in turbine {{technologies}} lead {{to higher}} operating temperature and pressure conditions. Parasitic leakage flows around the turbine account for considerable efficiency losses that increase fuel cost dramatically. Brush seal has recently emerged as an improved sealing technology to provide better leakage performance and to replace classical labyrinth seals. In order to optimize efficiency, comprehensive study of the factors causing the leakage is required. The leakage performance of the brush seal is directly related with geometry, operating inlet and outlet boundary conditions, bristle pack configuration. Brush seal flow and pressure profiles with turbine operating conditions become complicated, and analytical formulations remain inadequate to correlate design parameters and leakage performance in operating conditions. Recently brush seals have found ever increasing applications in steam turbines. Literature review indicates that there is very limited studies of brush <b>seal</b> for <b>steam</b> environment. There is also no correlation available for brush seal porosity coefficients in the literature.

The unsatisfactory wear properties of various seal and propeller shaft material combinations on many of our submarines, particularly those of the deep-submergence class and those where the trend is towards the larger shaft diameters, prompted this investigation. While the fault may well lay in design, this paper approaches the problem as one in boundary lubrication; attempting to find the best combination of seal material and mating service in this particular service condition from a wear viewpoint. An additional aim was to attempt some correlation between wear, friction, and the physical properties involved. Results from this latter goal could well find application in the selection of <b>steam</b> turbine <b>seals</b> as well as those employed in the aircraft industry. The approach used by the authors was first to evaluate potential seal materials from different families in combination with various corrosion-resistant shaft materials. This work was done on the Kinetic Oiliness Testing Machine (KOTM) and the results are presented in Part I of this investigation. The testing involved obtaining friction and wear data on carbons and laminated phenolics, as well as teflon, in combination with chrome, bronze G, and stellite # 6 „ Synthetic sea water was the primary lubricant, although the effect of wetting agents was also checked. Results here conclusively demonstrated the superiority of commercial grade carbon seals, for the wear of the laminated phenolics was excessive, and transition temperature effects were experienced with the straight teflon samples at roughly 250 °F ambient temperature. While successful as a screening tool, the KOTM proved inadequate for wear measurements of carbons; and for this reason the pin on disc geometric configuration was utilized in Part II. This section involved a more extensive analysis of the friction and wear properties of carbons in combination with five potential shaft materials. Twenty-one commercial grade carbons in all were tested, the number representing a wide cross section in graphite content 8 hardness 9 impregnation and other physical properties. The effect of wetting agents, up to 50 $ by volume, are also presented. Results of this phase conclusively demonstrated the superiority of chrome as a mating surface for carbon, its high heat of reaction and resultant resistance to carbide formation giving reasonably low friction and wear values. Several carbons were grouped close to the top when all were compared from a wear and friction viewpoint, but one, Carbon 1, was shown to be the superior material of those tested in this boundary lubrication problem. The effect of wetting agents contradicted our original assumption, in that concentrations up to 50 $ by volume gave higher frictional values than that experienced with synthetic sea water.

50|$|In an ordinary, non-pressurized, cooking vessel, {{the boiling}} point of water is 100 C at {{standard}} pressure; the temperature of food is limited by {{the boiling point}} of water because excess heat causes boiling water to vaporize into <b>steam.</b> In a <b>sealed</b> pressure cooker, the boiling point of water increases as the pressure rises, resulting in superheated water. At a pressure of 1 bar or ~15 psi (pounds per square inch) above the existing atmospheric pressure, water in a pressure cooker can reach a temperature of up to 121 C, depending on altitude. The boiling temperature of water (and water-based liquids) is determined by the ambient atmospheric pressure. Pressure cookers always require liquid in order to cook food under pressure. At sea level, the boiling temperature of water is 100 C and excess heat only increases the rate at which water evaporates into steam vapour; more heat does not increase the temperature of the water. At higher altitudes above sea level, the atmospheric pressure is lower and thus the boiling temperature of water is lower, because the lower atmospheric pressure pushing on the water makes it easier for the water molecules to escape the surface compared to higher atmospheric pressure. Inside a pressure cooker, once the water (liquid) is boiling and the steam is trapped, the pressure from the trapped steam increases and this pushes on the liquid, which increases its boiling temperature, because it becomes harder for the water molecules to escape from the surface as the pressure increases on it. The heat applied to the liquid by the heat source continues to create more steam pressure and the extra heat also raises the temperature of the liquid under this increased pressure. Both the liquid and steam are at the same temperature. Once the selected pressure level is reached, the pressure regulator on the lid indicates this and now the heat source can be lowered to maintain that pressure level and save energy, since extra heat will not increase the temperature of the liquid if the pressure is not allowed to rise—excess pressure will only escape as fast-flowing steam from the lid.|$|R
