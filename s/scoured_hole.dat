This study aims to {{examine the effect of}} bridge pier inclination angle on the scouring process by conducting tests along a straight channel in a Plexiglas laboratory flume. To this end, cylindrical piers with four different inclination angles were placed in the flume along a straight channel and tests were conducted at four different flow rates under clear water conditions. Evenly graded sand (D 50  =  1. 46  mm) was used as flume bed material. The obtained results showed that the maximum and minimum scouring depths occurred at pier angles of 0 and 15 respectively.

40|$|Scour is an {{important}} issue due to the potential great extent of loss and risks associated with scouring. The work described herein constitutes laboratory testing of the time development of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in clayey soils produced by a submerged vertical circular impinging jet. Long term laboratory tests were performed on three types of manufactured pottery clays, Buffstone clay (50. 3 - 51. 7 % clay), P 300 clay (48. 7 - 50. 7 % clay), and M 370 clay (51. 1 - 51. 3 % clay). Detailed measurements of the entire <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> were performed on a 2 mm grid using a computer controlled laser optical profiler after scouring times of 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 h, 1. 5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 and then at every 24 h interval until the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> was considered to have reached equilibrium based on the criterion used by Mazurek et al. (2001). This resulted in long test durations ranging from 120 h to 384 h. For the time development of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> a three-dimensional <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> surface was produced using the data taken by an optical profiler. Thereafter, four cross sections of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> were extracted from the three-dimensional <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> surface. Dimensions considered for analysis were taken from both the three-dimensional <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> surface and the cross sections of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> The volume of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> and the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depths were extracted from the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> surface. The section-wise maximum scour depth, radius of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> half-width about the jet centreline, and half-width about the section-wise maximum scour depth were extracted for each cross-sections. The growth of these dimensions were observed with time. For a significant portion of scouring, the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depths increased linearly with the logarithm of time. For the majority of the tests, the half-widths decreased with time. Temporary ceasing of the increment of the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depths was observed, called “plateaus”, in the time development plot. <b>Scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimensions for the cross-sections showed variability from the average <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimensions. However, for most of the tests this variability decreased with time as the scour test proceeded. To decide on whether the equilibrium state of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> was achieved, all of the aforementioned <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimensions were evaluated. The characteristic <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimension to decide on the equilibrium condition was termed as the “critical equilibrium dimension”. Four of the scour tests reached an overall equilibrium state, the section wise maximum <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depth was the critical equilibrium dimension for three of those. The half-widths were the critical equilibrium dimension for one of the tests. However, previous studies did not consider the “side slope erosion” of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> hence neglected the section-wise maximum scour depth and half widths for identifying equilibrium condition. Dimensionless <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> profiles were developed using the centreline scour depth as the scale for <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depth and the half-width about the centreline depth as the scale for radial distance from the jet centreline. A general equation of the dimensionless equilibrium <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> profile was developed by fitting a sine function to the equilibrium scour test profiles using linear regression analysis. Dimensionless <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> profiles with time during the scour test were compared to the dimensionless profile at equilibrium. It was observed that while for some scour tests the equilibrium <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> shape formed quickly compared to the time to equilibrium, for some scour tests the equilibrium shapes did not form until the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> stopped growing...|$|R
40|$|Over {{one hundred}} <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> {{are located in}} the Rhine-Meuse delta. These <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> have {{relatively}} large depths and steep slopes and could pose a risk to the stability of river banks and hydraulic structures, especially since some <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> are still growing. <b>Scour</b> <b>holes</b> develop at locations where either the hydrodynamics or the erodibility of the soil varies locally. In the Rhine Meuse delta, the subsoil stratigraphy is believed to play a large role, as it is composed of alternating layers of poorly erodible clay and peat and highly erodible sand. Local and large scale erosion are therefore not evenly distributed over the river bed and at locations where a top layer of clay or peat becomes too thin, exposure of an underlying layer of sand can result in a <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> Anthropogenic activities also have a large impact on the development of <b>scour</b> <b>holes,</b> such as the presence of hydraulic structures (e. g. groynes, bridge piers) and changes in geometry, which cause local changes in hydrodynamics. Moreover, deepening of river beds by dredging may have removed protective clay layers exposing underlying sand bodies. Finally, the closure of the Haringvliet caused higher flow velocities and therefore erosion in the connecting branches in {{the central part of the}} delta. In order to judge the potential risk, understanding is needed on the behaviour of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the Rhine-Meuse delta. A thorough data analysis is therefore performed on a large set of bed topography data. By performing experiments in a scale model more knowledge is obtained on the detailed physical processes influencing <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> development. In order to predict future <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> development the applicability of the method of Breusers is tested that predicts the depth and slopes of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> behind bed protections. As a first step in this research an attempt is made to develop an objective and generic identification method in order to identify <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the future or in other river branches. Although a method based on the statistical characteristics of the river bed results in a good first approximation to indicate scour zones, the analysis shows that bed irregularities and large variations in <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> shapes and sizes complicates this method. It is therefore advised to always study <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in more detail individually. As the closure of the Haringvliet in 1970 led to erosion in the connecting branches, it is likely that this also influenced the growth of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in that area. After relating the current growth of the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the delta to the current bed level trends, it is seen that despite these degrading bed levels, the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the connecting branches do not show the largest growth. This is explained by studying the evolution of <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> growth over the last five decades in two connecting branches (Oude Maas and Dordtsche Kil). It shows that most <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the area already exist for decades and have reached a stable state. Most of the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> show a large growth after 1970 which is likely related to enhanced flow velocities caused by the Haringvliet closure. However, the analysis furthermore shows that only few <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> developed just after 1970 of which some are expected to have been caused by dredging activities. The influence of the Haringvliet closure on the development of new <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> seems therefore limited. The analysis of long term evolution of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the Oude Maas and Dordtsche Kil furthermore shows that the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> behaviour varies strongly and does not show similar trends, not even when they {{are located in the}} same river reach. This is likely related to the large variations in local conditions such as changes in geometry, the presence of structures, such as bridges and groynes, and the composition of the subsoil.

Extensive research has been done in the past on <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> close to hydraulic structures in a homogeneous subsoil, however, a large amount of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> are not related to hydraulic structures. Additionally, in deltas, the subsoil mostly consists of alternating layers of soil with different erosive capacities. This experimental study focused on a simplified situation of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in heterogeneous subsoil with a three-dimensional character.

40|$|The {{rivers in}} the South-West of The Netherlands flow over an erosion-resistant bed, {{consisting}} of peat and clay, overlying non-cohesive sediments. As they are experiencing general incision, the erosion resistant layer becomes thinner and sometimes locally breaks, exposing the more easily eroded non-cohesive sediments. Consequently sudden <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> may be formed that can pose {{risks to the}} stability of nearby flood defences. Mobile bed laboratory experiments were carried out to study the corresponding scour process, using a local opening in steel plates to represent a broken erosion-resistant top layer. I found that once the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> extends {{to the edge of}} the top layer, this layer is undermined. As a result, the sediment is only transported in suspension and although the turbulence within the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> is increasing, the rate of scour decreases. With the stiff steel plates at a fixed location the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> approaches an equilibrium depth. However, undermining in the field, will eventually lead to failure of the top layer and consequent growth of the horizontal extent of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> But not all <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in the field are growing, indicating other processes. This raised the assumption that the poorly erodible layer can also fail by deformation and covers the slopes of the scour hole; thus functions as a falling apron. Numerical computations with FINEL 3 D showed the shear stresses at bed of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> High shear stresses were observed at the edges and inner slopes of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> These shear stresses exceeded the critical shear stress of sand, which indicated that the slope are protected by the poorly erodible layer.

The analysis strongly suggests that erosion occurred through a number of different old (clay) layers. The presence of cohesive layers can reduce the development of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> considerably. Implementation of cohesive layers in the Delft 3 d model showed that the erosion rate as observed in reality can be simulated with cohesive sediment. Armouring of the bed, erosion of fine sediments and the harder to erode coarser sediment remains, also result in a reduction of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> The armouring effect can be simulated in a schematized way by distinguishing a number of fractions and bed layers. Simulations show that armouring indeed reduces the development of the depth of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> However, the computed erosion is still considerably higher compared to the observed erosion rate. Computations for the Maasvlakte 2 indicate that the main flow characteristics are similar. It is expected that the development of the scour shows much resemblance. Therefore similar parameters can be used for the Maasvlakte 2 situation. The above mentioned mechanisms result in a lower erosion rate for the Maasvlakte 2 situation. The cohesive layers are positioned deeper and therefore the armouring effect is also of importance.

Changes in the depth of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> showed some interesting phenomena. It is found that three-dimensional processes suppress the formation of the recirculation zone, as flow separation happened for milder slopes and shallower holes in two-dimensional simulations. The contraction of flow is not necessarily stronger for larger holes, which was hypothesized. The analysis of the bed shear stress in the model results shows a constant upstream slope angle, as the critical value for bed shear stress is not reached.

The experimental data was used to develop new empirical relationships to describe the pattern of boundary shear stress caused by a wall jet over fixed beds and in equilibrium <b>scour</b> <b>holes.</b> These relationships were linked with existing bed-load transport rate models in order to predict the temporal evolution of <b>scour</b> <b>holes.</b> An analytical model describing the relationship between the wall jet flow {{and the development of a}} local <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> shape was reported and its predictions compared with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} (PHOENICS) {{was used to}} investigate the role of stream deflector angle and length on the flow field in a rectangular laboratory flume. Subsequent bed topography surveys were performed to examine the role of obstruction angle on <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> development over time. The model was capable of predicting laboratory velocity and turbulent kinetic energy measurements, performing better for flow over a flat stable bed than over a deformed sand bed. A new method of incorporating complex bed topography into a structured Cartesian mesh {{was developed in the}} process. Flow field properties such as dynamic pressure, velocity amplification, separation zone length and width, and downwelling extent and magnitude were found to be strongly dependent on deflector geometry. Equilibrium <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depths and geometry are also angle-dependent. A predictive equation was produced explaining the rate at which <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> reach equilibrium, and compared well with existing literature.

40|$|Plunge pool scour is an {{important}} topic in hydraulic structures design. Numerous {{studies have been done}} in past years to understand the scour phenomenon due to plunging jets. These studies finally aimed at reducing the risk of structural undermining and collapse. <b>Scour</b> <b>holes</b> created under various hydraulic and geometrical conditions were analyzed for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, and methods to reduce the scour were also investigated. In the current study, an attempt was made to quantify the feasibility of using crossing jets. The scour process was analyzed, and various relationships were presented to predict the main geometrical parameters, i. e., maximum <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> depth, <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> length, and <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> width. <b>Scour</b> profiles were also compared with those due to an equivalent single jet. The main parameters on which the scour geometry depends were found as the densimetric Froude number of the jet, the crossing angle between the jets, the distance between the crossing point and the water surface level, and the water depth.

40|$|Confluences {{are basic}} {{building}} blocks in river networks at all scales. When two rivers merge at a confluence, rapid changes in fluid velocity and turbulence intensity cause {{changes in the}} bed geometry. Usually, a deep <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> and a depositional point bar are present at the confluence. One important phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies is the progressive penetration of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> into the tributary channel. This progressive penetration may jeopardize the structural safety of the lateral channel in {{the proximity of the}} main channel. In this study, dimensional analysis techniques are used to develop a general equation for the prediction of maximum <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> penetration (P sc) into the tributary. Eventhough, the penetration of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> into the lateral channel is a time-dependent process, in developing the formula the maximum value after the equilibrium condition has been achieved is used. A series of 73 experimental tests with different confluence angle (θ), lateral to downstream channel discharge ratio (Q r), lateral to main channel width ratio (B r) and downstream densimetric Froude number (F g) in an asymmetrical confluence has been conducted to test the proposed formulation. The results show that P sc increases with Q r, θ and F g and decreases with B r. The degree of penetration defines two types of scour holes: In the first type the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> penetration only reaches the toe of the lateral channel wall closer to the downstream junction corner whereas in the second type the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> reaches both lateral channel walls. The second type is associated with higher values of Q r, ? and F g and lower values of B r. Statistical analysis showed that the mean error of the developed formula is of the order of 24 %...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, scour of {{cohesive}} soils by submerged circular turbulent wall jets is investigated. Two sets of experimental {{data obtained by}} Abt (1980) and Mazurek (unpublished) are analyzed. The first set of data {{is a series of}} twelve experiments of 1000 minutes duration, where the scour in one cohesive material downstream of a culvert outlet was observed, with the tailwater maintained at a certain height above the culvert invert. The other set of data is an unpublished laboratory study of the scour of clays by a submerged circular wall jet produced in two {{cohesive soils}} by flow through a nozzle with a diameter of 4. 9, 5. 97 or 12. 18 mm. Twenty-three experiments were performed to examine the shape and size of the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> produced in these materials in the asymptotic state. In the present study, dimensionless <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> profiles are developed to give the general shape of the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> produced by these jets in cohesive material. It is seen the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> have the same dimensionless shape, and this shape is consistent through the scouring process. Using dimensional analysis, a model has been developed to predict the characteristic dimensions of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> such as the maximum scour depth, the length of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> and the maximum width. These dimensions are found to correlate well with a dimensionless excess shear stress term found from dimensional analysis. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|Sequences of {{artificial}} steps are sometimes used {{to reproduce the}} natural step–pool morphology of high-gradient streams. The depth, length {{and shape of the}} <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> in gravel-bed rivers can be predicted reasonably using recently developed formulae. However, the properties of the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> can sometimes be affected by the distance between structures. This effect is called ‘geometrical interference’ and leads to a reduction of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> compared to its potential size. Geometrical interference may occur in sequences {{of artificial}} steps in high-gradient torrents, where structures are sometimes built at distances of a few tens of metres apart, but may also apply to natural step–pool systems. In this paper, a series of tests have been conducted to determine the effect of bed sill spacing and sediment grading on the potential erosion by jets forming over the sills. A new formula is derived, applicable to high-gradient streams (slope > 0 · 04), which {{can be applied to the}} special case of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> developed by interfering sills. Sediment size gradation, not accounted for in previous formulae, is found to have a significant effect on the scour dimensions and is included in the new predictive formula...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Accurate {{estimation}} of the maximum possible depth of scour at bridge abutments is important in decision-making for the safe depth of burial of footings. Besides, investigation of the geometric features of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> around abutments provides useful information for the degree of scour counter-measure to be imple-mented against excessive scouring. Experiments have been performed to investi-gate time-dependent characteristics of <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> around vertical wall abutments under clear water conditions with uniform bed materials. Temporal variations of scour depth and scour contours were measured. Using this information, an empir-ical relation was developed for temporal variation of scour depth. Additional rela-tions were also derived for time-dependent volume and surface area of the <b>scour</b> <b>holes</b> around abutments.

A study was {{performed}} to determine the relationship between pipe geometry and scour depth, and examine <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimensions under multiple pipes. Model tests were conducted in a two-dimensional wave-current flume facility in which pipes were exposed to unidirectional flow and unidirectional flow with oscillatory motion. The model testing investigated pipes in contact with a sand bed and the effect of pipe spacing on <b>scour.</b> <b>Scour</b> <b>hole</b> profiles were measured and plotted to show the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> shape under multiple pipe systems. For two pipe systems, spacing between pipes of 1 / 2 pipe diameter resulted in less scour depth than full diameter spacing.

40|$|After {{the annual}} {{maintenance}} period {{and during the}} refilling of the canal downstream of a regulator the tail water depth of this canal is small and not sufficient to produce a hydraulic jump inside the solid apron. This results in a severe local scour problem for the canal bed. A traditional solution of this problem is to place crushed rock in the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> to prevent further scour; however, this method has not {{proved to be a}} permanent solution. To investigate this local scour problem a physical model for a one vent regulator was constructed and a non-uniform granular material was used to simulate the canal bed. This experimental studies revealed that there are five distinct flow regimes in the region of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> namely: (1) a jet attached to the bed, (2) breaking wave and adverse hydraulic jump, (3) a travelling hydraulic jump, (4) wave jump and diving jet, and (5) surface jet with entrainment from below. The initial tests produced an asymmetrical scour hole; however, a midstream flow divider or vane, made the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> more symmetrical. Two depressions were observed inside most of the symmetrical <b>scour</b> <b>holes.</b> It was found that the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> that forms immediately after the apron, which {{is referred to as the}} short-term scour, reaches an equilibrium depth within a few minutes of the start of flow while the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> formed farther from the apron (long-term scour) continues to increase, at a decreasing rate for several days. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is caused mainly by the attached jet while the short-term scour in a trapezoidal channel is produced by the jet attachment and the drilling effect of the vertical vortices caused by the sudden enlargement at the end of the control structure. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is found to be a function of the initial Froude number, the initial jet depth and the particle size. The long-term scour depth is caused by the wave jet or diving jet as well as the surface jet; the scour depth was found to be a function of time, densimetric Froude number, initial jet depth and particle size. The changes in the surficial size distribution and settling velocity were determined for short-term and long-term scour at various locations within and downstream of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole.</b> The Gumbel distribution yields a good fit to both fall diameter and mass based equivalent diameter particle frequency distribution. As the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> develops, the D 50 decreases as does the ratio D 90 /D 10. An unsteady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> pattern and duration of phase 1 (attached jet). This model verified the rapid development of the short-term scour depth and reflected the observed effects of head, flow, and grain size. A steady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimensions immediately downstream of the apron. This model confirmed that the short-term scour depth is mainly a function of the initial Froude number, and initial jet depth, although it was found to be weakly dependent on the particle size. A theoretical consideration for the maximum long-term scour depth supports the concept that this depth is dependent on the densimetric Froude number, the jet expansion characteristics and the Shields constant.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{submergence}} on local scour in a uniform cohesionless sediment bed by a plane turbulent wall jet and the resulting flow field were investigated experimentally. Here, submergence {{is defined as the}} ratio of the tailwater depth to the thickness of the jet at its origin. The main focus was to determine scour dimensions at an asymptotic state, examine whether there was similarity in the velocity profiles for the flow in the <b>scour</b> <b>hole,</b> and to determine the growth of the length scales and decay of the maximum velocity of the jet. Also examined were the relationships between the scales for the velocity field in the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> and the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> size. In the experiments, the range of submergence was varied from 3 - 17. 5, whereas the range of densimetric Froude number and the ratio of the boundary roughness to the gate opening (relative boundary roughness) were varied from 4. 4 - 6. 9 and 0. 085 - 0. 137 respectively. The velocity field in the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> at asymptotic state was measured using a SonTek 16 -MHz MicroADV. Time development of the characteristic dimensions of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> was also measured. The dimensions of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> were found to increase with increasing submergence for all experiments with a “bed-jet” flow regime. In the bed-jet flow regime, the jet remains near the bed throughout the scouring process. Further, the time development of the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> dimensions were observed to increase approximately linearly with the logarithm of time up to a certain time before the beginning of asymptotic state for experiments with either the bed-jet or surface-jet flow regimes. The flow field results showed that the velocity profiles in the region of forward flow and the recirculating region above the jet were similar in shape up to about the location of the maximum scour depth. Relationships describing this velocity profile, including its velocity and length scales, were formulated. The decay rate of the maximum velocity, the growth of the jet half-width, and the boundary layer thickness were also studied. The decay and the growth rate of the jet length scales were found to be influenced by the submergence ratio, densimetric Froude number, and the relative boundary roughness. Two distinct stages in the decay of the maximum streamwise velocity, with distance along the direction of flow, were observed for the jet flows having a bed-jet flow regime. The first stage of velocity decay was characterized by a curvilinear decay of velocity, which followed that of a wall jet on a smooth, rigid bed for streamwise distance approximately equal to 2 L. For the surface-jet flow regime, the decay of velocity was observed to be similar to that of a free-jump on a smooth, rigid bed for a streamwise distance approximately equal to L. Here, L is defined as the streamwise distance measured {{from the end of the}} rigid apron to where the maximum streamwise velocity in the jet is half the velocity of the jet at the end of apron. The streamwise maximum velocity of the jet was then seen to increase in what was called the recovery zone. A relationship for the streamwise decay of the maximum velocity within the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> is proposed. Moreover, other scales representing the flow inside the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> such as the streamwise distance from the end of the apron to where the streamwise maximum velocity starts to deviate from curvilinear to linear decay and the streamwise distance to where maximum streamwise velocity starts to increase are suggested. Some new results on the velocity distribution for the reverse flow for a “bed-jet” flow regime are also presented. Finally, some dimensionless empirical equations describing the relationship between the jet scales for the jet flow in a <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> and the <b>scour</b> <b>hole</b> size are given...|$|R
