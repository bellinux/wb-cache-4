40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} from one transmitter to multiple receivers through inductive coupling is slowly entering the market. However, for certain applications, capacitive wireless {{power transfer}} (CWPT) using electric coupling might be preferable. In this work, we determine closed-form expressions for a CWPT system with one transmitter and two receivers. We determine the optimal solution for two design requirements: (i) maximum power transfer, and (ii) maximum system efficiency. We derive the optimal loads and provide the analytical expressions for the efficiency and power. We show that the optimal load conductances for the maximum power configuration are always larger than for the maximum efficiency configuration. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that if the receivers are coupled, this can be compensated for by introducing <b>susceptances</b> that have the same value for both configurations.

It has been shown previously {{that because of the}} Coulomb interaction, the inherent limitation of the operating frequency and the charge relaxation (response) time of resonant tunneling diode (RTD) is not due to the resonant state lifetime [1], contrary to the general belief [2, 3]. Here we have experimentally shown that intrinsic response time of RTD is dierent than the resonant state lifetime and the operating frequencies of RTD is limited neither by the resonant state lifetime nor by the intrinsic response time. In fact we have experimentally demonstrated negative differential conductance (NDC) far beyond the resonant state lifetime limit which clearly proves that resonant tunneling exists at frequencies beyond the resonant state lifetime limit. Using the analytically derived equivalent circuit [1], the measured frequency {{response of the}} RTD admittances (conductances and <b>susceptances)</b> as well the special features of RTD capacitances at low frequencies are reproduced well.

Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using normalised impedance for series elements and normalised admittances for parallel elements. For these a dual (normalised) impedance and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from normalised impedance to normalised admittance or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius.

40|$|The {{power flow}} {{equations}} model the steady-state {{relationship between the}} power injections and voltage phasors in an electric power system. By separating the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow equations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real solutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper focuses on {{the maximum number of}} real solutions to the power flow equations. An upper bound on the number of real power flow solutions commonly used in the literature is the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and three-bus systems for which all complex solutions are real. It is an open question whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper investigates four-bus systems using techniques from numerical algebraic geometry and conjectures a negative answer to this question. In particular, this paper studies lossless, four-bus systems composed of PV buses connected by lines with arbitrary <b>susceptances.</b> Computing the Galois group, which is degenerate, enables conversion of the problem of counting the number of real solutions to the power flow equations into counting the number of positive roots of a univariate sextic polynomial. From this analysis, it is conjectured that the system has at most 16 real solutions, which is strictly less than the maximum number of complex solutions, namely 20. We also provide explicit parameter values where this system has 16 real solutions so that the conjectured upper bound is achievable. Comment: 6 pages. 1 figure. IEEE styl...|$|R
40|$|We study, {{possibly}} distributed, robust {{weight control}} policies for DC power networks that change link <b>susceptances,</b> or weights {{in response to}} balanced disturbances to the supply-demand vector. The margin of robustness for a given control policy {{is defined as the}} radius of the largest $l_ 1 $ ball in the space of balanced disturbances under which the link flows can be asymptotically contained within their specified limits. For centralized control policies, the control design as well as margin of robustness are obtained from solution to an non-convex weight control problem. We establish relationship between feasible sets for DC power flow and associated network flow, which is used to establish an upper bound on the margin of robustness in terms of the min cut capacity. This bound is proven to be tight if the network is tree-like, or if the lower bound of the operation range of weight control is zero. An explicit expression for the flow-weight Jacobian is derived and is used to devise a projected sub-gradient algorithm to solve the relaxed weight control problem. An exact multi-level programming approach to solve the weight control problem for reducible networks, based on recursive application of equivalent bilevel formulation for relevant class of non-convex network optimization problems, is also proposed. The lower level problem in each recursion corresponds to replacing a sub-network by a (virtual) link with equivalent weight and capacities. The equivalent capacity function for tree-reducible networks is shown to possess a strong quasi-concavity property, facilitating easy solution to the weight control problem. Robustness analysis for natural decentralized control policies that decrease weights on overloaded links, and increase weights on underloaded links with increasing flows is provided for parallel networks.

In the methodology developed here the unknowns relevant to PV nodes are considered within the search process together with the unknown state variables. The proposed method at each iteration requires the solution of a network made up only of impedances; for such a system, supplied only at one node, the <b>susceptances</b> of the PV nodes are unknown as well as the currents in shunt impedances of the terminal buses.

The individual line sources are scanned in elevation by varying the frequency.Scanning in the cross plane, and therefore in azimuth, is produced by phase shifters arranged in the feed structure of the one-dimensional array of line sources.The radiation will therefore occur in pencil-beam form and will scan in both elevation and azimuth in a conical-scan manner.The spacing between the line sources is chosen such that no grating lobes occur, and accurate analyses show that no blind spots appear anywhere.The described arrays have been analyzed accurately by unit-cell approach that takes into account all mutual-coupling effects.Each unit cell incorporates an individual line-source antenna, but in the presence of all the others.The radiating termination on the unit cell modifies the transverse equivalent network.A key new feature of the array analysis is therefore the determination of the active admittance of the unit cell in the two-dimensional environment as a function of scan angle.If the values of β and α did not change with phase shift, the scan would be exactly conical.However, it is found that these values change only a little, so that the deviation from conical scan is small.We next consider whether or not blind spots are present.Blind spots refer to angles at which the array cannot radiate or receive any power; if a blind spot occurred at some angle, therefore, the value of α would rapidly go to zero at that scan angle.To check for blind spots, we would then look for any sharp dips in the curves of α/k0 as a function of scan angle. No such dips were ever found.Typical data of this type exhibit fairly flat behavior for α/k0 until the curves drop quickly to zero as they reach the end of the conical-scan range, where the beam hits the ground.|$|R
