40|$|Abstract. When a small frontoparallel surface (a test strip) is {{surrounded}} by a larger <b>slanted</b> surface (an inducer), the test strip is perceived as <b>slanted</b> in the direction opposite to the inducer. This has been called the depth-contrast effect, but we call it the slant-contrast effect. In nearly all demonstrations of this effect, the inducer's <b>slant</b> is specified by stereoscopic signals; and other signals, such as the texture gradient, specify that it is frontoparallel. We present a theory of <b>slant</b> estimation that determines surface <b>slant</b> via linear combination of various <b>slant</b> estimators; the weight of each estimator is proportional to its reliability. The theory explains <b>slant</b> contrast because the absolute <b>slant</b> of the inducer and the relative <b>slant</b> between test strip and inducer are both estimated with greater reliability than the absolute <b>slant</b> of the test strip. The theory predicts that <b>slant</b> contrast will be eliminated if the signals specifying the inducer's <b>slant</b> are consistent with one another. It also predicts reversed <b>slant</b> contrast if the inducer's <b>slant</b> is specified by nonstereoscopic signals rather than by stereo signals.

5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna as something of a pilot project, a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm.

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as <b>slanting</b> struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty, {{previous}} works on architecture {{were brought to}} more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing ("Timberwork Manual"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao {{was responsible for the}} construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about <b>slanting</b> struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E
40|$|<b>Slant</b> {{correction}} is {{an indispensable}} technique for handwritten word recognition systems. Conventional <b>slant</b> correction techniques estimate the average <b>slant</b> angle of component characters and then correct the <b>slant</b> uniformly. Thus these conventional techniques will perform successfully {{under the assumption}} that each word is written with a constant <b>slant.</b> However, it is more widely acceptable assumption that the <b>slant</b> angle fluctuates during writing a word. In this paper, a nonuniform <b>slant</b> correction technique is presented where the <b>slant</b> correction problem is formulated as an optimal estimaiton problem of local <b>slant</b> angles at all horizontal positions. The optimal estimation is governed by a criterion function and several constraints for the global and local validity of the local angles.

The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a <b>slanting</b> disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself.

5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is <b>slanting,</b> the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E

We found that <b>slant</b> aftereffects (SAE) for monocular and binocular test patterns had opposite signs when measured simultaneously. There was no significant influence of voluntarily controlled perceptual state during adaptation on SAEs of monocular or binocular signals.

40|$|Multiple cues are {{typically}} available for perceiving the 3 D <b>slant</b> of surfaces, and <b>slant</b> perception {{has been used}} as a test case for investigating cue integration. Previous evidence suggests that texture and stereo <b>slant</b> cues contribute in an optimal Bayesian manner.

One explanation proposed by Todd, Christensen, and Guckes (2010) is that <b>slant</b> from texture is based on an inaccurate optical variable. An alternative Bayesian explanation is that perceptual underestimation is due to the influence of frontal cues and/or a frontal prior, which is weighted according to the reliability of <b>slant</b> cues. We measured <b>slant</b> perception using a hand-alignment task for conditions that provided only texture, only stereo, or combined texture and stereo cues. <b>Slant</b> estimates from monocular texture showed large biases toward frontal, with proportionally more underestimation at low <b>slants</b> than high <b>slants.</b> <b>Slant</b> estimates from stereo alone were more accurate, and adding texture information did not reduce accuracy. These results are consistent with a frontal influence that is decreasingly weighted as <b>slant</b> information becomes more reliable. We also included conditions with small cue conflicts to measure the relative weighting of texture and stereo cues. Consistent with previous studies, texture had a significant effect on <b>slant</b> estimates in binocular conditions, and the relative weighting of texture increased with <b>slant.</b> In some cases, perceived <b>slant</b> from combined stereo and texture cues was higher than from either cue in isolation.
