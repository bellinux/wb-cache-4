5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> London, and William Longchamp to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Ely. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E
5|$|Æthelhard was {{translated}} from the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Winchester to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury in 792 and was enthroned as archbishop on 21 July 793. Æthelhard owed his appointment to King Offa of Mercia, and the enthronement was presided over by the then-senior bishop of the land: Hygberht, the Archbishop of Lichfield. King Offa consulted Alcuin of York over proper procedure, as the archbishopric of Lichfield was a new creation.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter from}} Julius II to Henry VII dated 6 July 1504, remarks {{that the king}} had chosen the pope's {{cardinal}}-nephew Galeotto della Rovere as cardinal protector; the letter does not mention Castellesi. della Rovere's selection was likely arranged by Gigli. Castellesi was compensated by being promoted to the wealthier <b>See</b> <b>of</b> Bath and Wells. Castellesi lost favour with the king and fled Rome until the death of Julius II.|$|E

5|$|Alexander was {{nominated}} to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, {{at a ceremony}} held in Canterbury. He owed his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the Peterborough version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted that Alexander's elevation to the episcopate was done entirely {{for the love of}} Roger.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Poland on 20 October 1584 {{and settled in}} Miechów. He rebuilt the altar in the monastery and introduced new ceremonies (including a 40-hour prayer for the king and the kingdom).

5|$|Badajoz is the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz. Prior to {{the merger}} of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's {{inception}} in 1255. The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by {{the ruins of a}} Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz and AD Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin was {{translated}} from the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Worcester to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury in December 1184, after Henry II {{let it be known}} that he would accept only Baldwin at Canterbury; the previous incumbent, Richard of Dover, had died in April that year. The monks put forward three candidates from within Christ Church Priory: Odo, who had been prior of Christ Church and was then Abbot of Battle Abbey, Peter de Leia, a Cluniac prior of Wenlock Priory and later Bishop of St David's, and Theobald, Abbot of Cluny, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place only after a dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury and the suffragan bishops of Canterbury, both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.|$|E

5|$|For {{whatever}} reason, Ealdred {{gave up the}} <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Worcester in 1062, when papal legates {{arrived in}} England to hold a council {{and make sure that}} Ealdred relinquished Worcester. This happened at Easter in 1062. Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig. The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness. Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Worcester was within Canterbury's province. Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed Urse d'Abetot's attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.|$|E

5|$|Gervase of Canterbury wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
5|$|If Cuthbert was at Hereford, {{he served}} in that {{capacity}} for four years before his elevation to the <b>See</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury in 740.

5|$|In 1043 Edward {{appointed}} Stigand to the <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Elmham. Four {{years later}} he {{was appointed to the}} <b>see</b> <b>of</b> Winchester, and then in 1052 to the archdiocese of Canterbury, which Stigand held jointly with Winchester. Five successive popes, including Nicholas II and Alexander II, excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury. Stigand was present at the deathbed of King Edward and at the coronation of Harold Godwinson as king of England in 1066. After Harold's death, Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror. On Christmas Day 1066 Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned William King of England. Stigand's excommunication meant that he could only assist at the coronation.|$|E
