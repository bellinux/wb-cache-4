50|$|Starting in the 2009 model year, General Motors began {{equipping}} {{some new}} <b>vehicles</b> with <b>Stolen</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Slowdown. This feature allows OnStar to remotely {{slow down the}} <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The <b>service</b> {{is also expected to}} help reduce the risk of property damage, serious injuries or fatalities resulting from high-speed pursuits of <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Customers may opt out of that function. The first successful use of this service occurred in October 2009 when a stolen Chevrolet Tahoe was recovered and its suspected thief was apprehended.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned applications, M 2 M communications in ITS support several operations such as tracking of a <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle,</b> traffic reports and route planning, as well as infotainment services [5]. For instance, to recover a <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> tracking (SVT), <b>service</b> providers request data about the location from Telematic Control Unit (TCU) located inside the vehicle. In addition, drivers are also updated by sending reports regarding traffic in a particular region {{so that they can}} change/plan new routes in case of a traffic jam or an emergency. Furthermore, infotainment services aim to provide news/information to drivers and passengers through mobile TV, web-browsing, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} for the research was primarily to satisfy positional accuracy requirements for mobile phone handsets using terrestrial networks as specified by the United States (US) Federal Communications Commission (FCC) E- 911 rules. The objective of the research was to improve location finding accuracy to support the emergency <b>services</b> and the <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> recovery <b>service,</b> in areas devoid of satellite coverage. Following a literature review, four novel location finding techniques were discovered and simulated. The first novel technique provides a means to achieve an accurate mobile time source (1 part in 107) in first generation cellular networks and thereby accurate positioning(20 dBi) pseudo-Doppler antenna. The second method provides enhanced processing gain using a novel Error Correction Coding (ECC) post processing algorithm for hard decision decoded messages where signal re-transmission exists or can be requested. The {{results of the study}} revealed that improvements in location finding accuracy are possible in 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd generation cellular radio networks without compromising the operation of legacy handsets or <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> tracking devices.

30|$|Mobile M 2 M {{communication}} offers manifold {{applications and}} services in modern transport and logistical processes such as onboard security, traffic and infrastructure management, fleet management, and route planning [19]. In case of an emergency, the collected data are sent to other vehicles as well as infrastructure to gain immediate attention. To avoid further incidents, communication between the infrastructure and the vehicles must be very fast to detect emergency messages and deliver warning messages immediately. Similarly, traffic and infrastructure management play {{a prominent role in}} handling the problem of road congestion. It tackles the problem by providing two-way communication opportunities between vehicles and infrastructure. Vehicles can send status updates about the position, speed, fuel consumption, and delivery status reports to the infrastructure and can also receive relevant instructions about road accidents and emergency braking system [20]. Moreover, M 2 M communications support several operations such as tracking of a <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle,</b> traffic reports, and route planning as well as infotainment services [6]. For instance, to recover a <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle,</b> SVT (<b>Stolen</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Tracking) <b>service</b> providers request data about the location from Telematic Control Unit (TCU) located inside the vehicle. In addition, drivers are also updated by sending reports regarding traffic in a particular region so that they can change or plan new routes in case of traffic jam or an emergency. Furthermore, infotainment services aim to provide news/information to drivers and passengers through mobile TV, web-browsing, etc.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990 International Teletrac Systems (later PacTel Teletrac), {{founded in}} Los Angeles CA, {{introduced}} the world's first dynamic real-time <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> recovery <b>services.</b> As an adjacency to this they began developing location based services that could transmit information about location-based {{goods and services}} to custom-programmed alphanumeric Motorola pagers. In 1996 Todd Glassey designed the first Digital Timestamp Server for Email and other content validation and created the first instances of [...] "GeoSpatial Keying" [...] a complex cryptographic process for using time and location data to access or 'unlock' certain key services. Glassey proceeded with his Digital Evidence System {{which was based on}} location and digital object control at the service and network layer interfaces. Later that same year (1996) the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) issued rules requiring all US mobile operators to locate emergency callers. This rule was a compromise resulting from US mobile operators seeking the support of the emergency community in order to obtain the same protection from lawsuits relating to emergency calls as fixed-line operators already had.|$|R

5000|$|Vehicles {{are often}} {{required}} to be registered. Registration may be for purely legal reasons, for insurance reasons or to help law enforcement recover <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Toronto Police <b>Service,</b> for example, offers free and optional bicycle registration online. On motor vehicles, registration often {{takes the form of}} a vehicle registration plate, which makes it easy to identify a vehicle. In Russia, trucks and buses have their licence plate numbers repeated in large black letters on the back. On aircraft, a similar system is used where a tail number is painted on various surfaces. Like motor vehicles and aircraft, watercraft also have registration numbers in most jurisdictions, however the vessel name is still the primary means of identification as has been the case since ancient times. For this reason, duplicate registration names are generally rejected. In Canada, boats with an engine power of [...] or greater require registration, leading to the ubiquitous [...] "" [...] engine.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} finding <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> is very {{time-consuming}} for the cops. So, we are developing such a software {{that will help}} cops to find the <b>STOLEN</b> <b>vehicle</b> faster. For this reason {{there is a need}} for a system where the vehicle must have it’s unique and universal identity. In this project we are using the Ic which we will embed in the vechicle. Whenever the vehicle goes, it will have it’s unique and universal identity with it. When anybody <b>stolen</b> the <b>vehicles,</b> the owner of the vehicle register his/her complaints to the police station, then police will upload the information of <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> in the server database. If that <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> will passes through the range of receiver then the message will display on the tablet of police which contains the whole information about that <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle.</b> So, this system can be useful to detect the vehicle and get it’s details like it’s insurance, registration details, vehicle information, current location and many more. Any person cannot hide the vehicles identity. The vehicle can be tracked anywhere in this world, where the universal vehicle catcher system is available...|$|R

50|$|The {{core of the}} LoJack <b>Stolen</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Recovery System is a small, silent radio {{transceiver}} that is installed in a vehicle. The vehicle is not marked as possessing a LoJack transceiver, {{and the location of}} the transceiver within the vehicle varies from one car to the next. Once installed, the unit and the vehicle's VIN are registered in a database which interfaces with the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) system used by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies throughout the U.S. In the event of a theft, a customer reports the incident to the police, who make a routine entry into the state police crime computer, including the <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle's</b> VIN.
