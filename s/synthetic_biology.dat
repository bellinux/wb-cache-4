5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term <b>synthetic</b> <b>biology</b> is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} paradigmatic {{and structural}} schemes of the functional organization of life (organ-isms and their systems) are constructed {{on the basis}} of systemic analysis and synthesis of the main phenomenological features of the living world. Life is based on functional elements that implement engineering procedures of closed-loop coding-decoding control (CL-CDC). In this approach, living systems are technological systems that naturally emerged on the Earth 3 – 4 bln years ago as a result of chemical and, later on, biological evolution. Generalized schemes of functional organization on the levels of cell, organism and brain neocortex (as the highest one with CL-CDC) are presented. The CL-CDC concept expands the understanding of bioinfor-matics as informatic technologies in life sciences by showing information as the key player in natural processes.

40|$|Genome biology {{approaches}} have made enormous contributions {{to our understanding}} of biological rhythms, particularly in identifying outputs of the clock, including RNAs, proteins, and metabolites, whose abundance oscillates throughout the day. These methods hold significant promise for future discovery, particularly when combined with computational modeling. However, genome-scale experiments are costly and laborious, yielding ‘big data’ that is conceptually and statistically difficult to analyze. There is no obvious consensus regarding design or analysis. Here we discuss the relevant technical considerations to generate reproducible, statistically sound, and broadly useful genome scale data. Rather than suggest a set of rigid rules, we aim to codify principles by which investigators, reviewers, and readers of the primary literature can evaluate the suitability of different experimental designs for measuring different aspects of biological rhythms. We introduce CircaInSilico, a web-based application for generating <b>synthetic</b> genome <b>biology</b> data to benchmark statistical methods for studying biological rhythms.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{work in the}} field of <b>synthetic</b> protocell <b>biology</b> has shown that prebiotic vesicles are able to ‘steal’ lipids from each other. This phenomenon is driven purely by asymmetries in the physical state or composition of the vesicle membranes, and, when lipid resource is limited, translates directly into competition amongst the vesicles. Such a scenario is interesting from an origins of life perspective because a rudimentary form of cell-level selection emerges. To sharpen intuition about possible mechanisms underlying this behaviour, {{experimental work}} must be complemented with theoretical modelling. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a coarse-grain mathematical model of protocell lipid competition. Our model is capable of reproducing, often quantitatively, results from core experimental papers that reported distinct types vesicle competition. Additionally, we make some predictions untested in the lab, and develop a general numerical method for quickly solving the equilibrium point of a model vesicle population. R. S. and B.

40|$|In {{any given}} cell, {{thousands}} of genes are expressed {{and work in}} concert to ensure the cell 2 ̆ 7 s function, fitness, and survival. Each gene, in turn, must be expressed at the proper time and in the proper amounts to ensure the appropriate functional outcome. The regulation and expression of some genes are highly robust; their expression is controlled by invariable expression programs. For instance, developmental gene expression is extremely similar in a given cell type from one individual to another. The expression of other genes is more variable: Their levels are noisy and are different from cell to cell and from individual to individual. This can be highly beneficial in physiological responses to outside cues and stresses. Recent advances have enabled the analysis of differential gene expression at a systems level. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving interactions between large numbers of genes and their regulators have been mapped onto graphic diagrams {{that are used to}} visualize the regulatory relationships. The further characterization of GRNs has already uncovered global principles of gene regulation. Together with <b>synthetic</b> network <b>biology,</b> such studies are starting to provide insights into the transcriptional mechanisms that cause robust versus stochastic gene expression and their relationships to phenotypic robustness and variability.
