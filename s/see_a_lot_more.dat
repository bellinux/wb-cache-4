60|$|About {{a quarter}} of a mile from my house, at a turn of the lane, lived Mrs. Betty Perch. She was a widow with about twelve children. A few of these were her own, and the others she had {{inherited}} from two sisters who had married and died, and whose husbands, having proved their disloyalty by marrying again, were not allowed by the indignant Mrs. Perch to resume possession of their offspring. The casual observer might have supposed the number of these children to be very great,--fifteen or perhaps even twenty,--for if he happened to see a group of them on the door-step, he would <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> if he looked into the little garden; and under some cedar-trees at the back of the house there were always some of them on fine days. But perhaps they sought to increase their apparent number, and ran from one place to another to be ready to meet observation, like the famous clown Grimaldi, who used to go through his performances at one London theatre, and then dash off in his paint and motley to another, so that perambulating theatre-going men might imagine that there were two greatest clowns in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Wesley is {{introduced}} in Angel having been {{fired from the}} Watcher's Council. Denisof says the experience gave the character [...] "a little shake". He elaborates, When he arrived in Sunnydale, he was straight out of Watcher grad school; he lacked practical experience. He {{was living in the}} ideal of the perfect way to execute his duties. I think that losing his job and going out alone roughened him up a little, lopped off some of his sharper corners. It made him more approachable and more personable, less sure of himself all the time. [...] Coming into the show immediately following the death of Doyle, Wesley serves as a partial replacement for that character. Comparing the two characters, Denisof states, [...] "Wesley is a clearer counterpart to Angel, whereas Doyle had more street smarts. Although [...] was struggling with his demon nature, he had <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> of the world in the same way Angel had." [...] Nonetheless Denisof believes that in this period, his character [...] "was so anxious to be a tough rogue demon hunter but was clearly a kind of soft puppy dog." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tamara was {{the victim}} of {{domestic}} abuse during her relationship with Nelson. Paterniti wanted to portray the issue sensitively because {{she did not want to}} insult victims of domestic abuse. She felt it was challenging because no violence aspects were depicted.

Todd finds Jessica mean-tempered, vain, selfish, stupid, spoiled and boring. But we later <b>see</b> there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> to it Jessica's not telling. Or Todd. Jessica's main reason for her anger towards Todd is {{based on the fact that}} he picked Elizabeth over her. Jessica has always found Todd attractive in his appearance and attitude, but she finds his interests and personality quite boring. In that respect, Jessica finds Elizabeth and Todd perfect for each other. Jessica once remarked that she thought Todd was really limiting who Elizabeth was as a person and what she could do. She thought he was making her boring, holding her back even. But after she spent some personal intimate time over one summer with him, she started to think it was the other way around.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reach the EU 2020 goals for the climate, Danish {{vocational}} training units are currently {{in a process of}} institutional change triggered by the need of providing energy, and new process competences for the skilled and semiskilled workforce active in construction. The aim of the present paper is to analyze enablers and barriers for this institutional change. The vocational education system in Denmark is strongly institutionalised with unions, employer's associations and the schools in central roles. Drawing on institutional theory contributions on labour market -, educational - and professional institutions, the paper presents a study of institutional work inside and across schools and craft disciplines working in SMEs involved in new building and renovation with an energy aspect. Collaboration between four education committees for carpenters, masons, electricians and plumbers and interviews with seven companies come to focus on competences of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustainable innovation in SME. The anticipation of future building regulation of 2015 and 2020 creates an institutional pressure in education for change including handling differentiated demands of customers and contractors, not always just following regulation but occasionally ahead of it. At a time this needs to be balanced with customer needs with a comfort orientation and issues of cost and financing. The committees act in a contradictory, sometimes conservative manner in this change of institutions of knowing. In the future specialization will be supplemented by horizontal and vertical interdisciplinary and innovative competences integrating the complex process industrialized construction sector. Schools, teachers and digital teaching materials need be developed to support this change supported by front running companies and results from innovative building projects. The education committees in Denmark can have a leading role in this development and set high and motivational standards for the improvements. The analysis <b>sees</b> however <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> barriers than enablers...|$|R
40|$|This is {{my second}} {{presentation}} to the Human Complexity program, but it is my first experience as a discussant, and I must admit to a rising degree of terror {{when faced with the}} two substantial bodies of work we've <b>seen</b> today. It's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> fun to simply make your points than to try to make your points by risking a complete misrepresentation of someone else's points. That risk is greater than you might suspect, because I approach our topic from two unusual stances: first as an investigative journalist, and second as a generalist. The first stance is easy enough to understand. My aim is to reflect the work we are discussing in plain language. The second stance is tricky because we live in a culture that increasingly separates life into functional compartments. There are no advanced degrees in generalities. But as complexity science shows, the sum is greater than the parts, and the parts are coformed with the sum. So one of my aims today will be to show that generalism and independent scholarship can make useful contributions to specialists and professional scholars. If I succeed at all, Doug White deserves the credit for this invitation. And in any case, I am very grateful to Prof. Hutchins and Prof. Gessler for submitting to amateur commentary...|$|R
