5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to <b>share</b> <b>it</b> with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has {{all the time in the}} world to read them without interruption.|$|E

Diego Forlán (Villarreal, Atlético Madrid), Luis Suárez (Liverpool, Barcelona), Mário Jardel (Porto, Sporting CP) and Cristiano Ronaldo {{are the only}} players to win the award with two different clubs. Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suárez are the only players to win the Golden Shoe in two different leagues.

5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would <b>share</b> <b>it</b> with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory {{and not have to}} <b>share</b> <b>it</b> with his brothers.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{designer}} Peter James described Flight Unlimited IIIs {{development as}} a struggle, thanks {{to a lack of}} interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market <b>share.</b> <b>It</b> became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise, and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.|$|E

5|$|Scheduling of {{the series}} changed {{over the course of}} its development. The first {{announcement}} {{of the series}} in May 2010 stated it would be broadcast during the spring 2011, but by August it was announced it would be moved up to the autumn schedule, before it was ultimately settled to broadcast in February 2011. The series premiere received overnight ratings of 967,000 viewers and a 4 per cent audience <b>share.</b> <b>It</b> became the second largest multichannel audience of the night, behind a repeat of EastEnders on BBC Three, which was seen by 1.061 million. The consolidated ratings for the first episode raised to 1.61 million viewers, which made the episode the second largest multichannel audience in its week, behind an episode of Glee on E4. It also became the 17th highest rated programme ever for Sky1. Overnight ratings declined steadily to 802,000 by episode two, and 691,000 by episode three. The first series finale went up to 938,000 viewers. The second series premiered on Sky1 on 19 January 2012.|$|E

5|$|The Orioles {{decided to}} put Davis at first base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to <b>share</b> <b>it.</b> On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI {{in the first four}} games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 95 victory over the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} broadcast on digital channel BBC Three from 10:30 pm on Monday, 27 October 2008, {{the same day}} as the BBC One viewing of the first episode. The episode would be repeated on the frontline BBC One a day later, during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot. The BBC Three broadcast was viewed by 827,000 and a 7.3% audience <b>share.</b> <b>It</b> was the second most seen multichannel of the night, beaten by the first episode of Dead Set from E4. The BBC One repeat was seen by 5.06 million viewers with a 22.2 per cent; though it was down by 450,000 from the previous episode, it still won its time slot; and both broadcasts achieved a total reach of 5.89 million. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 0.93 million on BBC Three, and 5.63 million on BBC One; together they add up to 6.56 million.|$|E
5|$|The third series faced {{a decline}} in viewership from the second series. The season premiere {{received}} an overnight figure of six million viewers and a 25 per cent audience <b>share.</b> <b>It</b> was down almost two million from the series two premiere in June 2003, which was seen by 7.8million. Ratings declines further as the series continues. The fifth episode dropped to five million. The penultimate episode dropped further to 4.5million, though the finale rose slightly back to five million. However, it was also down from the seven million who saw the series two finale in August 2003. With consolidated figures factored in, the third series was seen {{by an average of}} 5.77million viewers. Despite the ratings decline, the BBC already commissioned a fourth series of Spooks before the third series even began broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to {{find her}} and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is {{captured}} and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. However, they are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and <b>share</b> <b>it</b> equally, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.|$|E
5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would <b>share</b> <b>it,</b> too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E

The second episode saw a fall in the ratings by 300,000 viewers, to 5.16 million viewers, making it the seventeenth most-watched programme on the channel for the week of its broadcast. The episode received a 26% audience share for its timeslot. The following episode dropped to 4.42 million viewers and twenty-fifth in the weekly rankings. Despite a 23% decrease in audience <b>share,</b> <b>it</b> continued to lead in its timeslot. By episode five, viewership had declined to 4.10 million and a 21% audience share, but the show remained the most-watched at 8pm. The same was true of episode six, watched by 4 million viewers with a 20% audience share. Viewership for episodes four to six fell below the channel's top thirty in the weekly rankings. The final two episodes of series one experienced an increase in viewership, to 4.13 and 4.36 million respectively, ranking HolbyBlue twenty-sixth then twenty-fourth in the channel ratings for the weeks of broadcast.|$|E
