5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

25|$|Her last {{political}} invitation was {{to fight}} the Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election, 1924 but the Conservative candidate Walter Elliot was a friend, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could poll enough votes to cause him to lose the seat, so she refused and gave {{up the idea of}} a career in politics. Helen then moved to London, earning money from freelance articles on women's issues. She was elected to Kensington Borough Council sitting as a member for seven years.|$|E

500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|According to Ibn Ishaq's {{biography}} of Muhammad, {{one woman who}} had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. 'Ã'isha, one of Mohammad's wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: 'By Allah,' she said,' that is me.' I said to her 'You poor soul, what is to happen to you?' She said:"I must be killed." [...] "Why?" [...] I asked her. [...] "For something I did," [...] she answered. She went away and was beheaded.

500|$|The video {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from the journalist and critics. Jamie Portman from The Daily Gazette felt that the clip could be [...] "vulnerable to charges of being blatantly provocative in its calculated blending of sex and religion". David Rosenthal from The Spokesman-Review found the video as [...] "visually stunning"; however, Edna Gundersen from USA Today {{did not understand the}} media mayhem behind the clip. She pointed out that [...] "Madonna is a good girl in the video. She saves someone. What is the big deal?..." [...] Among music critics, Phil Kloer from Record-Journal felt that whether one condemns the video as racist or not, [...] "It's condemnable {{on the face of it}} because it exploits a symbol of evil [...] in order to sell records." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman complimented the video for its portrayal of a love song, rather than blasphemy. He was more interested in the stigmata presented in the clip. Taraborrelli described his thoughts: [...] "Madonna danced with such abundance in , as if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was about to cause a commotion, and couldn't wait to see how it would unfold." ...|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

Against her parents' advice, she rejected a four-year journalism scholarship to Carleton University to study drama at the prestigious National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal, paying her own way.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 August 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC had commissioned the six-part comedy Heading Out, which was created and written by Perkins. The BBC's Executive editor of Comedy Commissioning, Kristian Smith, called the show [...] "a warm, intelligent and brilliantly funny sitcom." [...] While Perkins stated that Heading Out [...] "might well be the thing that I'm most proud of. It's been a joy to work on, and I hope that joy proves to be infectious." [...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so she could come out to them. The comedian revealed that she is a fan of thrillers and wanted to have a ticking clock element to the show, so she thought Sara's coming out {{would be a good thing}} to do.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Desencanto== This {{short story}} depicts {{the life of}} a Cape Verdean {{emigrant}} who is on a tram car in Portugal on her way to work. Amarílis describes the day-to-day life of this woman and describes modern Lisbon life as impersonal, monotonous, and continuously accelerated in a hustle and bustle. Life in Lisbon {{is very different from the}} quiet and calm life on her island in Cape Verde. The character does not enjoy her life of solitude in Lisbon, but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can not return to Cape Verde. Although she tries to adapt to the Lisbon city culture, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will never be fully accepted into the ‘white’ European society. To complicate the matter more, <b>she</b> also feels <b>that</b> <b>she</b> no longer belongs to the Cape Verdean culture. As the title of this short story suggests, it is ‘a disenchantment’ (“um desencanto”) for the Cape Verdean emigrants because they feel isolated while living in a foreign land.|$|R
