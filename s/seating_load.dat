40|$|Wheelchair-dependent {{subjects}} often adopt {{a passive}} sitting posture and suffer from sitting acquired pressure ulcers (PU) that mainly occur when high buttock pressures sustain {{for a longer}} period of time. Body posture directly influences <b>seating</b> <b>load</b> and proper postural change is therefore essential. Many subjects cannot reposition themselves and seating systems that adjust sitting posture can regulate <b>seating</b> <b>load</b> and potentially diminish the risk to develop PU. We describe a mechanism for postural adjustments and investigated the influence of seat inclination (1), pelvis rotation (2) and chair recline (3) on buttock load. We developed an experimental simulator chair containing the concept to adjust body posture in the sagittal plane. Measurements involved quasi-static actuated chair movements in which chair configuration, buttock interface pressure and seating forces were simultaneously measured. Significant effects with high coefficients of determination (r 2 > 0. 8) were found for seating force, centre of pressure and sacral load. We conclude that a combination of independent pelvis rotation and seat inclination is effective to regulate the net buttock shear force and the sacral interface pressure in healthy subjects. Whether both techniques are also applicable in subjects without postural stability is still to be evaluated...|$|E

The aim was to investigate the influence of loading force and loading duration applied during cementation on the reinforcement conferred by a resin-cement on a leucite reinforced glass-ceramic. 210 glass-ceramic discs (12 mm diameter, 0. 8 mm thickness) were allocated to seven groups (n= 30). The bi-axial flexure strength (BFS) was determined for 'as-fired' specimens (group A), following HF-acid etching (group B) and following etching and centrally loading on a semi-compliant substrate with 30 N for 300 s (group C). Further etched specimens were coated with Rely-X Unicem resin-cement under cementation loading of 5 or 30 N, for 60 or 300 s (groups D-F) prior to BFS determination using multilayered analytical solutions. BFS data was compared using factorial or one-way analyses of variance and the Weibull analysis. HF-acid etching of the 'as-fired' surface resulted in a significant reduction in mean BFS (P< 0. 001) whereas resin-cementation subsequently conferred significant strengthening (P< 0. 001) ranging from 24 to 38 % and dependent on the loading parameters employed.

It was observed that abnormal swell occurs during unloading when specimens were inundated with a 4 N alkali solution.

40|$|Vacuum seals {{are very}} {{important}} to ensure that the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linac has an optimum vacuum system. The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the leak rate and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal C-seal, Energized Spring seal, Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum leak rate tests on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a copper gasket for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The leak rate of the thin ConFlat flange with a copper gasket is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long coupling cavity flange with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long coupling cavity flange and the welded area of a cavity body with the flange. This analysis is also necessary to predict a potential deformation of the cavity under the combined force of atmospheric pressure and the <b>seating</b> <b>load</b> of the seal.

40|$|Construction {{of roads}} over soft soils {{can lead to}} design and {{construction}} related problems linked to the soil's compressibility characteristics and low strength. Failure, in terms of bearing capacity can occur when pavements are constructed over such soft soils. When road pavements, which are constructed over soft soils, are subjected to cyclic traffic loading (dynamic in nature), rapid deterioration of the base layer material and progressive permanent deformation of the surface will occur. This not only reduces the serviceability of the pavement structure but also its design life. In this study, reinforcement geosynthetics (geogrids and geotextiles) were used as reinforcement inclusions within a granular base overlying a soft subgrade of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) less than 2 % in a 1. 0 m 3 steel test box. Firstly, a geotextile/geogrid was placed at the interface between the base layer and subgrade. Thereafter, {{a combination of the}} geotextile at the interface (of the base and subgrade) and geogrid within the base layer. Bench scale plate load tests (static and cyclic) were conducted on a 305 mm diameter circular steel plate on the two layer system using a Universal Compression Machine. Static loading was applied at a rate of 1. 2 mm/min. Dynamic sinusoidal load wave was applied with a 4 kN <b>seating</b> <b>load</b> that was linearly increased with an incremental load of 4 kN for every 8 cycles at a frequency of 0. 2 Hz on a 305 mm circular plate.

Additionally, a Settlement Reduction Factor (SRF) of 18 % for geogrid, 23 % for geotextile and 31 % for the geogrid-geotextile combination resulted.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} has been to {{evaluate}} and understand the effect of caustic alkali solution of varying composition on the behaviour of expansive soil containing mixed layered minerals. Mixed layered minerals are formed {{of two or more}} kinds of inter grown layers, not physical mixtures. Illite - smectite is the most abundant and wide spread of the mixed layered clay minerals in sedimentary rocks and soils and also more common than either discrete illite or smectite. In geotechnical engineering much attention has not been paid to the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals. Much less is known about the behaviour of these soils in polluted environment. Mixed layered minerals are more susceptible to environmental changes as the structural linkages between the layer minerals are weak compared to normal layered phyllosilicates. One important pollutant that can have considerable effect on the behaviour of soils is the caustic alkali contamination released from various industries. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} behaviour of even stable minerals is affected by alkali contamination. However, the effect of caustic alkali contamination on the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals is not known and has been chosen for detailed study. Also to understand the mechanism of their interaction with alkali, it is necessary to study the effect of alkali solutions on the constituent clay minerals viz., montmorillonite and illite under similar conditions. To elucidate the mechanism of soil alkali interaction limited tests were conducted with simple electrolyte solution, as the alkali solution also acts as electrolyte apart from being alkaline. To confirm the mechanism of interaction, tests are also conducted on these soils with industrial spent liquor containing high caustic alkali and suspended alumina obtained from an alumina extraction plant treating bauxite with high alkali solutions at high temperatures. The results obtained in the laboratory are compared with the soil samples contaminated with leaking industrial Bayer's liquid in the field. Studies are also conducted to suggest remedial measures to control the adverse effects of alkali solutions on soil containing mixed layer minerals. The content of the thesis is broadly divide into 8 Chapters - viz., Introduction, Background and overview, Experimental program and procedures, Behaviour of soils containing mixed layer mineral illite - smectite (BCSI), Behaviour of montmorillonite and illite, Influence of Bayer's liquor and study on the field contaminated soils, Measures to control the influence of alkali contamination on BCSI and Summary and conclusions. The broad outline of these chapters is given in Chapter 1. A review of literature on the behaviour of soils containing different types of clay minerals with emphasis on mixed layer minerals has been presented in Chapter 2. The influence of different inorganic contaminants on the properties of soils in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their concentration has been summarized. The importance of changes in surface characteristics of soil particles and the changes in the thickness of diffuse double layer in altering the property of soils at low concentration of contaminants and changes in the mineralogy with high concentrated contaminants such as acids and alkalis has been highlighted. This forms the background information necessary to bring out the scope of the study. Four soils having different mineralogy have been used in this study. These soils are, black cotton soil containing predominantly mixed layer mineral illite - smectite mineral called rectorite, illite, montmorillonite (common smectite) and black cotton soil containing predominantly montmorillonite. The properties of the soils used are described in Chapter 3. Caustic alkali solutions of 1 N, 4 N concentration prepared in the laboratory and industrial alkali-spent liquor are used as contaminants. The spent Bayer's liquor had about 4 N alkali concentration and 10 % alumina in suspension. To simulate the effect of suspended alumina, two more caustic alkali solutions of 1 N and 4 N solutions containing 10 % alumina by weight of solutions are also prepared. To isolate the effect of electrolyte solutions from that of alkali solution, two electrolyte solutions of 1 N and 4 N sodium chloride solutions are also used. Test procedures for conducting various tests such as pH, water adsorption characteristics, X-ray diffraction studies, SEM studies, thermal characteristics and geotechnical properties such as Atterberg limits, Oedometer tests and Shear Strength are given in this chapter. The test procedures are modified, wherever necessary, to bring out the effect of contaminants, particularly the effect of duration of interaction on the properties of soils. The source and properties of black cotton soil are presented in Chapter 4. Detailed x-diffraction studies have confirmed the presence of inter layered illite-smectite mineral viz., rectorite, which is uncommon in Indian expansive soils, and is classified as CH (Clay of high compressibility) as per ASTM soil classification. Effect of alkali and salt solutions of 1 N and 4 N concentration on all physico chemical and geotechnical properties are studied in this chapter. As it is known that presence of certain elements such as aluminium influence the soil alkali interaction, the effect of suspended alumina along with alkali solution has also been investigated. The effect of contaminating fluids such as 1 N NaOH, 4 N NaOH with and without alumina, 1 N NaCl and 4 N NaCl on the geotechnical properties of the soil has been studied. Mineralogical changes were observed by XRD and thermal studies in the soil treated with 4 N NaOH solution and 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina. The interlayer potassium of illite is released and potassium hydroxide is formed in soil treated with 4 N NaOH. Swelling compounds such as sodium aluminium silicate hydroxide hydrate (SASH) has formed due to attack of 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina on silica rather than on rectorite. Thus the studies clearly bring out that the rectorite present in the soil is dissociated only in the presence of strong alkali solutions of concentration of about 4 N. The liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the electrolyte concentration in the case of NaCl solutions. With 1 N NaOH, the liquid limit of soil increased due to increase in the thickness of diffuse double layer due to increased pH. However, Proctor's maximum dry density increased and optimum moisture content decreased with 1 N NaOH. With increase in the concentration of alkali solution to 4 N, the rectorite dissociates into constituent minerals with the formation potassium hydroxide. The liquid limit of soil decreased probably due to the dominating influence of electrolyte nature of hydroxide solution over the effect of increased negative charge on clay particles due increase in the pH on the constituent minerals. Proctor's maximum dry density decreased and optimum moisture content increased with 4 N NaOH. Sediment volume and oedometer free swell at seating/nominal surcharge load of 6. 25 kPa of soil increased in 1 N and 4 N caustic alkali solutions, though by different mechanisms. The increase with 1 N solution is essentially due to increased negative charges on clay mineral surface. However, the increase in swelling with 4 N solution is associated with the dissociation of rectorite mineral and occurs in two distinct phases unlike in the case of 1 N solution. While the first phase can be attributed to the effect of alkaline nature of the solution after reduction in its concentration due to reaction with rectorite and the consequent reduction in its electrolyte nature. The second phase is due to the swelling of the separated constituent minerals in the presence of excess of alkali and occurs after much delay. Consolidation behaviour of rectorite in 1 N and 4 N alkali solutions has been studied in two ways: 1). Loading without waiting for the second stage of swelling to occur, as in standard consolidation procedure and 2). Loading after completion of second stage of swelling which is occurring after considerable delay as explained earlier. Normally one would initiate loading after equilibrium is reached at the end of first stage of swelling and second stage of swelling is not suspected. As there is no second stage of swelling with 1 N solutions, these two types of consolidation tests produced the same results. Abnormal rebound is observed during unloading with 4 N solution in which loading cycle is initiated without waiting for second stage of swelling to complete. It is interesting to note that while the liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the concentration of alkali solution, the swelling increased. The testing procedure and period of interaction as well as the concentration of alkali solution during the test in these two tests are different. The effects of alkali solution are more severe in case of liquid limit because of thorough mixing and consequent effective reaction during testing. Similarly, the volume changes in soil that has already reacted with 4 N alkali solution when exposed to further to alkali contamination are considerably less compared to uncontaminated soil exposed to fresh contamination. The shear strength of soil treated with 4 N-alkali solution has increased particularly after long period of interaction. This indicates that the soil after mineralogical changes posses good strength. Chapter 5 presents the effect of alkali and salt solutions on the physico chemical and geotechnical properties of component minerals of mixed layered illite/smectite. For this study, commercially obtained montmorillonite (bentonite), naturally occurring black soil containing montmorillonite and commercially pure illite are used. It was observed that montmorillonite alkali reactions would not produce significant mineralogical changes where as illite is dissociated into smectite with the formation of potassium silicate by the interaction of released potassium with soluble silica. This confirms that the ultimate products of rectorite with alkali solutions would be smectite and compounds of potassium. In the absence of mineralogical alterations the liquid limit of montmorillonite decreases due to suppression of diffuse double layer thickness due to dominating influence of alkali solutions on this highly active clay. However a small increase in liquid limit is observed in illite with alkali solutions. Thus the net effect of alkali on rectorite is to decrease the liquid limit with increase in alkali concentration. While the free swell and oedometer swelling of montmorillonite generally decreases with increase in the alkali concentration, they increase in illite. However, in both the minerals the swelling occurs only in one phase. Thus the second phase of swelling that has been observed in rectorite can be attributed to delayed swelling of montmorillonite that has been released by the attack of alkali on rectorite. The behaviour of black soil containing mixed layer mineral contaminated in the field and laboratory by leaking Bayer's spent liquor in an alumina extraction plant has been studied in Chapter 6. The Atterberg limits of the samples treated with liquor are reduced and sediment volume increased. Similarly the swelling at <b>seating</b> <b>load</b> in consolidation test is higher in sample compacted with water and inundated with liquor. X-ray diffraction studies showed that the mineralogical changes are similar to those occurred with 4 N caustic alkali solution. The mineralogical and micro structural changes in the soil samples that are contaminated by leaked spent liquor in the field are relatively more marked. Also the behavior of highly montmorillonite clay, bentonite, has been studied contaminated with liquor in the laboratory. The study on the effect of high concentrated alkali solutions on montmorillonite can be useful to study the effect of interaction on the dissociated montmorillonite. These studies are helpful to suggest some possible remedial measures to control the adverse effect of alkali on soils. Possible Remedial schemes that can be adopted before and after contamination of the soil to control the adverse effect of alkali solutions on the black cotton soil containing mixed layered mineral are listed and their effectiveness examined in Chapter 7. The suggested remedial measures include flushing with water to dilute the effect of alkali, neutralisation with dilute hydrochloric acid, stabilisation of soil with lime and calcium chloride and use of impervious membrane to separate the foundation soil from alkali solution. The effectiveness of different measures as well as the method of their application has been described. Efforts are made to understand the mechanism of remedial action. Consolidation tests conducted on soil contaminated with 4 N alkali solution and inundated with water showed increased swelling due to dilution of the alkali concentration. Though the swelling of contaminated soil can be controlled by passing dilute hydrochloric acid (1 N), the method is not advocated as it can lead to ground water contamination. Mixing the soil with solutions containing up to 5 % by weight of calcium compound in water could not prevent the alkali induced heave in the long run when inundated with 4 N alkali solution. This was due to dissolution of silica by the strong alkali solutions and formation of swelling compounds such as sodium aluminium silicate hydroxide hydrate (SASH). The formation of sodium aluminates occurred only when the alkali solution contained alumina or soil contained calcium compounds. There are no significant variations in the effects of calcium chloride or calcium hydroxide on contaminated soil. Replacing the foundation soil with soil thoroughly contaminated with 4 N alkali solutions and controlling the migration of contaminants into the foundation soil using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geosynthetic membranes can be an effective measure to control the heaving in alkali contaminated foundation soil containing interstratified illite – smectite.

40|$|Contaminant-resistant seal {{designs and}} a {{dynamically}} stable prototype check valve for the orbital maneuvering and reaction control helium pressurization {{systems of the}} space shuttle were developed. Polymer and carbide seal models were designed and tested. Perfluoroelastomers compatible with N 2 O 4 and N 2 H 4 types were evaluated and compared with Teflon in flat and captive seal models. Low load sealing and contamination resistance tests demonstrated cutter seal superiority over polymer seals. Ceramic and carbide materials were evaluated for N 2 O 4 service using exposure to RFNA as a worst case screen; chemically vapor deposited tungsten carbide was shown to be impervious to the acid after 6 months immersion. A unique carbide shell poppet/cutter seat check valve was designed and tested to demonstrate low cracking pressure (2. 0 psid), dynamic stability under all test bench flow conditions, contamination resistance (0. 001 inch CRES wires cut with 1. 5 pound <b>seat</b> <b>load)</b> and long life of 100, 000 cycles (leakage 1. 0 scc/hr helium from 0. 1 to 400 psig) ...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{testing of}} {{aircraft}} seats has been incorporated {{to enhance the}} survivability of aircraft mishaps for over 10 years. This standard may be introduced into aircraft with certification basis prior to this introduction if <b>seat</b> <b>loads</b> can {{be limited to the}} structural capabilities of the seat track. Since the earlier seat tracks typically had lower load requirements they may not be capable of bearing a dynamic seat test with current seat designs. An attempt to establish the performance objects of energy absorbing features will be investigated. Modeling dynamic events with MADYMO software has been proven to be efficient and accurate in many aerospace and automotive applications. Using this tool, a model was developed to investigate how limiting <b>loads</b> at the <b>seat</b> track affect occupant performance. Both finite element and multibody techniques were used to create a detailed model of a typical commercial airplane seat with three occupants. Both a baseline model without energy absorption and a modified model with energy absorption were developed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of energy absorbing devices between the seat and the seat track...|$|R

40|$|In Greece, {{during the}} 1980 's, 60 % of the twin-block {{concrete}} ties designed for 200 km/h, which were laid {{on a track}} with maximum operational speed of 140 km/h, presented serious cracks. The existing theories, in the French, German and American bibliographies, could not justify the appearance of these cracks since the calculated actions on the rail seat of the ties were {{much lower than the}} limit values of the regulations. This paper presents a model for the determination of the load acting on the rail seat of the ties in relation to the fluctuation of the substructure stiffness coefficient. The basic parameters influencing the estimation of the rail <b>seat</b> <b>load</b> -considering the most adverse conditions of a railway network-are investigated, and a methodology for calculating the load undertaken by each rail seat is presented. Numerical applications on twin-block and monoblock ties are presented, including the use of strain attenuating tie pads with high resilient fastenings. Finally, an application for the heavy-haul rail transport is presented, for the case of a track equipped with W 24 fastening, Zw 700 WIC pad, rail 140 RE type and concrete sleepers. © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

At the request and under the sponsorship of Ford Motor Company, Autoliv conducted a series of dynamic rollover tests on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles (SUV) during 1998 and 1999. Data from those tests were made available to the public and were analyzed in this study to investigate the magnitude of and the temporal relationship between roof deformation, lap–shoulder <b>seat</b> belt <b>loads,</b> and restrained anthropometric test dummy (ATD) neck loads...|$|R
