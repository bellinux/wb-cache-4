40|$|Two {{widely used}} {{simulation}} models of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) {{were used in}} order to compare the models' predictions in term of disease spread, consequence, and the ranking of the applied control strategies, and to discuss {{the effect of the}} way disease spread is modeled on the predicted outcomes of each model. The DTU-DADS (version 0. 100), and ISP (version 2. 001. 11) were used to simulate a hypothetical spread of FMD in Denmark. Actual herd type, movements, and location data in the period 1 st October 2006 and 30 th September 2007 was used. The models simulated the spread of FMD using 3 different control scenarios: 1) A basic scenario representing EU and Danish control strategies, 2) pre-emptive depopulation of susceptible herds within a 500 meters radius around the detected herds, and 3) <b>suppressive</b> <b>vaccination</b> of susceptible herds within a 1, 000 meters radius around the detected herds. Depopulation and vaccination started 14 days following the detection of the first infected herd. Five thousand index herds were selected randomly, of which there were 1, 000 cattle herds located in high density cattle areas and 1, 000 in low density cattle areas, 1, 000 swine herds located in high density swine areas and 1, 000 in low density swine areas, and 1, 000 sheep herds. Generally, DTU-DADS predicted larger, longer duration and costlier epidemics than ISP, except when epidemics started in cattle herds located in high density cattle areas. ISP supported <b>suppressive</b> <b>vaccination</b> rather than pre-emptive depopulation, while DTU-DADS was indifferent to the alternative control strategies. Nonetheless, the absolute differences between control strategies were small making the choice of control strategy during an outbreak to be most likely based on practical reasons...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} on which strategy {{to use in}} the control of contagious animal diseases involves complex trade-offs between multiple objectives. This paper describes a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) application to illustrate its potential support to policy makers in choosing the control strategy that best meets all of the conflicting interests. The presented application focused on the evaluation of alternative strategies to control Classical Swine Fever (CSF) epidemics within the European Union (EU) according to the preferences of the European Chief Veterinary Officers (CVO). The performed analysis was centred on the three high-level objectives of epidemiology, economics and social ethics. The appraised control alternatives consisted of the EU compulsory control strategy, a pre-emptive slaughter strategy, a protective vaccination strategy and a <b>suppressive</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategy. Using averaged preference weights of the elicited CVOs, the preference ranking of the control alternatives was determined for six EU regions. The obtained results emphasized the need for EU region-specific control. Individual CVOs differed in their views on the relative importance of the various (sub) criteria by which the performance of the alternatives were judged. Nevertheless, the individual rankings of the control alternatives within a region appeared surprisingly similar. Based on the results of the described application it was concluded that the structuring feature of the MCDM technique provides a suitable tool in assisting the complex decision making process of controlling contagious animal diseases...|$|E
40|$|Usually {{we rely on}} {{vaccination}} {{to promote}} an immune response to a pathogenic microbe. In this study, we demonstrate a suppressive form of vaccination, with DNA encoding a minigene for residues 139 – 151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP 139 – 151), a pathogenic self-Ag. This <b>suppressive</b> <b>vaccination</b> attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis. Proliferative responses and production of the Th 1 cytokines, IL- 2 and IFN-�, were reduced in T cells responsive to PLP 139 – 151. In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL- 2, IL- 15, and IFN- � were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th 1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP 139 – 151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP 139 – 151 to proliferate even {{in the presence of}} exogenous CD 28 costimulation. DNA immunization with the myelin minigene for PLP-altered expression of B 7. 1 (CD 80), and B 7. 2 (CD 86) on APCs in the spleen. Suppressive immunization against self-Ags encoded by DNA may be exploited to treat autoimmune diseases. The Journal of Immunology, 1999, 162 : 3336 – 3341.

40|$|Vaccination with DNA {{encoding}} the encephalitogenic autoantigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), pMOG 91 - 108, {{induce a}} protective immunity against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of human multiple sclerosis. By injection of a DNA vaccine {{that contains a}} DNA region encoding short interfering RNA specific for IFNβ (pMOG-IFNβ) the protective effect of the DNA vaccination is totally inhibited. This demonstrates that IFN-β is {{directly involved in the}} protective mechanism against EAE. The objective of this project was to study how molecules involved in the inflammatory process in EAE are regulated by <b>suppressive</b> DNA <b>vaccination.</b> mRNA expression of IL- 1 β, TGF β, IL- 23 p 40 and Axl receptor tyrosine kinas did not show any significant differences between the groups vaccinated with these DNA vaccines. IL- 6 and IFNγ mRNA expression after MOG stimulation in rats treated with pCI, a control vaccine was significantly higher compared to the group vaccinated with vaccine containing pMOG-IFNβ. IL- 17 m RNA expression after MOG stimulation in pCl-treated rats was significantly higher compared to the group vaccinated with vaccine containing pMOG- 91 - 108. Of these results the mRNA expression of IL- 17 and IL- 6 were of interest for the project. The immune system normally protects the body against infections and T-cells have an important role in this defence system. In MS and EAE, the immune system attacks the myelin and this process is caused by a dysregulation of the T-cells. IL- 17 -producing Th 17 cells mediate EAE. Naïve CD 4 T-cells in the presence of IL- 6 and TGFβ are differentiated to Th 17 cells instead of differentiating into T-helper or regulatory T-cells. These IL- 17 -producing T-cells are highly pathogenic and essential for the development of EAE. The results showed that pMOG IFNβ vaccine had an effect at the immune response, which resulted in an inhibition of the IL- 6 production and that vaccination with pMOG 91 - 108 impairs differentiation of IL- 17 -producing T-cells...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the last}} {{issue of the}} SEP Report, a {{distinct}} <b>suppressive</b> effect of <b>vaccination</b> on the occurrence of both smallpox and measles {{has appeared in the}} 19 country West and Central African Region. Both are described in this issue. The results reflect laudably on the vigorous and effective efforts of the respective Ministries of Health responsible, and also on the collaboration and assistance of the two health unions OCOGE and OCEAC, the World Health Organization, and the USAID-USPHS technicians participating. They also encourage an intensification of efforts to consolidate the gains made, and {{to take advantage of a}} unique opportunity, now emerging, to rid the area of smallpox within the next twelve months. In this regard the example of malaria eradication elsewhere in the world bears remembering; the elation of early success too frequently gave way to frustration in eliminating residual foci of disease, to discouragement of interest and relaxation of effort. As a result some countries, once close to malaria eradication have suffered a resurgence of malariato pre-eradication levels. The same need not occur with smallpox eradication. In the West and Central African Regional Smallpox Eradication and Measles Control effort, rapid and effective mass vaccination campaigns have begun to reap gratifying reductions in the occurrence of both diseases. However intensified disease surveillance, case detection, and outbreak containment concurrently with continuing mass vaccination efforts must play an increasingly predominate role if the objectives of smallpox eradication and measles control are to be reached.

40|$|Myelin-specific {{induction}} {{of tolerance}} represents a promising means {{to modify the}} course of autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Our laboratory has focused on a novel preclinical strategy for the induction of tolerance to the major encephalitogenic epitopes of myelin that cause experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats and mice. This novel approach {{is based on the}} use of cytokine-NAg (neuroantigen) fusion proteins comprised of the native cytokine fused either with or without a linker to a NAg domain. Several single-chain cytokine-NAg fusion proteins were tested including GMCSF-NAg, IFNbeta-NAg, NAgIL 16, and IL 2 -NAg. These cytokine-NAg vaccines were tolerogenic, therapeutic vaccines that had tolerogenic activity when given as pre-treatments before encephalitogenic immunization and also were effective as therapeutic interventions during the effector phase of EAE. The rank order of inhibitory activity was as follows: GMCSF-NAg, IFNbeta-NAg[*]>[*]NAgIL 16 [*]>[*]IL 2 -NAg[*]>[*]MCSF-NAg, IL 4 -NAg, IL- 13 -NAg, IL 1 RA-NAg, and NAg. Several cytokine-NAg fusion proteins exhibited antigen-targeting activity. High affinity binding of the cytokine domain to specific cytokine receptors on particular subsets of APC resulted in the concentrated uptake of the NAg domain by those APC which in turn facilitated the enhanced processing and presentation of the NAg domain on cell surface MHC class II glycoproteins. For most cytokine-NAg vaccines, the covalent linkage of the cytokine domain and NAg domain was required for inhibition of EAE, thereby indicating that antigenic targeting of the NAg domain to APC was also required in vivo for tolerogenic activity. Overall, these studies introduced a new concept of cytokine-NAg fusion proteins as a means to induce tolerance and to inhibit the effector phase of autoimmune disease. The approach has broad application for <b>suppressive</b> <b>vaccination</b> as a therapy for autoimmune diseases such as MS...|$|E
