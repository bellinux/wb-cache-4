It is also traditionally used in the production of several types of Chinese huangjiu (Shaoxing jiu), Japanese sake (akaisake), and Korean rice wine (hongju), imparting a reddish colour to these wines. Although used mainly for its colour in cuisine, red yeast rice imparts a <b>subtle</b> <b>but</b> pleasant taste to food and is commonly used in the cuisine of Fujian regions of China.|$|E
25|$|After {{the early}} studies that {{reported}} that PCE {{children would be}} severely disabled came studies that purported to show that cocaine exposure in utero has no important effects. Almost every prenatal complication originally thought to be due directly to PCE was found to result from confounding factors such as poor maternal nutrition, use of other drugs, depression, and lack of prenatal care. More recently the scientific community has begun to reach an understanding that PCE does have some important effects but {{that they are not}} severe as was predicted in the early studies. The effects of PCE are <b>subtle</b> <b>but</b> they exist. Most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero are normal or close to it.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the term}} was {{promoted}} most actively by the Communist Party of China during its struggle for power. It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in mainland China after the People's Republic of China was founded. For example, women were nü tongzhi (female comrade), children were xiao tongzhi (little comrade) and seniors were lao tongzhi (old comrade). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese {{and members of the}} Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as tóng zhì is seen as a <b>subtle</b> <b>but</b> unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity.|$|E

25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually very <b>subtle</b> <b>but</b> may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). A high pain threshold is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E

Restricted by Stalinist censorship, Brynych's uses Nazi fascism as a metaphor {{to speak out against}} Soviet communism, highlighting the evils of both oppressive regimes. When it was released in America in 1968, the film was highly praised by critics.

5000|$|Social health {{means the}} same as social order, and is {{guaranteed}} when nearly everyone accepts the general moral values of their society. Hence structural functionalists believe the aim of key institutions, such as education, is to socialize children and teenagers. Socialization is {{the process by which}} the new generation learns the knowledge, attitudes and values that they will need as productive citizens. Although this aim is stated in the formal curriculum, it is mainly achieved through the hidden curriculum, a <b>subtler,</b> <b>but</b> nonetheless powerful, indoctrination of the norms and values of the wider society. Students learn these values because their behavior at school is regulated (Durkheim in [...] ) until they gradually internalize and accept them.|$|R

PopMatters praised the production, stating that [...] "the hip-hop rhythms are catchy, sometimes in your face, sometimes <b>subtle,</b> <b>but</b> always a fine backdrop for the power of Dre's voice." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times mentioned that the beats were [...] "lean and immaculate, each one a pithy combination of beat, rap, melody and strategic silences".|$|E

VanDerWerff noted that the episode's plotting and symbolism were not always <b>subtle,</b> <b>but</b> felt that this directness suited the series' tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5. Gibron felt that both Cloke and O'Quinn gave particularly strong performances in both this episode and its follow-up.

500|$|GWA {{studies have}} several issues and {{limitations}} {{that can be}} taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case and control groups, insufficient sample size, control for multiple testing and control for population stratification are common problems. [...] Particularly the statistical issue of multiple testing wherein it has been noted that [...] "the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for false-positive results". Ignoring these correctible issues has been cited as contributing to a general sense of problems with the GWA methodology. In addition to easily correctible problems such as these, some more <b>subtle</b> <b>but</b> important issues have surfaced. A high-profile GWA study that investigated individuals with very long life spans to identify SNPs associated with longevity is an example of this. The publication came under scrutiny because of a discrepancy between the type of genotyping array in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated with longevity. The study was subsequently retracted.|$|E

[...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected the song as the album's best track by writing [...] "Truth be told, this album lacks an absolute classic to match 'Confide in Me', but 'Breathe' – <b>subtle</b> <b>but</b> sneakily catchy with it – could be one of 's most underrated singles." [...] While reviewing Minogue's 2004 compilation, Ultimate Kylie, Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music gave it a mixed review by writing [...] "Beginning in 1994 with the gorgeously glacial, slinkily synthetic 'Confide In Me', Kylie enjoyed brief success before fans fled in droves from awkward faux-rock like 'Some Kind of Bliss' (not included) and flimsy house like 'Breathe'." [...] Reviewing her 2002 compilation, Hits+, Mackenzie Wilson from AllMusic commended Minogue's [...] "seductive vocals" [...] on [...] "Breathe", [...] "Automatic Love" [...] and [...] "Confide in Me".|$|E

30|$|This {{background}} creates {{new challenges}} to old ideals of filial piety, which {{have long been}} the guiding principle of relations between ageing parents and adult children.

This special issue makes a timely contribution to understanding some of the consequences of population ageing for intergenerational relations in China through qualitative research on family strategies and practices. The papers included do not focus on the obvious problems of ageing (or the elderly as a problem), <b>but</b> instead highlight <b>subtler,</b> <b>but</b> nonetheless important changes taking place in Chinese families in terms of renegotiating intergenerational obligations and planning to manage care and support in the context of a rapidly ageing society, new family configurations and insufficient welfare support from the state.|$|R
