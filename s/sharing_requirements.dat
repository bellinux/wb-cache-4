40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} that the relative priority of requirements can help developers to resolve inconsistencies and make some necessary trade-off decisions. However, for most distributed development such as Viewpoints-based approaches, different stakeholders may assign different levels of priority to the same <b>shared</b> <b>requirements</b> statement from their own perspectives. The disagreement in the local priorities as-signed to the same <b>shared</b> <b>requirements</b> statement often puts developers into a dilemma during inconsistency handling process. As {{a solution to this}} problem, we present a merging-based approach to handling inconsistency in the Viewpoints framework in this paper. In the Viewpoints framework, each viewpoint is a requirements collection with local prior-itization. Informally, we transform such a requirements collection with local prioritization into a stratified knowledge base. Moreover, the re-lationship between viewpoints is considered as integrity constraints. By merging these stratified knowledge bases, we then construct a merged knowledge base with a global prioritization, which may be viewed as an overall belief in these viewpoints. Finally, proposals for inconsistency handling are derived from the merged result. The global prioritization as well as the local prioritization may be used to argue these proposals and to help developers make a reasonable trade-off decision on handling inconsistency...|$|R

40|$|At last, {{this study}} {{examines}} the welfare effects of export <b>share</b> <b>requirement</b> in a less developed country (LDC) with foreign investment, labour unemployment (or underemployment) and imperfect competition in its importable sector. In the quota case, introducing export <b>share</b> <b>requirement</b> always benefits a Harris-Todaro or Lewis' economy irrespective of free or restricted entry of local rivals. The policy unambiguously dampens the domestic price of imported goods, expands the importable sector, reduces labour unemployment (or underemployment) and improves national welfare. When free entry and exit of domestic players are allowed, the policy also induces emergence of local rivals. The LDC should always impose 100 % export <b>share</b> <b>requirement</b> on foreign investment for attaining maximal welfare. This dissertation consists of three independent essays on international trade policies. First of all, this dissertation provides a general equilibrium model on a small economy for examining the individual {{as well as the}} joint effects of pollution tax and equity share restrictions on the investment from multinational corporations (MNCs). The results show that free trade, free capital flow and the Pigouvian tax (i. e. at a rate equal to the marginal damage of pollution) is the first-best policy for the host country. Should imports be subject to irremovable tariff, the second-best policy is 100 % foreign ownership of MNC subsidiaries, coupled with pollution tax higher than the Pigouvian rate. Allowing wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries and taxing pollution less than the Pigouvian rate is the second-best option for an economy adopting quantitative restriction policies. In particular, if quota is adopted by the host country, who retains all the trade restriction rent, the second best policy mix will be the Pigouvian tax and allowing full foreign ownership of MNC subsidiaries. We then proceed to a game theoretic model to investigate how an industrialized country serves the market of a host country by transferring its technology to the host country's importable sector, and how the host country government reacts by means of export <b>share</b> <b>requirement</b> to optimize its national welfare. The interaction between the host country and the technology-exporting country has been modeled as a non-cooperative game. In the simultaneous-move framework, we have derived the existence of Nash equilibrium. The export of technology should earn a positive royalty, and the host country mandates some portion of importable good produced by foreign firms for export. The effects of raising tariff on importable good and importing more capital-intensive technology are also investigated. In addition, the sub-game perfect equilibria of two possible sequential-move frameworks have also been formulated. Tai Chi-hung. "December 1999. "Adviser: Eden S. H. Yu.
