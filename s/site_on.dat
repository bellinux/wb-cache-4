40|$|Neutralizing {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{directed against}} five antigenic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> the spike (S) S 1 glycopolypeptide of {{avian infectious bronchitis}} virus (IBV) were used to select neutralization-resistant variants of the virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of such variants with the sequence of the IBV parent strain, we located five antigenic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> the amino acid sequence of the S 1 glycopolypeptide. The variants had mutations within three regions corresponding to amino acid residues 24 to 61, 132 to 149 and 291 to 398 of the S 1 glycopolypeptide.

40|$|Anisotropy of anionic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> plasma {{membranes}} {{has been}} implicated in contact phenomena at cell surfaces (16, 17). Recent evidence indicates that charge anisotropy may be important among intracellular membranes also, since distribution of anionic sites has been related to structural organization of mitochondrial membranes (8).

This visual probe {{has been applied to}} study anionic <b>sites</b> <b>on</b> cell surfaces (2, 7) and on mitochondrial membranes (8).

5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one <b>site</b> <b>on</b> the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another <b>site</b> <b>on</b> the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a <b>site</b> <b>on</b> the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania.
