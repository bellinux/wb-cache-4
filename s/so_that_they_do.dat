5|$|The larvae of wasps {{resemble}} maggots, and are {{adapted for}} life in a protected environment; {{this may be the}} body of a host organism or a cell in a nest, where the larva either eats the provisions left for it or, in social species, is fed by the adults. Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not foul their cell).|$|E
5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story. At certain points, they get to make a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not {{have to go back to}} the beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
25|$|Animal control {{agencies}} in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have undesired puppies.|$|E
25|$|To produce yogurt, milk {{is first}} heated, usually to about 85°C (185°F), to denature the milk {{proteins}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not form curds. After heating, the milk {{is allowed to}} cool to about 45°C (113°F). The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a temperature of 45°C (113°F) is maintained for four to twelve hours to allow fermentation.|$|E

25|$|In 2016 the OBR {{said that}} the reforms had still made {{no impact on the}} level of welfare {{spending}} — although a simple freezing of benefit payments, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not rise with inflation, had made some savings for the Treasury.|$|R
25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded. Rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not suffer recession due {{to the use of}} unleaded fuel.|$|E
25|$|An adapted abacus, {{invented by}} Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer abacus is still {{commonly}} used {{by individuals who}} are blind. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cube root.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{power series}} are like polynomials, but allow {{infinitely}} many non-zero terms to occur, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like irrational numbers cannot), but {{the rules for}} manipulating their terms {{are the same as}} for polynomials. Non-formal power series also generalize polynomials, but the multiplication of two power series may not converge.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{principles}} of stealth technology was to shape the surface of aircraft <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not reflect the transmitted beam directly back at the shared antenna. Another technique was to absorb some of the radar in the coating of the aircraft.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{but they}} had no cannon in those days," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "They had only bows and arrows, spears, javelins, and such sort of weapons, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not require any port-holes. The men could shoot their weapons {{from the top of the}} wall." ...|$|R
2500|$|Driving {{controls}} were located {{at each end}} of the railcar <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have to be turned at termini. Each was powered by two diesel engines, mounted on the bogies. They wore out three sets of engines; the original Leyland engines were replaced with Meadows engines.|$|R
25|$|In agriculture, {{the insect}} {{can be managed}} with cultural, biological, and {{chemical}} control methods. Keeping orchard trees clipped <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not touch each other may help slow the spread. Cleaning farm equipment and other objects used in the field can help prevent its transport. Few insecticides {{are known to be}} very effective on mealybugs, because they can hide and avoid spraying, their wax layers resist some chemicals, and their overlapping generations prevent complete control.|$|E
25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another.|$|E
25|$|In-situ {{leaching}} (ISL), {{also known}} as solution mining, or in-situ recovery (ISR) in North America, involves leaving the ore where {{it is in the}} ground, and recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered. Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock generated. However, the orebody needs to be permeable to the liquids used, and located <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not contaminate ground water away from the orebody.|$|E
50|$|The rule {{borrowed}} from the rule of Saint Augustine, but was mostly inspired by the rule of Saint Benedict. It was, however, adapted for use by active, primarily military, knights, rather than cloistered monks. For example, the fasts were less severe <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not interfere with combat.|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} thing. The noises from it went far to drown the voice of God, and bewildered some men <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not rightly know what the voice was saying.

25|$|None of {{the other}} sets of modes in a drum {{membrane}} have a central antinode, and {{in all of them}} the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-s orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not pass straight {{through the center of the}} primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.|$|E
25|$|The {{softened}} fibers {{are kept}} in water until they are processed. This {{needs to be done}} as quickly as possible <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not rot. At this stage, chlorine bleach may be added to either lighten the paper entirely or to create a mix of shades to create a marbled effect. This step has become necessary {{due to the lack of}} naturally light bark fibers. If the paper is to be colored, strong industrial dyes are used. These can vary from purple, red, green or pink, whatever the demand is.|$|E
25|$|As direct-contact {{membrane}} keyboards became popular, {{the available}} rollover of keys was optimized {{by analyzing the}} most common key sequences and placing these keys <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still {{be a problem in}} games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.|$|E

60|$|The {{whole of}} that day was spent on the mountainside, the {{various members of the}} party {{separating}} {{from time to time and}} then coming together, to relate their various experiences.

30|$|Also {{at the end}} of winter, {{around about}} March, the sheep’s tails were cut <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not bother them in summer and could avoid infections. In the old days, the tails were {{carefully}} scraped and cleaned and then were used for another feast. Curiously, this delicacy came from the meat of an animal which was still alive.|$|R
25|$|Reliefs are {{slightly}} {{more complicated than}} his sculptures. The pieces have to be completed as quickly as possible, sometimes within one day, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not dry and contract in size. When a relief was finished, Al-Zahawi would cut the relief into equal sized cross-sections that fit wooden squares (approximately 8 inches sq.) so as to allow each square {{to have its own}} design portion. Each square is then fired at 1000°C (biscuit firing). Once firing is complete, each square is mounted back onto a large wooden surface to reconstruct the relief into its original design. Often the pieces do not align perfectly but this adds a more unique and creative element to the final finish.|$|E
25|$|Expressways however can be {{upgraded}} to motorway standard; these roads are colloquially {{referred to as}} gelbe Autobahn (yellow motorway) {{because they have the}} same technical standard as the Autobahn but they have black on yellow signs instead of the white on blue signs used on the Autobahn motorway network. These are generally high-speed arterial roads in larger cities or important roads within a federal state that do not connect to major cities, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not fall under the federal budget for the Autobahn network. The federal road Bundesstraße 27 is an example where about half of its length is {{upgraded to}} a high speed motorway standard. Some of these non-Autobahn motorways do not have an actual speed limit (design speed 130km/h).|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the rest}} of Querétaro's notable sites are located in the {{historic}} center, which is pedestrian-friendly and filled with colonial architecture. The local government maintains this area well, with cleaning crews to keep the streets clean and regulating vendors <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not block streets and sidewalks. In the evening, the area fills with people strolling the plazas and walkways and frequenting the area's restaurants, cafes and food stands. One way to see this part of town is the Noche de Leyendas (Night of Legends), which is a hybrid between interactive theater and a recounting of history. A group of actors guide visitors through the streets of the city narrating stories about what has happened in these places. This event begins at the main plaza, the Plaza de Armas {{in the center of the}} city with a reenactment of the legend of Carambada. Then the show wanders the street all the while telling tales related to bandits, loves and myths. These tales demand audience participation providing lines and provoking debate.|$|E
