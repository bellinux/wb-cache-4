40|$|In {{container}} shipping industry inter-firm {{agreements are}} becoming progressively popular as ship-owners share their slot capacity with commercial partners {{in order to}} have fully loaded container ships and reduce financial risk. This manuscript focuses on the co-operative agreements among shipping firms, i. e. vessel sharing and <b>slot</b> <b>charter</b> agreements within consortia and strategic alliances. Through a quantitative approach based on network and OLS regression analysis, we scrutinise the propensity to co-operate, the geographic extent and leveraging effect generated by this commercial practise on the container-shipping industry. Results show that carriers, usually regarded as independent, are instead fairly co-operative, especially when involved in trade lanes originating from the Far East. Finally, we show that carriers increase their commercial objectives by leveraging the operated fleet capacity. We conclude with some implications for managers and practitioners as well as a discussion on limitations and future extensions of this study...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{container}} shipping {{has become}} increasingly important {{over the past few}} decades due to its obvious advantages, container shipping companies have faced various risks from different sources in their operations. Systematic academic studies on this topic are few; and in light of this, this study aims to systematically explore and analyse the risks in container shipping operations and to examine the applicable risk mitigation strategies in a logistics perspective, including information flow, physical flow, and payment flow. This thesis uses Taiwan container shipping industry as a case study, and borrows four steps of risk management as the main method, which includes risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation strategies identification, and strategies evaluation. In order to ensure the analysis is inclusive and systematic, risk factors and risk mitigation strategies are identified through a related literature review and are validated through a set of interviews. Risk analysis is conducted through using questionnaires, and then through risk ranking, risk matrix, risk mapping, and P-I graph. Risk mitigation strategies are evaluated through classic AHP and fuzzy AHP analysis. A number of significant findings have been obtained. Firstly, 35 risk factors are identified and classified into three categories: risks associated with information flow, risks associated with physical flow, and risks associated with payment flow. After collecting and analysing the risk-factor survey, the results indicate that the risk associated with physical flow has the more significant impact on shipping companies’ operation. However, one risk factor associated with information flow, “shippers hiding cargo information”, has the most significant impact among the 35 risk factors. Secondly, 20 risk mitigation strategies are identified and classified into three categories: intra-organisational strategies, intra-channel strategies, and inter-channel strategies. After collecting the AHP survey and analysing through classic AHP and fuzzy AHP, the result indicates that “slot exchange, <b>slot</b> <b>charter,</b> joint fleet, ship charter with other container shipping companies” is the most important strategy. The main contributions of this thesis include: (1) based on the literature review, there have been no research on risk management in the context of container shipping operation from a broad logistics perspective, and this thesis is the first attempt to fill this research gap; (2) this thesis uses Taiwan shipping industry as a case study to apply the framework, which generates useful managerial insights; (3) the conceptual model of risk management developed in this thesis can be applied to container shipping operations in other countries and regions; (4) compared with several studies using secondary data, this thesis uses empirical data to conduct the risk analysis, and make the results more close to the reality situation in container shipping; (5) in terms of risk analysis, this thesis ranks the total 35 risk factors rather than only identify the most important one, this can be used to be generalised to the whole container shipping companies in Taiwan, or even to the whole world; (6) in terms of risk management, the previous studies usually analyse only the importance of strategies. However, this thesis analyses the results of AHP from three different angles: reducing financial loss, reducing reputation loss, and reducing safety and security incident related loss. This can provide different angles for the managers who are considering different aspects...|$|E
30|$|Concurrently {{with the}} {{development}} of Liner Shipping Conferences, Vessel Sharing Agreements (VSAs) allowed ocean carriers to mutually cooperate through space sharing on larger vessels and provide schedule stability while reducing operational costs. Transport that would otherwise require each carrier to support a large fleet for all their sea-lanes on an individual basis could be rationalized to allow smaller lines in particular the ability to serve more destinations. This evolved into <b>slot</b> <b>chartering</b> agreements between two or more operators to ensure better economies of scale than container liner service performed individually (Cullinane and Khanna, 1999). VSAs typically were executed based on geographic coverage, port rotation, sailing frequency, the vessels in service, and participant’s share in vessel spaces. A distinction between VSAs and liner conferences is that in a VSA each operator carries out its own marketing identity; its own bills of lading, carriage and handling including port terminals and land transport (Karmelic, 2010). VSAs enabled rates to be established to stabilize the trade and cover some operating costs such as ocean terminal arrangements (McLean and Biles, 2008).|$|R
40|$|Shipping {{lines are}} under {{pressure}} to expand the geographical reach of their services and to invest in value added services. The former, addressed {{by a number of}} strategies including <b>slot</b> <b>charters,</b> alliances and mergers and acquisitions, has been quite widely treated in the literature. The ways in which the lines are enhancing the range of their services has been subject to less study and is the focus of this paper. Viewed {{within the context of the}} economics of vertical integration, the paper reviews the organisation strategies of lines in relation to terminal management, intermodal services and logistics services. There is only close integration with shipping in the management of dedicated terminals and intermodal services. With one exception, P&O Nedlloyd's Value Added Services, the management of logistics services remains ostensibly quite distinct from shipping. In terms of pricing practices, this is reality but it leaves uncertain the level and ways of sharing information and resources related to logistics. The interest of lines in developing new relationships with shippers will place further pressure on collective pricing practices in liner shipping.

50|$|Daytime {{international}} slots were allocated in October 2013. In {{the allocation}} among Japanese carriers, All Nippon Airways {{argued that it}} should receive more international slots than Japan Airlines due to JAL's recent government-supported bankruptcy restructuring, and ultimately won 11 daily slots to JAL's five. Nine daytime slot pairs remained unallocated and were intended {{to be used for}} service to the United States, but allocation talks were stalled as of January 2014, leading the Japanese government to release these <b>slots</b> for <b>charter</b> services to other countries through October 2014. The new daytime slots led to increased flight capacity between Tokyo and many Asian markets, but did not have a major effect on capacity between Japan and Europe, as several carriers simply transferred flights from Narita to Haneda (most notably ANA and Lufthansa services to Germany, which almost entirely shifted to Haneda). In an effort to combat this effect, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport gave non-binding guidance to airlines that any new route at Haneda should not lead to the discontinuation of a route at Narita, although it was possible for airlines to meet this requirement through cooperation with a code sharing partner (for instance, ANA moved its London flight to Haneda while maintaining a code share on Virgin Atlantic's Narita-London flight).|$|R
50|$|Fell Charter Elementary School {{opened in}} August 2002. It was {{originally}} chartered on August 1, 2002 {{for a period}} of five years by the Pennsylvania State Charter School Board of Appeals. Fell Charter Elementary School is currently chartered by the Carbondale Area School District. In Pennsylvania, public charter schools are initially approved and subsequently overseen by the local school board. Fell Charter Elementary school draws students from the following local public school districts: Carbondale Area School District, Forest City Regional School District, Lakeland School District, Mid Valley School District, Mountain View School District, Valley View School District, Wayne Highlands School District and Western Wayne School District. By law the school district must provide transportation to all schools that lie within 10 miles of the district's borders. Pennsylvania public charter schools have the same academic accountability as traditional public schools and must give the PSSAs to their pupils each year, working to achieve Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status. According to PA Charter School law, if more students apply to attend than there are open <b>slots</b> available, <b>Charter</b> Schools are required to use a random lottery system to select new incoming students. According to the Charter School law, siblings (brothers and sisters), and children of individuals who help establish a charter school, are granted an “admissions preference.” The Commonwealth bases the funding for charter schools on the principle that the state’s subsidies should follow the students, regardless of whether they choose to attend traditional public schools or charter schools. The Charter School Law also requires that charter schools bill each sending school district on a monthly basis for students attending the charter school.|$|R
40|$|Container {{lines have}} been the main {{transport}} mode linking most markets engaged in global trade. To cater for the growing customer demands, container lines have adopted various approaches such as forming strategic co-operations to achieve rapid growth and providing efficient services through the integration of resources. The spectrum of strategic co-operations among container lines varies from loose-knitted <b>slot</b> <b>charters,</b> liner conferences, shipping alliances, joint services and consortia, through to mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, these forms of strategic co-operations {{have not always been}} able to achieve the intended synergetic growth resulting from the integration of resources. The Resource Based View (RBV) suggests that integrating intangible resources, which are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (VRIN), can make a significant contribution to the performance of post strategic co-operations. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the contribution of intangible resources to the post strategic co-operation success of container lines. Therefore, the thesis focuses on the following primary research question (PRQ) : PRQ: Does the integration of intangible resources contribute to the post strategic co-operation success of container lines? To further examine PRQ two subsidiary research questions (SRQ 1 and SRQ 2) are explored. SRQ 1 : Which intangible resources provide the greatest contribution to the market success of container lines? SRQ 2 : Do container lines adopt processes to ensure the successful integration of intangible resources when strategic co-operations are being developed? The design used for this study is a two stage methodology enabling both quantative and qualitative research approaches. The two stage approach helps to identify firstly the senior managers‟ view of the importance of intangible resources and secondly how intangible resources are integrated during strategic co-operations among container lines. The sample consists of 84 senior managers (with a response rate of 51 per cent and thus 47 usable questionnaires) attached to regional offices of leading global container lines and their agents in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. The first stage was conducted via an exploratory mail survey with the objective of investigating senior managers‟ understanding of intangible resources, importantly, the findings of stage one enabled more probing questions to be developed and identified suitable respondents for the second stage of the research. Due to the need for more qualitative responses, stage two was conducted as in-person interviews, with a greater, focus on (i) the extent that intangible resources were being integrated, (ii) the processes adopted to integrate intangible resources, and (iii) the organisation and economic performance of container lines during post-strategic co-operation. The in-depth in-person interviews achieved 100 per cent response rate with participation of 36 senior managers. The findings of stage one, which addressed SRQ 1, revealed that respondents attach a higher importance to intangible resource items such as the reputation of the company, and organisational processes and capabilities. These intangible resources provide major benefits to container lines such as attracting customers and enabling internal functions of container lines including the closely related functions of marketing the services of the container lines. During the stage two in-person interviews, differences were found in how intangible resources were integrated among Limited integrated strategic co-operations (LISCs) (shipping alliances, joint services and consortia) and acquisitions. In LISCs, due to their loosely integrated structure and antitrust laws, sailing schedules have become the only closely integrated intangible resource. Other intangible resources such as organisational processes, capabilities and organisational culture are kept away from the strategic co-operations to gain competitive edge for the individual container lines. The integration of sailing schedules in LISCs has helped the container lines to increase the frequency of services, enter into new trade routes by reducing cost. In acquisitions, apart from sailing schedules intangible resources such as the capabilities and organisational processes of the acquirer container line are adopted by the new entity. The container lines adopted different processes such as organising staff meetings, mixed project teams, joint training sessions, and appointing task teams to integrate these intangible resources in acquisitions. However, colonising of the acquired container line with intangible resources of the acquirer container line and neglecting the important intangible resources of the acquired line has hindered the integration of acquired container line staff to the new entity. Hence, high staff turnover among senior managers was evident in all the acquisitions during the post-acquisition period. This top management turnover, especially in the marketing functions has adversely affected the intended synergetic growth of market share of these acquisitions. Thus, the two stage study helped address both PRQ and SRQ 2 by revealing that intangible resources are important to the market success of container lines, and container lines are advised to identify these intangible resources and adopt processes to integrate them when strategic co-operations are being formed...|$|R
