25|$|During <b>spermiogenesis,</b> the {{spermatids}} {{begin to}} form a tail by growing microtubules {{on one of the}} centrioles, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of centrosome reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{similarities}} in the protonephridial flame bulb, sperm and <b>spermiogenesis,</b> {{as well as the}} parasitic lifestyle, fecampiids were thought to be closely related to neodermatans, but molecular studies revealed them to be more closely related to triclads and prolecithophorans.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spermiogenesis</b> is {{the final}} stage of spermatogenesis, which sees the {{maturation}} of spermatids into mature, motile spermatozoa. The spermatid is a more or less circular cell containing a nucleus, Golgi apparatus, centriole and mitochondria. All these components take part in forming the spermatozoon.|$|E
50|$|Some {{possibly}} identified synapomorphies {{are found}} in the ultrastructure of the protonephridial system, but similar constructions exist in other groups.

50|$|Mitotic germ stem cells, spermatogonia, divide by mitosis {{to produce}} spermatocytes {{committed}} to meiosis. The spermatocytes divide by meiosis to form spermatids. The post-meiotic spermatids differentiate through <b>spermiogenesis</b> to become mature and functional spermatozoa.

50|$|Many {{of these}} {{characteristics}} are also shared with the tribe Compsurini in Cheirodontinae. Though unrelated, this group contains inseminating species with caudal organs. However, the caudal organs and other similar characteristics are structured differently. They also share the elongate cytoplasmic collar binding the flagellum to the elongate nucleus at some stage of <b>spermiogenesis,</b> which was previously assumed to be exclusive to glandulocaudines. These fish also occasionally have gill glands.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a protein}} {{belonging}} to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase family of enzymes that {{play an important role}} in carbohydrate metabolism. Like its somatic cell counterpart, this sperm-specific enzyme functions in a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent manner to remove hydrogen and add phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form 1,3-diphosphoglycerate. During <b>spermiogenesis,</b> this enzyme may {{play an important role in}} regulating the switch between different energy-producing pathways, and it is required for sperm motility and male fertility.|$|E
50|$|This gene {{represents}} one of several duplicated family members that are located on chromosome X.

5000|$|Testicular tissue-derived seipin is {{essential}} for male fertility by modulating testicular phospholipid homeostasis. The lack of seipin in germ cells results in complete male infertility and teratozoospermia. Spermatids devoid of seipin in germ cells are morphologically abnormal with large ectopic lipid droplets and aggregate in dysfunctional clusters. Elevated levels of phosphatidic acid accompanied with an altered ratio of polyunsaturated to monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids show impaired phospholipid homeostasis during <b>spermiogenesis</b> [...]|$|E
50|$|This {{gene product}} is a serine/threonine protein kinase that {{contains}} an N-terminal protein kinase domain that is structurally {{similar to the}} kinase domains of testis-specific protein kinase-1 and the LIM motif-containing protein kinases (LIMKs). Its overall structure is most related to the former, indicating that {{it belongs to the}} TESK subgroup of the LIMK/TESK family of protein kinases. This gene is predominantly expressed in testis and prostate. The developmental expression pattern of the rat gene in testis suggests an important role for this gene in meiotic stages and/or early stages of <b>spermiogenesis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Spermatozoa {{develop in}} the seminiferous tubules of the testes. During their {{development}} the spermatogonia proceed through meiosis to become spermatozoa. Many changes occur during this process: the DNA in nuclei becomes condensed; the acrosome develops as a structure close to the nucleus. The acrosome {{is derived from the}} Golgi apparatus and contains hydrolytic enzymes important for fusion of the spermatozoon with an egg cell. During <b>spermiogenesis</b> the nucleus condenses and changes shape. Abnormal shape change is a feature of sperm in male infertility.The acroplaxome is a structure found between the acrosomal membrane and the nuclear membrane. The acroplaxome contains structural proteins including keratin 5, F-actin and profilin IV.|$|E
50|$|Due to its progonadotropic {{effects in}} males, unlike CPA, {{cyproterone}} has been found, in male rodents, to increase testicular weight, increase {{the total number}} of type A spermatogonia, increase {{the total number of}} Sertoli cells, hyperstimulate the Leydig cells, and to have almost no effect on spermatogenesis. Conversely, it has also been reported for male rodents that <b>spermiogenesis</b> is inhibited and that accessory sexual gland weights (e.g., prostate gland, seminal vesicles) and fertility were markedly reduced, although with rapid recovery from the changes upon cessation of treatment. In any case, the drug is said to not be an effective antispermatogenic agent, whereas CPA is effective. Also unlike CPA, due to its lack of progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity, cyproterone does not suppress ovulation in women.|$|E
50|$|H2B histone type {{is known}} to have a limited number of {{variants}} at least in mammals, apicomplexa and sea urchins. H2B.1 is a testis, oocyte and zygote specific variant that forms subnucleosomal particles, at least, in spermatids. It can dimerize with H2A.L and H2A.1. H2B.W is involved in spermatogenesis, telomere associated functions in sperm and is found in spermatogenic cells. It is characterized by the extension of the N-terminal tail. subH2B participates in regulation of <b>spermiogenesis</b> and is found in non-nucleosomal particle in the subacrosome of spermatozoa. This variant has a bipartite nuclear localization signal.H2B.Z is an apicomplexan specific variant that {{is known to}} interact with H2A.Z. â€˜sperm H2Bâ€™ is a putative group that contains sperm H2B histones from sea and sand urchins and potentially is common for Echinacea. Recently discovered variant H2B.E is involved in the regulation of olfactory neuron function in mice.|$|E
50|$|Initiation of {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase II {{requires the}} activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of {{the remainder of the}} transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes a protein that serves the same function as TBP and substitutes for TBP at some promoters that are not recognized by TFIID. It is essential for <b>spermiogenesis</b> and believed to be important in expression of developmentally regulated genes.|$|E
5000|$|Due to insemination, {{the sperm}} of glandulocaudines has adapted. In many species, an {{elongate}} cytoplasmic collar binds the flagellum to the elongate nucleus at some stage of <b>spermiogenesis.</b> In almost all species, the sperm cell bodies are elongate. In the tribe Diapomini, the genus Planaltina expresses only round sperm (like that of externally fertilizing characins) and the genera Diapoma and Acrobrycon only express slightly elongated sperm; this may indicate a possible plesiomorphy. Some sperm have enlarged regions containing mitochondria, which may help in prolonging {{the life of}} the sperm while stored in the ovary. In some genera, sperm clumping and patterns of arrangement are observed in the sperm ducts and storage regions. In the tribes Xenobryconini (in the genera Tyttocharax, Scopaeocharax, and Xenurobrycon) and Glandulocaudini, there is a form of sperm packaging which would allow for a higher sperm density during transfer from the male to the female. These packets are called spermatozeugmata, and the sperm are packaged [...] to each other; this packaging is further increased by the elongation of the sperm cells. In Xenobryconini, each spermatozeugma is produced and is released fully formed in the spermatocysts, but in Glandulocaudini, the sperm is released from the spermatocysts and packaged elsewhere. The spermatozeugmata are situated in the posterior end of the testes, which serves as a storage area for sperm.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} how often <b>spermiogenesis</b> occurs in young male European bison up to 3 years old. Research was performed on sections of the testes and epididymes collected from 51 male bison aged 2 - 3 years. The animals were divided into 2 age groups: young males up to 2 years and young males up to 3 years old, with further separation into specimens with or without <b>spermiogenesis.</b> The animals were culled during the autumn-winter seasons in 1994 - 2008 (after rutting period) in the BialowieÅ¼a Primeval Forest. <b>Spermiogenesis</b> in the 2 -year-old animals was a rare condition found in 16. 7 % of cases. However, at the age of 3 years more than half of the individuals examined (53. 3 %) had <b>spermiogenesis.</b> Young males up to 2 years old with spermioge-nesis were characterized by a significantly higher body weight and their right testis also weighed more than the left testis of the animals without <b>spermiogenesis,</b> the difference being on the border of statistical significance. There was no significant differences in the body mass and weight of the left testis between older animals, up to 3 years old, with or without <b>spermiogenesis.</b> However, young males up to 3 years old with <b>spermiogenesis</b> were characterized by a significantly higher weight of the right testis than those without <b>spermiogenesis.</b> Key words: Bison bonasus, juveniles, frequency of <b>spermiogenesis,</b> body weight, testis weigh...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructure of a {{spermatid}} nucleus changes {{many times}} during <b>spermiogenesis.</b> Condensed chromatin forms irregular clusters during phases I-II, a continuous ring {{adjacent to a}} nuclear envelope during phases III-V and a network occupying the whole nucleus during phase VI. In advanced <b>spermiogenesis</b> dense chromatin disappears and short randomly positioned fibrils arise, then long parallel ones are found (phase VIII) which during phase IX form a lamellar structure. In mature spermatozoids (phase X) chromatin becomes extremely condensed. 3 H-arginine and 3 H-lysine incorporation into spermatids during 2 -min incubation is intensive during phases IN, decreases during phases VI, VII and becomes very low during phases VIII-IX. Capillary electrophoresis has shown that during Chara tomentosa <b>spermiogenesis</b> replacement of histones with basic proteins whose mobility is {{comparable to that of}} salmon protamines takes place. At the beginning of <b>spermiogenesis</b> core and linker histones are found in spermatids. During early <b>spermiogenesis</b> protamine-like proteins appear and their amount increases in late <b>spermiogenesis</b> when core histones are still present. In mature spermatozoids only protamine-like proteins represented by 3 fractions: 9. 1 kDa, 9. 6 kDa, 11. 2 kDa are found. Disappearance of linker histones following their modification precedes disappearance of core histones. The results indicate that dynamic rearrangement of chromatin ultrastructure and aminoacid incorporation rate during <b>spermiogenesis</b> are reflected in basic nuclear protein changes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spermiogenesis</b> is {{a dynamic}} process which {{includes}} organelle reorganization and new structure formation. The morphology and distribution of the mitochondria in germ cells change to accommodate the cellular requirement.

Energetic metabolism provides energy for cellular activity and influences sperm survival and motility directly. Ubiquitination of mitochondria takes place during <b>spermiogenesis,</b> which has been implicated in sperm quality control and mitochondrial inheritance. In light of the essential roles of mitochondria in energy production, calcium homeostasis and apoptosis, mitochondria dysfunction cause severe human diseases, such as male infertility.

40|$|The chronological {{formation}} {{and development of}} three rat spermatozoon head components - the nucleus, acrosomic system and perinuclear theca - were investigated by electron microscopy during <b>spermiogenesis</b> and transit through the epididymis. Chromatin condensation involves an intermediate step of coarse chromatin filament formation. Coarse filaments aggregate into coarse chromatin clumps which, in turn, fuse into a dense homogeneous mass late in <b>spermiogenesis.</b> The completely formed acrosomic system is composed of the acrosome and head cap, both enclosed in a continuous unit membrane, and a separated portion of the head cap called the ventral flap running on the antero-ventral part of the head. During <b>spermiogenesis,</b> the acrosome and head cap are formed as distinct morphological entities, and the ventral flap ls split off from the head cap during step 14 of <b>spermiogenesis.</b> Perinuclear material forms adjacent to the nucleus in three areas which eventually become connected. The material of this continuous layer condenses during the last steps 18 and 19 of <b>spermiogenesis</b> to form the perinuclear theca, a continuous layer over the nucleus except around the attachment site of the flagellum...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spermiogenesis</b> {{entails a}} major {{biochemical}} and morphological {{restructuring of the}} germ cell involving replacement of the somatic histones by protamines packing the DNA into the condensed spermatid nucleus and elimination of the cytoplasm during the elongation phase. We describe H 1 T 2, an histone H 1 variant selectively and transiently expressed in male haploid germ cells during <b>spermiogenesis.</b> In round and elongating spermatids, H 1 T 2 specifically localizes to a chromatin domain at the apical pole, revealing a polarity in the spermatid nucleus. Inactivation by homologous recombination shows that H 1 T 2 is critical for <b>spermiogenesis</b> as male H 1 t 2 â€“/â€“ mice have greatly reduced fertility. Analysis of <b>spermiogenesis</b> in H 1 t 2 mutant mice shows delayed nuclear condensation and aberrant elongation. As a result, mutant spermatids are characterized {{by the presence of}} residual cytoplasm, acrosome detachment, and fragmented DNA. Hence, H 1 T 2 is a protein required for proper cell restructuring and DNA condensation during the elongation phase of <b>spermiogenesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Spermiogenesis</b> in Chara algae, {{which has}} been divided into 10 phases (sp I-X), is similar to <b>spermiogenesis</b> in animals. The most {{important}} process during <b>spermiogenesis</b> in animals is remodeling of chromatin leading to "sleeping genome", being the result the exchange of histone proteins into protamine-like proteins. Cytochemical studies showed in both Chara species (C. vulgaris, C. tomentosa) that at spI-IV phases only histones were present, at spV-VIII phases [...] the amount of nuclear protamine-type proteins progressively increased and that of histones decreased while at spIX-X only pro-tamine-type proteins were present. This was also confirmed with capillar electrophoresis. In order to localize more precisely both histones and protamines the immunocytochemical studies {{with the use of}} anti-protamine antibodies (protamine-type proteins were obtained from C. tomentosa antheridia) and anti-histone H 3 antibodies, have been carried out. More specific immunocytochemical studies confirmed cytochemical results including the exchange of histones into protamine-type during <b>spermiogenesis</b> (spV-VIII) in both Chara species. At phase V <b>spermiogenesis</b> these strong strand-like anti-protamine signals were observed in cytoplasm which might suggest that protamine synthesis took place in ER...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructural data on {{spermatid}} characters during <b>spermiogenesis</b> are on {{the increase}} for reptiles, but are still relatively limited within squamates. A recent study compared Sceloporus bicanthalis to S. variabilis and found 8 character differences between these species that reside in the same genus. This study focuses on the events of <b>spermiogenesis</b> within an oviparous and seasonal mating lizard, Sceloporus aeneus. This lizard is the sister taxon to S. bicanthalis and thus we explored the question: do sibling species within a genus show differences in the ontogeny of <b>spermiogenesis?</b> Five lizards were collected in April 2012 from Toluca, Mexico. The testicular tissues were processed normally for TEM and analyzed to access the ultrastructural spermatid changes occurring during <b>spermiogenesis.</b> The present data were compared to the spermiogenic information available on the viviparous lizard, Sceloporus bicanthalis. Interestingly, few differences exist between S. bicanthalis and S. aeneus. Degrading and coiled myelin figures were visible within the developing acrosome, which are likely remnants of transport vesicles from the Golgi complex. Acrosome and subacrosome granules are present during early <b>spermiogenesis.</b> During late <b>spermiogenesis,</b> an electron lucent line, the acrosome lucent ridge, between the subacrosomal space and the acrosomal medulla was observed in S. aeneus spermatids, which has been mentioned in other squamates but not accurately described. Our study suggests that <b>spermiogenesis</b> may be more conserved in sibling taxa within a genus.

40|$|The body of ultrastructural data on {{spermatid}} characters during <b>spermiogenesis</b> {{continues to}} grow in reptiles, but is still relatively limited within the squamates. This study focuses on the ontogenic events of <b>spermiogenesis</b> within a viviparous and continually spermatogenic lizard, from high altitude in Mexico. Between the months of June and August, testicular tissues were collected from eight spermatogenically active bunchgrass lizards (Sceloporus bicanthalis) from Nevado de Toluca, MÃ©xico. The testicular tissues were processed for transmission electron microscopy and analyzed to access the ultrastructural differences between spermatid generations during <b>spermiogenesis.</b> Interestingly, few differences exist between S. bicanthalis <b>spermiogenesis</b> when compared with what has been described for other saurian squamates. Degrading and coiling membrane structures similar to myelin figures were visible within the developing acrosome that are likely remnants from Golgi body vesicles. During <b>spermiogenesis,</b> an electron lucent area between the subacrosomal space and the acrosomal medulla was observed, which has been observed in other squamates but not accurately described. Thus, we elect to term this region the acrosomal lucent ridge.

40|$|Translational control plays a {{key role}} in late <b>spermiogenesis.</b> A number of mRNAs {{encoding}} proteins required for late <b>spermiogenesis</b> are expressed in early spermatids but are stored as translationally inactive messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). The translation of these mRNAs is associated with shortening of their poly(A) tail in late <b>spermiogenesis.</b> Poly(A) -binding protein (Pabp) plays an important role in mRNA stabilization and translation. Three Pabp-interacting proteins, Paip 1, Paip 2 a, and Paip 2 b, have been described. Paip 2 a is expressed in late spermatids. To investigate the role of Paip 2 in <b>spermiogenesis,</b> we generated mice with knockout of either Paip 2 a or Paip 2 b and double-KO (DKO) mice lacking both Paip 2 a and Paip 2 b. Paip 2 a-KO and Paip 2 a/Paip 2 b-DKO mice exhibited male infertility. Translation of several mRNAs encoding proteins essential to male germ cell development was inhibited in late <b>spermiogenesis</b> in Paip 2 a/Paip 2 b-DKO mice, resulting in defective elongated spermatids. Inhibition of translation in Paip 2 a/Paip 2 b-DKO mice was caused by aberrant increased expression of Pabp, which impaired the interaction between eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E) and the cap structure at the 5 â€² end of the mRNA. We therefore propose a model whereby efficient mRNA translation in late <b>spermiogenesis</b> occurs at an optimal concentration of Pabp, a condition not fulfilled in Paip 2 a/Paip 2 b-DKO mice...|$|E
