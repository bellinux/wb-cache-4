50|$|Joseph Jordania {{suggested}} that in human evolutionary history collective identity was {{crucial for the}} physical survival of hominids and early humans. As individual hominids were too weak and slow to survive predators on their own, in the moments most critical to survival (predator attacks, combat situations, mortal danger) humans enter the {{altered state of consciousness}} where they do not feel fear and pain, do not question the behavior of other members of their group, and are ready to sacrifice their lives for evolution's more important <b>super-ordinate</b> goals (i.e. survival of the children or the group). Humans sometimes do not have memory of these critical moments. Absence of stressful memories is known as psychogenic amnesia. According to Jordania, human ability to follow the rhythm in big groups, to sing together in harmony, to dance for many hours and enter the ecstatic state, as well as the tradition of body painting, were all the parts of the first universal rituals. These were primarily developed as the means to synchronize each individual group-member's neural activity (through the release of neuro-chemicals), in order to reach the state of collective identity, also known as transcendence. In this state the survival needs of the group can override the instincts of individual survival.|$|E

This qualitative study followed an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach to explore the community services nurses’ experiences of health care services at Tshwane district public hospital. Data were collected from 11 purposively selected community service nurses using a semi-structured interview format. Data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis framework for data analysis.

However, literature suggests {{a positive relationship between}} R/S and psychological health, and ethical guidelines encourage healthcare professionals to accommodate the client’s religious and spiritual beliefs in their therapy. Despite the guidelines, little is known of how psychological therapists deliver R/S accommodative therapy in practice. The focus of this project is to explore the experiences of psychological therapists engaged in therapy that is R/S accommodative. Part One: Critical Literature Review: The literature review explored qualitative research on psychological therapists’ experiences of addressing R/S in therapy, in order to better understand how R/S integration might lead to improved treatment outcomes. Twenty-two papers were identified, critically appraised and analysed using thematic analysis. One core theme: Integrating R/S into Therapy, and five <b>super-ordinates</b> themes; The conceptualisation of R/S; Approaches to R/S material; Conditions for integration; Overcoming challenges; and Learning to integrate, emerged from the data. The review highlighted the need for an awareness of how therapist and client related factors impact the process of R/S accommodative therapy and potential outcomes. Research implications are discussed including the need for more robust studies.

Twenty-three subjects saw 360 words belonging to six sub-ordinate categories (mammals, birds, fish, fruit, flowers, trees) within two <b>super-ordinate</b> categories (fauna, flora). Visually evoked magnetic fields were determined from whole-head (148 -sensor) magnetoencephalography and analyzed in the source space (Minimum Norm Estimate). Results Activity (MNE amplitudes) 100 – 150 ms after stimulus onset in the left occipito-temporal area distinguished <b>super-ordinate</b> categories, while later activity (300 – 550 ms) in the left temporal area distinguished the six sub-ordinate categories.

40|$|Preparing a {{multi-purpose}} lexicon {{requires a}} systematic analysis of inter-conceptual relations. These relations are of two types, namely (i) syntactic and (ii) semantic, which can further be decomposed to capture the greater explanatory adequacy. But {{the exploration of the}} lexical structure becomes intricate because of the hidden dynamics of the context; since traditionally, language has been viewed as a totality of lexicon and computation system, and major emphasis has been given to the designing of the computational system, considering the designing of the lexicon internal domain ontology as a mere metaphysical game, when in reality it is a serious epistemic concern, because of having the capacity of licensing inferences. Therefore a lexical level representation should have enough scope to incorporate the contextual information. Designing domain ontology is important since it tells us about the conceptual constellation within the coherent whole of which the related terms are meaningful. Isolating a term from the corresponding constellation will results into the evaporation of meaning. Furthermore it provides the basis, upon which the entire linguistic structure rests. If so, then how is it possible to construct a lexicon, by divorcing the ontological issues? And at the same time, ontology by itself is not enough, again because of the reason that the higher order typifications of those (grounded) concepts and their corresponding interrelations among the types ultimately results into the consequent <b>super-ordinating</b> levels, containing the syntactic information pertinent to a symbol manipulating system. In this paper I would show that the representation of a lexical structure, should include both kind of information which are pertinent to the closed class and as well as the open class semantics, on the basis of examples, cited from English and Bengali...|$|R

40|$|Schema {{therapy was}} {{developed}} {{as a treatment for}} chronic and entrenched psychological difficulties, and has progressed to be used as an offence focused intervention that addresses dynamic risk factors. This thesis investigated the lived experiences of people with diagnoses of personality disorder who had offended and who had used the technique of imagery in schema therapy. This was explored because although the literature around schema therapy demonstrates some support for the effectiveness of schema therapy holistically, the individual components of this therapy have not been explored. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis is felt to be an appropriate methodology to address this gap in the literature as it explored imagery from the perspective of those who had experienced it and also acknowledged the researcher‟s influence in co-constructing the understanding of the experience. This methodology allowed for a starting point of knowledge by beginning to develop an understanding of this area which could potentially inform future research. Semistructured interviews were conducted with six people diagnosed with Personality Disorder, who had offended and who had used imagery in schema therapy. Their experiences were explored using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Throughout analysis a metaphor of life as a journey on which one carries carry emotional baggage resonated and themes were named accordingly. An overarching theme of the life journey (as temporal) enveloped three <b>super-ordinate</b> themes of opening the suitcase (revisiting trauma), unpacking and ordering the contents (therapeutic processes), and closing the suitcase (therapeutic outcomes). The <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of opening the suitcase incorporated a subordinate theme of reconnecting with the childhood self which overlapped with the <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of unpacking and ordering the contents. The <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of unpacking and ordering the contents included three subordinate themes, 1) emotional control (i. e. attempts to control emotions isolate people from others, but losing control of emotions during imagery leads to interpersonal connectedness with the therapist), 2) moving on versus being stuck in the past and 3) the therapeutic relationship as characterized by trust, and meeting needs. The second of these subordinate themes was felt to overlap with the <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of closing the suitcase. The <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of closing the suitcase was felt to contain two subordinate themes of healing the fractured self and applying what has been learned. All three <b>super-ordinate</b> themes were penetrated by another theme; distancing from the trauma (protection from emotional pain). This theme was felt to be embedded within descriptions of revisiting the trauma, re-connecting with the childhood self, emotional control, the therapeutic relationship, healing the fractured self and applying what has been learned. Two other minor themes were also identified relating to use of professional language and avoidance. It was concluded that for the six participants in this study, imagery was described as a process that enabled them to close the suitcase and put it away without fear that its contents would be unintentionally disgorged. These results represent the first qualitative exploration of people's lived experiences of imagery in schema therapy. The results add to the literature around both schema therapy and imagery separately. Although these results are not generalisable, they may be transferable to other groups that have topographically similar experiences and therefore they offer a new way to understand imagery in schema therapy...|$|E

Abstract: In {{this study}} the {{experiences}} of business coaches of becoming and being a coach were explored through the weaving together of three inter-related ‘texts’: Firstly, the research participants’ experiences of becoming and being a business coach and how these were couched {{in their own words}} and expressions, exemplifying or suggesting metaphors and metaphorical thinking. Secondly, the metaphors and metaphorical thinking that the participants’ experiences, words and expressions evoked in the researcher as a trainee coach; and, thirdly, the connections between these metaphors and those that appear or were suggested in the body of knowledge on business coaching. The inter-relationship of the three “texts” constituted the research question, including the specific research objectives emanating from it. The research study was conducted within a qualitative research paradigm and the research strategy used was that of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). The application of IPA yielded four main metaphors: Firstly, the business coach as Proteus, underpinned by two <b>super-ordinate</b> themes (the role of the coach and the coaching space) and supported by four emergent metaphorical themes (the coach as time-traveller; as container; as bearer; and as creator of spaces). Secondly, the business coach as Nomad underpinned by the <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of the position of the coach, and supported by seven emergent metaphorical themes (the coach as insider; as outsider; borderlines, boundaries and bridges in coaching; coaching as diving deep; a bird’s eye view in coaching; being on a knife’s edge and the blind spot). Thirdly, the metaphor of a Cup of Tea, underpinned by the <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of the business coach’s self-care, and supported by five emergent metaphorical themes (cleansing, exhaustion, physical ailments, nourishment and boundaries).

40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years {{psychological}} therapy {{for people with}} Intellectual Disabilities (ID) has been increasingly advocated (e. g., Linington, 2002) and successful treatment outcomes of psychological therapies for this population have been highlighted {{in a number of}} studies (e. g., Beail, 1998). However, the processes underlying these successful treatments are uncertain and some authors argue that success could be attributed to person-centred counselling rather than the specific approach adopted (e. g., Beail, 1998). Current literature highlights a substantial gap and an increasing need for research that identifies conditions under which the effects of therapy are optimised for people with ID through the exploration of barriers and facilitators to positive therapeutic change. This thesis explored the experiences of Clinical Psychologists (CPs), their clients with an ID and the client’s carers, with regards to the perceived barriers and facilitators to positive therapeutic change. Furthermore, this research aimed to develop a cohesive understanding from the multiple perspectives of the topic area. A triadic case design was utilised in which two triads of the CP, clients with ID and carers were nested by one CP. Therefore one ‘case’ constituted one CP, two of their clients (with ID) and two carers. Three of these cases were recruited and therefore this study had 15 participants and as the CPs were interviewed twice (once regarding each client separately) 18 interviews were completed. Thematic analysis was deemed to be an appropriate methodology to address the gap in qualitative research with people with ID. This methodology allowed the exploration of participant’s accounts whilst enabling the flexibility that is required to accommodate the varied abilities of people with ID. From the analysis of the transcripts of the 18 semi-structured interviews, five <b>super-ordinate</b> themes and one central theme were identified based on their frequency and salience from participants across all three participant groups. The first <b>super-ordinate</b> theme, ‘what the client brings’ encapsulated a number of factors related to the client that participants perceive to be initial barriers within therapy, namely, the ID itself (e. g., communication skills, memory) and the client’s engagement in therapy. A second <b>super-ordinate</b> theme that the client also brings to therapy is their ‘wider system’. This theme encompasses the facilitating role that a wider support network can play and also the barriers that the wider system can bring with regards to the negative influence of others on the client. A third <b>super-ordinate</b> theme related to ‘therapy factors’ that are generally perceived to be facilitators to overcome the barriers that clients bring to therapy. This included therapy adaptations and the therapeutic relationship. The fourth <b>super-ordinate</b> theme, namely ‘the mental health GP’ encompasses the concept that psychologists are required to coordinate the often extensive wider system of people with ID and this is because participants felt that in order to benefit from individual therapy, all of the client’s needs must be met, including physical health needs and ensuring that the client lives in an appropriate environment. Given the four <b>super-ordinate</b> themes noted above, all of these concepts foster the fifth <b>super-ordinate</b> theme ‘systemic dependency’. The mere presence of an ID means that naturally people are more dependent on others. As a result, therapy factors including the therapeutic relationship and adaptations to therapy (e. g., increased longevity of therapy) can foster strong attachments which can facilitate an unhelpful level of dependency. Additionally, the client’s wider system can also become dependent on services to help them facilitate care and coordinate the numerous services involved. All of these <b>super-ordinate</b> themes maintain the concept of the ‘revolving door’ into services. Additional subthemes noted in the extended paper are examples of barriers and facilitators to therapeutic change that are considered to have an important impact on therapy but were only noted by one group of participants (e. g., clients) and thus did not contribute to cohesive understanding of multiple perspectives aimed for within the journal paper. For example, clients reported confidentiality to be a barrier and CPs reported attachment difficulties of clients to be a barrier. The results of this study offer the first explorations of conditions under which therapy can be optimised for people with an ID through the awareness of barriers and facilitators to positive therapeutic outcomes. CPs are shown to be skilled at overcoming barriers within therapy; however there appeared to be a process of facilitators creating more barriers within therapy and the phenomenon of the revolving door needs to be fully considered. Given the potential impact of funding constraints on the role of CPs and access to psychological therapies for people with ID, this has important implications for the way psychologists working within this population market themselves and further evidence their work...|$|E
40|$|Where is the Person in Symptom Cluster Research? The Experience of Symptom Clusters in Patients with Advanced Lung Cancer This thesis {{describes}} a three-year qualitative study which {{aimed to explore}} the experience of symptom clusters in patients with advanced lung cancer. The study employed a patient-focused approach utilising Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (Smith et al. 2009 a). This methodology (IPA), informed by a contextual constructionist stance, was selected to explore the experience of symptom clusters, for its focus on the lived experience, the context and meanings which surround such experiences and its idiographic approach. Ten patients (a sample size which is the upper limit {{of the number of}} participants advocated for studies employing IPA (Smith et al. 2009 b;Reid et al. 2005;Smith and Osborn 2004)) with advanced lung cancer took part in the study and data were collected using unstructured, in-depth interviews at two time points: on recruitment and three to five weeks later. Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, within the framework advocated by Smith and Osborn (2003). The study generated interesting and significant findings. The experience of symptom clusters in patients with advanced lung cancer was characterised by two <b>super-ordinate</b> themes: ‘The lived experience of symptom clusters and the role of context and meaning’ and ‘Symptom clusters and loss of sense of self’. The <b>super-ordinate</b> theme of ‘The lived experience of symptom clusters and the role of context and meaning’ in the first instance, illustrates that {{the participants in this study}} were experiencing symptom clusters and providing detail on the components, nature and patterning of the symptom clusters reported, particularly the way that one or two salient symptoms were commonly highlighted from all the other symptoms experienced. This <b>super-ordinate</b> theme also demonstrates the core role that context and meaning play in the lived experience of symptom clusters, with many of the participants in this study framing their experiences of symptom clusters within a fear of death, stigma and loss of sense of self. The second <b>super-ordinate</b> theme informing this thesis is ‘Symptom clusters and loss of sense of self’. This <b>super-ordinate</b> theme illustrates the impact of symptom clusters on the participants’ lives, and how this, in turn, impacted on their sense of self in a number of different ways. For some, their sense of self was compromised by the concurrent symptoms that they were experiencing, as they prevented them from undertaking roles and activities that they were accustomed to in the past. This <b>super-ordinate</b> theme also highlights the role of the body relative to the self, and describes how the participants’ sense of self was transiently lost during periods when they experienced symptom clusters of high severity. The findings presented also demonstrate the knock-on effect of loss of sense of self experienced, with the participants feeling like they were a burden due to their incapacitation, and at times hiding the multiple symptoms that they were experiencing, in a bid to protect their loved ones from their illness. In light of the loss of sense of self experienced, this <b>super-ordinate</b> theme also demonstrates how the participants employed various strategies in a bid to try and maintain a coherent and valued sense of self. The findings presented illustrate how the use of IPA facilitated the collection of data that provided an in-depth understanding of the complexity of the experience of symptom clusters in patients with advanced lung cancer, adding a unique contribution to this body of knowledge. The results of this study highlight the limitations of definitions that currently underpin the study of symptom clusters in patients with cancer and the current empirical base to date, particularly the way that they do not acknowledge the core role that context and meaning play in the lived experience of this phenomenon. This lack of recognition of these core elements of the patient experience of symptom clusters poses the risk of this body of research producing data that have limited relevance to the patient and therefore clinical practice. It is therefore proposed that the study of symptom clusters in patients with cancer needs to move away from the reductionist approach which currently dominates and to broaden its scope, to one that acknowledges the complexity of the experience of symptom clusters, the core role that context and meaning play in such experiences, and contributions that patient experience can make in advancing this important and emerging body of research...|$|E

The main thrust {{of the study is}} continuing debates on how cross-functional teamwork contributes to project management performance: on-time, on-budget, and on-purpose. The level of influence was observed based on six critical factors: the clarity of <b>super-ordinate</b> goals, conformity of project team members to organization rules and procedures, physical proximity of each project team members, accessibility of project team members, knowledge sharing amongst project team members, and fairness of selection process of the project team members. The study uses combination of survey and case studies approach to answer such complex question. Samples were driven from 44 healthcare projects under the coordination of Health Department in East Java involving 88 respondents in the study. The hierarchical regression analysis was then used to explain major antecedents of cross-functional teamwork on the performance of project management. The study concludes that successful project management accounts multi-dimensional issues. The clarity of <b>super-ordinate</b> goals and physical proximity of team members have positive and significant influence in the performance of cross-functional teamwork.

These were discussed in relation to the known difficulties encountered by those with bvFTD. ‘Bewilderment’ reflected the feelings of the participants from the start of their dementia journey and was divided into two main themes (1) ‘Awareness of change: What’s the problem?: Awareness of changes in behaviour or lifestyle, and (2) Threats to self: This is not me: Changes in behaviour or lifestyle which negatively impact on their sense of self. The second <b>super-ordinate</b> theme, ‘Relationships with others’, reflected difficulties with social relationships and comprised two main themes (1) ‘Family and friends: Things haven’t changed… but do I say anything wrong?’: Paradox between feeling their relationships were unchanged but an awareness that something was not as it were previously, and (2) Coping with threats to self: Blame others or just avoid them: Ways participants sought to cope...|$|E
40|$|A body of {{research}} has focused on exploring educational attainment and links between outcomes {{from one generation to the}} next, with a complex array of factors revealed. One influential factor linked to outcomes is the aspirations that parents have about school for their children. Research to date however has provided only limited insight into the ways parents, or mothers in particular view school for their child, based on their own experiences. This study aimed to understand more about what a negative school experience meant to a group, mothers of children 3 years and under. It also sought to elicit their views about their children’s schooling. Through a process of interpretative phenomenological analysis of the semi-structured interviews, this study identified factors that served to help and support them around their school days, and what could potentially help them gain more confidence in their children’s education. The key <b>super-ordinate</b> theme to emerge was the power of their negative experience to cloud what was positive about their school days. What became apparent was the degree to which for three mothers, this centred on persistent, inescapable bullying. Additional factors (and sub-themes) identified included: being ignored and left to get on with learning; not being heard by teachers and parents; and the power of all these negative experiences to undermine confidence, self-worth and future pathways in life. However, an additional <b>super-ordinate</b> theme focused on positive factors that had helped them cope in school. Two further <b>super-ordinate</b> themes identified the conflicting emotions felt about school for their child, and how they had given great thought to the future education of their children. Within these factors emerged a strong desire for them to have a different, more enjoyable experience of school and how they considered their role to be a protective influence in their lives. This thesis offers an insight into the ways educational professionals, including psychologists, can provide support to parents with negative school experiences, helping to build confidence and trust in a positive future for their children in school...|$|E

This dissertation provides a qualitative view of the experience of consumer dissatisfaction with legal services in Manhattan, NY. An interpretative phenomenological analysis using semi-structured interviews was used to examine the dissatisfaction experiences of four participants. The analysis resulted in five <b>super-ordinate</b> themes and their accompanying sub-themes. The <b>super-ordinate</b> themes are: (a) disconfirmation of expectations leads to alienation, (b) rationalizing disconfirmation experience, (c) resisting alienation by developing coping mechanisms, (d) psychological reactions, and (e) desire for measures that would confirm expectations. The study used existing literature to clarify the results, and make recommendations. Information from this study could provide direction to the New York State legislature and to the legal profession as a whole, as to how to respond to the complex phenomenon of consumer dissatisfaction with legal services...|$|E
40|$|Lifetime home {{standards}} (LTHS) are a set {{of standards}} aimed at making homes more accessible. Previous research, however, indicates that LTHS do not adequately {{meet the needs of}} those with sensory impairments. Now, with visual impairment set to increase globally and acknowledging the recognised link between quality of dwelling and wellbeing, this article aims to examine the experiences of visually impaired people living in lifetime homes. The objectives are to investigate existing lifetime homes and to identify whether LTHS meet occupants’ needs. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out with six visually impaired people living in homes designed to LTHS in Northern Ireland. Collected data was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis identifying three <b>super-ordinate</b> themes: (1) living with visual impairment; (2) design considerations and (3) coping strategies. A core theme of balance between psychological and physical needs emerged through interconnection of <b>super-ordinate</b> themes. Although there are benefits to living in lifetime homes, negative aspects are also apparent with occupants employing several coping strategies to overcome difficulties. Whilst residents experience negative emotions following visual impairment diagnoses, results suggest that occupants still regard their homes as key places of security and comfort in addition to then highlighting the need for greater consideration of specific individual needs within general guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Transitions {{such as the}} {{one between}} primary and {{secondary}} education are viewed as having a significant impact, socially, academically and psychologically, however, transition to further education at 16 is an under-researched domain. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain an in-depth understanding of how young people experience their transition into a school-based sixth form as incomers. This was addressed through analysing semi-structured interviews using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and, via this process, <b>super-ordinate</b> and sub-ordinate themes were identified. Three emerging <b>super-ordinate</b> themes evolved from the analysis: the importance of social inclusion; intrapersonal factors; and academic demands relating to A Level study. The results from the study were found to be consistent with existing psychological theories and literature. This current study found that social connections were important, as well as the constructs of belonging and identity. It was also found, that in the sixth form, the academic workload and expectations imposed time constraints on extra- curricular activities and part time work, for the participants in the study. The findings of the current study suggest several implications for EP practice and for teachers at school- based sixth forms regarding supporting the transition for incomers, socially, psychologically and academically. Suggestions for further research are included...|$|E

Scores from 300 college students were sub-jected to maximum-likelihood confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). A first-order model consisting of eight correlated factors and a second-order model consisting of two <b>super-ordinate</b> factors and eight first-order factors were tested. The results of the analyses indi-cated that the first-order correlated model was the best fit for the data. The English-language version of the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire can be used to measure eight correlated yet theoretically unique dimensions of temperament...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the subjective experiences of physical activity for individuals with cystic fibrosis. The health-care team, at an Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit in the United Kingdom, recruited 12 participants to take part. Interview data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. A central theme of ‘self-monitoring’ emerged from the accounts and was embedded in the three <b>super-ordinate</b> themes...|$|E

Concepts of adjectives are distributed by SOM (Self-Organizing map) whose feature vectors are calculated by MI (Mutual Information). For the SOM obtained, we make tight clusters from map nodes, calculated by cosine. In addition, the number of tight clusters obtained by cosine was increased using map nodes and Japanese thesaurus. As a result, the number of extended clusters of concepts was 149 clusters. From the map, we found 8 adjectival clusters in <b>super-ordinate</b> level and some tendencies of similar and dissimilar clusters. ...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyCurriculum and Instruction ProgramsLawrence C. ScharmannBradley A. ShawSpanish {{instructors}} are not neo-phobic of instructional technology (IT), {{and they will}} affirm they are not afraid of IT just to avoid being labeled as ‘living dinosaurs. ’ Most of them just {{do not have the}} know-how to explore and use IT in-depth. Regardless, they are more familiar with the diverse IT world available. In this study the main factors influencing Spanish language educators to use IT (or not) in their Second Language Acquisition (SLA) teaching methodology were discussed. Data from Spanish instructors in eight Kansas universities was analyzed to understand their perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of IT in their classrooms. Mixed methodologies were used: A quantitative survey targeting 80 instructors from the Modern Language Departments was developed. The survey had one section on demographic information and a second with 43 items dealing with perceptions related to IT. Afterwards, a case study with four in-depth interviews was conducted to elucidate richer descriptions and potentially corroborate patterns identified from the survey data. Data analysis revealed that most Spanish instructors have positive perceptions and attitudes towards IT. From the survey, nine themes emerged. Six of them formed a <b>super-ordinate</b> category showing that instructors consider IT useful for teaching culture in the target language, and in facilitating general knowledge. In this <b>super-ordinate</b> category, the six emergent themes are considered subordinate themes. The other three emergent themes formed another <b>super-ordinate</b> category with three subordinate themes: faculty require more time, training and technical resources to be able to integrate IT in their teaching. The four interviews explored what perceptions (or characteristics) stand out among faculty along a continuum of non-users to users with respect to the integration of IT; this allowed the researcher to confirm the instructors’ perceptions and attitudes on the nine emerging themes. Spanish instructors would integrate more modern tools in their teaching if they had more opportunities and support to be better informed; received appropriate training in their specific field; and were advised of available technology. As the findings showed, educators are no longer afraid of technology. Finally, conclusions of the findings were offered as well as recommendations for future research...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{emphasis}} on the application of evidence based practice (EBP) together with an increasing pressure on Local Authorities (LAs) to demonstrate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the services that they fund has lead {{to the introduction of}} evaluative tools across many of the public services. Distance Travelled Tools (DTTs) are considered to be a useful measure of progress made over time in response to an intervention and can therefore be used to provide this kind of evidence. A semi-rural LA in England developed a DTT for use across the services for children and young people. The implementation of the tool as part of the work undertaken by practitioners represented a significant change in practice. In this study I explored the perceptions and experiences of mainstream primary and secondary school staff in the implementation of this DTT. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with twenty members of staff from eight mainstream education settings (five primary and three secondary). I transcribed the interviews verbatim and analysed them using thematic analysis. The analysis revealed two <b>super-ordinate</b> themes, six themes and 25 sub-themes, which shed light on staff’s experiences of applying the DTT. The first <b>super-ordinate</b> theme relates to the perceptions of staff regarding their use of the DTT to their work, specifically: in supporting holistic working; in enabling staff to elicit, share and understand the perspectives of stakeholders; and to formulate and support next steps. The second <b>super-ordinate</b> theme relates to school staff’s experiences of implementing the tool, including: the issues associated with the tool’s format; specific motivators and difficulties associated with the process of implementation; and the utility of the tool as a means of providing evidence for the LA. In highlighting the experiences and perceptions of the tool’s users, this study has implications for the application of this type of tool in supporting the work undertaken by a range of practitioners who work with vulnerable pupils and their families. By exploring the perceived issues and benefits of implementing a DTT, this study also has implications for the work undertaken by Educational Psychologists to support organisational change associated with the implementation of new evaluative procedures and practices. ...|$|E
