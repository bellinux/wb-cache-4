50|$|All <b>stratovolcanoes</b> and shield volcanoes have a {{tendency}} to form a cone at the surface. However, <b>stratovolcanoes</b> are able to form steeper sides whilst shield volcanoes only form very flat cones. The {{reason for this is that}} <b>stratovolcanoes</b> are composed largely of solid, eruptive material, whereas shield volcanoes are built up mainly by fluid lava flows.|$|R

The mountain is located 6 km west of Acamarachi (also known as Cerro de Pili) and 12.5 km north of the Aguas Calientes (Simbad) and Lascar <b>stratovolcanoes.</b>|$|R
5|$|From 600,000 to 400,000years ago, eruptions built a large conical <b>stratovolcano</b> called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) {{in what is}} now the {{southwest}} corner of the park. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and tephra (volcanic ash, breccia, and pumice) with increasing amounts of tephra with elevation.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams, {{known by}} some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat, is a {{potentially}} active <b>stratovolcano</b> in the Cascade Range. Although Adams has not erupted {{in more than}} 1,000years, it is not considered extinct. It is the second-highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington, after Mount Rainier.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering <b>stratovolcano,</b> Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E

All three volcanoes are part of the Oregon High Cascades, a range that sections off the stratovolcanoes of Oregon that are younger than 3.5million years. The High Cascades include Mount Jefferson, the Three Sisters, Broken Top, and other stratovolcanoes and remnants.|$|E
5|$|Goat Rocks is an extinct <b>stratovolcano</b> in the Cascade Range, {{located between}} Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in {{southern}} Washington, in the United States. Part of the Cascade Volcanoes, it {{was formed by}} the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under {{the western edge of}} the North American Plate. The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago. Throughout its complex eruptive history, volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous, mafic activity.|$|E
5|$|Sangay (also {{known as}} Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) {{is an active}} <b>stratovolcano</b> in central Ecuador. It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting only three times in {{recorded}} history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.|$|E

50|$|The {{region has}} been heavily {{affected}} by volcanism, including large ignimbrites and <b>stratovolcanoes</b> extending into Chile. Volcanic rocks include andesite, dacite and rhyodacite {{with the former}} dominating in the Chilean <b>stratovolcanoes</b> and the latter in the ignimbrites. The dry regional climate {{means that there is}} little erosion and that volcanic centres are well conserved. The surface covered by volcanic rocks amounts to about 300000 km2.|$|R

5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent. Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the <b>stratovolcano.</b> Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying <b>stratovolcano</b> and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex <b>stratovolcano</b> located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E

50|$|Lanín is the easternmost volcano of a north-west {{south-east}} oriented {{chain of}} 3 large <b>stratovolcanoes</b> volcanoes, Villarrica being the westernmost volcano and Quetrupillán {{the one in}} the middle. This alignment is attributed to the existence a fault beneath the volcanoes. In historical times Lanín has been the least active of these volcanoes. Apart from Quetrupillán and Villarrica there a number of old eroded remains of <b>stratovolcanoes</b> in the alignment.|$|R
5000|$|... 4) Since {{the late}} Pliocene, {{the style and}} {{composition}} of volcanism in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt became more diverse. In several areas, volumetrically dominant calc-alkaline rocks are associated with modest volumes of intraplate-like lavas or other potassium rich rocks, accompanied by Quaternary rhyolitic peralkaline rocks. This modern arc consists of a frontal belt dominated by flux and slab melting and a rear belt characterized by the differentiated rocks stated previously. Absent since ~9 Ma, <b>stratovolcanoes</b> began to be created in the last 1 Ma ~100 km behind the volcanic front in the Western Sector, oriented West - Northwest and East - Southeast. In the eastern sector, all <b>stratovolcanoes</b> are found within the volcanic front. One exception {{to the location of}} these <b>stratovolcanoes</b> is the Colima volcanic complex, which is positioned south of the southern tip of the Cocos and Rivera slab tear and is the largest volcanic edifice in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. In addition to <b>stratovolcanoes,</b> monogenetic volcanic fields are also characteristic for this episode, the most prominent being the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field.|$|R
5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, <b>stratovolcano</b> in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major {{highways}} pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to get closer to the mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.|$|E
