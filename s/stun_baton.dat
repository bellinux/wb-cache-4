Lonnie Machin is introduced as [...] "Anarky" [...] {{as early as}} his first appearance in Detective Comics No.608, withholding his origin story for a later point. He is established as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent twelve-year-old. The debut story of the character failed to provide a back story to explain his behavior, but a narrative from Batman reveals {{that he is a}} socially conscious and arrogant child who believes he knows how to solve societies' problems. Convinced that only he can do so, he becomes a vigilante and fashions weapons—a <b>stun</b> <b>baton</b> and smoke bombs—in labs at school. Lonnie Machin made his debut as [...] "Anarky" [...] by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water. He goes to lengths to disguise his age and appearance by creating a costume with a false head to increase his height. This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing Anarky to be an adult. Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child. During this first confrontation, Anarky is aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who becomes loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances. After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center.|$|E

Although they are illegal for personal use in many jurisdictions, Tasers have been marketed to the general public. [...] Other electroshock weapons such as <b>stun</b> guns, <b>stun</b> <b>batons</b> ("cattle prods"), and electroshock belts administer an electric shock by direct contact.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stun</b> <b>batons</b> are {{an unusual}} modern {{variation}} designed to administer an electric shock {{in order to}} incapacitate the target. They consist of an insulated handle and guard, and a rigid shaft usually a foot or more in length for delivering a shock. Many designs function like an elongated stun gun or a cattle prod, requiring the tip to be held against the target and then manually triggering a shock by a switch in the handle. Some more sophisticated designs carry a charge along the shaft's entire surface, administering a shock on contact. This later design is especially useful in preventing the officer from having his weapon grabbed and taken away by an assailant.|$|R

50|$|The debut {{story of}} the {{character}} failed to provide a back story to explain his behavior, but exposition from Batman during the narrative dénouement posits that Anarky is guided by socially consciousness and arrogance. As a child prodigy with extensive knowledge of both radical philosophy and improvised munitions, Lonnie was confident that violent change is necessary to improve social conditions. Convinced that he must accomplish this, he becomes a vigilante and fashions weapons—a <b>stun</b> <b>baton</b> and smoke bombs—in labs at school. Batman ultimately condemns his actions, but expresses admiration for his idealism.|$|E

He was able to escape with his life. Crown prosecutors had not immediately decided if they would pursue the charge of attempted murder upon securing a conviction of first degree murder since a conviction of attempted murder would not add to the life sentence Twitchell had already received.|$|E

A police officer arrests him for breaking and entering and then, mistakenly believing him {{to be one of}} the boy's abusers, attacks him with a <b>stun</b> <b>baton</b> before taking him to the station. Noone convinces the police he meant no harm and is released, only to find Donna waiting for him with the news that Pete is dead; also, that he was in a Milwaukee hospital, and was never in Madison. Distressed that Noone doesn't believe her, Donna collapses in the middle of a road and tries to hold him with her in the path of an oncoming truck. She then moves everything out of her home and disappears before the police can question her. Noone is now convinced that the boy is a figment of the deranged woman's imagination.|$|E
5000|$|After lights out, Conrad {{explains}} that the academy, called I.N.S.A.N.E, tries to make everything that walks through its doors normal. Through the food, they put a formula in tailored to every human to deactivate their abilities {{and do the same}} thing with the animals and plants and if all fails, destroys them. Conrad was only picking on Piper so she could wake up and fly. Piper refuses to escape with him unless the rest are going, and begins to encourage them to dream about using their talents in a good way. The only person she can't get an answer out of is Jasper, who is scheduled to graduate next (when someone has fully lost their power). They tell the kids and plan an escape plan, which fails with Dr. Hellion catching them. Dr. Hellion puts Piper in a M.O.L.D., then leaves to wait for Piper to succumb. A man with the power of invisibility known as J. reveals himself and tries to get Piper out, but she refuses and J. leaves. Sebastian comes and sings to her, revealing his talent, but is effectively killed by Dr. Hellion with agent A. Agent's shoe, which causes Piper to black out. Afterwards, Conrad is confused on how he could have possibly failed and starts to stay in bed. She arrives a few weeks later, after Conrad awakes from weeks of lying in bed, thinking that Piper might have the answer. The kids find that Piper has forgotten who she was, on top of being crippled, and Conrad suggests they leave without her. Jasper refuses and finally remembers his talent, which is healing. He heals Piper and she remembers herself and how to fly. They instead do not escape but revolt, which seems to succeed. As the children are leaving the school to catch a glimpse of the sun, Dr. Hellion is waiting for them with a <b>stun</b> <b>baton.</b> Piper and Dr. Hellion fight, leading to Dr. Hellion uncovering the secret ability to fly. She finally falls into the icy cliffs then remembering a terrible flash-back about her younger sister Sarah who died from falling into a cliff when she and Dr. Hellion were out flying. Then Dr. Hellion stops flying and Piper tries to save her but Dr. Hellion falls into the icy cliffs below and kills herself, and several months later, Conrad joins Piper as a part of her family after being abandoned by his. Piper goes to the picnic along with her friends from I.N.S.A.N.E., and they win the annual baseball game. Lowland County has been told that Piper had pulled an [...] "optical illusion" [...] on them and was sent to the academy [...] "because she was a bad girl." [...] Later, Conrad and Piper are talking on the roof. Piper reveals to him that J. came to her and told her that the kids from I.N.S.A.N.E. were not safe yet, and there was another, hidden place where they belonged instead.|$|E
500|$|Using an {{improved}} {{version of the}} [...] "Freeflow" [...] combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now counter multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes. Many of Batman's gadgets can now be used in combat. Enemies are armed with varying levels of armor and weapons; attacks from basic weapons like baseball bats and lead pipes inflict minor damage and can be countered, while guns inflict significant damage. Certain enemies must be disarmed in specific ways {{before they can be}} neutralized in combat: enemies with <b>stun</b> <b>batons</b> can only be attacked from behind; enemies with shields require aerial attacks to disarm; and enemies wearing body armor must be stunned with rapid successive strikes before they can be harmed. Larger enemies must be tackled with stuns and combo attacks, and can be manipulated to take out their allies. Disputes between gangs allied to rival villains often spark s, which complicate the player's ability to move about Arkham City. Combat, among other actions, rewards the player with experience points that allow the player to periodically level Batman up and purchase upgrades to his Batsuit, gadgets, and combat and stealth skills. Each category contains approximately 15 different upgrades. For instance, an upgraded grapnel gun can be used to remotely disarm enemies, while a combat upgrade makes it easier to activate special attacks.|$|R

The police attacked not only the protesters (most of whom didn't or failed to put up resistance) but also other civilians {{in the vicinity of}} Maidan Nezalezhnosti, when the Berkut forces chased unarmed people several hundreds of meters and continued to beat them with batons and feet. Initially, 35 people were injured {{as a result of the}} militia raid, including a Reuters cameraman and a photographer. Other protesters were detained. Most of the protesters were students. At 09:20 Berkut besieged the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery where approximately 50 Euromaidan activists, including the injured, found sanctuary. Police spokeswoman Olha Bilyk justified the police raid by saying that protesters were interfering with preparations to decorate the square for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, and accused them of throwing stones and burning logs. Minister of Internal Affairs Vitaliy Zakharchenko later apologized and claimed [...] "riot police abused their power" [...] and promised a thorough investigation.

Alan really created him—along with the other characters—and I was just {{along for the ride}} and lucky to be there." [...] —Norm Breyfogle, 2006. Originally inspired by his personal political leanings, Alan Grant entertained the idea of interjecting anarchist philosophy into Batman comic books. In an attempt to emulate the success of Chopper, a rebellious youth in Judge Dredd, he conceptualized a character as a twelve-year-old anarchist vigilante, who readers would sympathize with despite the character's harsh methods. Creating the character without any consultation from his partner, illustrator Norm Breyfogle, his only instructions to Breyfogle were that Anarky be designed as a cross between V and the black spy from Mad magazine's Spy vs. Spy. Grant also briefly considered incorporating Krazy Kat as a third design suggestion, but decided against the idea. In response to deadline pressures, and not recognizing the character's potential, Breyfogle [...] "made no preliminary sketches, simply draping him in long red sheets". The character was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude [...] "head extender" [...] that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance. While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, [...] "priestly" [...] hat, and his golden sceptre.The first Anarky story, [...] "Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor", appeared in Detective Comics No.608, in November 1989. Lonnie Machin is introduced as [...] "Anarky" [...] as early as his first appearance in Detective Comics No.608, withholding his origin story for a later point.

He goes to lengths to disguise his age and appearance by creating a costume with a false head to increase his height. This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing Anarky to be an adult.
