25|$|Saddles, bridles, hobbles, and ropes {{were needed}} if {{the party had}} a horse or riding mule, and many men did. Extra {{harnesses}} and <b>spare</b> <b>wagon</b> parts were often carried. Most carried steel shoes for horses, mules, or livestock. Tar was carried to help repair an ox's injured hoof.|$|E
50|$|The wagons were {{organised}} into sets of {{seven or eight}} per train, with trains running six days per week from the ACI Resources Lang Lang sand mine to the Pilkington ACI plant at Dandenong, and to the Australian Glass Manufacturers siding at Spotswood, with <b>spare</b> <b>wagons</b> held if needed.|$|R
60|$|Sledges.--When {{carrying}} wood or stones, {{and doing}} other heavy work, a traveller should <b>spare</b> his <b>wagon</b> {{and use a}} sledge. This is made by cutting down a forked tree, lopping off its branches, and shaping it a little with an axe. If necessary, a few bars may be fixed across the fork {{so as to make}} a stage. Great distances may be traversed by one of these rude affairs, if the country is not very stony. Should it capsize, no great harm is done; and if it breaks down, or is found to have been badly made, an hour's labour will suffice to construct another. Sledges are very useful where there is an abundance of horse or ox power, but no wagon or packing-gear.|$|R
50|$|Davies {{attacked}} the lead {{section of the}} wagon train, two companies of artillery, 4 mi east of Paineville, and quickly rounded up 300 soldiers and as many African-American teamsters. The Union cavalrymen cut many horses and mules out of their traces, captured five new Armstrong guns and burned more that 100 wagons of provisions. Davies's troopers destroyed Major General Custis Lee's supplies including all the <b>spare</b> ammunition. Leading <b>wagons</b> from the train which left Amelia Court House, including Fitzhugh Lee's headquarters baggage, Robert E. Lee's headquarters wagons with many reports and some ambulances and medical supplies, also were caught by the Union raiders. Stragglers and sick soldiers finally gathered to stop the destruction.|$|R
