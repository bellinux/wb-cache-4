30|$|The Simplified Express Consignment Clearance System {{was first}} {{introduced}} in Taiwan in 2001 to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of customs clearance operations of air cargo. This system, {{which is based on}} <b>simplified</b> <b>declaration</b> procedures, is expected to facilitate the effective and efficient collection of taxes and duties even with limited manpower. The Customs Administration (CA) has highlighted the system’s efficiency, but its effectiveness is yet to be validated. Thus, this study comprehensively examines this system by adopting both bottom–up and top–down approaches from operation and policy perspectives.|$|E

Second, we provide a procedure for transforming models in this framework to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) constraints. Traditionally, such systems have been modeled directly with MILP constraints. We show with an example that our framework significantly <b>simplifies</b> model <b>declaration</b> and allows the complex MILP constraints to be produced systematically.

This report has Värnamo {{municipality}} as principal and shall clarify what the estate owner in general and Värnamo municipality in particular {{need to know about}} this law. Another part {{that is going to be}} dealt with is how large the future need for energy experts in this field will be, and which competence that will be demanded for them. The work will in general deal with <b>simplified</b> energy <b>declarations</b> for apartment houses and public buildings, since these buildings are the first to be involved with energy declarations. The energy declaration will consist of a number of important components. • Energy power i. e. how much energy the building consume • If the ventilation control is done • If the radon measurement is carried out • Recommendations of measures to improve the energy power • Reference value to compare the buildings energy power against According to the law the declaration shall been made by an independent expert, which will need certain information for this. The estate owner will need to collect some of this information. To simplify the collection of information a model was developed that can be used by the estate owner. The model was tested on Trälleborgskolan in Värnamo. It worked well because energy statistics were available from Värnamo municipality estate department. Regarding the energy consumption monthly statistics were also available which was desirable. Some improvement can been made by correlate the heat consumption for a normal year. There will be an estimated need for about 500 - 1000 energy experts to work with energy declarations in the future. The requirements on these experts are apart from the right education, also a couple of years of experience from the energy business. This can be hard to fulfil for a newly examined engineer. This report focuses on the <b>simplified</b> energy <b>declaration.</b> In a couple of years when building will need to be inspected more thoroughly, there might be a need for more information to be collected. How this can be done in the different estate management computer software that are available, could be a base for future work in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} viability theory offers {{concepts and}} methods that are suitable {{to study the}} compatibility between a dynamical system described {{by a set of}} differential equations and constraints in the state space. The result sets built during the viability analysis can give very useful information regarding management issues in fields where it is easier to discuss constraints than objective functions. However, computational problems arise very quickly with the number of state variables, and the practical implementation of the method is difficult, although there exists a convergent numerical scheme and several approaches to bypass the computational problems. In order to popularize the use of viability analysis we propose a framework in which the viability sets are represented and approximated with particular kd-trees. The computation of the viability kernel is seen as an active learning problem. We prove the convergence of the algorithm and assess the approximation it produces for known problems with analytical solution. This framework aims at <b>simplifying</b> the <b>declaration</b> of the viability problem and provides useful methods to assist further use of viability sets produced by the computation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose of the articlePurpose of {{the present}} article is to {{identify}} drawbacks {{in the field of}} customs statistics of Georgia and to formulate concrete steps for their correction. Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the <b>simplified</b> customs <b>declarations</b> are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a country of final destination are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of commodity code, weight and additional units of measurement. ConclusionsEmpirical data related to production of Foreign Trade Statistics are characterized with certain errors, as a part of foreign trade operations remains unregistered. It means that registered value of exports and imports does not fully correspond to the value of actual flows...|$|R
40|$|Ensemble {{simulations}} {{become popular}} in computational sciences, {{and also in}} fire safety engineering, to tackle sensitivities and uncertainties of complex systems. In many cases, the involved parameters have simple and explicit impact, like randomization of initial conditions (placement of agents in pedestrian simulation) or material properties in fire simulation. However, there exist parameters, like geometrical ones, whose changes may implicitly require to adopt other settings. As FDS uses an absolute definition in its input files, we introduce an intermediate file format – including an according parser – to allow for relative definition of parameter values. The presented tool fdsgeogen uses an XML based file format to define a single FDS input file or an ensemble of those. The parser is implemented in Python and therefore platform independent as well as {{easy to use and}} to extend. Besides a variable-driven FDS input declaration, it supports a selective import of existing FDS files, loop directives to ease repetitive tasks, as well as <b>simplified</b> and compact <b>declaration</b> of common FDS input structures, like devices or slices. This contribution presents the structure of fdsgeogen and demonstrates its usage. fdsgeogen is freely available via a git repository and any kind of contribution is encouraged...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} study I shall examine the recently introduced Developmental Appraisal System. I shall {{carry out an}} investigation into the implementation of the Developmental System of Appraisal in a primary school in Kwa-Zulu Natal. The intention of the research is to provide a case study, which will focus on the implementation of the Developmental Appraisal System. In order to achieve this, three main issues of the system will be addressed. These are the conceptualisation of the system; the implementation process and the impact of the process. Although, the results of my research is focussed on one school the results could be illuminative. The final chapter of this study will concentrate on the findings and recommendations for the enhancement of the Developmental Appraisal System. The paper concludes that despite the many positive aspects of the process it is recommended that the whole appraisal system should be revised, revised and re-conceptualised to make it accessible to most South African schools, paying particular attention to <b>simplifying</b> it. i <b>DECLARATION</b> I declare that this report is my own unaided work. It is submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Education (in the field of Educational Management) in the University of Natal, Durban.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the application of}} a set of life cycle oriented strategies and tools to a pressure cooker manufactured by a medium size company located in Portugal and targeting the international market. The life cycle assessment (LCA) indicated the major environmental problems of this product, which together with the company strategy of appealing the consumer through a 100 % recyclable and more ergonomic product, provided the direction for the product and market development. Besides the LCA, an ecodesign project was carried out for a reference pressure cooker and through the use of several tools, including ecodesign checklists co-developed by LNEG in a previous project, a number of improvement options was generated, leading to the reduction and substitution of raw materials consumption, improved recyclability, better ergonomic features, more eco-friendly packaging and improved user interaction. A <b>simplified</b> environmental product <b>declaration</b> for the reference product was elaborated, in the framework of the EU Stepwise EPD project, and its marketing asset was evaluated through different communication methods, including phone meetings, website feedback, mailing lists and direct communication with customers in business fairs. This paper presents the results of this project and the characteristics of the improved product, and reflects upon the use of different life cycle-related strategies and tools in an integrated way; thus, this case study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} pros and cons of implementing life cycle strategies and tools in businesses...|$|R
