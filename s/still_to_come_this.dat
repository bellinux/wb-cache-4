One of the key negative consequence of these processes is a severe downfall in number employed persons. However, the conducted analysis suggests that trends of employment (and unemployment) have been intensely influenced by the certain number of other factors, first and foremost by {{the negative effects of}} the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, the research indicates that the process privatization and restructuring had undoubtedly a powerful negative impact on the level of employment in Serbia. As though privatization and restructuring of a significant number state owned enterprises (which employ a large number of persons) are <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>this</b> processes could have a strong further negative impact on employment. Consequently, the paper provides some lessons that can help the policy makers in conducting forthcoming privatization and enterprises restructurings...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{biomarkers}} {{has been}} proposed for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in recent criteria, but some biomarkers have not been sufficiently investigated to justify their routine clinical use. Here, we evaluate in a literature review the clinical validity of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using a structured framework developed {{for the assessment of}} oncological biomarkers. Homogenous criteria have been addressed in reviews of other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. There is adequate evidence that the main aims of phases 1 (rationale for use) and 2 (discriminative ability) have been achieved. The aims of phase 3 (early detection ability) have been partly achieved, while phase 4 studies (performance in representative mild cognitive impairment patients) are currently ongoing. Phase 5 studies (quantification of impact and costs) are <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> review highlights the priorities to be pursued to enable the proper use of amyloid PET imaging in a clinical setting. Future investigations will primarily be large, phase 4 studies that will assess the utility of amyloid PET imaging in routine clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the TRC, Desmond Tutu stated that the Commission’s task was to promote, not to achieve, reconci- liation. Reconciliation, he maintained, is the responsibility of all South Africans, and expressed the hope that the Christian churches would be in the forefront of this healing process.   This article explores how the Christian church can be in the forefront of binding up the wounds, facilitating the healing pro- cess, and living as a people and a sign of hope. The answers it seeks to offer fall under three interrelated themes, namely the church’s:   • spirituality of reconciliation; • ministry and mission of reconciliation; and • resources for its ministry and mission of reconciliation.   Cultivating a spirituality of reconciliation would mean making reconciliation a lifestyle, rather than a series of strategies, pro- grammes or initiatives, yet remaining concrete, practical, mea- surable and accountable.   The church’s mission is primarily to proclaim the good news of God’s Kingdom that is already here, but not yet fully here and therefore <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> proclamation is the message of reconciliation between God, others and the self, and anticipates the unity of all creation in Jesus Christ.   The resources given to the church to fulfil this apostolic ministry include prophecy, evangelism, pastoral care and teaching, as well as its liturgical and sacramental life, its ministry of pre- sence, its people and its commitment to social justice...|$|E

40|$|Solid-phase {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} in the early sixties by Bruce Merrifield (Nobel Prize in 1984) and, up to now, a wide number of commercial applications have been applied to biopolymers synthesis, supported organic chemistry, and heterogeneous catalysis. In the specific case of peptide, polypeptide and protein synthesis, the possibility offered by solid-phase method to automate the operations required by the chemical procedures, is still hampered {{by the lack of}} adequate devices for monitoring and controlling the key steps of the synthetic cycle, namely deprotection and coupling. Deprotection allows removing masking group from the amino terminal of the last residue of the growing chain, while coupling enables to condense a new amino acid derivative. These steps are subsequently repeated until the complete sequence is assembled on the solid matrix. Afterwards, the crude product is cleaved from the support, purified and characterized. Direct, in-real-time, evaluation of the yield of both deprotection and coupling represents a crucial step in order to achieve a satisfactory level of process automation. Accordingly, many efforts have been made to define different procedures and some have been also commercially applied. However, an integrated system able to perform the overall control of the synthetic cycle is <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> paper reviews the efforts that have led us to develop an original method for the on-line prediction of the coupling yield.

40|$|AbstractSince the mid 1990 s, the {{intriguing}} {{dynamics of the}} brain at rest has been attracting {{a growing body of}} research in neuroscience. Neuroimaging studies have revealed distinct functional networks that slowly activate and deactivate, pointing to the existence of an underlying network dynamics emerging spontaneously during rest, with specific spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed and tested with the use of large-scale computational models of coupled brain areas. However, a mechanistic explanation that encompasses all the phenomena observed in the brain during rest is <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> In <b>this</b> review, we provide an overview of the key findings of resting-state activity covering a range of neuroimaging modalities including fMRI, EEG and MEG. We describe how to best define and analyze anatomical and functional brain networks and how unbalancing these networks may lead to problems with mental health. Finally, we review existing large-scale models of resting-state dynamics in health and disease. An important common feature of resting-state models is that the emergence of resting-state functional networks is obtained when the model parameters are such that the system operates at the edge of a bifurcation. At this critical working point, the global network dynamics reveals correlation patterns that are spatially shaped by the underlying anatomical structure, leading to an optimal fit with the empirical BOLD functional connectivity. However, new insights coming from recent studies, including faster oscillatory dynamics and non-stationary functional connectivity, must be taken into account in future models to fully understand the network mechanisms leading to the resting-state activity...|$|R

6000|$|... "Facts again!" [...] Mr. Playmore answered, [...] "muddled up together, {{as you may}} say--but {{positive}} facts for all that. Caldershaws, {{you must}} know, {{is one of the}} most disreputable districts in Edinburgh. One of my clerks (whom I am in the habit of employing confidentially) volunteered to inquire for 'Dandie' at 'Number Nine.' It was a ticklish business in every way; and my man wisely took a person with him who was known in the neighborhood. 'Number Nine' turned out to be (ostensibly) a shop for the sale of rags and old iron; and 'Dandie' was suspected of trading now and then, additionally, as a receiver of stolen goods. Thanks to the influence of his companion, backed by a bank-note (which can be repaid, by the way, out of the fund for the American expenses), my clerk succeeded is making the fellow speak. Not to trouble you with needless details, the result in substance was this: A fortnight or more before the date of Mrs. Eustace's death, 'Dandie' made two keys from wax models supplied to him by a new customer. The mystery observed in the matter by the agent who managed it excited Dandie's distrust. He had the man privately watched before he delivered the keys; and he ended in discovering that his customer was--Miserrimus Dexter. Wait a little! I have not done yet. Add to this information Dexter's incomprehensible knowledge of the contents of your husband's diary, and the product is--that the wax models sent to the old-iron shop in Caldershaws were models taken by theft from the key of the Diary and the key of the table-drawer in which it was kept. I have my own idea of the revelations that are <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> if <b>this</b> matter is properly followed up. Never mind going into that at present. Dexter (I tell you again) is answerable for the late Mrs. Eustace's death. How he is answerable I believe you are in a fair way of finding out. And, more than that, I say now, what I could not venture to say before--it is a duty toward Justice, as well as a duty toward your husband, to bring the truth to light. As for the difficulties to be encountered, I don't think they need daunt you. The greatest difficulties give way in the end, when they are attacked by the united alliance of patience resolution--and economy." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{may thus}} form {{some idea of}} the general {{position}} of American exploration and discovery at the time when Cartier made his momentous voyages. The maritime nations of Europe, in searching for a passage to the half-mythical empires of Asia, had stumbled on a great continent. At first they thought it Asia itself. Gradually they were realizing that this was not Asia, but an outlying land that lay between Europe and Asia and that must be passed by the navigator before Cathay and Cipango could rise upon the horizon. But the new continent was vast in extent. It blocked the westward path from pole to pole. With each voyage, too, the resources and the native beauty of the new land became more apparent. The luxuriant islands of the West Indies, and the Aztec empire of Mexico, were already bringing wealth and grandeur to the monarchy of Spain. South of Mexico it had been already found that the great barrier of the continent extended to the cold tempestuous seas of the Antarctic region. Magellan's voyage (1519-22) had proved indeed that by rounding South America the way was open to the spice islands of the east. But the route was infinitely long and arduous. The hope of a shorter passage by the north beckoned the explorer. Of this north country nothing but its coast was known as yet. Cabot and the fishermen had found a land of great forests, swept by the cold and leaden seas of the Arctic, and holding its secret clasped in the iron grip of the northern ice. The Corte-Reals, Verrazano, and Gomez had looked upon the endless panorama of the Atlantic coast of North America--the glorious forests draped with tangled vines extending to the sanded beaches of the sea--the wide inlets round the mouths of mighty rivers moving silent and mysterious from the heart of the unknown continent. Here and there a painted savage showed the bright feathers of his headgear as he lurked in the trees of the forest or stood, in fearless curiosity, gazing from the shore at the white-winged ships of the strange visitants from the sky. But for the most part all, save the sounds of nature, was silence and mystery. The waves thundered upon the sanded beach of Carolina and lashed in foam about the rocks of the iron coasts of New England and the New Found Land. The forest mingled its murmurs with the waves, and, as the sun sank behind the unknown hills, wafted its perfume to the anchored ships that rode upon the placid bosom of the evening sea. And beyond all this was mystery--the mystery of the unknown East, the secret of the pathway that must lie somewhere hidden in the bays and inlets of the continent of silent beauty, and above all the mysterious sense of a great history <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> for <b>this</b> new land itself--a sense of the murmuring of many voices caught as the undertone of the rustling of the forest leaves, but rising at last to the mighty sound of the vast civilization that in the centuries <b>to</b> <b>come</b> should pour into the silent wildernesses of America.|$|R
6000|$|Note 1. The Doctor's {{propensity}} for cobwebs is amplified {{in the following}} note for an earlier and somewhat milder version of the character: [...] "According to him, all science was to be renewed and established on a sure ground by no other means than cobwebs. The cobweb was the magic clue by which mankind was to be rescued from all its errors, and guided safely back to the right. And so he cherished spiders above all things, and kept them spinning, spinning away; the only textile factory that existed at that epoch in New England. He distinguished the production of each of his ugly friends, and assigned peculiar qualities to each; {{and he had been}} for years engaged in writing a work on this new discovery, in reference to which he had already compiled a great deal of folio manuscript, and had unguessed at resources <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> With <b>this</b> suggestive subject he interwove all imaginable learning, collected from his own library, rich in works that few others had read, and from that of his beloved University, crabbed with Greek, rich with Latin, drawing into itself, like a whirlpool, all that men had thought hitherto, and combining them anew {{in such a way that}} it had all the charm of a racy originality. Then he had projects for the cultivation of cobwebs, to which end, in the good Doctor's opinion, it seemed desirable to devote a certain part of the national income; and not content with this, all public-spirited citizens would probably be induced to devote as much of their time and means as they could to the same end. According to him, there was no such beautiful festoon and drapery for the halls of princes as the spinning of this heretofore despised and hated insect; and by due encouragement it might be hoped that they would flourish, and hang and dangle and wave triumphant in the breeze, to an extent as yet generally undreamed of. And he lamented much the destruction that has heretofore been wrought upon this precious fabric by the housemaid's broom, and insisted upon by foolish women who claimed to be good housewives. Indeed, it was the general opinion that the Doctor's celibacy was in great measure due to the impossibility of finding a woman who would pledge herself to co- operate with him in this great ambition of his life,--that of reducing the world to a cobweb factory; or who would bind herself to let her own drawing-room be ornamented with this kind of tapestry. But there never was a wife precisely fitted for our friend the Doctor, unless it had been Arachne herself, to whom, if she could again have been restored to her female shape, he would doubtless have lost no time in paying his addresses. It was doubtless the having dwelt too long among the musty and dusty clutter and litter of things gone by, that made the Doctor almost a monomaniac on this subject. There were cobwebs in his own brain, and so he saw nothing valuable but cobwebs in the world around him; and deemed that the march of created things, up to this time, had been calculated by foreknowledge to produce them." ...|$|R

40|$|In 2011 – 2015, {{health care}} {{regulation}} changes will present new {{challenges and opportunities}} to the novice lawyer in a general practice law office. Our purpose in this Article is to guide the novice at federal administrative rulemaking through the very challenging rulemaking aspects of implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or the Act). Even if you skipped the administrative law and health law courses in law school, your clients will ask for your help, and you can cheerily offer to guide them. Individuals, nonprofit groups, companies, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, local governments, states, insurers, investment analysts, and product manufacturers are among the many types of law firm clients who will struggle {{with the implementation of}} the 2010 health care reform legislation. How well you perform in this rule-writing context may shape the future of your practice when more health law issues arise for your clients. So much money is at stake for these clients that accurate advising and thoughtful preparation on Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rules could be essential to sustaining your role in those clients’ profitable health care businesses. Rulemaking comments, well crafted and effectively supported by data, will be your future goal in serving these clients. Your sensitivity to federal and state motivations will result in more effective comments and meeting participation; the clients will benefit from your thoughtful preparatory work. We confess that a guide to this massive law is impossible in these few short pages. We could try to parse its 406, 887 words, slog through the 906 -page PDF version from the Government Printing Office website, or even dance through the twelve-page table of contents for Public Laws 111 - 148 and 111 - 152, the basic statute and the companion “reconciliation” bill. Instead, in order to be both pragmatic and helpful, we will orient this Article toward aiding the novice in successfully drafting and submitting comments on the many agency rules that implement the new law’s complex commands and constraints. There is no question that PPACA will result in a tsunami of new administrative rulemaking. Although some of this important work has already begun and will be discussed below, there is <b>still</b> much more <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> rulemaking will be contentious, pitting politicians, agency heads, insurers, industry lobbyists, health care consumer advocates, and individuals against each other in a monumental battle to shape the regulations that will ultimately define health care in America. By analogy, those health care participants who wander onto the PPACA “beachfront” unaware and unprepared for this particular tsunami could be overwhelmed by the roiling flood of red tape before they have a real opportunity to have any impact on the rulemaking process. If the aphorism is correct that “the world is run by those who show up,” the 2011 world of health care reform rulemaking is being run by a few dozen law firms and corporate lobbyists, that represent major industries with financial stakes in the PPACA reforms. They have equal free speech rights, but their sophistication in rulemaking can make them seem more equal than other smaller players. This Article will target the needs of the small firm, solo, or public interest attorney who cares enough to advocate for the economic interests of citizens, patients, and less affluent players. We hope to provide you with the navigational tools you will need to have a say in this critical rulemaking that will define health care delivery and medical cost coverage for decades <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> Article will also provide an overview {{of some of the most}} critical provisions in the legislation and an explanation of where the rulemaking on those segments will take us...|$|R
