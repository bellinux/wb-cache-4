40|$|Abstract: Information {{brokerage}} in {{wireless sensor networks}} involves producers (such as sensor nodes) storing in <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> a {{large amount}} of data that they have collected and consumers (e. g. base stations, users, and nodes) retrieving that information. In this paper, first, the data storage problem is formalized into a one-to-one (one producer and one consumer) model, a many-to-one (m producers and one consumer) model, and a many-to-many (m producers and n consumers) model with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption. Second, based on the above models, two algorithms are proposed to determine the <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> based on data rates of producers, query rates of consumers, and transmission scheme of information brokerage. The optimal data storage (ODS) scheme, a greedy algorithm, produces the global optimal data <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> and the near-optimal data storage (NDS) scheme, an approximate algorithm, can greatly reduce the computational overhead while achieving local optimal positions. Both ODS and NDS are able to adjust the <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> adaptively to minimize energy consumption that includes the costs of storing and querying the data. Simulation results show that NDS not only provides substantial cost benefits but also performs as effective and efficient as ODS in over 70 % of the tested cases...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this {{abstract}} {{we address}} an integrated warehouse order picking problem. The warehouse is divided in the picking and the storage areas. We {{focus on the}} picking area. It contains a set of aisles, each composed {{by a set of}} <b>storage</b> <b>positions.</b> For each period of the working day each position contains several pieces of a unique product, defined by its reference. The warehouse is not automated, and the order pickers can prepare up to K parcels in a given picking route. For each period of the working day a set of customers orders is received at the warehouse. An order is a set of product references, each associated with a quantity, i. e. the number of pieces required. The problem consists in jointly deciding:(1) the assignment of references to <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> in the aisles which need to be filled up;(2) the division of orders into several parcels, respecting weight and size constraints;(3) the batching of parcels into groups of size K, that implicitly define the routing into the picking area. The routing is assumed to follow a return policy, i. e. an order picker enters and leaves each aisle from the same end. The objective function is to minimize the total routing cost. In order to deal with industrial instances of large size (considering hundreds of clients, thousands of positions and product references) in a short computation time, a heuristic method based on the split and dynamic programming paradigms is proposed. Experimental results will be presented...|$|R
40|$|NETSPEAK is a Web service {{which helps}} writers in finding {{alternative}} expressions {{for what they}} want to say. 1 It provides a large index of writing samples in the form of n-grams, n ≤ 5, along with an efficient means to retrieve them by the use of wildcard queries. When in doubt about a phrasing, a user can get additional evidence by retrieving samples that match a given context. The figure below shows the results for a query where a user is interested in the two most frequently written words between “looks” and “me”. The first two columns give an idea about the customariness of each result, and the user can select the one most appropriate for her sentence. To provide a rich choice of writing samples we index the Google n-gram corpus which was compiled from {{a large portion of the}} English Web and which consists of more than 3 billion n-grams along with their occurrence frequencies [2]. We have developed a space-optimal inverted index based on minimal perfect hashing. The hash function maps the vocabulary V of the corpus to the <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> of postlists. A hash function is perfect if it does not produce hash collisions for the key set V, and it is minimal if the number of <b>storage</b> <b>positions</b> required does not exceed |V |. The hash function is constructed with the CHD algorithm which produces a space overhead of 2. 07 × |V | bits [1]. Moreover, the index provides a top-k retrieval strategy to find the n-grams matching a query; details can be found in [3]. The table below shows selected performance data of our index. NETSPEAK is currently deployed on a cluster of 15 computers. In a load test the service was measured to process about 10 000 queries per second.

They include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology used.

5000|$|Scenically the production, {{designed}} by Harry Horner, was extremely involved with velour covered hard wall sets instead of typical muslin flats. The raised stage platform floor concealed tracks {{for the various}} platform wagon sets to be winched on and off stage. The village set, included left and right store facades with false perspective awnings, were stored, hanging in the off stage loft areas, allowing wing storage for the hard wall throne room (painted deep maroon color); a pink boudoir set; a garden set; and a Cathedral Rose stained glass window-wall with a central enlarged double Gothic arched doorway mounted on a six foot deep by thirty foot wide wagon platform. Staging the wedding scene, the couple began their walk {{at the rear of}} the stage on the Cathedral steps into the set. As the couple proceeded walking forward down to the foot-light apron, this massive Cathedral wall followed, moving with the couple to the middle of the stage. Interesting is fact the audience never realized that the set was moving downstage with the performers. When the couple turned around, returning upstage, the cathedral wall slowly returned to the back wall position ending the wedding scene. This set wagon wall flew out and was stored against the Curran's stage back wall; a spectacular visual transition, which was never seen by the audience! In Los Angeles, this set piece was replaced with a painted velour framed backing. Harry Horner matched Miles White's costume color, for Princess Flavia's dressing gown robe, spraying the velour boudoir walls the identical costume's pink color. During rehearsals, Miles was jump'n mad with Harry because all you could see was the actress' head bobbing in the identical pink background! The production required a large staff of stage technicians, flymen, and property crew for the major set changes. During the construction of the stage sets, the shop's minimum construction floor space limited and hindered by space for constructing all the wagon sets. The Light Opera rented film stages at the nearby (closed) Allied Artist Studios, located off Sunset Boulevard (KCET TV purchased the property afterwards). Only six blocks travel, carpenters and scenic artists assembled the scenery in two stages at the old film lot. Preparing the dry tint powder base paint for the throne room set, the Scenic charge man did not calculate the correct amount of [...] "horse glue" [...] binder for the dark maroon paint. Spraying the cream velour covered flats, after drying, the paint did not properly adhere to the velour flats. The result, the paint flaked and stained the stage technicians' hands. Each piece of scenery had to have a muslin case for shipping, keeping the finish from marking and affecting the other pieces of scenery. When this set was handled, each stage technician had to wear gloves when the set was moved into place, or shifted off stage for storage. This set remained a problem throughout the tour. Another folding deminsional scenic arch unit, which had been intended to fold open, and collapse when flown into grid <b>storage</b> <b>position</b> returning into the loft storage areas, became an engineering nightmare. The scenic element, abandoned after two weeks, was replaced by a flat profile garden arch.
