5|$|Stars {{are given}} a single-letter {{classification}} according to their spectra, ranging from type O, which are very hot, to M, which are <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. The most common of these are types L and T, which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes O0 and O1 may not exist.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and <b>so</b> <b>cool.</b> And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

In western Switzerland, the summers of 1816 and 1817 were <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> that an ice dam formed below a tongue of the Giétro Glacier {{high in the}} Val de Bagnes.

25|$|However {{this view}} has been challenged. The {{evidence}} indicates homeothermy, but by itself cannot prove endothermy. Secondly, {{the production of}} bone {{may not have been}} continuous in areas near the extremities of limbs– in allosaur skeketons lines of arrested growth ("LAGs"; rather like growth rings) are sparse or absent in large limb bones but common in the fingers and toes. While there is no absolute proof that LAGs are temperature-related, they could mark times when the extremities were <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> that the bones ceased to grow. If so, the data about oxygen isotope ratios would be incomplete, especially for times when the extremities were coolest. Oxygen isotope ratios may be an unreliable method of estimating temperatures if it cannot be shown that bone growth was equally continuous {{in all parts of the}} animal.|$|E
25|$|Willow meets stoic Oz in {{the second}} season. Their {{courtship}} is slow and patient. Oz is bitten by a werewolf, and just as Willow begins to confront him about why he does not spend time with her, he transforms and attacks her. She must shoot him with a tranquilizer gun several times while he is wild, but her assertiveness in doing so makes her more confident in their relationship. Oz's trials in dealing with a power he cannot control is, according to authors J. Michael Richardson and J. Douglas Rabb, a model for Willow to reference when she encounters her own attraction to evil. When Willow and Oz decide to commit to each other, Willow is enthusiastic {{that she has a}} boyfriend, and, as a guitarist in a band, one <b>so</b> <b>cool.</b> Her relationship with Oz endures the high school storylines of exploring her attraction to Xander, which briefly separates them. She worries that she is not as close to Oz as she could be. They stay together through graduation into college, but Oz is drawn to Veruca, another werewolf. He admits an animal attraction to Veruca, which he does not share with Willow. He sleeps with Veruca and leaves shortly after to explore the werewolf part of himself. Willow becomes very depressed and doubts herself. She drinks, her magical abilities are compromised, her spells come out wrong, and she lashes out at her friends when they suggest she get over it ("Something Blue").|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} 1979 - 2014 Southern Ocean (SO) sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) trends simulated in an ensemble of coupled general circulation models and evaluate possible {{causes of the}} models’ inability to reproduce the observed 1979 - 2014 <b>SO</b> <b>cooling.</b> For each model we estimate the response of SO SST to step changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing and in the seasonal indices of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Using these step-response functions, we skillfully reconstruct the models’ 1979 - 2014 SO SST trends. Consistent with the seasonal signature of the Antarctic ozone hole and the seasonality of SO stratification, {{the summer and fall}} SAM exert a large impact on the simulated SO SST trends. We further identify conditions that favor multidecadal SO cooling: 1) a weak SO warming response to GHG forcing; 2) a strong multidecadal <b>SO</b> <b>cooling</b> response to a positive SAM trend; 3) a historical SAM trend as strong as in observations...|$|R

50|$|As {{one might}} expect, {{temperatures}} increase towards the Thames, firstly {{because of the}} urban warming effect of the surrounding area, but secondly due to altitude decreasing towards the river, meaning some of the hillier northern margins of North London are often a degree or <b>so</b> <b>cooler</b> than those areas adjacent to the Thames.

The magazine had previously published a special issue centered on the network and its shows in July 2012, but overlooked Off the Air, presenting an [...] "opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show." [...] Speaking {{from the first time}} he watched it, McManus praised it for not being [...] "your typical try-too-hard-to-be-weird production." [...] In Adweek, Sam Thielman ranked it second place out of 18 other programs on the network. He tied it with the network's parody infomercial specials and wrote that it was [...] "in the same category as King Star King among things that are <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> and strange that they look like they should probably be part of a video installation in an art gallery somewhere." ...|$|E

In 2006, Emmy Magazine voted Khan [...] "TV's Most Out-of-This-World Character", beating out other science-fiction characters such as The Doctor and Commander Adama. Editors wrote that [...] "Khan was <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> we would've bought a Chrysler Cordoba if he'd told us to," [...] referring to an ad campaign Montalbán appeared in for Chrysler.

500|$|Poochie, {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta and Alex Rocco, is an {{anthropomorphic}} dog {{that appeared in}} [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] (season eight, 1997). In the episode, the producers of The Itchy & Scratchy Show believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. Homer Simpson gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, [...] "The Beagle Has Landed". A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised, and was killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer's objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of The Simpsons. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious {{because he was so}} rich, rather than because he was <b>so</b> <b>cool.</b> Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] and [...] "Little Big Mom." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate {{what it is to be}} about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E
500|$|Professional wrestler Bret Hart guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, {{and he was very}} insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit. He {{explained}} that [...] "It's <b>so</b> <b>cool</b> {{to be part of a}} show that makes people laugh really, really hard." [...] The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that [...] "Bret offers to wrestle him [...] for the place." [...] In a 2009 interview with the A.V. Club's Dave Hofer, Hart explained that the reason why his animated counterpart sounds nothing like him was that initially, he was brought in to voice a generic wrestler. When Mark Kirkland realised how famous Hart actually was, he told Hart that if the artwork had not been started yet, he would be drawn in as himself. Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series Jacob Two-Two. The press noted that at that time Hart was [...] "no stranger to cartoon-land," [...] having been [...] "immortalized" [...] by [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa".|$|E
