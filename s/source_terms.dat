40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of new theoretical and experimental techniques for the efficient estimation of thermophysical properties and source-term in micro and macro-scale. Two kinds of <b>source</b> <b>term</b> were studied: a constant and a time varying <b>source</b> <b>term.</b> The time wise variation of the <b>source</b> <b>term</b> had a sinusoidal and a pulse form. Two devices were used for the sample heating: An electrical resistance and a laser diode. For the data acquisition, an infrared camera was used, providing a full cartography of properties of the medium and also non-contact temperature measurements. The direct problem was solved by the finite differences method, and two approaches were used for the solution of the inverse problem, depending on the time varying behavior of the <b>source</b> <b>term.</b> Both approaches deal with the parameters estimation within the Bayesian framework, using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method via the Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm for the constant <b>source</b> <b>term,</b> and the Kalman filter for the time-varying <b>source</b> <b>term.</b> The nodal strategy is presented as a method to deal with the large number of experimental data problems.

The Riemann problem for the droplet model is constructively solved by going through the solution of the Riemann problems for the inviscid Burgers equation with a zeroth order linear <b>source</b> <b>term</b> and the subsystem, respectively.
