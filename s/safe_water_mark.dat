5000|$|A <b>Safe</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Mark,</b> {{as defined}} by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in {{maritime}} pilotage to indicate the end of a channel. It usually implies that open, deep and safe water lies ahead, though it is sometimes also used to indicate the start and end of a buoyed section of a continuous narrow channel, or a line of these marks can be used to mark a safe route through shallow areas. [...] It is therefore important to consult an appropriate chart to determine the exact meaning in each case. The marker is also sometimes known as a Fairway Buoy.|$|E

40|$|Sarankhola Upazila of Bagerhat {{district}} {{is one of}} the most water scarce and disaster prone areas of the country. Village level map of existing <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> options for this Upazila has been prepared using data on number of water supply technologies for each village using ArcGIS 9. 1. Hydrometeorological, geological and hydrogeological data have been analyzed to decipher the geohydro-environment in order to validate site specific water supply options. Existence of different <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> options in every village alongside population density has been presented in the map in order to identify high, medium and low priority areas. It is evident from the analysis that where shallow tubewell is less successful, the <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> coverage is also low. Rainwater harvesting is the least used option despite having high annual rainfall and therefore, can be used in large numbers along with pond sand filter (PSF) in order to improve <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> coverage. Results obtained from the study can be utilized as a planning tool to optimize the <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> coverage by targeting priority areas. The map also identifies the areas suitable for a particular <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> option and can be used as a guiding tool for installing the appropriate sustainable <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> options during future interventions...|$|R

Text <b>water</b> <b>marking</b> requires extreme care when embedding additional data within the images because the additional information must not affect the image quality.

5000|$|One kind of high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> is the {{ordinary}} high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> or average high <b>water</b> <b>mark,</b> the high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> {{that can be}} expected to be produced by a body of water in non-flood conditions. The ordinary high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> may have legal significance and is often being used to demarcate property boundaries. The ordinary high <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> has also been used for other legal demarcations. For example, a 1651 analysis of laws passed by the English Parliament notes that for persons granted the title Admiral of the English Seas, [...] "the Admirals power extended even to the high <b>water</b> <b>mark,</b> and into the main streams".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the disappointing adoption rates of point-of-use (POU) <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technologies designed to expand access to <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> {{in the developing}} world. Low cost <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technologies substantially reduce diarrheal disease (Clasen et al. 2006). Nev-ertheless, they remain little used {{in many parts of}} the developing world, even when widely available. We present results from a randomized field study in Kenya that provided all partic-ipant households a variety of free <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technologies in order to test hypothesized infor-mational and behavioral constraints to the decision to use any <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technology. Sharing common (village-level) source water quality information increases water treatment by 8 - 13 percentage points, representing a 12 - 23 % increase over base values; the additional sharing of personalized (household-level) water quality information does not further increase use. Social marketing messages that harness findings from behavioral economics to encourage adoption of a <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technology further increased water treatment by 9 - 11 percentage points overall. These results suggest promising avenues for incremental improvements in the market for <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> (and other) technologies. More broadly, they present further evidence against a model of decision making that assumes full information and fully formed preferences. JEL CODES...|$|R
40|$|Ever since arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{was discovered in}} Bangladesh in the 1990 ’s, several international organizations and NGOs have been constructing <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> devices for mitigating the associated problems. However, many such <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> devices were abandoned {{due to lack of}} maintenance. This article analyzes how and why the use of these devices had stopped, through the use of interviews made with officials of the device operating committees. It was found that, in one example, an active <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> device had a well-organized operating committee, headed by a leading member of the community who was held in high regard. In contrast, an inactive <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> device in a neighboring village was found to have an unstable organizing committee; in this case an unmotivated community leader who had his own access to <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water.</b> The maintenance of <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> devices therefore greatly depends on leadership in the community. A future concern should see the implementation of methods of sustainable device maintenance that is free from the issues of community unity and/or leadership. 国民の９割が地下水を飲用に利用しているバングラデシュでは 1990 年代に地下水砒素汚染が明らかになり問題になっている｡以降､国内外の機関によって対策活動として､安全な水を供給するための装置(代替水源装置) が建設されてきた｡しかし､建設された多くの代替水源装置において維持管理が適切に行われず結果的に放棄される例などが報告されている｡本研究は､代替水源装置の運営(維持管理) がどうして､どのように立ち行かなくなっていくのかということについて､装置の管理組合の役員にインタビューを行い､明らかにするものである｡順調に稼動している代替水源装置においては､尊敬されている人物が組合のリーダーを務めておりその人物を中心として利用世帯がまとまっていたり､日常的に装置のメンテナンスを行う人物の存在が見られた｡一方､維持管理が放棄されている代替水源装置においては､組合のリーダーや､コミュニティ全体に関連する問題が見られた｡今後､放棄される代替水源装置の数を減らし､代替水源装置によって安定的に安全な水を供給するためには､いいリーダーがいない､又はまとまって何かを解決することが難しいという地域社会において､どうすれば代替水源装置は安定的に稼動させることができるのかという点が重要な課題となるであろう...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} this study reveal that climate change poses a great risk for <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> {{availability}} and health problems in the study area. <b>Safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> as well as freshwater resources are badly hampered by the effects of climatic variability, such as salinity intrusion, drought during the dry season, and floods during the wet season. As a result, an overwhelming majority of the people is struggling to get <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> and among them, more than 50 % are affected by various health-related problems through waterborne diseases. However, <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> measures and health care facilities are inadequate compared to demand, as the existing number of limited health centers shows. Households collect <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> from far distances. Considering all these issues, this research identified suitable <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> practices—such as rainwater harvesting, pond sand filters, and potable water supplies—that are effective for securing <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water.</b> These practices ultimately help to adapt to health problems and to reduce waterborne diseases. To harmonize dealing with the challenges, this research underlines the role of multiple stakeholders (GOs, NGOs, and communities) in carrying out various adaptive actions toward <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> and improved health.|$|R
