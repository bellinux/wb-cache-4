Studies have shown that polyunsaturated fats can reduce hypothalamic inflammation. Here, we evaluated the presence and function of RvD 2, a resolvin produced from docosahexaenoic acid, in the hypothalamus of mice. Methods Male Swiss mice were fed either chow or a high-fat diet. RvD 2 receptor and <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes</b> were evaluated by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. RvD 2 was determined by mass spectrometry. Dietary and pharmacological approaches were used to modulate the RvD 2 system in the hypothalamus, and metabolic phenotype consequences were determined. Results All enzymes involved in the synthesis of RvD 2 were detected in the hypothalamus and were modulated {{in response to the}} consumption of dietary saturated fats, leading to a reduction of hypothalamic RvD 2. GPR 18, the receptor for RvD 2, which was detected in POMC and NPY neurons, was also modulated by dietary fats. The substitution of saturated by polyunsaturated fats in the diet resulted in increased hypothalamic RvD 2, which was accompanied by reduced body mass and improved glucose tolerance. The intracerebroventricular treatment with docosahexaenoic acid resulted in increased expression of the RvD 2 <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes,</b> increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and improved metabolic phenotype. Finally, intracerebroventricular treatment with RvD 2 resulted in reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance and increased hypothalamic expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

First, in control-fed mice L-FABP gene ablation alone increased the total bile acid pool size by 1. 5 -fold, especially in gall-bladder and liver, but without altering the proportions of bile acid, cholesterol and phospholipid. Loss of liver L-FABP was more than compensated by up-regulation of: other liver cytosolic bile acid-binding proteins [GST (glutathione S-transferase), 3 α-HSD (3 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) ], key hepatic bile acid <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes</b> [CYP 7 A 1 (cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase) and CYP 27 A 1 (sterol 27 α-hydroxylase) ], membrane bile acid translocases [canalicular BSEP (bile salt export pump), canalicular MRP 2 (multidrug resistance associated protein 2), and basolateral/serosal OATP- 1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1) ], and positive alterations in nuclear receptors [more LXRα (liver X receptor a) and less SHP (short heterodimer partner) ]. Secondly, L-FABP gene ablation reversed the cholesterol-responsiveness of bile acid metabolic parameters such that total bile acid pool size, especially in gall-bladder and liver, was reduced 4 -fold, while the mass of biliary cholesterol increased 1. 9 -fold. The dramatically reduced bile acid levels in cholesterol-fed male L-FABP (-/-) mice were associated with reduced expression of: (i) liver cytosolic bile acid-binding proteins (L-FABP, GST and 3 α-HSD), (ii) hepatic bile acid <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes</b> [CYP 7 A 1, CYP 27 A 1 and SCP-x (sterol carrier protein-x/ 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) ] concomitant with decreased positive nuclear receptor alterations (i. e. less LXRα and more SHP), and (iii) membrane bile acid transporters (BSEP, MRP 2 and OATP- 1).

Previous studies showed that epinephrine activates the beta 2 -adrenergic receptor (B 2 AR), impairing keratinocyte migration. Here, we investigated the keratinocyte catecholamine synthetic pathway in response to acute trauma. Cultured keratinocytes were scratch wounded and expression levels of the B 2 AR and catecholamine <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes</b> tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase were assayed. The binding affinity of the B 2 AR was measured. Wounding downregulated B 2 AR, tyrosine hydroxylase, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase expression, but pre-exposure to timolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, delayed this effect. In wounded keratinocytes, B 2 AR-binding affinity remained depressed even after its expression returned to prewounding levels. Keratinocyte-derived norepinephrine increased after wounding. Norepinephrine impaired keratinocyte migration; this effect was abrogated with B 2 AR-selective antagonist ICI- 118, 551 but not with B 1 AR-selective antagonist bisoprolol. Finally, for clinical relevance, we determined that norepinephrine was present in freshly wounded skin, thus providing a potential mechanism for impaired healing by local B 2 AR activation in wound-edge keratinocytes. Taken together, {{the data show that}} keratinocytes modulate catecholamine <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and release norepinephrine after scratch wounding. Norepinephrine appears to be a stress-related mediator that impairs keratinocyte migration through activation of the B 2 AR.

40|$|Growing {{understanding}} of enzymatic reactions and their utilization for synthetic purposes {{has led to}} a rising interest in development of artificial, biocatalytic multi-step reactions. These <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzyme</b> cascades selectively convert inexpensive substrates into valuable compounds of varying applications. Despite their many advantages, the productivity of biocatalytic cascade reactions is oftentimes considered unsatisfactory for implementation into industrial scale processes. To overcome this limitation and facilitate investigation, application, optimization, and scale-up of biocatalytic cascade reactions was the objective of this thesis. Representing a valuable chiral building block for pharmaceutical synthesis, 1 -phenylpropane- 1, 2 -diol was chosen as a model product, accessed by subsequent carboligation and oxidoreduction. In order to increase the economic and ecologic relevance of the model process and of <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzyme</b> cascades in general, lyophilized whole cell catalyst was used in a micro-aqueous solvent system. In doing so, a cheap and stable catalyst formulation was employed, independent of costly external cofactor addition. The cofactor, supplied by the whole cell catalyst itself, was recycled by substrate-coupled regeneration. Furthermore, the reaction in organic solvent enabled outstandingly high substrate and product titers together with facilitated downstream processing by straightforward solvent evaporation. To enable an easy cascade investigation and setup, the compartmentalized entrapment or encapsulation of whole cell catalyst was envisaged, allowing to serve as a catalytic module. Therefore, whole cell catalyst was retained in a polymeric membrane, resulting in a catalytic teabag. The catalytic teabag was proven a useful modularization tool, enabling (i) simplified and flexible handling and combination of biocatalysts, (ii) straightforward catalyst recovery and recycling, (iii) facilitated cascade optimization and set-up, as well as (iv) small scale preparative production of chiral compounds. In a second project part, the teabag approach was demonstrated scalable up to 150 mL, facilitating the gram-scale manufacturing of (1 R, 2 R) - 1 -phenylpropane- 1, 2 -diol in a 1 -pot 2 -step cascade. As suitable reaction vessel, not only novel reactor concepts such as the SpinChem reactor (Nordic Chemquest AB) were proven useful, but also ubiquitously available lab equipment. In a third project part, the investigated concepts were demonstrated transferable to two more catalysts, now granting stereoselective access to all four diastereoisomers of 1 -phenylpropane- 1, 2 -diol at industrially relevant product concentrations. To achieve this goal, a combination of reaction engineering and solvent engineering was applied. By the implementation of “smart” diol co-substrates up to 90 mol% of co-substrate could be saved during oxidoreduction in two of the final cascades. At the same time, product yield and space-time-yields obtained met industrial benchmarks while outstandingly small amounts of waste were generated. In summary, the investigation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzyme</b> cascades was strongly facilitated by the teabag approach. The developed module is quickly manufactured and easily manageable, also by users unexperienced in handling of biological systems and can even be used for the preparative production of chiral compounds. The combination of solvent and reaction engineering allowed exceeding industrial threshold and thus illustrated the potential of <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzyme</b> cascades even beyond the investigatory scale...|$|R

In vivo use of a new and potent inhibitor of the Cyp 26 enzymes, ser 2 – 7, demonstrated a function for endogenous Cyp 26 in the brain and that hippocampal RA levels can be raised by ser 2 – 7, altering the effect of RA on differential patterning of cell proliferation in the hippocampal region of neurogenesis, the subgranular zone.

Results: The hepatic expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) subunits and GSH synthase (GS) increased transiently after BDL but fell to 50 % of baseline by 2 weeks. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf 2) trans-activates gene expression via the antioxidant response element (ARE), which controls the expression of all three genes. Despite increased Nrf 2 nuclear levels, Nrf 2 nuclear binding to ARE fell 2 weeks after BDL. Nuclear levels of c-Maf and MafG, which can negatively regulate ARE, were persistently induced during BDL and the dominant proteins bound to ARE on day 14. UDCA and SAMe induced the expression of GCL subunits and raised GSH levels. They increased nuclear Nrf 2 levels, prevented c-Maf and MafG induction and prevented the fall in Nrf 2 nuclear binding to ARE. Combined treatment had additive effects, reduced liver cell death and prevented fibrosis. Conclusions: GSH synthesis falls during later stages of BDL due to lower expression of GSH <b>synthetic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> UDCA and SAMe treatment prevented this fall and combined therapy was more effective on preserving GSH levels and preventing liver injury...|$|R
