5|$|In 2012, a beehive metal <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, {{was criticized}} by the council for {{installment}} adjacent to the children’s play area in Hyde park for looking too rude and phallic. Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved it {{to another part of}} the park.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the courthouse building, the public square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.|$|E

5|$|It was one {{of these}} prizes that, in the year 1986, was won by {{director}} Anja Breien, who decided to sell it through a newspaper advert, as a protest against that year's budget cuts for Norwegian film. The Swedish Film Institute, which had experienced similar cuts and sympathized, bought the sculpture. In 2005, as Breien was presented with an honorary award, she was also given back the original <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> former Minister of Culture and director of the Swedish Film Institute, Åse Kleveland.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were {{closed to the public}} as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E

The Town Hall of the former Metropolitan Borough of Deptford, built in 1905 with decorative <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Henry Poole RA, lies just outside Deptford, on the New Cross Road in New Cross. It was purchased by Goldsmiths College in 2000.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} artwork is {{displayed}} on {{the exterior of the}} building. Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures {{on both sides of the}} main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered Wagon) shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance.

5|$|He {{lived in}} Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, in the {{restored}} Bailey House, designed by Richard Neutra. After his home {{was destroyed by}} a fire in 2007, Simon redesigned it to be environmentally friendly; much of the interior is constructed from recycled materials while solar panels provide virtually its entire power needs. The building has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certificate. He had an extensive art collection; he owned paintings by Thomas Hart Benton, John Singer Sargent {{and one of the}} original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. He also had a <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Robert Graham and works by Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren, Ed Ruscha and Richard Estes.|$|E
5|$|He {{meanwhile}} {{worked under}} Leslie Martin {{as a senior}} architect at the Architects' Department of the London County Council (LCC) from 1949 to 1962. During this period, he oversaw the design of two neighbouring schools in North Hammersmith, {{now known as the}} Phoenix School; he unsuccessfully tried to have the school named after Morris. He was also involved in the design and construction of several modernist, high-rise post-war housing estates, namely Bethnal Green's Avebury Estate and Kennington's Brandon Estate, personally securing a <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Henry Moore for the latter. In his final years in this position he focused on estates in south London, working on Deptford's Pepys Estate and the first designs for what became Thamesmead.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{north of}} Regent Street is the BBC's headquarters, Broadcasting House, whose front {{entrance}} is in Langham Place. Several national radio stations are broadcast from this building. The site had formerly been a {{building on the}} gardens of Foley House designed by James Wyatt and called Wyatt's House. It was demolished in 1928 (with much of the fixtures ending up in the Victoria and Albert Museum) to construct Broadcasting House. Construction was challenging because the building had to be visually similar to other properties on Regent Street, yet also contain over twenty soundproofed studios. The exterior is built of Portland stone and above the front entrance is a <b>sculpture</b> <b>by</b> Eric Gill.|$|E
