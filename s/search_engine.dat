5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the analysis of <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> and meta <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> adoption process by University of Isfahan users during 2009 - 2010 based on the Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory. The main {{aim of the research}} was to study the rate of adoption and recognizing the potentials and effective tools in <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> and meta <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> adoption among University of Isfahan users. The research method was descriptive survey study. The cases of the study were all of the post graduate students of the University of Isfahan. 351 students were selected as the sample and categorized by a stratified random sampling method. Questionnaire was used for collecting data. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS 16 in both descriptive and analytic statistic. For descriptive statistic frequency, percentage and mean were used, while for analytic statistic t-test and Kruskal-Wallis non parametric test (H-test) were used. The finding of t-test and Kruscal-Wallis indicated that the mean of <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> and meta <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> adoption did not show statistical differences gender, level of education and the faculty. Special <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> adoption process was different in terms of gender but not in terms of the level of education and the faculty. Other results of the research indicated that among general <b>search</b> <b>engines,</b> Google had the most adoption rate. In addition, among the special <b>search</b> <b>engines,</b> Google Scholar and among the meta <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> Mamma had the most adopting rate. Findings also showed that friends played an important role on how students adopted general <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> while professors had important role on how students adopted special <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> and meta <b>search</b> <b>engines.</b> Moreover, results showed that the place where students got the most acquaintance with <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> and meta <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> was in the university. The finding showed that the curve of adoption rate was not normal and it was not also in S-shape. Morover, among simple and advanced pages of Google, a specific bias toward simple search pages could be seen in users. This part of the study confirmed Rogers’ theory. Other results of the study indicated that renouncement of innovation was not only in decision phase. This part of the investigation was in conflict with Rogers’ theory...|$|R

They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell lysate, in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope.

40|$|This paper aims to {{find out}} the {{possible}} effect of the use or nonuse of diacritics in Yoruba search queries on the performance of major <b>search</b> <b>engines,</b> AOL, Bing, Google and Yahoo!, in retrieving documents. 30 Yoruba queries created from the most searched keywords from Nigeria on Google search logs were submitted to the <b>search</b> <b>engines.</b> The <b>search</b> queries were posed to the <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> without diacritics and then with diacritics. All of the <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> retrieved more sites in response to the queries without diacritics. Also, they all retrieved more precise results for queries without diacritics. The <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> also answered more queries without diacritics. There {{was no significant difference in}} the precision values of any two of the four <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> for diacritized and undiacritized queries.
