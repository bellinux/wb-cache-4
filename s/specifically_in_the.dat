More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, <b>specifically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
