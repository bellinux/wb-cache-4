He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{defense of}} the APL community, APL {{requires}} less coding to type in, and keyboard mappings become memorized over time. Also, special APL keyboards are manufactured and in use today, as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating system platforms such as Microsoft Windows. The reported productivity gains assume that one will <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> working in APL to make memorization of the symbols, their semantics, and keyboard mappings worthwhile.|$|E
25|$|While Livingstone had a {{great impact}} on British Imperialism, he did so at a {{tremendous}} cost to his family. In his absences, his children grew up missing their father, and his wife Mary (daughter of Mary and Robert Moffat), whom he wed in 1845, endured very poor health, and died of malaria on 27 April 1862 trying to follow him in Africa. He had six children: Robert reportedly died in the American Civil War; Agnes (b. 1847), Thomas, Elizabeth (who died at two months), William Oswell (nicknamed Zouga because of the river along which he was born, in 1851) and Anna Mary (b. 1858). Only Agnes, William Oswell and Anna Mary married and had children. His one regret in later life was that he did not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> with his children.|$|E

25|$|Champe Ransom, whom Stevenson {{hired as}} an {{assistant}} in the 1970s, wrote an unpublished report about Stevenson's work, which Edwards cites in his Immortality (1992) and Reincarnation (1996). According to Ransom, Edwards wrote, Stevenson asked the children leading questions, filled in gaps in the narrative, did not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> interviewing them, and left too long a period between the claimed recall and the interview; it was often {{years after the first}} mention of a recall that Stevenson learned about it. In only eleven of the 1,111 cases Ransom looked at had there been no contact between the families of the deceased and of the child before the interview; in addition, according to Ransom, seven of those eleven cases were seriously flawed. He also wrote that there were problems with the way Stevenson presented the cases, in that he would report his witnesses' conclusions, rather than the data upon which the conclusions rested. Weaknesses in cases would be reported in a separate part of his books, rather than during the discussion of the cases themselves. Ransom concluded that it all amounted to anecdotal evidence of the weakest kind.|$|E

His schooling was unsuccessful however, and he failed his Fiji Junior Certificate Examination (tenth year) in 1984. Serevi blamed his love for rugby, saying he [...] "played too much and didn't <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> studying." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the product}} was not {{publicly}} released, many questioned whether [...] "Microsoft had lost its senses" [...] and {{the product was}} widely derided. Critics contended that the product {{was a waste of}} money and doomed to fail. Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines, how hygienic it would be to share keyboards in a public loo, and {{what would happen if the}} keyboard were to be urinated upon. Critics also questioned whether users would <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> in the loo to make use of the internet facilities, noting that [...] "most port-a-potty users stay only long enough to relieve themselves without having to inhale." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{story and}} {{characters}} were generally criticised, with Game Informer stating that [...] "Amanda exhibits little growth or personality, other than concern for her fellow humans {{and a desire}} not to die gruesomely." [...] Similarly, Blake Peterson of Game Revolution noted that none of characters are fully developed. According to him, [...] "we never <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> with them to build the emotional bond necessary for their inevitable deaths to mean anything." [...] GameTrailers said {{that most of the}} computer terminals found in the game contain unoriginal logs to describe predictable events, but also remarked that reading reports from different computer terminals [...] "grounds Sevastopol in an appreciable way." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Buczynski got {{in contact}} with Harold Moss, {{the founder of the}} Church of the Eternal Source (CEW), a Kemetic Pagan group which he had created in 1970. Fascinated by the {{religion}} of Ancient Egypt which the CES wanted to revive, Buczynski joined the order, being ordained as a priest on July 19. Adopting the ritual name of [...] "Un-Nefer", he devoted himself to the worship of the goddess Isis, organizing a temple based in New York and beginning the publication of a newsletter, which he titled Esbat. His relationship with Moss, and with the CES' secretary Ron Myron, was however strained. Although Moss was himself a homosexual, he disagreed with Buczynski's effeminate nature, while Myron had taken a dislike to Buczynski as soon as the latter had been ordained, in particular believing that he didn't <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> responding to enquiries.|$|E
2500|$|Blagojevich {{was often}} {{at odds with}} members of both parties in the state legislature. Democratic {{legislator}} Jack Franks said that the reason Blagojevich had problems passing laws {{with the cooperation of}} the General Assembly is that he did not <b>spend</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> with the legislature. [...] "That’s a real reason he has such poor relations with the Legislature and can’t get any of his agenda passed, because he doesn’t talk to anybody." [...] When lawmakers working on a budget during a special session met at 10am rather than 2pm, and Blagojevich's attorney threatened that the Governor was considering legal action against the involved representatives, Democratic Rep. Joe Lyons told reporters, [...] "We have a madman. The man is insane." ...|$|E
30|$|Access {{to other}} participants’ {{contributions}} {{can lead to}} synergy, as is seen in research on electronic brainstorming[44]. Consequently, we hypothesised that giving user participants’ access to others’ contributions would increase the usefulness of their design feedback.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not <b>spending</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|R

Almalki was on sabbatical leave {{at the time of}} Khadr's return. The two managers clashed, as Khadr's work ethic had changed after his injury. He had become a demanding workaholic who began alienating his colleagues. Almalki left HCI early, citing frustration with Khadr.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{difficult}} climbs in the region, {{and many have}} died on the peaks of the Cordillera Blanca.

He or she will use the traits of the former pack to find and develop a new one if possible. This may involve establishing mating dominance of a certain member of another pack. This refreshes the idea that this behavior is suggestive of rejected inbreeding within a social system.|$|R

The most notable creation of the violet rings are crystals that encase prisoners from other lantern corps on the Zamaron planet. Over time, the rings of the prisoners trapped in stasis within the crystals are infected with violet energy.
