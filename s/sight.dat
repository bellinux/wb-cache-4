5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb <b>Sight</b> in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting <b>sight,</b> using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting <b>sight,</b> which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the <b>sight</b> pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E
5|$|P90 USG:The P90 USG (United States Government) {{model is}} similar to the {{standard}} P90, except the reflex <b>sight</b> housing is aluminium, and the <b>sight</b> has a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex <b>sight</b> can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different <b>sight.</b>|$|E
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the <b>sight</b> head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The <b>sight</b> head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector <b>sight</b> that {{was easy to see}} at night. The <b>sight</b> could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
50|$|Each holiday group {{includes}} {{an equal number}} of blind/partially <b>sighted</b> and <b>sighted</b> individuals. Blind travellers pair daily with different <b>sighted</b> ones, and the <b>sighted</b> traveller describes the <b>sights</b> to their blind partner. The role of the <b>sighted</b> individual is to be a fellow traveller and not to act as a carer. <b>Sighted</b> travellers receive a discount on the price of their holiday in return for this ‘use of their eyes’.|$|R

5000|$|A {{hand compass}} (also {{hand bearing compass}} or <b>sighting</b> compass) is a compact {{magnetic}} compass capable of one-hand use and fitted with a <b>sighting</b> device to record a precise bearing or azimuth to a given target or to determine a location. [...] Hand or <b>sighting</b> compasses include instruments with simple notch-and-post alignment ("gunsights"), prismatic <b>sights,</b> direct or lensatic <b>sights,</b> and mirror/vee (reflected-image) <b>sights.</b> With the additional precision offered by the <b>sighting</b> arrangement, and depending upon construction, <b>sighting</b> compasses provide increased accuracy when measuring precise bearings to an objective.|$|R
5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to the <b>sight,</b> it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the sighting head itself. The gyro on the <b>sight</b> head only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its roll axis.|$|E
5|$|Hare {{coursing}} is {{the pursuit}} of hares with greyhounds and other sighthounds, which chase the hare by <b>sight</b> and not by scent.|$|E
5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the <b>sight.</b> The <b>sight</b> can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E

5|$|PS90 Standard: The PS90 Standard is {{the current}} model of the PS90 offered by FN Herstal. It {{features}} a MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail fitted {{to the top of}} the receiver, which allows the shooter to mount their preferred optical <b>sight.</b> The rail includes a set of integrated iron sights, as backup in case the primary <b>sight</b> is damaged. The PS90 Standard is available with either an olive drab or black frame.|$|E
50|$|The ancient Chinese {{crossbow}} often {{included a}} metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as iron <b>sights.</b> Modern crossbow <b>sights</b> often use similar technology to modern firearm <b>sights,</b> such as red dot <b>sights</b> and telescopic <b>sights.</b> Many crossbow scopes feature multiple crosshairs {{to compensate for}} the significant effects of gravity over different ranges. In most cases, a newly bought crossbow will need to be <b>sighted</b> for accurate shooting.|$|R
50|$|All Model 52's {{with iron}} <b>sights</b> were {{equipped}} with receiver-mounted aperture <b>sights,</b> never barrel mounts, tang mounts or open <b>sights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Factory {{accessories}} include: fixed metal three-dot iron <b>sights,</b> fixed tritium night <b>sights,</b> adjustable sports iron <b>sights,</b> adjustable {{optic fibre}} iron <b>sights,</b> laser pointers, tactical lights, magazine flashlight adapters, holsters, magazines, and magazine loaders are offered as factory accessories.|$|R
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} fashion as the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} reflex <b>sight</b> housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex <b>sight</b> can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different <b>sight,</b> and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex <b>sight</b> is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the <b>sight</b> head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the <b>sight</b> manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the <b>sight</b> head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the <b>sight.</b> Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the <b>sight)</b> were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the <b>sight</b> line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The <b>sight</b> does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hand compass}} (also {{hand bearing compass}} or <b>sighting</b> compass) is a compact {{magnetic}} compass capable of one-hand use and fitted with a <b>sighting</b> device to record a precise bearing or azimuth to a given target or to determine a location. [...] Hand or <b>sighting</b> compasses include instruments with simple notch-and-post alignment ("gunsights"), prismatic <b>sights,</b> direct or lensatic <b>sights,</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The MP7 {{features}} a full-length, top-mounted Picatinny rail that comes as standard with folding fore and rear iron <b>sights</b> attached. When the <b>sights</b> are folded flat, they resemble Patridge style open <b>sights.</b> Folded up, they feature aperture <b>sights.</b> The <b>sights</b> {{can easily be}} removed by loosening a single screw and lifting them off. It can fit additional rails {{on the sides of}} the barrel, which allow it to mount commercial optical <b>sights</b> (telescopic and red dot <b>sights),</b> laser aiming modules (LAM), and tactical flashlights. It can also accept a suppressor, and its tailor-made suppressor does not interfere with its accuracy or rate of fire.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the <b>sight</b> is only truly parallax free at infinity, the <b>sight</b> has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the <b>sight</b> and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the <b>sight)</b> this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the <b>sight</b> parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the <b>sight</b> itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the <b>sight</b> on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot <b>sight,</b> with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable <b>sight</b> with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1938: new conical turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of fuel tanks. Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 telescopic <b>sight</b> (or a TOS telescopic <b>sight</b> on the 1938 model).|$|E
50|$|Other mammals {{seen in the}} {{sanctuary}} include: black panther (rare), sloth bear (rare, occasional sightings near caves and grasslands), Indian gaur (commonly <b>sighted</b> near the grasslands, in forest clearings, and near water), barking deer (commonly <b>sighted</b> near forest clearings and waterholes), sambar deer (occasionally <b>sighted</b> on grasslands and main roads), leopard (extremely rare), ruddy mongoose (frequently <b>sighted</b> at daybreak and dusk on forest paths), Asian palm civet (commonly <b>sighted</b> on main roads and near village settlements), small Indian civet (commonly <b>sighted</b> on main roads, dhole (rarely <b>sighted</b> transient mammal in the forests), jungle cat (extremely rare, <b>sighted</b> by researchers and locals on a few occasions), mouse deer (rare, occasional sightings on trails), wild boar (frequently <b>sighted</b> at dawn and dusk), Indian hare (commonly <b>sighted</b> on the plateaux), giant squirrel (documented in the forests), flying squirrel (a nocturnal mammal, documented in dense evergreen forests), black-faced langur (commonly found in small groups in the tree canopy), Indian pangolin (rarely found in secondary forests), slender loris (rare and endangered), bonnet macaque (commonly found in troupes).|$|R
50|$|Whitworth rifles were {{equipped}} with either Enfield style <b>sights</b> or telescopic <b>sights.</b> The telescopic <b>sights</b> were more accurate, {{but had a}} reputation for bruising the user's eye due to the rifle's recoil.|$|R

5|$|The Mark XIV Computing Bomb <b>Sight</b> was a vector bombsight {{developed}} by Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command during the Second World War. The bombsight was {{also known as}} the Blackett <b>sight</b> after its primary inventor, P. M. S. Blackett. Production of a slightly modified version was also undertaken in the United States as the Sperry T-1, which was interchangeable with UK-built version. It was the RAF's standard bombsight for {{the second half of the}} War.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex <b>sight,</b> but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 <b>sight,</b> which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The <b>sight</b> is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex <b>sight</b> is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex <b>sight</b> housing.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example of}} devices {{that show the}} PIP are red dot <b>sights</b> like the M68 Aimpoint. Such <b>sights,</b> Like on a HUD's, are {{collimated}} reflector <b>sights,</b> so the dot always appears over the weapon's impact point, regardless of the shooter's eye position.
