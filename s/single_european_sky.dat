Lufttransport renewed the {{contract}} {{for a new}} three years starting 1 August 2008, after {{they were the only}} bidder in the tender. They received NOK102 million for three years. During this period better navigational aids were installed, allowing helicopters to operate during twice per day also during the dark period of the year. Lufttransport was the only bidder for the following contract, which lasts three years from 1 August 2011. The subsidies for this period are NOK96 million. Because it only serves helicopters, Værøy does not have an aerodrome flight information service (AFIS). As part of the <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Sky</b> ATM Research program, Avinor installed a remote AFIS service at Værøy, which is controlled from Bodø. If successful, the program may result in regional airports in Norway receiving remote AFIS services.|$|E
500|$|The Single Eurasian Sky programme, {{administered}} by the Eurasian Economic Commission, outlines {{the creation of a}} single market for air services and a single air traffic zone. The single air traffic zone {{would make it easier for}} airlines to draw up new flight paths, thereby increasing the number of flights flying through the region. Eurasian Commissioner, Daniyal Akhmetov, said that it would be created on a step-by-step basis. In June 2014, Belarusian Airline Belavia stated that it was ready to move towards the development of the Single Eurasian Sky. The terms and conditions of operation in the common aviation market have not yet been agreed on. However, the project is likely to be modelled on the European Union's <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Sky.</b> The project will reportedly help turn the airspace of the Eurasian Union into a popular transit hub between Europe and Southeast Asia. [...] "We should understand that currently, the aviation companies of Kazakhstan and Belarus are not able to compete with Russia's aviation companies. Therefore, the programme will envisage a phasing, creating a competitive environment and so on", Eurasian Commissioner Akhmetov said.|$|E

This edition contains a new module on Port Services and analyses also the <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Skies</b> programme. The volume, after an Introduction to the relevant EU provisions, is divided in four modules: I. Air transport; II. Rail transport; III. Port services; IV. Passengers’ rights. It includes also the most important decisions by EU courts and by the European Commission which have opened and shaped the market for trans-European transport services...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} DLR’s Airport Control Center Simulator “ACCES”, {{a platform}} designed for ATM related validation activities. This platform is specifically useful to conduct gaming exercises coupled with real-time simulations. Gaming {{has been used}} for several decades in strategic military planning (“war games”) and also in operations research. The fundamental idea is to provide a scenario and a set of actions that can be performed by the actors in the game. These actions affect the scenario in a clearly specified way. In addition there is a set of rules defining when and how actions may be performed by specific actors. The result of a gaming exercise will usually be a certain state of the scenario, derived from the initial scenario, which has been effected by the actions performed during the game. Gaming exercises can be conducted “paper based” and coupled with simulation. In the first case the evolvement of the scenario given specific actions of the actors is written down in a rule set that is handed out to the actors. A game master will conduct the experiment and track the state of the scenario. When coupled to a simulation the actions performed by the participants will directly influence the simulated environment, so that the degree of realism or immersion felt by the actors can be greatly increased. Lately gaming has been also used to study new air traffic management concepts. One project that has studied the use of gaming techniques in this area is the European 6 th framework project EPISODE- 3, which focused on innovative validation methods to be applied to the <b>Single</b> <b>European</b> <b>Skies</b> ATM Research (SESAR) program. In this project both paper based and simulation coupled gaming exercises have been performed. One of these exercises, dealing with collaborative airport planning, has been performed at DLR using the ACCES platform. The ACCES has been designed as a highly flexible research and validation facility for ATM and airport operations research. It provides a large projection screen to display an overview of the situation or other information relevant to all actors in the exercise. In addition there are eight operator working positions equipped with up to four screens that can be connected to a number of computers on which the simulation and planning tools can run. A separate room provides additional working positions (without projections screen) to simulate a remote control room, e. g. an Airline Operations Center...|$|R
