40|$|ABSTRACT Colour, a vital {{constituent}} of food, {{is indispensable}} {{to the modern}} day consumer {{as a means for}} the rapid identification and ultimate acceptance of food. A number of reviews concerning the toxicology of natural and synthetic dyes, especially those used in food, have appeared since the dyestuffs became potential suspects for causing cancer. A large number of natural or synthetic dyes have been removed from both national and international lists of permitted food colours because of their mutagenic or carcinogenic activity. To the majority of the food additive JECFA/FAO has assigned “Admissible Daily Intake Dose ” –ADI, which are often temporary and emphasized the need for further genotoxic evaluation, since a number of them are reported to be genotoxic below the ADI dose. In India, the problem is severe because in spite of regulation and restrictions by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act of 1954, use of non-permitted food colours is prevalent. We have tested the mutagenic and genotoxic effects of amaranth, and tartrazine utilizing Ames mutagenicity assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow assay.

It is concluded that surgical gloves are a potent inhibitor of early embryonic growth. In an in vitro fertilization programme including follicle aspiration and embryo transfer, contamination of embryos with these gloves should be avoided at all costs. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} lymphoid cells to exert {{cytotoxic}} effects in vivo and in vitro {{has been documented}} by numerous workers (1). However, {{the nature of the}} events during the interactions between effector cells and target cells is largely unknown. Also, the identity of the effector cells has not always been established satisfactorily. Although it is known that the involvement of thymusderived (T) lymphocytes 1 is essential in cell-mediated cytotoxic reactions, recent papers indicate that the cytotoxicity may be mediated by other lymphoid cells (2 - 6). The present communication supplies evidence that macrophages may exert strong extracellular cytoto×icity in vitro, and also gives clues to some of the mechanisms that may be involved. A preliminary report has appeared else-where (7). Materials and Methods Animals. ~he experiments were carried out with inbred (A/J/BOMf and C 3 H/ Tif/BOMf) and hybrid (B 6 D 2 F 1 /BOM [C 57 BL/ 6 q x DBA/ 2]) female mice. B 6 D 2 and C 3 H mice were about 6 wk old while A/J mice were around 4 mo of age. The mice were all killed by overdoses of ether. Cells and Culture Conditlons. [...] Macrophages were obtained by peritoneal washings (8). The cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM), pH 7. 45, with penicillin (Proca-penicillin AL, final concentration 0. 15 g/liter medium) and streptomycin (Streptomycin Novo, final concentration 0. 05 g/liter medium). Experiments were performed with media of 320 mosM (approximately the value for mouse plasma) as determined by freeze point depression. In some cases media of 290 and 260 mosM were used for experiments. The osmolarity was increased or reduced by addition of sodium chloride and <b>sterile,</b> triply <b>distilled</b> <b>water.</b> Heat-inactivated (56 °C, 1 h) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), newborn calf serum (NBCS) (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N. Y.), gamma globulin-free NBCS (Grand Island Biological Co.), and mouse serum produced from B 6 D 2 hybrid mice were added to 20 or 1 %. The macrophages were cultivated in silicone...|$|R
