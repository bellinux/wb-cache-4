Approximately 1,500 MW of projects in Australia have used Windlab intellectual property for <b>site</b> <b>identification</b> purposes. The company co-developed the Oakland's Hill (67MW) wind farm and the Collgar Wind Farm (206MW). With incentives from the ACT large scale feed-in tariff, Windlab is building the Coonooer Bridge Wind Farm, located North West of Bendigo, Victoria. This project is jointly owned by Windlab Limited, Eurus Energy and landholders neighbouring the project and has 6 turbines generating up to 19.4 MW. [...] From 2017, Windlab will begin building the Kiata Wind Farm, a 30MW wind energy project located 50km North West of Horsham, Victoria. Windlab is also developing the Kennedy energy park in North Queensland near Townsville, in two stages: Up to 40 - 50 MW of wind and 40 - 50 MW of solar in the first phase and up to 600 MW of wind and 600 MW of solar in the second phase.
