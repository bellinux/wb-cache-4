5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Bragan {{replaced}} Farrell {{as manager}} {{to begin the}} 1958 season. During a spring training game in March, Garcia <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> a wet pitcher's mound and injured his back. He did not make his first regular season appearance until April 27 and he underwent surgery in June for a herniated disc. He finished {{the season with a}} 1–0 record in six appearances and eight innings of work. That same month, Bragan was fired as manager. He was replaced by former Indians player Joe Gordon, and the Indians finished 77–76.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Viscous Couette flow {{is derived}} for flow between two {{infinitely}} long con-centric rotating cylinders with Navier <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> both. Its axisymmetric linear stability is studied within {{a regime that}} would be hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh’s criterion: opposing gradients of angular velocity and specific angular momentum, based on the rotation rates and radii of the cylinders. Stability conditions are analyzed, by methods based on those of Synge and Chandrasekhar. For sufficiently small <b>slip</b> length <b>on</b> the outer cylinder no instability occurs with arbitrary <b>slip</b> length <b>on</b> the inner cylin-der. As a corollary, <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the inner cylinder is shown to be stabilizing, with no <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the outer cylinder. Two slip configurations are investigated numerically, first with <b>slip</b> only <b>on</b> the outer cylinder, then second with equal <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> both cylinders. It is found that instability does occur (for large outer slip length), and the principle of exchange of stabilities emerges. The instability disappears for sufficiently large slip length in the second case; Rayleigh’s criterion provides an explanation for these phenomena. 1. Introduction. In many areas of scienc...|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} {{simulation}} results, {{it is found}} that when wheels <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the rail and the friction coefficient between the wheel and rail is large enough, unstable vibration of the wheel–rail system will occur, signifying that rail corrugation will arise. Therefore, the effective method for controlling and suppressing rail corrugation in high-speed tracks is to prevent wheels <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> rails. If the wheel does not <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the rail, self-excited vibration of the wheel–rail system will not take place. Thus, rail corrugation will not occur. The present result explains why rail corrugation most probably takes place in train brake sections of tracks. This is because the wheel is easy to <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> the rail due to a low coefficient of friction when a train is braked at a high speed. This result {{can also be used to}} explain why most of rails in high-speed tracks are not subjected to corrugation, where wheel <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> rail rarely takes place.|$|R
5|$|Waddington {{was less}} {{effective}} in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, he <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> wet grass {{when he was}} about to bowl against Leicestershire at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class batting average better than 12 in an English season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E

5|$|Oswald Watt drowned at Bilgola Beach, near Newport, New South Wales, on 21May 1921. Cuts and {{bruising}} on {{his body}} indicated that he had <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> rocks, struck his head, and rolled unconscious into relatively shallow water. Survived by his 15-year-old son, he was accorded a military funeral two days later at St Jude's Church, Randwick. Members of the AFC, Royal Air Force, and Australian Aero Club formed a guard of honour at the service, {{one of the largest}} in the suburb's history, which also included representatives of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army. Among the tributes was a floral wreath from an anonymous group of French admirers, and another that was dropped by parachute from a low-flying plane. On 31May, Watt's body was cremated and his ashes interred in the family vault at St Jude's.|$|E
5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> the {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E
5|$|Jacqui meets {{homeless}} teenager Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{and invites}} {{her to move}} into her flat. At Tony and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring)'s wedding, a bus crashes in to the venue. Rhys becomes trapped under the debris and apologises to Jacqui as he dies in her arms. Jacqui returns home to discover Rhys had planned to leave her and had left a note, detailing his plans to leave her and his affair with a mystery woman. Jacqui becomes suspicious that Cindy {{was having an affair}} with Rhys. Jacqui confronts Cindy who is with Bart's pregnant girlfriend Sinead O'Connor. She accuses Cindy only for Sinead to confess to having sex with Rhys. Jacqui confronts Sinead and realises Rhys is the father of her baby. She allows Sinead to keep the baby's paternity a secret when Bart proposes to her. On Christmas Day at the McQueens, which Tony and Cindy have both been invited to, Jacqui discovers items belonging to Rhys in the closet, including his mobile phone, which her family had been hiding from her. She recharges Rhys' phone and discovers that it was Cindy he {{was having an affair with}}. A disgusted Jacqui attacks Cindy with a Santa statue, Cindy recovers in hospital and is persuaded by Tony to keep quiet about attack and say she <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> the ice. Jacqui drags Cindy from Hospital to Rhys' grave and warns her to stay away.|$|E
