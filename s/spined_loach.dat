Slow flowing drainage channels {{such as those}} managed by IDBs can form an important habitat for a diverse community of aquatic and emergent plants, invertebrates and higher organisms. IDB channels form {{one of the last}} refuges in the UK of the BAP registered <b>spined</b> <b>loach</b> (Cobitis Taenia), a small nocturnal bottom feeding fish that have been recorded only in the lower parts of the Trent and Great Ouse catchments, and in some small rivers and drains in Lincolnshire and East Anglia. All IDBs are currently engaging with their own individual biodiversity action plans which will further enhance their environmental role.|$|E

40|$|Taxonomic {{investigation}} of <b>spined</b> <b>loaches</b> from Dalmatia and Herzegovina {{was conducted on}} specimens from 14 localities. The results of the detailed morphological investigations were combined with genetic data (based on one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes) in order to resolve the taxonomic status of each Cobitis population. Among the investigated features of external morphology, the appearance of spots on the caudal fin base {{turned out to have}} the greatest diagnostic value. Furthermore, the number of branched fin rays enabled the discrimination of several species. No morphometric character alone could ensure determination of any Cobitis species. Nevertheless, groups of populations that are more similar in their body shapes correspond to mitochondrial phylogenetic lineages. Based on molecular genetic markers, Dalmatian and Herzegovinian <b>spined</b> <b>loaches</b> form independent lineages inside the Adriatic phylogenetic group. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic reconstruction revealed six monophyletic lineages, corresponding to six species distributed in the investigated area. The population distributed in Mostarsko blato karstic field in Bosnia and Herzegovina is described as a new species based on a unique combination of morphological characters: a single triangular Canestrini scale; usually 51 / 2 branched anal fin rays, 61 / 2 branched dorsal fin rays, 14 branched caudal fin rays; no spots in the surface pigmentation layer on the cauda...|$|R

40|$|Actinopterygian fishes {{exhibit the}} {{greatest}} taxonomical diversity of all vertebrates, making this group attractive to address numerous evolutionary questions. The role of molecular cytogenetics and cytogenomics further increase because {{recent advances in}} these fields provide more comprehensive view of fish genome organization and evolutionary dynamics, responsible for this amazing diversity. My Thesis investigates the genome organization of selected fish lineages, namely basal lineages of Actinopterygians (Lepisosteidae and Amiidae) and Teleosts (Pantodontidae), together with "modern" fishes Cobitidae and Coregonidae. I have integrated conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques together with phylogenetic and statistical approaches. Publications included into the Thesis describe e. g. the cytogenetic variability and dynamics in closely related fish species of the genus Coregonus {{and the impact of}} repetitive sequences on the ecological speciation. In contrast to the recent cytotaxonomical diversity of Coregonids, we have detected a karyotype stability associated with asexual reproduction in <b>spined</b> <b>loaches</b> of the genus Cobitis. In the subsequent publication, we describe a surprising AT/GC genome organization in gars (Atractosteus and Lepisosteus) and summarize the knowledge of genome [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} {{may result}} in asexual hybrid lineages that reproduce via parthenogenesis. Contrary to true parthenogens, sperm-dependent asexuals (gynogens and hybridogens) are restricted to the range of bisexual species, generally the parental taxa, by their need for a sperm donor. It has been documented that asexual lineages may rarely use sperm from a non-parental species or even switch a host. The available literature reports do not allow distinguishing, between whether such host switches arise by the expansion of asexuals out of their parental's range (and into that of another's) or by the local extinction of a parental population followed by a host switch. The present study combines new and previously collected data on the distribution and history of gynogenetic <b>spined</b> <b>loaches</b> (Cobitis) of hybrid origin. We identified at least three clonal lineages that have independently switched their sperm dependency to different non-parental Cobitis species, and in cases incorporated their genomes. Our current knowledge of European Cobitis species and their hybrids suggests that this pattern most probably results from the expansion of gynogenetic lineages into new areas. Such expansion was independent of the original parental species. This suggests that sperm dependence is not as restrictive to geographical expansion when compared with true parthenogenesis as previously thought...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} perform {{environmental}} impact assessment on Jangheung Dam construction, we investigated fish fauna and community from February to November 2005. Fishes were collected seasonally in 3 sites at upstream and 5 sites at downstream of the dam using cast net and kick net. A total number of fish caught from the study area was 8, 733 fish representing 15 families and 45 species, and Cyprinidae and Gobiidae Families had twenty-four (53. 3 %) and four (8. 9 %) species, respectively. However, rest of families composed of one to three species. There was the 2 nd-class endangered species, Sand lamprey (Lampetra reissneri), found in the upstream (Site 3) of the dam, and fourteen Korean endemic species (31. 1 %) including southern king <b>spine</b> <b>loach</b> (Iksookimia hugowolfeldi). In the mean time, one foreign introduced species, Crucian carp. (Carassius cuvieri) was mostly found in upstream of the dam among the 45 species. The number of species in each site ranged 20 to 34 species, and it tended to increase toward to downstream. The species of pale chub (Zacco platypus, 43. 5 % relative abundance) and dark chub (Zacco temminckii, 14. 7 %) were dominant and subdominant species, and 14 species including eel (Anguilla japonica) comprised less than 0. 1 % relative abundance (rare species) of the total catch. Compared to assessments in previous years (1998 ~ 2004), {{the number of species}} found in 2005 was the maximum. Fifteen species were not confirmed at this year even if they were found in previous years, and some of them including hickory shad (Konosirus punctatus) were peripheral species of fish collected in only single year. Whereas three species (Lampetra reissneri, Carassius cuvieri, Hemiculter eigenmanni) was confirmed {{for the first time in}} 2005. Based on the results, modification of fish fauna and community in Tamjin River watershed should be monitored in detail in order to assess any negative effect due to dam construction, and additional investigation for the endangered species needs to be performed to establish conservation of their habitat and population...|$|R
