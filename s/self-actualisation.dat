5000|$|Schott {{discusses}} <b>self-actualisation</b> {{in connection}} with management, noting Maslow's term [...] "eupsychian managers" [...] for managers who have reached <b>self-actualisation,</b> and also discusses why some self-actualising individuals may feel inhibited against aspirations to management positions. Schott also, {{in connection with}} Jung, discusses the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator in relation to management. The observation that self-actualisers may feel inhibited against moving into management positions has an especially acute implication for transpersonal management studies, since, in transpersonal psychology, self-transcendence rather than <b>self-actualisation</b> is frequently viewed as the apex of psychological health; {{the extent to which}} self-transcendence is incompatible with desire for management positions is a topic that awaits further research.|$|E
50|$|That humans psychologically {{require the}} life {{activities}} {{that lead to}} their <b>self-actualisation</b> as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance, because the capitalist mode of production eventually will exploit and impoverish the proletariat until compelling them to social revolution for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of Marxist humanism; in The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism (1992), Raya Dunayevskaya discussed and described {{the existence of the}} desire for self-activity and <b>self-actualisation</b> among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy.|$|E

50|$|In the parlance {{of modern}} {{behavioural}} sciences the term <b>self-actualisation</b> {{is defined as}} a fundamental tendency to maximum realisation and fulfilment of one's potential.

He sets his own standards of performance and after achieving them keeps raising them to a higher level. It is a continual upward spiral.|$|E

This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of Individuation or <b>self-actualisation.</b> Such peak experiences are hypothetically devoid of any karma (nirvana or moksha).|$|E

50|$|Rogers {{agrees that}} we may behave {{aggressive}} and violent at times, but at such times we are neurotic and are not functioning as fully developed human beings. Rogers reverses Freud's concept of neuroticism and thinks that what Freud has construed as our natural state of being is actually unnatural and unhealthy behaviour. For Rogers, {{the core of our}} nature is essentially positive and aligned towards <b>self-actualisation,</b> while for Freud, we solely are driven by sexual and aggressive instincts. Recent research support Rogers' point of view as it has shown that people with an optimistic style of thought tend to cope more effectively with stress than do people who have a pessimistic style.|$|E
5000|$|Ecological self {{is central}} to the school of Experiential Deep Ecology, which, {{based on the work of}} Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss, argues that through the process of <b>self-actualisation,</b> one transcends the nations of the individuated [...] "egoic" [...] self and arrives at a {{position}} of an ecological self. So long as one is working within the narrower concept of self, Næss argues, environmentally responsible behaviour is a form of altruism, a [...] "doing good for the other", which historically has been a precarious ethical basis, usually involved in exhorting others to [...] "be good". Næss argues that in his Ecosophy, the enlargement of the ego-self to the eco-self results in environmentally responsible behaviour as a form of self-interest.|$|E

50|$|Theories of {{motivation}} provide a theoretical basis for reward management {{though some of}} the best known ones have emerged from the psychology discipline. Perhaps the first and best known of these comes from the work of Abraham Maslow. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs describes a pyramid comprising a series of layers from at the base the most fundamental physiological needs such as food, water, shelter and sex, rising to the apex where <b>self-actualisation</b> needs included morality and creativity. Maslow saw these levels of needs being fulfilled one at a time in sequence from bottom to top. Employment and the resources it brings are classed under ‘safety needs’ (level 2) while the workplace may also contribute to a sense of ‘belonging’ (level 3) and recognition at work can satisfy the need for ‘self-esteem’ (level 4).|$|E
50|$|Humanist {{psychologist}} Carl Rogers opposed psychoanalytic personality {{theory as}} he was dissatisfied with the 'dehumanising nature' of this school of thought. The central tenet of humanistic psychology is that people have drives that lead them to engage in activities resulting in personal satisfaction and a contribution to society: the actualising tendency. This tendency is present in all organisms and {{can be defined as}} the motivation present inevery life form to develop its potentials to the fullest extent. Humanistic psychology is based on an optimistic view of human nature and the direction of people's movement is basically towards <b>self-actualisation.</b> Some might criticise Rogers as being a naive optimist and point out the violent history of humanity. Rogers defends his view by referring to the fact that his theory is based on more than twenty-five years of experience in psychotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Rogerian {{personality}} theory {{distinguishes between}} two personalities. The real self is created through the actualising tendency, {{it is the}} self that one can become. The demands of society, however, do not always support the actualising tendency and {{we are forced to}} live under conditions that are out of step with our tendencies. The ideal self is the ideal created through the demands of society. Rogers does not see it as something to strive for (that is the real self) but an ideal imposed on us we can never fully reach. Rogers' view of 'hidden' personality relates to the person one could be given the right circumstances within society. For an individual to be truly happy and for <b>self-actualisation</b> to be realised, the public and hidden selves must be as similar as possible. Rogers believed that when all aspects of a person's life, surroundings and thoughts are in harmony, thus the ideal state of congruence is reached.|$|E

5000|$|A self-loathing yet self-obsessed neurotic, Edina's self-image {{is based}} on 1960s {{counterculture}} {{and the world of}} fashion and celebrity. She is fixated on self-indulgence and her ideas of <b>self-actualisation.</b> Edina subscribes to every trend that arises, including New Age spirituality—she calls herself a Buddhist—and feng shui. She aspires to move in the highest circles of creativity, fashion, and celebrity. She considers herself a follower of the latest trends, but, having no real sense of style of her own, Edina is actually a fashion victim, parading the latest fashion trends without understanding them or understanding what looks good on her.

Edina is mildly overweight but not nearly so much as she believes herself to be and frequently attempts to conceal her bloated body with heavy, swaddling clothing which only adds to her absurd appearance. Others often draw attention to Edina's weight, aware of her obsession with it which only adds to her neurosis.|$|E
5000|$|In the East Coast, the {{teaching}} professions, especially teaching English, {{was a popular}} option in the European, Eurasian, Peranakan and Chinese communities who descended from privileged colonial Civil Service families for the Queen's Crown, {{from the beginning of}} the last century up till the 1970s. From the 1970s onwards, the permanent decolonisation meant that the original Queen's English taught began to experience deformation and modification from other languages.

Their Siglap/Katong accent, though not a pure form of Queen's English, is considered to be the prestigious variant of English in Singapore.

50|$|Michel Ngue-Awane {{argues that}} {{although}} African countries won the physical {{battle against the}} colonial powers’ occupation, they are still struggling to liberate their minds. A history of subtle and systematic indoctrination of their subconscious, through programmes {{put in place to}} control them, left its shadow, with African people unable to take action to change their status quo. A history of tales has fooled Africans to believe their situation could change simply by the wave of a magic wand. ‘The Colonial Subconscious’ -a theory that many of the current struggles faced by Africans people are exacerbated unconsciously by themselves, due to their lack of actions to change systems that were put in place to control them. By keeping and working with these systems, they perpetuate their self-annihilation, living as dependants individuals under siege- and encourages readers to reflect on their own lives and sense of self. By identifying these repressed ideologies the individual can confront the negative shackles and enter a positive stage of <b>self-actualisation.</b> This releases the subconscious and invites in new experiences and opportunities leaving the individual able to take firm, positive action and full control over their destiny. Only after individuals in Africa have improved and honoured themselves, can they collectively rise above all prejudices and stereotypes ensuring freedom, peace and prosperity for future generations.|$|E

In his escape, he kills or maims several Dolls and Dollhouse staff members (including Echo's previous handler) but leaves Echo unscathed. After his escape from the Dollhouse, Alpha begins to send anonymous packages to Paul Ballard that hint at the existence of the Dollhouse and Echo's former identity. Alpha reveals himself after posing as an Environmental Systems Consultant involved {{in the construction of the}} Los Angeles Dollhouse facility, Stephen Kepler, whom Ballard has tracked down. He leads Ballard into the Dollhouse, takes control of the security and automated systems, and leaves with Echo. Though Echo escapes him, he remains at large.

50|$|There are {{considered}} to be three stages of followers within a brand (McAlexander, James H., John W Schouten and Harold F. Koening, 2002). It starts with the ‘brand following’, continued by the ‘connectedness’, with the third and final stage being that of ‘consumer conformity’. Brand following can be described as consumers that share the same strong affiliation in a brand, create a bond or ‘relationship’ on the simple basis that they share a common interest. At this point, there is more emphasis on the brand itself with an underlying relationship between common consumers arising. The second stage being that of connectedness, can be described as the brand users developing a further sense of togetherness while also initiating a stronger bond {{in the way that they}} display a sort of empathy towards one another. In this stage, users are now becoming more interested in other uses, the culture of building a community, and the apparent bond that is forming within such a community. The third and final stage of ‘consumer conformity’ suggests that there is no longer any real individual consumer, but a well formed group/population. It is said that people associate themselves with groups or other people to make sense of themselves or essentially to reach <b>self-actualisation.</b> Through doing so, one would feel a certain level of fulfilment that helps to energise a group, providing strength and loyalty to a brand. A good example of a strong brand community within a well-known cult brand is that of the ‘Hell’s Angels’. The Hell’s Angels are so devoted to Harley Davidsons that it is said within their own wedding ceremonies they use the Harley owner’s manual as a replacement for the bible (McAlexander, James H., John W Schouten and Harold F. Koening, 2002).|$|E
