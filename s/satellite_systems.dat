5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the <b>satellite</b> <b>systems</b> of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass. This may be because Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E
5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons. This great perturbation may possibly be the reason why the satellite system of Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet and all its moons seen in the <b>satellite</b> <b>systems</b> of all the other giant planets.|$|E

25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area.

It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation <b>Satellite</b> <b>Systems</b> like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations.

40|$|A {{method to}} control the librational motion of a {{tethered}} <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in an elliptic orbit is presented. To simplify the analysis, gravity is treated as the only external force affecting the tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system,</b> only in-plane motion is considered, and the flexibility and mass of tethers are neglected. The tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> treated in this paper consists of two subsatellites and a mother satellite, such as the space shuttle, connected together in series via massless tethers. This type of tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> has very important applications in Earth observation, space observation, communications, and satellite constellations. The librational motion of the tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in an elliptic orbit {{is known to be}} chaotic and can be stabilized to undergo periodic motion by the delayed feedback control method. The periodic motion of a tethered satellite in a circular orbit is employed as the reference trajectory for tracking by the actual tethered satellite, which is in an elliptic orbit. The decoupling and model tracking control methods, based on differential geometric control theory are combined with the delayed feedback control method in a new approach to controlling the librational motion of the tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in elliptic orbits. The results of numerical simulations show that the proposed control scheme has good performance in controlling the librational motion of a tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in an elliptic orbit...|$|R

25|$|The {{satellite}} system of Uranus is notably {{different from those}} of Jupiter and Saturn in that it lacks precise resonances among the larger moons, while the majority of the larger moons of Jupiter (3 of the 4 largest) and of Saturn (6 of the 8 largest) are in mean-motion resonances. In all three <b>satellite</b> <b>systems,</b> moons were likely captured into mean-motion resonances in the past as their orbits shifted due to tidal dissipation (a process by which satellites gain orbital energy {{at the expense of the}} primary's rotational energy, affecting inner moons disproportionately). In the Uranian system, however, due to the planet's lesser degree of oblateness, and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier. Lower oblateness of the primary alters its gravitational field in such a way that different possible resonances are spaced more closely together. A larger relative satellite size increases the strength of their interactions. Both factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondary resonance, and/or tidal evolution-driven increases in orbital eccentricity or inclination.|$|E
25|$|University {{interpretation}} and up-to-date understanding of export control regulations {{and willingness to}} seek opinions from the U.S. State Department affect the research that can be conducted on their campuses; for example, the University of Michigan successfully obtained an opinion from the Department of State stating that satellite development work on an (at the time) ITAR-controlled satellite being conducted by a student group containing both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens was considered fundamental research and was allowed to proceed. In contrast, as of March 2016, Stanford's Export Control Officer maintains that all <b>satellite</b> <b>systems</b> are controlled defense articles under the ITAR (despite their reclassification under the EAR in 2014) and, based on NASA criteria for automatic designation of a research project as fundamental research, does not consider projects above TRL 4 to be fundamental research, limiting the activities of laboratories and project-based groups on campus. This and similar policies are particularly damaging to international students studying aerospace engineering or related fields at U.S. universities, as opportunities to gain practical experience in their studies through internships are, due to licensing requirements, typically not offered to them at U.S. aerospace companies, and on-campus projects, when allowed, offer an alternate route for developing skills like those obtained through internships and co-op programs.|$|E
