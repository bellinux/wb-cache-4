5000|$|End Sanctuary Cities Policy: After the <b>shooting</b> <b>incidence</b> in {{the summer}} of 2015 when Kathryn Steinle was killed by an undocumented immigrant, Francisco Sanchez, in San Francisco, the Federation for American Immigrant Reform {{organized}} the [...] "End Sanctuary Cities" [...] movement, arguing that the Federal government should end the sanctuary cities policy because the influx of illegal immigrants is the fundamental cause of criminal activities in the United States. Sanctuary cities including San Francisco are the jurisdictions where illegal immigrants are protected from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Through lobbying in Washington D.C, and actively promoting its ideas on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, FAIR is calling for the Federal government's denial of federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions and amendment of IIRIRA Section 642 that hampers the collection of immigration information from immigrants in the United States.|$|E
40|$|On September 16 2007 the {{employees}} of the U. S. security firm Blackwater became involved in a <b>shooting</b> <b>incidence</b> in the Nisour Square in Baghdad. They were escorting a U. S. State Department delegation, which according to the firm, came under attack. According to by-standers, the Blackwater employees opened fire unprovoked, shooting in all directions and seemingly at anyone moving, including those trying to flee or help those wounded. 17 Iraqis civilians died in the incidence and {{at least twice as}} many were wounded. President Al-Maliki immediately came out to "revoke Blackwater’s license” for operating in Iraq and Iraqi authorities engaged the process of ending contractor impunity in their country. However, {{it soon became clear that}} there was no license to revoke and that the Iraqi government may not have the authority to deny Blackwater the right to operate in Iraq, let alone decide the fate of private contractors more generally. On their part, the U. S. authorities promised to open their own investigation and expressed regret at the civilian casualties but did not end their contracts with Blackwater in Iraq or elsewhere. The incapacity of the Iraqi government to impose its authority and right to control the use of force on its territory, to hold Blackwater and/or its employees accountable for the incidence, made Jeremy Scahill conclude that: "nothing gives a more clear indication to the Iraqis that they don’t have a sovereign government” (2007). Scahill is right in pointing to the limitations of the Iraqi government’s role as the ultimate authority deciding on laws on Iraqi territory. However, it does not follow that the Mansour incidence is illustrative of the extent to which the private markets for force have undermined sovereignty generally...|$|E

The attacks by NATO shifted the conflict from an insurgency into a war. During the Kosovo War, KLA terrorists collaborated with NATO soldiers and were qualified by NATO as [...] "freedom fighters." [...] In late 1999, the KLA was disbanded and its members entered the Kosovo Protection Corps as outlined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244.With the arrival of KFOR, the security situation in Kosovo deteriorated and the KLA increased attacks against the Serbian population. In total, 155 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries were destroyed between 11 June 1999 and 19 March 2004, {{after the end of}} the Kosovo War and including the 2004 unrest in Kosovo.

40|$|Metallic {{particles}} and textile fibres belong to forensic microtra ces of a distinctively high evid ential value. Examinations {{of these materials}} performed by various techniques of optical microscopy, electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis and other microspectroscopic methods are utilised mainly for th eir identification and comparison to reference materials secured as evidence in various crimes. Results of such ex aminations are complementary to other information obtained during investigations {{and can be used}} to crime reconstruc tion. In <b>shooting</b> <b>incidences</b> usually gunshot residues, among them characteristic metallic particles, are cautiously stud ied. However, our experience demonstrates that detailed examinations of fibres in the surroundings of a gunshot dama ge in clothing of victims may additionally contribute to explanation of the impact done to the clothing and so signi ficantly improve the inferences on the crime reconstruction. This is illustrated by an example of complex examinations of both, gunshot residues and textile fibres, selected from the casework of the authors...|$|R
40|$|A 2 -year {{study on}} {{epidemic}} progress of apple scab {{was conducted at}} Randwijk, the Netherlands, in 1998 and 1999. The summer epidemic caused by conidia was studied instead of the well-described spring season epidemic originating from ascospores. The aim was to investigate relationships between disease measurements, i. e. disease incidence and severity measures of apple scab, and their implications {{for the development of}} predictive models and threshold levels. The study characterized good relationships between the measurements on cultivar Jonagold using regression analyses in three disease control regimes (untreated, organic and integrated). For fruit quality prediction, the relationship between fruit incidence (I (f)) and leaf incidence (I (l)) in the organic control regime was given by I (f) = 1. 966 + 0. 402 x (I (l)) (R (2) = 0. 92). As a result of low level of disease in the integrated control regime, <b>shoot</b> <b>incidence</b> (I (s)), with higher values than leaf incidence, was better suited for prediction. The relationship was given by I (f) = - 0. 162 + 0. 028 x (I (s)) (R (2) = 0. 91). For the integrated control regime, disease threshold levels were constructed for timing of the final fungicide application. If an apple grower wants to keep fruit infection under 1 % incidence (harvest scab threshold), the timing of the final fungicide application (action threshold) should correspond to 4 % <b>shoot</b> scab <b>incidence</b> at the beginning of August. The results are compared with similar studies and their biological interpretation is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{expansion}} of area under maize (Zea mays L.) {{and the use}} of no tillage have favored the incidence of stalk rot on this crop. The study aimed to evaluate the organic fertilizers and the treatment of corn seeds with Trichoderma spp. on the production of dry matter (DM) of <b>shoot,</b> <b>incidence</b> of stalk rot and corn yield. The experiment consisted in a factorial with split-plot in strips, on the randomized block design with four replicates, and the fertilization treatments (pig slurry; swine deep bedding; cattle slurry; mineral fertilizer; control treatment) were applied to the plots and the seeds treatment (with and without Trichoderma spp.) in the subplots. At the flowering stage, three corn plants per subplot were collected for the assessment of DM production. At physiological maturity stage, the incidence of stalk rot was assessed, and the ears of corn harvested for productivity assessment. The organic and mineral fertilizers increased the production of DM and productivity of corn. Trichoderma spp. increased the production of DM of corn, but had no reflection on productivity. The incidence of stalk rot in corn was higher in treatments with organic and mineral fertilization. Organic fertilizers increase dry matter production of shoot and corn yield, and Trichoderma spp. provides an increase in dry matter production of shoot. ...|$|R
40|$|Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), {{caused by}} cassava brown streak viruses, is {{recognized}} as one of the most important plant disease threats to African food security. This study describes the incidence and severity of the different symptom types caused by CBSD, derived from extensive surveys in the country most severely affected by the disease: Tanzania. Total plant incidence and mean root severity of CBSD, recorded from 341 farmers’ fields, were both greater in the Coast Zone (49. 5 % and 3. 05), than in the Lake Zone (32. 7 % and 2. 57). Overall, the differing incidences recorded declined in the following order: total plant incidence (39. 1 %), plant <b>shoot</b> <b>incidence</b> (33. 4 %), plant root incidence (19. 3 %), root incidence (10. 5 %), and unusable root incidence (5. 4 %). The much lower-than-anticipated loss due to the root necrosis that is characteristic of CBSD was offset by large reductions of root number in plants expressing foliar symptoms of CBSD (15. 7 % in the Coast Zone and 5. 5 % in the Lake Zone). These data suggest that the effects of CBSD on the growth of affected plants are greater than those due to root spoilage. Based on these two factors, annual losses due to CBSD in the parts of Tanzania surveyed were estimated at > 860, 000 t, equivalent to more than U. S. $ 51 million. A novel approach to using farm-derived data on the responses of the most frequently cultivated varieties to CBSD infection allowed the grouping of the varieties into four categories, based on their relative resistance or tolerance to infection. This tool should be of value to breeders in identifying and selecting for sources of resistance or tolerance in both local and exotic germplasm, and should ultimately contribute to enhancing the management of one of Africa’s most damaging crop diseases.

40|$|Stem rot or {{foot rot}} disease caused by Phytophthora capsici {{is known as}} an {{important}} constraint on pepper cultivation. Research was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of arbuskula mycorhizal fungi (AMF) on incidence of foot rot disease of pepper seedlings.   The experiment was done in the net house and arranged using completed randomized design with 6 treatments, i. e. (1) soil infested by P. capsici (TPC) as negative control treatment, (2) sterilized soil (TS) as positive control treatment, (3) TPC with 5 g of AMF, (4) TPC with 10 g AMF, (5) TPC with 15 g AMF, and (6) TPC with 20 g AMF.    Observation involved plant height, number of <b>shoots,</b> disease <b>incidence,</b> the percentage of AMF infection on the roots of pepper plants, and pepper plants dependence on AMF.

40|$|Early {{defoliation}} {{is a novel}} {{cultural practice}} for crop management in grapevines. The effects of timing (prebloom or fruit set) and method (manual or mechanical) of early defoliation on yield and grape and wine composition of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano and Carignan grapevines were investigated. Leaf removal induced {{a substantial increase in}} both cluster exposure and canopy porosity. Yield was significantly reduced by defoliation in both varieties. Yield per shoot was reduced between 30 and 70 % by manual and mechanical leaf removal prebloom. In both varieties, postflowering leaf removal was ineffective at modifying fruit set, number of berries per cluster, or yield per <b>shoot.</b> Botrytis <b>incidence</b> was also reduced by leaf removal. Prebloom defoliation allowed full recovery of the leaf:fruit ratios to that seen in nondefoliated vines. Grape soluble solids and wine alcohol concentration were not affected by defoliation. Malic acid decreased with leaf removal at fruit set. Genotype-environment interactions on berry acidity variables such as titratable acidity and tartaric acid concentrations were found. Early leaf removal substantially increased anthocyanin and phenol concentration in grapes and wine of both varieties. In Carignan, early leaf removal resulted in heavier berries, which nevertheless had enhanced grape and wine color. These results support the hypothesis that in early-defoliated vines, the relative growth of various berry organs is affected independently from absolute berry mass. Mechanical early defoliation {{has the potential to be}} a cost-effective technique to control yield and to improve grape and wine composition. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Point {{location}} {{problems for}} n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space (and ℓ_p spaces more generally) have typically had {{two kinds of}} running-time solutions: * (Nearly-Linear) less than d^poly(d) · n ^O(d) n time, or * (Barely-Subquadratic) f(d) · n^ 2 - 1 /Θ(d) time, for various f. For small d and large n, "nearly-linear" running times are generally feasible, while "barely-subquadratic" times are generally infeasible. For example, in the Euclidean metric, finding a Closest Pair among n points in R^d is nearly-linear, solvable in 2 ^O(d) · n ^O(1) n time, while known algorithms for Furthest Pair (the diameter of the point set) are only barely-subquadratic, requiring Ω(n^ 2 - 1 /Θ(d)) time. Why do these proximity problems have such different time complexities? Is there a barrier to obtaining nearly-linear algorithms for problems which are currently only barely-subquadratic? We give a novel exact and deterministic self-reduction for the Orthogonal Vectors problem on n vectors in { 0, 1 }^d to n vectors in Z^ω(d) that runs in 2 ^o(d) time. As a consequence, barely-subquadratic problems such as Euclidean diameter, Euclidean bichromatic closest pair, ray <b>shooting,</b> and <b>incidence</b> detection do not have O(n^ 2 -ϵ) time algorithms (in Turing models of computation) for dimensionality d = ω(n) ^ 2, unless the popular Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture and the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis are false. That is, while poly-log-log-dimensional Closest Pair is in n^ 1 +o(1) time, the analogous case of Furthest Pair can encode larger-dimensional problems conjectured to require n^ 2 -o(1) time. We also show that the All-Nearest Neighbors problem in ω(n) dimensions requires n^ 2 -o(1) time to solve, assuming either of the above conjectures. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|Xylotrechus arvicola (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) (Olivier) is a {{polyphagous}} borer which attacks different woody species in natural habitats in Spain. This coleopteran is also becoming a real impacting pest in several Spanish wine producing territories. Infested vines show adult exit holes, rachitic <b>shoots,</b> a higher <b>incidence</b> of wood fungal diseases and fragility. At {{the beginning of}} the 1990 s, a heavy increase of infestation was observed in La Rioja vineyards, the only Qualified Guarantee of Origin Region (A. O. C.) in Spain. Due to the endophytic development of the larvae of X. arvicola, adults are the designated target for the integrated management. Therefore, the aim of the present paper was to study the flight period of the pest and to calculate the value of degree-days for the emergence of both sexes from data collected in the field during 2003 - 2008 in a Tempranillo cultivar in Tirgo (La Rioja). Adult emergences occurred from the end of May to mid-August and a certain degree of protandry was detected. The predictive models obtained for each year fit a sinusoidal curve in all cases, except for males in 2004, when the adjustment was polynomial. The obtained correlation coefficients were considerably high, as the value 0. 99 was exceeded in 72 % of the cases. These results obtained in La Rioja vineyards suggest that control strategies aimed at the reduction of the adult population of X. arvicola {{in the view of the}} integrated management, should be performed between mid-June and the end of July...|$|R
30|$|The {{algorithm}} proposed here {{includes two}} {{new methods of}} clustering DHFCM and DHKM; they use simple and easy techniques, as DWT and reducing the color palette that provides the robustness needed in the segmentation and classification of the dorsal fin to the photo-id. The theme of the image segmentation is a highly debated topic and remains an open issue because each image has different characteristics even taking the picture with the same device. That is why, the main contribution of this work is that each image of blue whales has different characteristics, because the angles of <b>shooting</b> and the <b>incidence</b> {{of light on the}} skin of the blue whale vary depending on the time shooting photograph and individual objects or animals that may be included in the scene which have high randomness. Therefore, the techniques proposed here help in the process of elimination of unexpected visual artifacts presented in the actual images of the blue whale. To measure the performance of the algorithm proposed here, different tests with different types of cameras were performed to verify the simplicity and portability of the system and validate the accuracies obtained in each test for each performed with different types of cameras (Cannon and cameras of the mobiles devices) were preserved with the best returns. The photo-identification system on mobile device is an alternative portability for researchers in the field to obtain a quick way to identify blue whales in their habitat; this system represents a double tool to assist the process of photo-identification as it can be run from a computer or of a mobile device. The new proposals DHFCM and DHKM due to its easy operation and preprocessing of the images obtained in the habitat of the blue whale are a feasible application for mobile devices, where some processes that run on mobile devices come to be limited by the equity of these, such as the battery and memory. Finally, the proposal App offers a real-time solution to the blue whale photo-identification using a mobile device such as a portable computer.|$|R
