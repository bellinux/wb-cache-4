40|$|Background: It can be {{difficult}} to determine on the coronary angiogram which lesions cause ischemia.

Methods: In the FAME <b>study,</b> <b>routine</b> measurement of the fractional flow reserve (FFR) was compared with angiography for guiding percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.

30|$|Log data {{had to be}} {{isolated}} for shales and sands that are {{of particular interest to}} the <b>study.</b> <b>Routine</b> identification of lithologies often relies on values of gamma ray logs. Typically, values of gamma ray across mudstones are higher than in other sedimentary rocks because of the high potassium content (and presence of adsorbed uranium and thorium) of clay minerals. Hence, shales can often be distinguished from other lithologies using a simple gamma ray cut-off. In the Niger Delta, this cut-off is usually 65 API such that gamma ray values in excess of this threshold are assigned to shales while sands are assigned to lower values. However, high gamma ray sands also exist in the Niger Delta and could be wrongly picked as mudstones. Picking the cleanest sand and shale units therefore requires a combination of tools.|$|E

Twenty-one percent of sickle negative Blacks had white cell counts below the lowest value seen in Whites. The haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte mean cell volume and monocyte count were also significantly lower amongst Blacks though lymphocyte counts were higher. The racial differences in haemoglobin and white count were not accounted for by differences in smoking and drinking habits. They were also found when Blacks with sickle cell trait were compared to age/sex-matched Whites and in others taking the oral contraceptive pill. Awareness of racial group should aid interpretation of routine tests and avoid unnecessary investigation of normal 'neutropenic' Blacks...|$|E
