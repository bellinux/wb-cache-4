5000|$|Work on the {{standardization}} of T-slots started in 1924 and a tentative standard {{was published in}} 1927. The first official American Standard for T-slots came in 1941. [...] B5 Technical Committee No. 11 was organized in New York on December 4, 1928, and B5 Technical Committee No. 4 on <b>Spindle</b> <b>Noses</b> was organized on December 5, 1928. These two committees worked in close cooperation {{with each other and}} with manufacturers and users of engine lathes, turret lathes and automatic lathes in developing standards for <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> and chucks.|$|R
50|$|The {{first edition}} of the <b>Spindle</b> <b>Noses</b> and Tool Shanks for Milling Machines standard, known as B5.18-1943, {{resulted}} from intensive effort dating back to 1926 by a special group of milling machine manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; <b>spindle</b> <b>noses</b> may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} common {{standardized}} methods of mounting shell mills to their arbors. They overlap somewhat (not entirely) with the analogous joining of lathe chucks to the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The chuck may be {{held against}} the taper with a {{threaded}} retainer ring (large thin nut), typically wrenched with a spanner wrench of the pin or hook variety. The peak of popularity for building {{this type of}} <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> was the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
30|$|According to Fig. 9, by {{applying}} the medium level of the cutting depth, a desirable surface roughness is achieved. The analysis reveals that a proper surface finish is achieved when the <b>spindle</b> speed and <b>nose</b> radius are higher than their moderate level. From the above discussion, {{it can be concluded}} that the highest level of the <b>spindle</b> speed and <b>nose</b> radius, the moderate level of the cutting depth, and the lowest level of the feed rate is an ideal combination to achieve an acceptable surface roughness in the finish hard turning operation.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) can {{directly}} {{achieve the}} fabrication of threedimensional non-axisymmetric freeform components with nanometeric surface finish and submicrometric form accuracy. During {{the past few}} years, {{a lot of research}} on computerized numerical control (CNC) machining technologies has been conducted; however, little of this research makes any contribution to UPRM. This paper studies the mechanism of scallop height generation for UPRM. Through analyzing the cutting edge locus and the scallop height generation mechanism, a model for feed-intervals and for raster-interval scallop height generation, are presented. Parameters such as selection of feed direction (vertical cutting and horizontal cutting), feed rate, <b>spindle</b> speed, tool <b>nose</b> radius, swing distance, feed length and raster distance have been taken into consideration in the scallop generation models.

30|$|Figure  10 {{shows the}} {{dimensional}} accuracy variations under the various combinations of the processing parameters. The best dimensional accuracy is achieved when the dimensional deviation {{is equal to}} zero (i.e., Δd[*]=[*] 0). As depicted in Fig.  10 a b, a high dimensional accuracy is obtained at {{the lowest level of}} the <b>spindle</b> speed and <b>nose</b> radius. In addition, as shown in Fig. 10 c, d, the spindle speed between 700 and 1200  rpm along with the feed rate lower than 0.15  mm/rev is an ideal combination to achieve a high dimensional accuracy. It can be seen from Fig. 10 g–j that for any level of the feed rate and spindle speed, the best dimensional accuracy is achieved at the cutting depth lower than 1.5  mm. According to the experimental results, 0.5  mm cutting depth, 0.8  mm nose radius, 0.16  mm/rev feed rate, and the speed lower than 1100  rpm provide the best dimensional accuracy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lowest cutting depth level, the moderate feed rate, and nose radius level and the lowest level of the spindle speed always produce the best dimensional accuracy during the hard turning operation.|$|R

HSK-63 has begun to supplant the ISO-30 as the rapid change standard in recent years.|$|E

5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates screw onto the lathe's <b>spindle</b> <b>nose.</b> This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|E
40|$|A lagrangian {{formulation}} {{is presented}} {{for the total}} dynamic stiffness and damping matrices of a rigid rotor carrying noncentral rigid disk and supported on angular contact ball bearings (ACBBs). The bearing dynamic stiffness/damping marix is derived {{in terms of the}} bearing motions (displacements/rotations) and then the principal of virtual work is used to transfer it from the bearing location to the rotor mass center to obtain the total dynamic stiffness/damping matrix. The bearing analyses take into account the bearing nonlinearities, cage rotation and bearing axial preload. The coefficients of these time-dependent matrices are presented analytically. The equations of motion of a rigid rotor-ACBBs assembly are derived using Lagrange's equation. The proposed analyses on deriving the bearing stiffness matrix are verified against existing bearing analyses of SKF researchers that, in turn, were verified using both SKF softwares/experiments and we obtained typical agreements. The presented total stiffness matrix is applied to a typical grinding machine spindle studied experimentally by other researchers and excellent agreements are obtained between our analytical eigenvalues and the experimental ones. The effect of using the total full stiffness matrix versus using the total diagonal stiffness matrix on the natural frequencies and dynamic response of the rigid rotor-bearings system is studied. It is found that using the diagonal matrix affects natural frequencies values (except the axial frequency) and response amplitudes and pattern and causes important vibration tones to be missig from the response spectrum. Therefore it is recommended to use the full total stiffness matrix and not the diagonal matrix in the design/vibration analysis of these rotating machines. For a machine spindle-ACBBs assembly under mass unbalnce and a horizontal force at the <b>spindle</b> cutting <b>nose</b> when the bearing time-varying stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is considered) is used, the peak-to-valley variation in time domain of the stiffness matrix elements becomes significant compared to its counterpart when the bearing standard stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is neglected) is used. The vibration spectrum of the time-varying matrix case is marked by tones at bearing outer ring ball passing frequency, rotating unbalnce frequency and combination compared to spectrum of the standard stiffness matrix case which is marked by only the rotating unbalnce frequency. Therfore, it is highly recomended to model bearing stiffness matrix to be a time-dependent...|$|R
5000|$|Many lathes {{that run}} collet chucks have {{dedicated}} collet-closer setups whereby {{there is no}} backplate, and the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> contains the female taper for either the collet's male outer taper, or a sleeve that will hold it. A hollow drawbar passes back through the headstock to its back side, where a closer mechanism is mounted. The latter allows easy, rapid opening and closing of the collet. The drawbar's inner diameter determines the through-the-spindle bar diameter capacity of the lathe. Some collet-closer systems even allow opening and closing without stopping the spindle rotation. The closer on a manual lathe is either lever-style or handwheel-style. The closer on a CNC lathe is powered (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic), {{and it may be}} controlled by various means: a foot pedal that the operator steps on when desired; a line in the program (for opening and closing under program control); or a button on the control panel.|$|E
5000|$|A {{backplate}} with threads may screw onto a threaded <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> (for lathe work) or onto an {{adapter plate}} {{with the same}} nose, to be mounted on the table of milling machines or surface grinding machines. This [...] "threaded spindle nose" [...] type of mounting was the typical method in the 19th century through 1930s. It is simple and useful, but the degree of control of concentricity is not quite {{good enough to be}} foolproof for high-speed, high-precision work (high precision can be achieved, but the time and skill involved in the setups makes it a poor choice now that better options exist, such as the cam-lock spindle noses described below). Threaded spindle noses are still built on new machine tools, but only of the low-end variety (hobbyist, least-expense MRO, etc.). High-capital manufacturing (where high upfront expense yields lowest possible unit expense for mid- to high-volume part counts of high-precision parts) has moved away from this type of mounting. The exact-adjust (Set-Tru) concept is one way to chase high concentricity on threaded spindle noses with some relative degree of ease.|$|E

40|$|The {{contouring}} {{accuracy of}} a multi-axis machine has a critical {{effect on the}} quality of many advanced technology products. One of the best approaches to assessing the contouring performance of machine tools is through double ball bar measurement. During circular interpolation motion, the machine traverses, with two axes at a time, a circular trajectory, with each axis subject to sinusoidal changes in acceleration, velocity, and position. The motion error is measured by detecting the relative distance between a point on the <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> and another point on the machine table and plotting this distance in polar coordinates. The present paper derives mathematical models and diagnosis procedures for first and second-order motion error resulting from the active degrees of freedom of a multi-axis machine. The theoretical results are verified by both computer simulation and double ball bar testing experiments. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{knowledge}} discovery technique {{is used to}} build an effective and transparent mathematic thermal error model for machine tools. Our proposed thermal error modeling methodology (called KRL) integrates the schemes of K-means theory (KM), rough-set theory (RS), and linear regression model (LR). First, to explore the machine tool's thermal behavior, an integrated system is designed to simultaneously measure the temperature ascents at selected characteristic points and the thermal deformations at <b>spindle</b> <b>nose</b> under suitable real machining conditions. Second, the obtained data are classified by the KM method, further reduced by the RS scheme, and a linear thermal error model is established by the LR technique. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) thermal error model is introduced for comparison. Finally, a verification experiment is carried out and results reveal that the proposed KRL model is effective in predicting thermal behavior in machine tools. Our proposed KRL model is transparent, easily understood by users, and can be easily programmed or modified for different machining conditions...|$|E

Phase shifts induced by changes of machining direction are compensated. Results are compared with cutting forces measured with a dynamometer table.

40|$|In PKM Machines, the Cartesian {{position}} and {{orientation of the}} tool point carried on the platform is obtained from a kinematic model of the particular machine. Accurate positioning of these machines relies on the accurate knowledge of {{the parameters of the}} kinematic model unique to the particular machine. The parameters in the kinematic model include the spatial locations of the joint centers on the machine base and moving platform, the initial strut lengths, and the strut displacements. The strut displacements are readily obtained from sensors on the machine. However, the remaining kinematic parameters (joint center locations, and initial strut lengths) are difficult to determine when these machines are in their fully assembled state. The size and complexity of these machines generally makes it difficult and somewhat undesirable to determine the remaining kinematic parameters by direct inspection such as in a coordinate measuring machine. In order for PKMs to be useful for precision positioning applications, techniques must be developed to quickly calibrate the machine by determining the kinematic parameters without disassembly of the machine. A number of authors have reported techniques for calibration of PKMs (Soons, Masory, Zhuang et. al., Ropponen). In two other papers, the authors have reported on work recently completed by the University of Florida and Sandia National Laboratories on calibration of PKMs, which describes a new technique to sequentially determine the kinematic parameters of an assembled parallel kinematic device. The technique described is intended to be used with a spatial coordinate measuring device such as a portable articulated CMM measuring arm (Romer, Faro, etc.), a Laser Ball Bar (LBB), or a laser tracker (SMX< API, etc.).
