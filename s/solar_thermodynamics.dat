40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore and {{illustrate}} a possible use of densification, a metric derived from network theory, to shed light into the evolution of three renewable energy technologies. The combination of the statistical analysis of publications (bibliometrics) and network analysis allows monitoring technological developments and can be used for the identification of emerging topics. Renewable energy has been addressed by the European Commission and in bibliometric studies e. g. On offshore wind energy, Tsai et al. (2016) identified technology development priorities, and Gao et al. (2016) reviewed worldwide progress of wind power prices. On <b>solar</b> photovoltaics, <b>thermodynamics</b> fundamentally limit efficiency, and there is much research on alternative approaches to improving efficiency and/or production costs. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS, providing energy from deep fractured rocks) is an emerging technology requiring significant development to reach commercial readiness, with innovation so far limited by costs, exploration risks and technological improvement needs. Kacham et al. (2012) provide insights into technological developments and emerging trends. JRC. C. 7 -Knowledge for the Energy Unio...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} closed solar air heaters is used in particular, to assist in interpreting the observed phenomena in the solar air heaters, to design the system, to predict the trends, and to assist in optimization. In this paper, various {{mathematical model}}s, mainly analyzing the heat transfer process of solar air heaters, are reviewed and classified based on the model, {{the number of the}} cover, the shape of the absorber and the presence or not of the packing bed. Although the models have evolved to a point where several features of the process can be predicted, more effort is required before the models can be applied to define actual operating conditions as well as to further investigate new closed solar air heaters. It is shown that the major governing equations in the models are based on the first law of <b>thermodynamics.</b> <b>Solar</b> air heater collectors Mathematical model Designs Energy balance equations Exergy analysis...|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamics is {{a highly}} {{successful}} macroscopic theory widely used across the natural sciences and {{for the construction of}} everyday devices, from car engines and fridges to power plants and <b>solar</b> cells. With <b>thermodynamics</b> predating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws that govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects. Here we identify information processing tasks, the so-called "projections", that can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show that the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial thermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with information erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic work cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike. Implications are far-reaching, adding a thermodynamic dimension to measurements performed in quantum thermodynamics experiments, and providing key input {{for the construction of a}} future quantum thermodynamic framework. Repercussions are discussed for quantum work fluctuation relations and thermodynamic single-shot approaches. Comment: 6 pages + appendix, 4 figures, v 2 : changed presentation, critically discuss interpretation as measurement, added new conclusions; previous title: "Quantum measurement and its role in thermodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamics is {{a highly}} {{successful}} macroscopic theory widely used across the natural sciences and {{for the construction of}} everyday devices, from car engines to <b>solar</b> cells. With <b>thermodynamics</b> predating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws that govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects. Recent theoretical breakthroughs include the characterisation of the efficiency of quantum thermal engines, the extension of classical non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to the quantum regime and a new thermodynamic resource theory has led to the discovery of a set of second laws for finite size systems. These results have substantially advanced our understanding of nanoscale thermodynamics, however putting a finger on what is genuinely quantum in quantum thermodynamics has remained a challenge. Here we identify information processing tasks, the so-called projections, that can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show that the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial thermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with information erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic work cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike.

40|$|Supramolecular {{artificial}} light harvesting complexes {{have been designed}} through binding of a donor dye to DNA, an acceptor dye to a protein and assembling the protein on the DNA allowing for efficient energy transfer between the DNA-bound donor and the protein-bound acceptor. Such {{artificial light}} harvesting complexes could be useful in sensitizing solar cells. In order to create successful DNA-based artificial light harvesting complexes, DNA-ligand and protein-ligand interactions were studied and suggested that small changes to functional groups on the ligands {{have a significant impact}} on the binding affinity of the ligands for the macromolecules. A set of DNA-binding ligands with different numbers of methylenes lowered had decreased binding free energy, ΔGbind, by – 0. 07 kcal/mol/methylene. Protein-ligand interactions were also studied with the binding of coumarins derivatives to serum albumins. In order to understand better how to apply artificial light harvesting units created with <b>solar</b> cells, the <b>thermodynamics</b> of interactions between proteins or DNA with a model solid were studied. Binding of proteins to the negatively charged model solid, α-ZrP, suggested the net charge of the protein, the number of atoms and buffer counterions affected proteins binding to the solid. The knowledge gained from ligand-DNA, ligand-protein and protein-solid interactions allowed for better design of DNA-based materials for light harvesting. ^ Artificial light harvesting units were created where a donor dye and an acceptor dye were bound simultaneously to one protein molecule. Excitation spectra clearly showed donor sensitized emission from the acceptor, and this process was sensitive to the protein structure. Efficient energy transfer between micromolar concentrations of the donor and acceptor were noted, though a significant amount of donor emission was still present in the emission spectrum. More efficient, DNA-based artificial light harvesting units were created with donor bound DNA, and acceptor bound to chemically modified cationic protein, in a supramolecular complex. Energy transfer was very efficient, as the majority of the donor emission was quenched by micromolar concentrations of the acceptor. Successful DNA-based materials for artificial light harvesting have been created, and that efficient energy transfer can be obtained from these materials. ...|$|R
