5|$|Worldwide {{rates of}} either HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 are between 60 and 95% in adults. HSV-1 {{is more common}} than HSV-2, with rates of both {{increasing}} as people age. HSV-1 rates are between 70% and 80% in populations of low <b>socioeconomic</b> status and 40% to 60% in populations of improved <b>socioeconomic</b> status. An estimated 536 million people or 16% of the population worldwide were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and in those in the developing world. Rates of infection {{are determined by the}} presence of antibodies against either viral species.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching <b>socioeconomic</b> consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{has hosted}} the Democratic National Convention twice, in 1908 {{and again in}} 2008, taking the {{opportunity}} to promote the city's status on the national, political, and <b>socioeconomic</b> stage. On August 10-15, 1993, Denver hosted the Catholic Church's 6th World Youth Day, which was attended by an estimated 500,000, making it the largest gathering in Colorado history.|$|E
5|$|Reception of the {{proposal}} has been highly polarized; it has received high praise from some as a culturally significant icon that will symbolize the nation's wealth and power, while others question its <b>socioeconomic</b> motives, and forecast {{that it will have}} negative financial consequences.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{of leisure}} have {{determined}} that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by <b>socioeconomic</b> variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation (presence or lack of family, age, and other factors).|$|E
5|$|Styles {{for these}} sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, {{included}} T-shaped windows and doors. This {{has been taken}} by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, {{as evidence of the}} continuing reach of the Chacoan system. Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite <b>socioeconomic</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, {{but many of the}} Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. The settlers encompassed a range of <b>socioeconomic</b> strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighborhood}} once contained {{many public}} housing complexes including {{about a third}} of the nation's largest, the Robert Taylor Homes. The Taylor homes have been demolished because of the <b>socioeconomic</b> problems that they perpetuated. The area has minimal industry or commerce at the current time. The other property on the NRHP in the area is the Schulze Baking Company Plant.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{health in}} India can be {{examined}} in terms of multiple indicators, which vary by geography, <b>socioeconomic</b> standing and culture. To adequately improve the health of women in India multiple dimensions of wellbeing must be analysed in relation to global health averages and also in comparison to men in India. Health {{is an important factor}} that contributes to human wellbeing and economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Another initiative, {{presented}} by the late Mayor Thomas Menino, is the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive, which reduces {{the cost of living}} in buildings that are deemed energy efficient. This, much like the green housing developments, gives people of low <b>socioeconomic</b> status an opportunity to find housing in communities that support the environment. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home energy assessment.|$|E
5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's <b>socioeconomic</b> condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{his friend}} Lao She {{introduced}} him to the famous pingju opera performer Xin Fengxia, who had acted in one of Wu's plays and admired his talent. They married that year, {{despite the fact that they}} were from differing <b>socioeconomic</b> backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy.|$|E
5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician. He {{was known for}} his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of <b>socioeconomic</b> status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Public Schools desegregated {{without a}} court order but {{continue}} to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). In 2007, Seattle's racial tie-breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme Court, but the ruling {{left the door open}} for desegregation formulae based on other indicators (e.g., income or <b>socioeconomic</b> class).|$|E
5|$|Within nations, it is {{more common}} in higher <b>socioeconomic</b> groups. Males and females are {{affected}} in an equal ratio, and the peak age of onset between 10 and 19 years. About 80% of people with aphthous stomatitis first developed the condition before the age of 30. There have been reports of ethnic variation. For example, in the United States, aphthous stomatitis may be three times more common in white-skinned people than black-skinned people.|$|E
25|$|While {{the onset}} and {{persistence}} of SLE can show disparities between genders, <b>socioeconomic</b> status {{also plays a}} major role. Women with SLE and of lower <b>socioeconomic</b> status {{have been shown to}} have higher depression scores, higher body mass index, and more restricted access to medical care than women of higher <b>socioeconomic</b> statuses with the illness. People with SLE had more self-reported anxiety and depression scores if they were from a lower <b>socioeconomic</b> status.|$|E
25|$|The lower a person's <b>socioeconomic</b> status, {{the higher}} their response. This might {{link to the}} {{material}} hardship that occurs with low <b>socioeconomic</b> status.|$|E
25|$|Caries occur {{more often}} in people from {{the lower end of}} the <b>socioeconomic</b> scale than people from the upper end of the <b>socioeconomic</b> scale.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{researchers}} periodontitis {{may be associated}} with higher stress. Periodontitis occurs more often in people from {{the lower end of the}} <b>socioeconomic</b> scale than people from the upper end of the <b>socioeconomic</b> scale.|$|E
25|$|Although {{women around}} the world share many {{similarities}} in terms of the health-impacting challenges, there are also many distinct differences that arise from their varying states of <b>socioeconomic</b> conditions. The type of living conditions in which women live is largely associated with not only their own <b>socioeconomic</b> status, but also that of their nation.|$|E

25|$|The Administrative Office {{will keep}} {{documents}} and issue the Mercosur official bulletin in both Portuguese and Spanish, and {{will also be}} charged with communicating {{the activities of the}} Common Market Group so as to allow for the maximum disclosure of decisions and the relevant documentation. The <b>Socioeconomic</b> Advisory Forum is consultative by nature, and represents the various <b>socioeconomic</b> sectors of the member nations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} misconceptions {{in regards to}} poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low <b>socioeconomic</b> status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families. It {{is not an issue}} of value, but more so a problem of access. A parent from a lower <b>socioeconomic</b> class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy <b>socioeconomic</b> class that may affect their involvement with their child’s education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their child’s education. The teachers, faculty, and administrators of the schools have to take these real-life factors into consideration.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} would identify the necessities of the <b>socioeconomic</b> reincorporation process through a <b>socioeconomic</b> census, identify possible productive programs and projects for demobilized {{members of the}} FARC and would create a one-time fund for the execution of such programs through ECOMÚN. In addition, for such purposes, {{each member of the}} FARC would have the right to a one-time economic support payment of 8 million pesos to undertake an individual or collective project.|$|E

25|$|Low {{self-esteem}} {{can result}} from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, mental health issues, <b>socioeconomic</b> status, peer pressure or bullying.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{communities}} or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, {{lack of social}} cohesion, and migration, {{have been associated with}} the development of mental disorders. Stresses and strains related to <b>socioeconomic</b> position (<b>socioeconomic</b> status (SES) or social class) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders. There have been mixed findings {{on the nature of the}} links and on the extent to which pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links. Both personal resources and community factors have been implicated, as well as interactions between individual-level and regional-level income levels. The causal role of different <b>socioeconomic</b> factors may vary by country. <b>Socioeconomic</b> deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worse mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. In addition, minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, have been found to be at greater risk for developing mental disorders, which has been attributed to various kinds of life insecurities and disadvantages, including racism. The direction of causality is sometimes unclear, and alternative hypotheses such as the Drift Hypothesis sometimes need to be discounted.|$|E
