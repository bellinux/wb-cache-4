40|$|Introduction: Vinca flower (Catharanthus roseus L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} medicinal plants of Apocynaceae (31, 27). Tropical plant native to a height of 30 to 35 centimeters (9) and a perennial shrub which is grown in cold areas for one year (27). One of the plants in the world today as a medicinal plant used the periwinkle plant. Among the 130 indole – terpenoids alkaloids which have been identified in the plant periwinkle vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastin are the most important component is used to treat a variety of cancers. Including therapies that are used for a variety of cancer, chemotherapy to help Vinca alkaloids collection (including vincristine and…). Vinblastin as effective member of this category, due to the low percentage of venom and effects at very low doses, is widely used today. These materials are generally formed as inhibitors of mitotic spindle in dividing cells have been identified. Vinblastin with these structural changes in connection kinotokor - microtubules and centrosomes in a dividing cell, the mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>stop</b> (45). Salicylic acid belongs to a group of phenolic compounds found in plants, and today is widely regarded as a hormone-like substance. These classes of compounds act as growth regulators. Humic substances are natural organic compounds that contain 50 to 90...|$|E

In {{contrast to the}} edge finder, the tip is not spring-loaded, and it works with the <b>spindle</b> <b>stopped.</b> Sometimes a magnifying glass is used to assist in marking location.

40|$|In this paper, a quick {{solution}} {{for measuring the}} volumetric errors of a precision machine is presented. It requires a laser tracker system and a plate including three caves on it. The laser tracker system can detect the coordinate of a sensor ball anywhere in the working space. The plate is fixed on the machine spindle. After installation, the spindle is moved toward the diagonal of the working space. The real movements are along the x, y, and z-axis directions, respectively; it will back to the diagonal line for one complete cycle motion. In each step movement, the <b>spindle</b> is <b>stopped</b> and the laser tracker detects the coordinates of the three caves by putting the target sensor ball into caves sequentially. By means of the coordinates, the volumetric errors at that position can be derived. The overall volumetric errors can be measured quickly by just one setup and many step movements with laser tracker detections...|$|R
40|$|Faithful {{segregation}} of chromosomes is ensured by the spindle checkpoint. If a kinetochore does not correctly attach to a microtubule the <b>spindle</b> checkpoint <b>stops</b> cell cycle progression until all chromosomes are attached to microtubules or tension is experienced while pulling the chromosomes. The C. elegans gene, san- 1, is required for spindle checkpoint function and anoxia survival. To further understand the role of san- 1 in the spindle checkpoint, an RNAi screen was conducted to identify genetic interactions with san- 1. The kinetochore gene hcp- 1 identified in this screen, was known to have a genetic interaction with hcp- 2. Interestingly, san- 1 (ok 1580);hcp- 2 (ok 1757) had embryonic and larval lethal phenotypes, but the phenotypes observed are less severe compared to the phenotypes of san- 1 (ok 1580);hcp- 1 (RNAi) animals. Both san- 1 (ok 1580);hcp- 1 (RNAi) and san- 1 (ok 1580);hcp- 2 (RNAi) produce eggs that may hatch; but san- 1 (ok 1580) :hcp- 1 (RNAi) larvae do not survive to adulthood due to defects caused by aberrant chromosome segregations during development. Y 54 G 9 A. 6 encodes the C. elegans homolog of bub- 3, and has spindle checkpoint function. In C. elegans, bub- 3 has genetic interactions with san- 1 and mdf- 2. An RNAi screen for genetic interactions with bub- 3 identified that F 31 F 6. 3 may potentially have a genetic interaction with bub- 3. This work provided genetic evidence that hcp- 1, hcp- 2 and F 31 F 6. 2 interact with spindle checkpoint genes...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} {{micromanipulation}} {{to study the}} attachment of chromosomes to the spindle and the mechanical properties of the chromosomal spindle fibers. Individual chromosomes can be displaced about {{the periphery of the}} spindle, in the plane of the metaphase plate, without altering the structure of the spindle or the positions of the nonmanipulated chromosomes. From mid-prometaphase through the onset of anaphase, chromosomes resist displacement toward either spindle pole, or beyond the spindle periphery. In anaphase a chromosome can be displaced either toward its spindle pole or laterally, beyond the periphery of the spindle; however, the chromosome resists displacement away from the spindle pole. When an anaphase half-bivalent is displaced toward its <b>spindle</b> pole, it <b>stops</b> migrating until the nonmanipulated half- bivalents reach a similar distance from the pole. The manipulated half- bivalent then resumes its poleward migration at the normal anaphase rate. No evidence was found for mechanical attachments between separating half-bivalents in anaphase. Our observations demonstrate that chromosomes are individually anchored to the spindle by fibers which connect the kinetochores of the chromosomes to the spindle poles. These fibers are flexible, much less extensible than the chromosomes, and are to pivot about their attachment points. While the fibers are able to support a tensile force sufficient to stretch a chromosome, they buckle when subjected to a compressive force. Preliminary evidence suggests that the mechanical attachment fibers detected with micromanipulation correspond to the birefringent chromosomal spindle fibers observed with polarization microscopy...|$|R
