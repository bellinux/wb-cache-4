Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in <b>strictly</b> <b>scientific</b> usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.|$|E

Seeing the possibility of using rockets as long-range artillery fire, the Wehrmacht initially funded the VfR team, but because their focus was <b>strictly</b> <b>scientific,</b> created its own research team. At the behest of military leaders, Wernher von Braun, at the time a young aspiring rocket scientist, joined the military (followed by two former VfR members) and developed long-range weapons for use in World War II by Nazi Germany.|$|E

25|$|The Dæmons began {{life as an}} {{audition}} scene for the companion Jo Grant. The audition sequence went on {{to be written into}} episode four. Producer Barry Letts was keen to write for the show and decided that a story dealing in black magic would be interesting as well as frightening. Script editor Terrance Dicks had reservations however, stating that people may view it as Satanist, and so it was reworked as <b>strictly</b> <b>scientific</b> with occultist themes. The Master was originally intended to worship the demon in a church set, standing on an altar. However, owing to fears that this might upset religious viewers, the scenes were reset in a crypt. This was subsequently revised again, and the crypt was called a cavern, although the set clearly resembled a church crypt. Letts initially intended to write the story himself but found himself short of time due to producership duties. His wife suggested a friend of hers, Robert Sloman, who was a playwright and journalist. Together they worked on the script in the evening after work. At the time, however, the BBC frowned upon production staff writing for their own series and so Letts and Sloman decided on the pseudonym Guy Leopold - Sloman's son and Letts' middle name respectively. The working title for this story was The Demons, which was commissioned on 17 December 1970. The scripts were completed by mid-February 1971 and worked on by Dicks, who had barely completed work on them by the time the story went into pre-production in March.|$|E

The aim of this review is to provide to new investigators an overview of the important steps involved in experimental designs and also to suggest some practical information that is commonly associated with this process. Investigators should adhere to the ethical procedure and follow <b>strictly</b> the <b>scientific</b> method. Both the aims and well-formulated hypothesis are essential and practical. In this regard a profound literature search and the aid of an experienced statistician is encouraged. The need of randomization, blinding, and attempting to minimize variation is discussed and recommended. The choosing of good control groups and the employment of pilot studies are useful. Finally, the formulation of new questions to be further responded is expected...|$|R

[...] VanDerWerff also wrote that the episode, along with the previous episode [...] "Per Manum" [...] was a showcase for Anderson's acting ability. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two noted, and praised, that the true tragedy of the episode is the fact that, despite her increased role as the reluctant believer, the way Scully deals with Absalom and Jeremiah Smith [...] "in a <b>strictly</b> <b>scientific</b> way", instead of taking the [...] "leap of faith", prevents her from finding and saving Mulder in time.|$|E

But Buckland was no theoretician: his life was lived on the practical side of natural history.|$|E

2500|$|Psychiatric {{illnesses}} can be conceptualised in {{a number}} of different ways. The biomedical approach examines signs and symptoms and compares them with diagnostic criteria. Mental illness can be assessed, conversely, through a narrative which tries to incorporate symptoms into a meaningful life history and to frame them as responses to external conditions. Both approaches are important in the field of psychiatry, but have not sufficiently reconciled to settle controversy over either the selection of a psychiatric paradigm or the specification of psychopathology. The notion of a [...] "biopsychosocial model" [...] is often used to underline the multifactorial nature of clinical impairment. In this notion the word [...] "model" [...] is not used in a <b>strictly</b> <b>scientific</b> way though. Alternatively, a [...] "biocognitive model" [...] acknowledges the physiological basis for the mind's existence, but identifies cognition as an irreducible and independent realm in which disorder may occur.

We argue that a tendency to employ <b>strictly</b> techno- <b>scientific</b> risk analyses of antimicro- bial use ignores the fundamental social, economic and political realities of key stakeholders and so limits the applicability of policy recommendations developed by government advisory groups. In particular, we suggest that veterinarians’ personal and professional interests, and their ethical norms of practice, are key factors to both the problem of and the solution to the current over -reliance on antimicrobials in food production...|$|R
