5000|$|Stafne's defect {{is usually}} {{discovered}} by chance during routine dental radiography. [...] Radiographically, it is a well-circumscribed, monolocular, round, radiolucent defect, 1-3 cm in size, usually between the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the inferior {{border of the}} posterior mandible between the molars and {{the angle of the}} jaw. It {{is one of the few}} radiolucent lesions that can occur below the IAN. The border is well corticated and it will have no effect on the surrounding structures. Computed tomography (CT) will show a shallow defect through the medial cortex of the mandible with a corticated rim and no soft tissue abnormalities, with the exception of a portion of the submandibular gland. Neoplasms, such as metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the submandibular lymph nodes or a salivary gland tumour, could create a similar appearance but rarely have such well defined borders and can usually be palpated in the floor of the mouth or submandibular triangle of the neck as a hard mass. CT and clinical exam is typically sufficient to distinguish between this and a Stafne defect. The Stafne defect also tends to not increase in size or change in radiographic appearance over time (hence the term [...] "static bone cyst"), and this can be used to help confirm the diagnosis. Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated, but if carried out, the histopathologic appearance is usually normal salivary gland tissue. Sometimes attempted biopsy of Stafne defects reveals an empty cavity (possibly because the gland was displaced at the time of biopsy), or other contents such as blood vessels, fat, lymphoid or connective tissues. Defects of the anterior lingual mandible may require biopsy for correct diagnosis at this unusual location. The radiolucent defect here may be superimposed on the lower anterior teeth and be mistaken for an odontogenic lesion. Sometimes the defect may interrupt the contour of the lower border of the mandible, and may be palpable. <b>Sialography</b> may be sometimes used to help demonstrate the salivary gland tissue within the bone.|$|E

We compared the diagnostic accuracies of MR <b>sialography</b> and digital subtraction <b>sialography</b> in patients with successful completion of both examinations and benign salivary gland disorders. METHODS: In a prospective study, we attempted to examine salivary glands in 80 patients with clinically suspected diagnoses of sialadenitis and/or sialolithiasis. Each patient underwent digital subtraction <b>sialography</b> and MR <b>sialography.</b> MR <b>sialography</b> was obtained with a T 2 -weighted single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence (TR/TE 2800 / 1100 msec, acquisition time 7 seconds), with use of a quadrature head coil. Final diagnoses were confirmed by clinical follow-up and results of biopsy (n 9) or surgery (n 19). RESULTS: Failure rate was 5 % (four of 80) for MR <b>sialography</b> and 14 % (11 of 80) for digital subtraction <b>sialography.</b> Eighty-one salivary glands (48 parotid, 33 submandibular) in 65 patients were successfully visualized with both modalities.

METHODS: Parotid <b>sialography</b> and parotid and submandibular US were performed in 360 patients (188 with SS and 172 non-SS) who were suspected of SS and had fulfilled the American-European criteria (AEC) for SS or had received > or = 3 of the objective examinations that were considered minimal requirements for classifying non-SS and had undergone both the imaging examinations. The glands were considered positive for SS if they exhibited peripheral sialoectatic changes on <b>sialography</b> and/or hypoechoic areas, echogenic streaks and/or irregular gland margins on US. The images obtained were independently rated as SS-positive or SS-negative by three radiologists in a blind fashion and the final decision was made by consensus.

Patients and methodsTwenty-eight patients (twenty males and eight females, average age, 47 years), with symptoms related to the salivary glands, underwent both conventional <b>sialography</b> and MR <b>sialography.</b> The latter was performed using heavily T 2 -weighted, two dimensional, fast spin-echo techniques and a neck coil. Contiguous 3 -mm axial images with frequency-selective fat suppression were acquired through the symptomatic gland. The MR <b>sialography</b> findings were compared with the final diagnoses determined by conventional <b>sialography,</b> and with surgery in the case of those who underwent surgical intervention. Ultrasound examination was performed using 7. 5 MHz transducer. Conventional <b>sialography</b> was performed with the use of 0. 012 – 0. 021 inch sialographic catheter and an injection of 0. 3 – 1. 5 ml Ultravist 300 mg/ml. ResultsFinal diagnosis included sialolithiasis in eleven cases, sialolithiasis and stenosis in four cases, stenosis without lithiasis in ten cases and normal salivary glands in three cases. (The normal cases were excluded from the study). ConclusionIt is concluded that MR <b>sialography</b> with a heavily T 2 -weighted sequence is highly successful in the noninvasive visualization of the ductal system of major salivary glands in cases that could not be examined by conventional sialogram. It is useful for diagnosing sialolithiasis and ductal stenosis. However, normal MR sialographic findings do not allow the exclusion of small calculi.

40|$|Objective. Despite the {{availability}} of many new imaging procedures, <b>sialography</b> has, after decades of use, maintained its status as the imaging procedure of choice for evaluating the oral component of Sjogren syndrome (SS). In this study, the clinical value of <b>sialography</b> as a diagnostic tool in SS was explored by assessing its diagnostic accuracy, observer bias, and staging potential. Methods. One hundred parotid sialograms were interpreted independently {{in a blinded fashion}} by 2 trained and 2 expert observers. Sialograms were derived from a group of consecutive patients referred for diagnostics of SS. Patients were categorized as SS and non-SS by the revised European classification criteria. Results. Trained observers reached a sensitivity of 95 and a specificity of 33 % for SS by sialogram, whereas expert observers reached a sensitivity of 87 and a specificity of 84 %. There was only "fair" interobserver agreement between trained and expert observers, whereas both expert observers showed "good" agreement with one another, according to Cohen's kappa. Intraobserver agreement was "good" to "very good" for all observers. The 4 different gradations of sialectasia, ie, punctate, globular, cavitary, and destructive, showed a weak but significant correlation with the duration of oral symptoms. Conclusions. This study markedly shows that the diagnostic value of parotid <b>sialography</b> for diagnosing SS greatly depends on the skills of the observer, implying that <b>sialography</b> lacks general applicability as a diagnostic tool in SS and requires specific expertise.

Twenty-two patients out of 34 were affected by Sjögren's syndrome, while the others resulted as control subjects. The ultrasonographic investigation has shown 76. 19 % of sensitivity and 30. 43 % of specificity. Even if echography is a non-invasive method, which could be used as preliminary approach for studying the diffused involvement of the parotid gland, at the status of the art, it is not completely reliable for the global evaluation of the morphostructural changes in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, in comparison with the other techniques. Because of the double nature of the gland injury, it appears to be essential the diagnostic integration between echography and <b>sialography...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the clinical and immunological factors influ encing sialometry in xerostomia patients. Method: The association between sialometry and other clinical examinations were investigated in a cross-sectional study. A total of 179 dry mouth patients showing hyposalivation who underwent a clinical examination were enrolled in this study. Multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the relative con-tributions of clinical and immunological factors including age, gender, parotid <b>sialography,</b> labial Salivary gland biopsy, anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies, and anti-La/SS-B antibodies to the resting (RSF) or stimulated saliva flow rate (SSF). Results: An increase of the stage of <b>sialography,</b> the grade of a labial biopsy, and the presence of anti-La/SS-B antibody had a significant correlation with a decrease of sialometry. Results of the multiple regression analysis showed that age (standardized coefficient = - 0. 244), grade of lip biopsy (- 0. 189), and anti-SS-B antibody (- 0. 171), were significantly associated with the RSF. The stage of <b>sialography</b> (? 0. 423) and age (- 0. 169) were significantly related to the sialometry in the SSF according to a multiple regression analysis. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the measurement of RSF reflects the immunological factors and SSF reflects the damage to the parotid gland...|$|E
40|$|The {{algorithm}} for imaging the {{salivary glands}} {{depends on the}} clinical scenario with which the patient presents to the clinician. Because {{of the importance of}} identifying small calculi in the gland or salivary duct as the cause of the symptom complex, nonenhanced computed tomography is often the best initial study for the evaluation of the painful gland. If an infiltrative neoplasm is highly suspected, nonenhanced and enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may be superior in demonstrating perineural, meningeal, and skull base invasion. <b>Sialography</b> is reserved for the evaluation of chronic sialadenitides unrelated to sialolithiasis. Thin-section MR techniques for MR <b>sialography</b> may soon replace conventional <b>sialography.</b> While neoplasms of the major salivary glands constitute less than 3 % of all tumors in the body, many people have an illness related to the salivary glands at some time in their lives. The process may be self-limited, such as with viral parotitis or mumps, but in others it may be a relapsing and remitting illness, such as chronic sialadenitis secondary to sialolithiasis. Still others may be evaluated for what is thought to be a salivary gland mass but is actually a mass peripheral to the glands, such as a lymph node. Very rarely, a nonnodal extraglandu...|$|E
