Bush apologized for the {{accident}} on national television, stating, [...] "I want to reiterate what I said {{to the prime minister}} of Japan: [...] I'm deeply <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> accident that took place; our nation is sorry." [...] Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also publicly apologized. [...] The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley, personally apologized to both Prime Minister Mori and to the Emperor of Japan. The public apologies to the Japanese from the highest American officials stirred resentment among some American veterans of the Pacific War and their families, as well as among Asian victims of Imperial Japanese aggression and occupation. Richard Cohen wrote a column in the Washington Post, saying [...] "We've Apologized Enough to Japan", denounced the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of its World War II victims, which he said were offered [...] "grudgingly", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision.|$|E

The Venezuelan Olympic Committee president Eduardo Alvarez remarked on the situation: [...] "We aren't <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss of the medal.

There was no mention of Legge-Bourke. However, on 24 January 1996, newspapers named Diana as the source of an untrue rumour circulated in November and December 1995 that Legge-Bourke had become pregnant by Charles and had had an abortion.

2500|$|Buchanan {{joined the}} St. Louis Globe-Democrat at age 23. During {{the first year}} of the United States embargo against Cuba in 1961, Canada–Cuba trade tripled. The Globe-Democrat {{published}} a rewrite of Buchanan's Columbia master's project under the eight-column banner [...] "Canada sells to Red Cuba — And Prospers" [...] eight weeks after Buchanan started at the paper. According to Buchanan's memoir Right from the Beginning, this article was a career milestone. Buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the communist regime and he turned against it. Buchanan was promoted to assistant editorial page editor in 1964 and supported Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. The Globe-Democrat did not endorse Goldwater and Buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Buchanan recalled: [...] "The conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats... I can't think of a single conservative who was <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Goldwater campaign." [...] According to the foreword (written by Pat Buchanan) in the most recent edition of Conscience of a Conservative, Buchanan was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom and wrote press releases for that organization. He served as an executive assistant in the Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Mitchell law offices in New York City in 1965.|$|E

The Guardian described it in 1978 as [...] "an awful warning against thinking too big in Britain's cities", and [...] "so castle-like in its outer strength that any passing medieval army would automatically besiege {{it rather than}} shop in it...". The underground railway scheme was abandoned by 1976 and the only deck access was across Corporation Street to another Town &City development in the Shambles.

[...] The [...] "unrepentant" [...] architects responded that they had provided what they had been asked to provide. Kenneth Stone said in 1978 [...] "We're not responsible for everything in there, but we're not <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> decisions we took as opposed to those which were forced upon us." [...] The critics' opinion did not mellow with time, and it was described as [...] "aggressive externally" [...] in 1991. The Economist noted in 1996 that it had [...] "long been regarded as one of Europe's ugliest shopping centres.... the epitome of lousy modern architecture... was hated". The Financial Times in 1997 called it [...] "outstandingly ugly" [...] and in 2000 [...] "one of Britain's least-loved buildings".|$|E
