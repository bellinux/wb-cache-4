2500|$|A {{separate}} elevator {{next to the}} turntable transports {{the balls}} to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen [...] "dead wood" [...] pins {{to remain on the}} lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for [...] "spotting cells" [...] in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifiying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by chains – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks {{on either side of the}} unit – or belts. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate , and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt <b>service</b> <b>mains.</b> The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} railway line to be opened on the island in 1873 and was {{operational}} continually until September 1968, {{with the exception of}} 1966 when the entire network was closed. The line is today retained as a footpath and bridleway and is 11.5 miles long. Since the rails were lifted in 1975, there has often been talk of resurrecting this line, which out of the closed lines would be the most viable. Since closure there have been several <b>service</b> <b>mains</b> buried under the trackbed, including gas and telephone mains, but pains are always taken to ensure that the trackbed is returned {{in such a way that}} the railway could be reinstated. There are two notable examples of this, firstly at Quarterbridge where the railway ran parallel to the T.T. course where an access road was built on the trackbed in 1991, and secondly at the station of St John's where a primary school and housing complex have been developed since 2001. Both of these developments have been built in such a way to ensure the line could be reinstated, albeit that any station at St John's would have to be significantly relocated. During the First World War there was a branch extending from a mid-way point between Peel and St John's stations to the farm of Knockaloe in connection with prisoners of war who were interned there. The stations are listed to the right. At the terminus of Peel a large heritage centre has been built, partly using the old goods shed and station building. The brickworks office and water tower remain in place at the mouth of the yard and are occupied by the Manx Transport Museum Group, and the station site itself is now a car park for the heritage centre. It would not be unfeasible however to reinstate some form of station here in the future as needs required.|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{with low}} demand, like households, are {{generally}} supplied single-phase power by connecting their <b>service</b> <b>mains</b> {{to one of}} the phases of a distribution transformer. The distribution companies face the problem of keeping a record of consumer connectivity to a phase due to uninformed changes that happen. The exact phase connectivity information is important for the efficient operation and control of distribution system. We propose a new data driven approach to the problem based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its Graph Theoretic interpretations, using energy measurements in equally timed short intervals, generated from smart meters. We propose an algorithm for inferring phase connectivity from noisy measurements. The algorithm is demonstrated using simulated data for phase connectivities in distribution networks.

A system has been developed which uses a thrust-boring mole of the type now in common use in the construction industry to install sub-surface <b>service</b> <b>mains</b> without excavation. The system has been developed with the aim of ut il is i ng the groundwater resources which are present in thin shallow uncemented sandy aquifers but whose exploitation by borehole or shaft-only dugwell would be marginal due to small available drawdowns and moderate to low permeabilities. Mesh-wrapped plastic screen is emplaced inside jacked-out temporary steel casing which is then retracted under a small positive hydraulic head in order to avoid sandlocking and formation ingress into the main shaft. 38 mm 10 pipe has been used, and rapid autodevelopment by the radials has provided coll ctors with yields of 1. 5 lis/radial from fine running sands. Arrays have been emplaced to over 20 m length with a 98 mm head at jacking forces of less than 7 tonnes f. The equipment required for the construction of the collectors is light to transport and install and significantly less expensive than a downhole rotary drill ing rig to buy and operate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to assess how the Customer Delivery Center (CDC) satisfies prescriptive design requirements of the 2012 International Building Code (IBC) for fire exiting, structural design, smoke detection, alarm notification and communication and water-based fire suppression. A performance-based analysis is then performed using hand calculations and computer-based models {{to determine if the}} available safe egress time exceeds the required safe egress time from the building. In order to complete this analysis, the issued-for-construction design and the contractor submittals were made accessible by the owner’s fire protection engineer and the project management group overseeing construction. These documents were reviewed and a thorough study was performed using the 2012 IBC, the NFPA 101 Life Safety Code (LSC) and other NFPA standards. All design elements that have been analyzed meet the IBC 2012 code requirements for safe egress. Occupants of this multi-use facility have been characterized and literature has been used to identify model parameters to determine total evacuation time for the building. The estimated total required evacuation time ranges from 6. 5 to 9. 9 minutes after alarm notification. The structural design satisfies all prescriptive requirements. The construction and building elements are designed to meet Type I-A per the IBC Section 503. The alarm system satisfies all prescriptive requirements. The current NFPA National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code (2013) and handbooks for fire alarm and signaling and system commissioning were consulted. Although a couple of omissions in the drawings were found during this analysis, only one recommendation for improving the design is made. Visual inspection of the ceiling mounted strobes in the warehouse should be performed to ensure that all areas have visibility of the signal. The water supply is sufficient in capacity and pressure to meet the system demand. The current NFPA standards for automatic sprinkler systems, private fire <b>service</b> <b>mains,</b> rack storage and system commissioning were consulted. The water suppression system design exceeds the minimum requirements in the code for water protection. No recommendations for improving the design have been made. Several performance based analyses are considered based on a hazard assessment and criteria from the Life Safety Code. The results of the performance based analysis of an open office workstation fire are included. A design fire in the third floor open office area results in tenable conditions of visibility, temperature and toxicity for allowing occupants to safely leave the third floor and all occupants to safely exit the building. Finally, a prescriptive analysis and a performance based analysis of an exterior exposure fire involving an aircraft fuel spill is included. Background on the NFPA 415 “Standard for Airport Terminal Buildings, Fueling Ramp Drainage, and Loading Walkways” (2016) is provided. Life safety and asset protection objectives are met by a combination of building features...|$|E

50|$|The first {{water mains}} in Philadelphia were {{installed}} in the 1800s. Philadelphia Water currently maintains 3,200 miles of water mains that can be classified into three distinct sections of mains: transmission mains, distribution <b>mains,</b> and <b>service</b> mains.Transmission <b>mains</b> are larger water mains that move vast amounts of water across Philadelphia between pump stations and reservoirs. They are typically more than 16 inches in diameter. Distribution mains, by comparison, are smaller than 16 inches in diameter and are used to carry water from transmission <b>mains</b> to customer <b>service</b> connections. Service connections are the individual connections owned by the property owner that connect to distribution mains and channel water into a building or house.|$|R

40|$|Poverty {{reduction}} {{is a primary}} goal of development policy. In {{large parts of the}} World people have to live on meagre incomes and have limited access to infrastructure <b>services,</b> such as <b>mains</b> water, safe sanitation, mains power supplies, maintained roads and telephones. In response, more and more infrastructure provision has been opened up to private investment {{over the last two decades}} and regulatory institutions have been introduced to protect the public interest in the absence of state ownership. In this paper the role of infrastructure regulation in poverty {{reduction is}} investigated drawing on the published evidence. The conclusion is that the evidence is both patchy and sometimes contradictory. There is mixed knowledge regarding the extent to which regulators address poverty issues and about the results of regulatory decisions. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda aimed at improving our understanding of the ways in which infrastructure regulation impacts on poverty, with the objective of improving actual regulatory policy in developing economies. ...|$|R

The model dosing rates were then assessed based on dissolved sulfide and total odour reduction, cost and availability of the chemical, safety of the dosing operation, and impact on WWTP performance. A permanent chemical dosing strategy using MHL has been proposed based on its safer operation, positive impact on the WWTP and more effective long-term odour control within the network and at the WWTP...|$|R
40|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{design on}} our urban threshold is increasingly becoming topical. In Adelaide {{it is being}} driven by stormwater management strategies and economic efficiencies {{in a city that}} is beginning to embrace its Mediterranean environment, low water sustainability, and whether our showpiece public domains in Adelaide can afford large expanses of manicured lawns. This paper reviews four projects in progress along the North Terrace in Adelaide. The first involves a major redesign of First Creek as it traverses Adelaide Botanic Garden to address stormwater management issues. The redesign includes strategies to control flash flooding, to cleanse stream water from pollutants, and to carefully incorporate a wetland system as an integral botanical and horticultural feature of a botanic garden. Further down North Terrace, the University of Adelaide is evaluating a scenario that will totally redesign Goodman Crescent, its picture-postcard promenade lawn. The scenario is to host an integrated water retention and water purification and cleansing system that will <b>service</b> independently of <b>mains</b> water an irrigation system and a waterfall. The proposal draws upon a similar strategy recently adopted by the South Australian Museum to capture and cleanse surface and roof water but place the installation and process on display as part of it...|$|R
40|$|Companies {{owned by}} the largest Italian {{municipal}} councils: quality and efficiency {{in the provision of}} local public services - Calculation and comparison of quality and efficiency indicators in the provision of local public services have been a relatively neglected field of research in industrial economics. Even the regulatory bodies, if any, which supervise these sectors, have generally failed to construct rigorous and exhaustive databases, and therefore lack what would be an essential tool to exercise their power as regulators. An incomplete and unclear picture emerges, where what little available information there is, {{is to be found in}} the "charters of service" drawn up by the companies themselves using selfreferential codes and methodologies that are neither shared nor controlled. The lack of transparence in information terms often goes hand-in-hand with operating inefficiencies, which can be perpetrated more easily in the absence of suitable benchmarking activity. This article seeks to provide an account of an extensive research project to collect and compile quality and efficiency indicators which the Mediobanca Research Department has carried out on behalf of the Civicum Foundation with reference to local public service operators controlled by six of the leading Italian municipalities (Bologna, Brescia, Milan, Naples, Rome and Turin) between 2003 and 2007..
