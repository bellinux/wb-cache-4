However, in many economic settings, twins are not exogenous as dizygotic twinning {{is known to be}} correlated with maternal characteristics and fertility treatments. Following the medical literature, we assume that monozygotic twins are exogenous, and construct a new instrument, which corrects for the selection bias although monozygotic twinning is usually unobserved.

40|$|Although {{theoretical}} models of labor supply {{and the family}} are well developed, there are few credible estimates of key empirical relationships in the work-family nexus. This study uses a new instrumental variable, the sex composition {{of the first two}} births in families with at least two children, to estimate the effect of additional children on parents' labor supply. Instrumental variables estimates using the sex mix are substantial but smaller than the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. Moreover, unlike the OLS estimates, the female labor supply effects estimated using sex-mix instruments appear to be absent among more educated women and women with high-wage husbands. We also find that married women who have a third child reduce their labor supply by as much as women in the full sample, while there is no relationship between wives' child-bearing and husbands' labor supply. Finally results to estimates produced using <b>twins</b> to generate <b>instruments.</b> Estimates using <b>twins</b> <b>instruments</b> are very close to the estimates generated by sex-mix instruments, once the estimators are corrected for differences in the ages of children whose birth was caused by the instruments. The estimates imply that the labor supply consequences of child-bearing disappear by the time the child is about 13 years old. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{sheds light}} on the undiscovered effects of <b>twinning</b> <b>instrument.</b> It explores whether the {{candidate}} countries are but mere ‘importers’ of Europeanization {{in the framework of}} institutional twinning and what the object of importation really is. The paper is based on two main assumptions: implementation of twinning projects enables imposed transposition of the EU acquis and it opens space for additional voluntary transfer of member states’ laws and institutions into candidate country’s legal and administrative system. It may be concluded that voluntary transposition of sophisticated objects, such as administrative procedures and methodologies, managerial styles and strategies and ‘ways of doing things’, is the most common result of horizontal twinning cooperation. Practice, though, reveals that the principle of administrative cooperation between twinning partners is misbalanced, which disturbsthe triangular administrative model. ‘Twinners’ focus more on transposition of institutional ‘non-acquis’ based on diverse domestic administrative solutions than on the transfer of legal obligations stipulated in the EU Directive...|$|R

By constructing change around local governance capabilities, the Twinning programme acts upon individual skills, institutional arrangements and relationships, deploys benchmarking techniques, and empowers subjects and government behaviour in order to bring conduct to certain economic logics and exercises.

40|$|Cognitive {{skills have}} been shown to be a strong {{predictor}} of educational attainment and future labor market success; as a result, understanding the determinants of cognitive skills can lead to a better understanding of children’s long run outcomes. But how do families influence the ability of children? This paper uses a large dataset on the male population of Norway and focuses on one family characteristic: the effect of family size on IQ. Because of the endogeneity of family size, we instrument for family size using twin births and sex composition. IV estimates using sex composition as an instrument show no negative effect of family size; however, IV estimates using twins imply that family size has a negative effect on IQ. Further investigation of the specific features of the <b>twins</b> <b>instrument</b> – the addition of extra children at zero spacing and typically with much lower birth weight than singletons – suggests that the twins estimates are unlikely to generalize to other types of increase in family size.
