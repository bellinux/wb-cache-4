However, MFH of the mesentery is very rare, and locally recurred MFH is even rarer. MFH is severely malignant and invasive regionally. The neoplasm can spread quickly. This report is about {{a case of a}} recurred MFH in the mesentery, which locally recurred within 3 years from the original operation. The patient (female, age 71) underwent a resection of the <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> mesentery of the recurrent MFH with negative resection margins. In the 24 months that followed, there has not been any evidence of recurrence or other metastasis in the patient. Although the prognosis of recurred MFH in mesentery was poor, a clear resection might provide a good opportunity for long-term survival, suggesting that surgery might be an effective treatment. This is the first report on the surgical treatment of recurrent MFH of the mesentery...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoide sind entscheidend an der Regulation physiologischer Prozesse beteiligt. Auf zellulaerer Ebene spielen sie eine Schluesselrolle in der Regulation von Differenzierungs- und Apoptosevorgaengen. Diese Regulationsmechanismen sind vor allem in adaptiven Geweben, die sich in ihrer Funktion staendig an neue Anforderungen anpassen muessen, von enormer Bedeutung. Der Gastrointestinaltrakt ist eines der am staerksten beanspruchten Organe. Sowohl die Anpassung an veraenderte Nahrungsverhaeltnisse, als auch die staendige Belastung mit einer Vielzahl an Antigenen, erfordert eine genau abgestimmte Regulation der Zellteilung, Differenzierung und Apoptose. Bei Schweinen konnte gezeigt werden, dass Unterschiede in den Turnoverraten von Skelettmuskulatur und Darm den unterschiedlichen Glucocorticoidrezeptor (GCR) Konzentrationen zugeschrieben werden koennen. Dies erklaert zum Teil die gewebsspezifische Sensitivitaet auf zirkulierende Corticoide. Studien zur GCR-Verteilung im Intestinaltrakt tragen daher zum Verstaendnis der Regulationsmechanismen bei. Bislang waren Rezeptorstudien beim Schwein nur ueber Bindungsstudien moeglich. Nachteilig ist hierbei, dass in komplexen Gewebsstrukturen, wie z. B. dem Darm, die Rezeptoren nicht den verschiedenen Zelltypen zugeordnet werden koennen. Weiterhin ist ueber Bindungsstudien nur der Nachweis des nichtaktivierten Rezeptors moeglich. Daher war es das Ziel der Untersuchungen, Antiseren gegen den Glucocoridcoidrezeptor des Schweins zu erstellen. Teilarbeiten hierzu waren die Sequenzanalyse der cDNA des GCR und die Klonierung ausreichend grosser Fragmente in rekombinanten Expressionssystemen. Darauf aufbauend sollten speziesspezifische Antikoerper gegen Fragmente des Rezeptorproteins erzeugt werden. Dazu wurde ein Fragment mit ca. 2, 1 kb der GCR cDNA (gcr 2. 1) sequenziert. Fuer die rekombinante Expression eines GCR-Antigens wurde ein Proteinfragement (135 AS) aus der modulatorischen Region (GCRmr) gewaehlt und als His-tag Fusionsprotein in ein T 7 -Expressionssystem kloniert. Nach affinitaetschromatographischer und praeparativer Aufreinigung des Fusionproteins ueber Ni-NTA-Agarose und SDS-PAGE wurden Kaninchen immunisiert. Das Anti-pGCR-Antiserum bindet mit hoher Affinitaet das pGCRmr Antigen sowie den denaturierten Rezeptor im Western Blot. Immunpraezipitationsversuche zeigten, dass das Antiserum den nativen Rezeptor in seiner inaktivierten Form als Multiproteinkomplex gekoppelt an HSP 90, als auch in seiner aktivierten Form mit abgespaltenem HSP 90 bindet. Die Resultate der Immunpraezipitation bestaetigen die Anwendbarkeit der Antikoerper in der Immunhistochemie. Praktische Anwendung fand das charakterisierte Antiserum in immunhistochemischen Studien zur Verteilung und Lokalisation des GCR im Duenn- und Dickdarm von Ebern und Kastraten. Die intrazellulaere Verteilung des GCR wurde mittels Western Blot Techniken untersucht. Bei Kastraten und Ebern kann in der Lamina propria ein Anstieg rezeptortragender Zellen von den proximalen Duenndarmbereichen Duodenum und Jejunum in Richtung Colon festgestellt werden. Die Immunfaerbung der Epithelzellen zeigt bei beiden Tiergruppen ein umgekehrtes Muster wie in der Lamina propria. Werden die beiden Gruppen - Eber und Kastraten - vergleichend betrachtet, zeigt sich, dass nur signifikante Unterschiede in der Anzahl GCR immunreaktiver Zellen in der Lamina propria zu beobachten sind. Im Duodenum sind bei Ebern etwa 10 % weniger immunreaktive Zellen zu verzeichnen als bei Kastraten. Im Jejunum ist derselbe Effekt, allerdings wesentlich ausgepraegter, zu beobachten. Hier sind etwa 30 % weniger immunreaktive Zellen. Im Dickdarm sind keine signifikanten Unterschiede festzustellen. UEber die intrazellulaere Rezeptorverteilung koennen folgenden Aussagen getroffen werden: in den einzelnen Darmabschnitten besteht zwischen Kastraten und Ebern sowohl in der Cytosol als auch in der Kernfraktion kein entscheidender Unterschied; im Ileum ist der Anteil des GCR im Cytosol kleiner als im Kern und im Colon ist der Anteil des GCR im Cytosol groesser als im Kern. Die unterschiedliche intrazellulaere GCR Lokalisation in den beiden Darmabschnitten kann durch die erhoehte Expression der 11 beta-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase 2 im Colon erklaert werden. 11 beta-HSD 2 inaktiviert Cortisol und unterbindet somit die Aktivierung und damit Translokation des Rezeptors in den Kern. Glucocorticoids {{are well}} known to be {{essential}} for many physiological and developmental processes. Such functions include their effects on carbohydrate and protein metabolism and their regulatory influences on the immune system. In cell regulation they play a dose-dependent key role for differentiation and apoptosis. In rapidly renewing tissues the stringent control of these mechanisms {{is central to the}} maintenance of tissue homeostasis. ln the gastrointestinal tract both the adaption to changing nutrients and the presentation with a vast array of different types of antigens, including potential pathogens and harmless dietary antigens requires a granular regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death. In the pig, the differences in the turn-over rate for instance between skeletal muscle and the gut tissue could be attributed to different GCR concentrations respectively. This explains the tissue specific sensitivty on circulating corticoids. Thus studies on GCR distribution contributes to the clarification of the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of these mechanisms in the intestinal tract. In the pig, so far receptor detection has been performed by radio ligand binding assays, which only measures steroid unoccupied non-activated receptors in the cytoplasm. Selective GCR antibodies react with both occupied and unoccupied GCR. In addition, antibodies enable celltype specific detection of the GCR in complex tissues by immunocytochemistry. The aim of this investigation was the production of porcine GCR-specific polyclonal antibodies by detailed analysis of the cDNA sequence of the GCR and the recombinant expression of a suitable antigen fragment. A fragment with 2. 1 kb of the GCR cDNA (gcr 2. 1) was sequenced. Based on Blast sequence analysis a GCR antigen fragment for recombinant expression was selected from the modulatory region (GCRmr) and cloned in a T 7 -expression system as a His-tag fusion protein. After affinity chromatographic und preparative purification The anti-pGCR-antibodies bind the pGCRmr antigen with high affinity, as well as the denatured receptor in western blot analysis. In additon, immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that cytosolic GCR is recognized regardless of whether it is unoccuppied or occuppied with dexamethasone. Thus, the antiserum is able to bind the native GCR both in its inactivated form as a multiprotein complex in association with HSP 90 and in its activated form with shed HSP 90. Our investigations with immunoprecipitation assays support the applicability of the anti-pGCR antiserum in immunohistochemistry. The characterized antibodies were implemented in immunohistochemy for studies of distribution and localization of the GCR in the <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> colon of boars and barrows. The intracellular distribution of the GCR was examined by western blot assays. Immunohistochemical studies showed an increased number of immunostained GCR in the colon compared with the small intestine, as has been shown earlier with ligand-binding assays. 32, 9 % and 14, 5 % of the cells of the lamina propria were GCR immunoreactive in the small intestine of barrows and boars. In the colon 49, 3 % and 43, 3 % showed immunostaining. Epithelial cells showed a reversed pattern compared to the lamina propria in both groups. The number of GCR immunoreactive cells in barrows and boars decreased from 9, 6 % and 9 % in the small intestine to 5, 4 and 5, 6 % in the colon, respectively. Comparison of both groups ? barrows and boars - revealed significant differences in the number of GCR immunoreactive cells in the lamina propria of the small bowl. Boars showed a decreased GCR expression of 10 % in the duodenum and 30 % in the jejunum. The number of GCR immuostained colonic cells amounts to 36, 9 % in the colon ascendens and 49, 2 % in the colon descendens of boars and 47, 5 % and 51 % in barrows. Studies of the subcellular localization by western blot analysis of cytosolplasmic and nuclear proteins demonstrated that in both groups in the ileum a higher amount of GCR was translocated into the nucleus. In the colon the number of cytoplasmic GCR was higher. The different subcellular GCR distribution in the two segments of the intestine {{can be explained by the}} increased expression of 11 â-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 in the colon. 11 â-HSD 2 inactivates cortisol and thus inhibits receptor activation and thereby translocation to the nucleus...|$|E

Pottery found at the site is almost exclusively of four types: bowls on fenestrated pedestals, <b>small</b> <b>bowls,</b> cornets <b>and</b> animal figurines. This limited variety may reflect its cultic significance — bowls on fenestrated pedestals have also been found in the Chalcolithic temple in Megiddo.|$|R
50|$|At {{the onset}} of the Holocene, pottery appears early at Ounjougou, {{during the first half of}} the 10th {{millennium}} BC. The region was then confronted with the return of more humid conditions linked to a rapid return of the monsoons after the Younger Dryas and the development of an open grassland savanna on the Bandiagara Plateau. In this context, populations made pottery characterized especially by <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> <b>and</b> imprinted décors. The appearance of pottery at Ounjougou is associated with a small bifacial point lithic industry. These innovations are quite likely linked to environmental changes during the establishment of tropical savannas during the Early Holocene, the new composition of hunted fauna that resulted and the development of edible wild grasses. This phase thus probably coincides with the establishment of a form of proto-agricultural economy, consisting of a strategy of selective and intensive gathering of grasses. In the layers dated to the 8th mill. BC, the pottery is also associated with grinding materials (grindstones and crushers). This occupation phase at Ounjougou was thus associated with an early Neolithic.|$|R

50|$|The {{so-called}} Golden Horn ware was {{a variation}} on the blue-and-white decoration that was popular from the late 1520s to 1550s. Golden Horn ware was so named because sherds in this style were excavated in the Golden Horn area of Istanbul. It was later realized that the pottery was made in İznik as some motifs on the vessels closely resembled those used on other blue-and-white Iznik pottery. The decoration consists of a series of thin spirals adorned with small leaves. The narrow rims of dishes are painted with a meandering pattern. The design is similar to the illuminated spiral scrolls used as a background to Sultan Suleymans Tuğra, or imperial monogram. Julian Raby has used the term Tuğrakeş spiral ware as the tuğrakeş were the specialist calligraphers in the Ottoman court. The earlier vessels were painted in cobalt blue while later vessels often include turquoise, olive-green and black. A number of dishes dating from this period show the influence of Italian pottery. The <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> <b>and</b> a large flat rims are similar in shape to maiolica tondino dishes that were popular in Italy between 1500 and 1530.|$|R
50|$|<b>Small</b> <b>bowls</b> <b>and</b> cornets of {{this period}} can be {{especially}} thin and {{appear to have been}} turned on wheels, but they are only finished that way. Recent research on the techniques of bowl making in this period indicate these vessels, while turned on a wheel, were actually only finished that way by scraping, after having been fashioned by hand. There is no evidence to show that the fast potter's wheel was used in the Chalcolithic period for 'throwing pots' using centripetal force. The wavy line or indented ledge handle makes its appearance in the central littoral in this period, presaging its adoption as {{the most common type of}} handle throughout the Early Bronze Age. Common decorations include raised, rope-like bands on some vessels, red painting and pie-crust like decoration on rims of large vessels (excepting holemouths. Combing, that produced wide, broad, flat lines, is sometimes found on jars of the Late Chalcolithic. Pronounced regional variations as well as functions of sites determine the kinds of vessels, types of clay used, and the forms of decoration preferred. Chalcolithic pottery technology and morphology greatly influenced the ceramic styles of the succeeding Early Bronze I period, especially in the southern region.|$|R
