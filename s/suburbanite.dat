25|$|Anxiety over {{imminent}} events {{grips the}} main characters in Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea, and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies. A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of D-ale carnavalului, whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally. Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican <b>suburbanite</b> Miţa Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation. Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis {{on the fact that}} Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.|$|E

[...] She began public speaking as a hobby, following her doctor's advice. Iris McCord, a Chicago radio broadcaster who taught at the Moody Bible Institute, arranged for her to address local church groups. Within a year Dilling was touring the Midwest, the Northeast and occasionally the West Coast, accompanied by her husband. She showed her home movies of the Soviet Union and made the same speech several times a week to audiences sometimes as large as several hundred, hosted by organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the American Legion.|$|E

When Gherea was challenged {{from the left}} by a pseudonymous author, I. Saint Pierre, Bacalbașa and his journal reacted with vehemence, debating over this issue with Steuerman-Rodion, a more moderate socialist chronicler. Yet another target for Toni's criticism was the old historian and novelist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who, still grieving for his daughter Iulia, {{allowed himself to be}} entirely absorbed into the polemic. Bacalbașa was widely credited as the winner of this collateral dispute, and even Hasdeu was pleasantly surprised by his talents, recommending him as Romania's only genuine journalist.|$|E
2500|$|Car {{ownership}} flourished {{during the}} postwar period, with 1970/1971 census data estimating that 96.4 per cent of Australian {{households in the}} early Seventies owned at least one car. However, not all felt the rapid suburban growth was desirable. Distinguished Architect and designer Robin Boyd, a critic of Australia's built surroundings, described Australia as [...] "'the constant sponge lying in the Pacific', following the fashions of overseas and lacking confidence in home-produced, original ideas." [...] In 1956, dadaist comedian Barry Humphries performed the character of Edna Everage as a parody of a house-proud housewife of staid 1950s Melbourne suburbia (the character only later morphed into a critique of self-obsessed celebrity culture).

40|$|Data {{from the}} 2005 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) {{indicate}} <b>suburbanites,</b> compared with city dwellers, have on average higher per-capita residential energy consumption. However, {{it is not}} clear why <b>suburbanites</b> tend to consume more energy at home. Using a two-group structural equation modeling, I analyzed direct and total effects of household’s sociodemographic characteristics, income, and building’s characteristics on per-capita energy consumption for <b>suburbanites</b> and city-dwellers. Results show that while modeling results show that household’s sociodemographic characteristics have the largest total effect on energy consumption per-capita in both models, the difference between the magnitudes of effect is only marginal between cities and suburbs. The direct impact of income on energy consumption index is also identical between the two models; however, the total effect is bigger for the <b>suburbanites.</b> Impact of income on housing characteristics is also bigger for the <b>suburbanites.</b> Overall, the biggest difference between cities and suburbs appears to be the effect of building characteristics on per- capita energy consumption, with suburban homes being 19 % more influential in increasing per-capita energy consumption. Such an increased impact also carries the indirect effect of households’ characteristics, implying an often-neglected hierarchy of effects and consequences between household characteristics, housing characteristics and residential energy outcomes.

40|$|Excerpt] <b>Suburbanites</b> {{are more}} likely to {{participate}} in the labor force than are city dwellers, and their unemployment rates are usually lower as well. These labor-market outcomes for <b>suburbanites</b> and city dwellers hold across the major age, sex, race, and educational attainment groups. In addition, groups that usually have poorer labor market outcomes are overrepresented in cities. This summary compares labor force participation and unemployment rates for persons living in the 25 largest central cities with those of persons living in the suburbs of those cities. The data (1997 annual averages) were collected through the Current Population Survey (CPS), a nationwide monthly survey of some 50, 000 households. It {{should be noted that the}} CPS is a survey of households, not employers. Thus, the classification of people as city dwellers or <b>suburbanites</b> depends on where they live, not where they work...|$|R

Respondents rated their satisfaction with housing, public schools, public clinics, public transport, roads, personal safety, street lighting, household refuse removal, jobs, local government and the neighbourhood. Black <b>suburbanites</b> tended to be more satisfied than the other three groups with most of these aspects. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that housing and personal safety accounted for 45 per cent (informal settlement), 21 per cent (squatter camp), 33 per cent (black <b>suburbanites),</b> and 28 per cent (white <b>suburbanites)</b> of the variance in neighbourhood satisfaction. The findings substantiated the importance of housing and personal safety in both disadvantaged and advantaged communities.

40|$|In recent years, a {{significant}} feature of population change in North American metropolitan areas {{has been the}} rapid suburbanization of elderly people. The ability to engage in routine activity may be {{a necessary condition for}} the maintenance of independent life styles and psychological well-being among older <b>suburbanites.</b> Using a conceptual framework based on Parmelee and Lawton's ecological model of aging, this article offers an exploratory investigation of the determinants of the travel of separate samples of elderly male and female <b>suburbanites</b> to each of five destination categories of key service/activity sites in a Canadian city. The results of the tests of ten multiple regression models disclose that the levels of explanation of trip frequency afforded by "autonomy components" (e. g. health-related characteristics, living arrangements, and income level) vary according to destination category. However, the explanatory power of "security components" (i. e. variables concerning access to destination categories) is generally low.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the nature of the black middle-class assimilation in the South African suburban space, a space that was the sole preserve of the white middle-class during apartheid. It explores the relationship between these races as they come to meet in this space and what new identities are being formed. It also explores the relationship between both the black and white <b>suburbanites</b> and the urban poor who stay in an adjacent area to the suburb. The study uses the Beacon Bay area, which is constituted by one of East London’s most affluent suburbs and a poor township, Nompumelelo, to show how the emergent black middle-class has managed to enter this space in the post-apartheid era. Previous studies by Richard Ballard (2004) and Grant Saff (2001) have shown how the white middle-class has always been against any form of race or class mixing. Within the suburb, the new black <b>suburbanites</b> in Beacon Bay appear to have been welcomed but with conditions by their fellow white counterparts. The relationship between these two races does not stretch beyond meet and greets and {{it is only in the}} second generation black middle-class that you find better and non-superficial relations with fellow white <b>suburbanites.</b> In the older generation, the generation that experienced apartheid, the relationship between these two races has been that of tolerance and serious escape of contact unless when necessary. The children of both white and black families, though, have a far better relationship in school and in sport than their parents. This has created another area of contact for both these races and it bears potential for meaningful integration in the suburban space. Externally as it relates to relations between the black middle-class and the urban poor, the findings show that these new black <b>suburbanites</b> express a similar discomfort as the white <b>suburbanites</b> about the urban poor’s presence in the area. This shows that the evolution of the Beacon Bay suburb, with its deep-rooted discourse of white middle-class exclusivity, has not been entirely about hatred of the urban poor necessarily but about an identity ascription of what it means to live in a suburb. Despite these realities traditional ceremonies organised by the black middle-class in the suburbs and the church appear to be playing a role in creating relations between these <b>suburbanites</b> and the Nompumelelo residents. This is why we have decided to use the conceptualisation of the 18 th century frontier zone as the borders of segregation within the suburb and between the suburban residents and those of the township can be crossed and re-crossed...|$|R

We review three arguments that have been offered in favor of suburbs 2 ̆ 019 fiscal assistance to their central cities. First, the central city provides public services that benefit suburban residents. Second, the central city may provide redistributive services to low-income central city residents that benefit <b>suburbanites</b> with redistributive preferences for such transfers.
