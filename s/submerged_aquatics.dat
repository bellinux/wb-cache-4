50|$|Plants usually rely on soil {{primarily}} for support and water (in quantitative terms), but also obtain compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and other elemental nutrients. Epiphytic and lithophytic plants depend on air and nearby debris for nutrients, and carnivorous plants supplement their nutrient requirements with insect prey that they capture. For {{the majority of}} plants to grow successfully they also require oxygen in the atmosphere and around their roots (soil gas) for respiration. Plants use oxygen and glucose (which may be produced from stored starch) to provide energy. Some plants grow as <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics,</b> using oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water, and a few specialized vascular plants, such as mangroves, can grow with their roots in anoxic conditions.|$|E

We evaluated the relationship of bluegill growth, recruitment, size structure, mor-tality, maturity, production, and relative abundance to <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatic</b> vegetation species richness, quality, value to fish and occurrence using data from 2, 571 surveys on Minnesota lakes to better understand how bluegill population dynamics are affected by alterations in <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatic</b> vegetation. Bluegill populations exhibited fast juvenile growth, high mor-tality and production in lakes where plant communities were less susceptible to disturbance and had low diversity, compared to diverse, susceptible plant communities. Adult bluegill grew faster in diverse, susceptible plant communities. The susceptibility and diversity of <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatic</b> vegetation communities explained variation in bluegill growth, mortality, and production based on Akaike and Bayes Information Criteria.

Most non-chemical methods have been of limited value in controlling or eradicating aquatic weeds. Even with aquatic herbicides, {{it is difficult to}} effectively control submerged species, due to inadequate plant exposure and uptake.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{occurrence}} of Potamogeton praelongus in the Netherlands, which {{has always been one}} of the rarer Potamogeton species in our country. In the 19 th century and {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century it was recorded from several localities in the western and central part of the country, but nowadays it is almost restricted to the north-eastern part, its extinction elsewhere presumably being due to salination and pollution of the water. It is supposed that P. praelongus prefers percolation areas; it occurs chiefly on the border zones of sand and peat districts. Sometimes it is found on river clay. The species is often accompanied by Potamogeton lucens, Nuphar lutea, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, and Sagittaria sagittifolia. If P. praelongus is compared with P. lucens, P. perfoliatus and P. pectinatus, all of them large, <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics,</b> it turns out that they show a decreasing salt tolerance in the order P. pectinatus – P. praelongus P. perfoliatus – P. lucens – In the same order they are increasingly restricted to deep, clear water.

40|$|There is {{a marked}} {{contrast}} between the theory {{and the practice of}} conservation in terrestrial environments {{on the one hand and}} in most aquatic environments, including those of the coastal marine zone, on the other. It is effectively axiomatic in the terrestrial sphere that conservation requires active management. It is not sufficient simply to safeguard an area from external threats, although that could also be important. Without active intervention, a given terrestrial system is likely to change into another, almost certainly of lesser conservation interest. The habitat must be manipulated so as to maintain it in a form suitable for the species and the communities of interest, and the populations of certain species—most especially various potentially superior competitors and often significant consumers—must be controlled in order to favour others. Burning, grazing and many other tools are routinely used to prevent natural changes. To a degree, the same is also true of freshwater habitats: control of water tables, of water quality, of fringing stands of vegetation and of <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics</b> are all well-known and much practised measures. Marine and brackish-water systems are treated differently, however. Through much of the past, these have been conserved only insofar as they lay within the boundaries of conservation areas declared—and managed—for other purposes, whether these have been botanical or ornithological. More recently, however, they have become the focus of conservation interest in their own right with the declaration o...|$|E

40|$|Haloragaceae are a {{relatively}} small family of 8 genera and approximately 120 species; yet, they display a rare and extreme diversity in habit, ranging from small trees to <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics.</b> The center of diversity for the family is Australia where three genera are endemic. Four genera are primarily terrestrial (Glischrocaryon, Gonocarpus, Haloragis, and Haloragodendron) while four are aquatic/semi-aquatic (Laurembergia, Meziella, Myriophyllum and Proserpinaca). Myriophyllum is the most speciose Haloragaceae genus (2 ̆ 6 ap; 60 spp.) and has a cosmopolitan distribution. Evolutionary relationships within Haloragaceae {{have been difficult to}} ascertain, particularly due to uncertain placement of the various aquatic/semi-aquatic genera in relation to each other and the terrestrial taxa. Phylogenetic analyses using both chloroplast (trnK, matK) and nuclear (ITS- 1, ITS- 2 and 5. 8 S) DNA sequence data have given insight into relationships among all the genera and many species of Haloragaceae. The terrestrial woody genera (Glischrocaryon and Haloragodendron) are basal-branching in the family, and form a clade sister {{to the rest of the}} family. The position of the recently rediscovered monotypic genus Meziella is supported as monophyletic with Myriophyllum. The semi-aquatic species Haloragis brownii and H. tenuifolia are only distantly related to other Haloragis and have unique morphological characters that argue for their distinct generic status. Phylogenetic analyses support some of the generic and subgeneric limits in Haloragaceae as proposed in Orchard 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) treatments, but some striking differences are apparent involving the generic limits of Glischrocaryon, Gonocarpus and Haloragis. The large aquatic genus Myriophyllum is divided into two distinct clades and several new taxa have been uncovered through phylogenetic analyses. The aquatic genera do not form a clade and the aquatic habit may have evolved independently multiple times in Haloragaceae. Alternatively a reversal from the aquatic habit to terrestrial habit may have evolved. ...|$|E
40|$|Submerged {{aquatic plants}} pose {{problems}} in Australian and New Zealand waterways for navigation, flood management, bank erosion, recreation and aesthetics. Among problematic species are: Lagarosiphon (Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss), Egeria (Egeria densa Planch.), Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) and Elodea (Elodea canadensis Michx.). These species prefer clear water, where they form dense stands. The problem in controlling these plants relates to their mode of spread; the smallest viable vegetative fragment can re-establish a population. Left uncontained, these aquatic weeds {{are likely to}} fully colonize all available habitats, within {{a short period of}} time. Recent advances in application technology have allowed the safe use of aquatic herbicides in control programs. A new technique for applying the aquatic herbicide- Diquat for the control of <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics</b> has been developed in New Zealand. This method involves the use of guar gum, and formulating a Diquat gel form (Hydrogelâ), which can then be applied to water. Hydrogel provides a greater degree of control, and allows the targeting of specific areas while significantly reducing offsite herbicide drift. Treatment trials of the formula “Hydrogel”, were undertaken at a number of sites in New Zealand and NSW, against a range of submerged aquatic weeds. Results indicate that control can be achieved at significantly less cost than control by mechanical and other means. Water quality monitoring results show negligible herbicide residues downstream of the treatment sites. Future trials will be undertaken to assess the long-term control options for aquatic weeds using Hydrogel and other aquatic herbicides. Larger-scale trials will be undertaken to assess the environmental fate of herbicides in water and the wider aquatic ecosystem. The ability to use herbicide for the control of submerged aquatic weeds will significantly improve the cost-effectiveness and environmental effects of river control works, channel clearing and dam maintenance in the future...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic plants offer a {{technically}} simple, low cost, energy-efficient {{method of}} treating domestic greywater. Aquatic plant systems require little technical back-up and {{are easy to}} maintain. Certain rooted aquatic plants have bacteriocidal properties {{and the ability to}} breakdown chemical pollutants, and <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics</b> are also important as oxygenators. Reeds and rushes take up and store nutrients themselves, provide a growing area for micro-organisms, stimulate the soil activity by root excretions and reduce the volume of effluent by transpiration. Effluent passes through various stages and the wastewater is gradually stripped of nutrients and pollutants. However, conventional reedbed systems are little more than monocultures of Phragmites, Baumea, Water Hyacinth, Typha or Schoenoplectus. Pond systems, employing a wider range of species, is a means to recycle more nutrients, improve treatment potential and mirror natural ecosystems - in ways to sustain the ecosystem. Species of Triglochin, commonly known as water ribbons throughout coastal Australia, are fast growing submergent macrophytes which seem to be adapted to high nutrient concentrations. In Western Australia, Triglochin huegelii is mainly a submergent plant but its leaves tend to float on the surface in shallow waterways and it has been found seasonally in some ephemeral swamps and lakes. As water recedes, the leaves become emergent. Initial studies using Triglochin huegelii in wastewater treatment experiments has shown that Triglochin has consistently more nitrogen and phosphorus than Schoenoplectus validus, an emergent commonly used for wastewater nutrient stripping, {{in all parts of the}} plant - leaves, tubers and roots. In some cases, such as in the leaves, twice as much nitrogen and one and a half times more phosphorus is assimilated in the Triglochin tissue. One prediction is that Triglochin huegelii will remove nitrogen and phosphorus at a greater rate than many other types of aquatic macrophytes. The implication is that instead of only planting the perimeter of lagoons, artificial wetlands and constructed basins we should be planting the bulk of the waterway with submergent species such as Triglochin spp which are far more effective in stripping nutrients than emergents currently used for that purpose...|$|E

These lakes, with <b>submerged</b> <b>aquatics</b> and hydroseral shore vegetation, lie {{today in the}} Abies religiosa-dominated forest belt. From c. 6320 to 2530 cal yr BP Zempoala shows a mixed forest with mesophyllous taxa, indicating warmer and more humid conditions than at present. From c. 2530 to 160 cal yr BP Abies forest and Pinus hartwegii forest dominated, indicating a temperate climate. During {{the first part of}} this period, from c. 2530 to 1150 cal yr BP abundant Pinus forest is indicative of drier climate conditions. During the last c. 310 cal yr of this period Abies-dominated forest prevailed, with a floral composition resembling the modem Abies forests. This is indicative of temperate and humid climatic conditions. During the last c. 160 cal yr BP the presence of Zea mays and Plantago reflect human impact. From c. 11, 610 to 10, 650 cal yr BP Quila shows Alnus and Pinus-dominated forest, reflecting humid climatic conditions. From 10, 650 to 5000 cal yr BP Pinus and Arceuthobium are indicative of a Pinus hartwegii forest, suggesting slightly lower temperatures than at present. A 25 -cm thick volcanic ash horizon at 380 - 355 cm core depth is the well-known 'yellow ash' marker with a known age of c. 4200 - 4800 C- 14 yr BP. This age is supported by our bracketing dates of 5620 and 4650 C- 14 yr BP. From 4630 to 1000 cal yr BP mixed forest, including Pinus, Quercus, Carpinus, Hedyosmum, Juglans and Artemisia, is indicative of mesophytic conditions. From 4630 to 1010 cal yr BP Abies forest was abundant, reflecting colder and more humid conditions. From c. 1010 to 20 cal yr BP Pinus forest was very abundant suggesting, as in site Zempoala, dry climatic conditions. The pollen record from Quila documents four different types of forest: Pinus/Alnus forest (possibly Alnus jorullensis in zone QUI-I), Pinus forest (most likely Pinus hartwegii forest in zone QUI-II), mixed forest in zone QUI-III), and Abies forest (Abies religiosa forest in zone QUI-IV). The last c. 1000 years show a decline of mixed forest and increasing Abies forest, reflecting cooler and more humid conditions. Quila also shows, during the most recent past, human impact by crop cultivation (Zea mays) and vegetation disturbance (Plantago) leading to erosion.
