5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of the 1918 {{pandemic}} {{was much}} deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those {{most at risk}} were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But in August, when the <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> began in France, Sierra Leone and the United States, the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the <b>second</b> <b>wave.</b> In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5000|$|One such {{example of}} the need to {{incorporate}} uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in the <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that [...] "for example, whilst equal pay is important for all of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all." [...] Therefore, the <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{infantry}} {{landing in the}} <b>second</b> <b>wave,</b> supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies. Combat engineers, tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in the <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was {{to capture}} Bayeux and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux {{to make it}} {{difficult}} for the Germans to move in reinforcements. The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> on King, the 151st Infantry Brigade, was tasked with capturing the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high ground between the Aure and Seulles rivers. Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E
5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> {{was also}} not {{under the command of}} the Emperor and was made up of a number of armies with their own commanders. Together, this group and the first wave {{numbered}} an estimated 60,000.|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensionality}} of 3 D pulsed <b>second</b> sound <b>wave</b> in He II {{emitted from}} a finite size heater is experimentally investigated and theoretically studied based on two-fluid model in this study. The detailed propagation of 3 D pulsed <b>second</b> sound <b>wave</b> is presented and reasonable {{agreement between the}} experimental and theoretical results is obtained. Heater size has a big influence on the profile of 3 D <b>second</b> sound <b>wave.</b> The counterflow between the superfluid and normal fluid components becomes inverse in the rarefaction of 3 D <b>second</b> sound <b>wave.</b> The amplitude of rarefaction decreases due to the interaction between <b>second</b> sound <b>wave</b> and quantized vortices, which explains the experimental results about <b>second</b> sound <b>wave</b> near [Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 2480 (1994) ]. The accumulation of dense quantized vortices {{in the vicinity of}} heater surface leads to the formation of a thermal boundary layer, and further increase of heating duration results in the occurrence of boiling phenomena.

5|$|There {{were further}} deportations from the capital. The first {{task was to}} {{identify}} those imprisoned. They were held for one day in a police station (Ottoman Turkish: Emniyeti Umumiye) and the Central Prison. A <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> brought the figure to between 500 and 600.|$|E
5|$|At 02:30 a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> {{of about}} 150 to 200 Japanese troops again {{attacked}} across the sandbar and was again almost completely wiped out. At {{least one of}} the surviving Imperial officers from this attack advised Ichiki to withdraw his remaining forces, but Ichiki declined to do so.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E

25|$|However, the Sisters of Mercy, who are {{frequently}} played at deathrock clubs, {{are generally not}} considered to be a deathrock band, as the most prominent example of their sound, Floodland, has more in common with second-wave gothic rock bands (as they were the <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> prime influence).|$|R
5|$|In 1337 Flemish weavers {{settled and}} {{introduced}} {{the manufacture of}} woollen cloth. More Flemish weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of linen and cotton. Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.|$|E
5|$|The brigade repulsed a heavy {{attack on}} the morning of 12 March, but settled into a {{relatively}} static position thereafter. On 9 May, the Garhwal Brigade was used as a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> in the first attacks of the Battle of Aubers Ridge, without success; they saw action again on the night of 15 May, where the leading battalions met heavy resistance and Blackader was forced to call off the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed that {{it must have been the}} same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the <b>second</b> <b>wave)</b> because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the brigade's glider units, forty Waco gliders {{carrying}} the 64th Airlanding Light Battery Royal Artillery and their 75mm pack howitzers, landed at 09:20. The thirty-five larger Horsa gliders, transporting the 300th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery and its equipment, failed to arrive, turning back to Italy due to an overcast sky at the landing zone. The Horsas returned with the afternoon's <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> landing at 15:04.|$|E
5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> {{of assault}} troops arrived at 06:35 on 32 LCVPs. Companies A and D of 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry landed on Tare Green and G and H on Uncle Red. They were {{accompanied}} by engineers and demolition teams tasked with removing beach obstacles and clearing the area directly behind the beach of obstacles and mines.|$|E
5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of work {{took place}} on the city walls in the late 15th century. Backed by {{substantial}} communal effort and financial contributions, Newingate was rebuilt between 1450 and 1470, and probably closely resembled the West Gate in style. Burgate was rebuilt in brick from 1475 onwards, again thanks to public contributions, but it was not completed until 1525, furnished with gunports and anachronistic battlements. Queningate was closed up at shortly after the 15th century, probably following {{the construction of a new}} postern gate nearby. West Gate was appointed the city gaol in 1453 by Henry VI, with Canterbury Castle serving as the county gaol.|$|E
50|$|For the Somme offensive, the Sheffield City {{battalion}} {{would have}} the dubious honour {{of being on the}} extreme left of the 15-mile British front. On 1 July, at 7.20 am, the battalion moved into No Man's Land while the German lines were mortared. The Germans responded with a counter-barrage while the <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> were coming out of the trenches.|$|R

Following Brunello et al. (2012), I exclude Spain and Greece because the compulsory schooling laws occurred too late to identify a treatment group.|$|R
50|$|While postfeminism {{was first}} used in the 1980s to {{describe}} a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label {{for a wide range}} of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> ideas. It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.|$|R
5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> set {{off from}} Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave. Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured. The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice-Marshal Paul Maltby, who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of {{the punk}} rock {{movement}} was breaking {{in the three}} countries where it had emerged, {{as well as in}} many other places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scholars}} have suggested the icon at Sinai {{could have been}} a possible representation of the Kamouliana icon of Christ or of the famous icon of Christ of the Chalke Gate, an image which was destroyed twice during the first and <b>second</b> <b>waves</b> of Byzantine Iconoclasmfirst in 726, and again in 814and thus its connection with the Christ Pantocrator is difficult to confirm.|$|R
