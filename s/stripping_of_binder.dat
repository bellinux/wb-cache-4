40|$|Since 1997, the MMLS 3 {{has been}} used as an APT tool to {{evaluate}} asphalt performance. This paper discusses a case study in Namibia in which performance of newly constructed rehabilitation asphalt on Highway B 1, south of Windhoek, was evaluated. Two aspects were investigated, namely use of lime to counteract <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> under wet trafficking and evaluation of the effect of compaction density on performance of the mix. Wet, dry, laboratory and field tests were utilized. Laboratory tests were done on field cores and field tests were conducted on in-service highway sections. Performance was evaluated in terms of expected traffic and environmental conditions. This provided a sound basis for decisions on adjustments to mixes and adjudication of already paved asphalt...|$|E
40|$|Several {{processes}} and products {{are available to}} produce warm mix asphalt (WMA). The use of those may reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures in relation to hot mix asphalt (HMA), ensuring a good performance of the pavement. Lower plant mixing temperatures mean reduction in fuel consumption and lower emissions, what may contribute to diminish odours and health problems. A laboratory study on {{the properties of the}} modified binders (using two commercial WMA additives—Sasobit® and Cecabase®) was carried out through conventional (penetration, softening point), dynamic viscosity and rheology (DSR) tests, in order to establish the optimum additive content. <b>Stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> from the aggregates is a reported problem in WMA. Thus, the affinity of the modified binders was assessed without encountering significant problems. It was also observed that only Sasobit® alters the viscosity of the binder. A maximum temperature reduction of 15 °C was achieved using 4 % of Sasobit® with a softer binder...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the cause of premature failure of a premix asphalt layer on a road in South Africa identified the filler material in the mix as the main cause. The failure was characterised by signs of dryness {{and an increase in}} permeability within a few months of laying the asphalt; distress was evident even while the project was still in progress. Later phases of deterioration were <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> from surface stone, pumping and crocodile cracking. The asphalt was within specification and no immediate cause was apparent. Specialised testing was conducted on the recovered binder, detailed filler grading, X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) tests and isotope dating. The ashing of the recovered binder indicated that a super fine filler material was present in the mix. It was determined that the origin of the super fine filler material was mostly tillite. The stiffening effect of the superfine filler material was quantified by the Rigden voids test, and by testing the filler binder mastic. Binder film thickness and mix stiffness calculations quantified the influence of the observed super-fine tillite filler size material in the asphalt mix, and were used to explain the mechanism of distress. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{moisture}} induced {{damage and}} <b>stripping</b> are two <b>of</b> common reasons of premature failure of flexible pavement. The current research involved an extensive experimental investigation on {{two types of}} polymers (Novolac and PVA) as modifiers {{in order to produce}} Polymer Modified Bitumen (PMB). Different ratios of both additives were investigated for rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> and mechanical properties of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). The rheological properties of PMB were evaluated by penetration, softening point, ductility and thin film oven tests. The mechanical properties of HMA were assessed by Marshall Stability test, Retained Marshall Stability test, indirect tensile strength test, Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR), and striping test. The results of tests showed that the Novolac modifier improves the cohesion properties <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> and the adhesion <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> to aggregate. The PVA modifier mainly improves the adhesion <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> to aggregate with less degree of that of using Novolac. Both modifiers significantly improve moisture sensitivity and decrease the <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> HMA. Also, the results showed that the addition of 2 % <b>of</b> Novolac to <b>binder</b> to produce PMB represents the optimum option. The HMA with PMB Novolac 2 % improves the Marshall Stability, Retained Marshall Stability, and TSR by 45 %, 14 % and 44 % respectively. The very small amount of these additives compared with mix components and their reasonable price make them a superior and practical solution for premature failure of flexible pavement...|$|R
40|$|Bituminous {{pavements}} {{suffer the}} effects of environmental and use exposure from ultraviolet light, water, aggressive chemical spills, and abrasion. The result of such exposure is {{the deterioration of the}} pavement from the surface. Oxidation (fading & hardening) of the pavement- causing brittleness, leads to cracking and subsequent crack wall erosion (water <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> the bituminous <b>binder),</b> which all leads to further water penetration and eventual loss of structural integrity if not addressed in a timely manner. The pavement accordingly suffers reduced color contrast and service life, requiring facility shutdowns for remediation. For these reasons an effective, low cost, long lived method of protection or remediation of new or mildly damaged pavement surfaces is needed. In 1996 a research and development project was initiated to address these problems. The resultant project culminated {{in the development of a}} Polymer/Cement Micro-Surface Overlay product (PCMO) manufactured by Polycon Systems, Inc. of Madison, Mississippi. Polycon Systems, Inc. entered into a cooperative Research and Development agreement with the Army Corp of Engineers, to fully test the PCMO product’s ability to preserve bituminous pavements by protecting them from damaging environmental exposure and abrasion.

As the amount of disposed industrial waste material is increasing in road construction, researchers are exploring the use of waste materials which could preserve natural resources and save the environment. One of these sustainable materials is steel-furnace slag, which is a synthetic aggregate produced {{as a consequence of the}} electric arc furnace (EAF). Steel slag was select due to its characteristics, which are almost similar to conventional aggregates, and the fact that it is easily obtainable as a by-product from the steel industry. The same gradations of mixtures would produce using normal crushed aggregate as control samples. This project was carried out to evaluate the performance of eaf steel slag aggregate in ac 14 -wearing course mix, where the conventional granite aggregate was replaced with steel slag. In addition the following mix design and performance characterization of the bituminous and aggregates (steel slag aggregates and conventional aggregates) were evaluated in this project through creep tests, resilient modulus tests at various temperatures, texture depth, skid resistance. The bitumen 60 - 70 pen was used and percentage of steel slag was considered 0, 30, 50 and 100 % for each sample. All the mixtures with eaf steel slag have satisfied the requisites for acceptance in the road sector technical standards, thus resulting as suitable for use in the construction of road infrastructures. Samples made from steel slag showed considerably better results than conventional aggregate. Therefore, operation of steel slag would reduce land fill, save natural resources and improve the strength of pavement to sustain a higher volume of vehicles. On the other hand, laboratory test result results illustrates better performance against deformation characteristics, skid resistance, <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>binder</b> and lateral movement of material compare with conventional wearing course...|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>binders</b> {{is crucial}} in the briquetting of pulverized coal using medium or low pressures (Xu and Liu 2001), especially for high quality coal. As important microstructural characteristics, the morphology and distribution <b>of</b> the <b>binders</b> have a strong effect on their performance. In this study, the microstructures (morphology and distribution) <b>of</b> <b>binders</b> in briquettes and their influence on briquette strength are discussed.|$|R
30|$|The binders {{dispersed}} in the coal/binder matrix {{are believed}} to act as fully adhesive, which benefits the mechanical strength of the briquettes. The amounts <b>of</b> dispersed <b>binders</b> increased as the concentration <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> increased. Large, unevenly distributed, agglomerated particles <b>of</b> <b>binders</b> that shrank during the drying process can generate fractures in the spaces between the binders and the coal particles, which is harmful to the mechanical strength (Wang et al. 2013). A larger size difference was found for the agglomerated binders as the binder concentration increased. When small amounts <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> were used, the cohesiveness <b>of</b> the dispersed <b>binders</b> was the dominating factor, with small volumes <b>of</b> agglomerated <b>binders</b> in the briquettes, and so the mechanical strength of the briquettes increased as the binder concentration increased.
