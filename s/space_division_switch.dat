40|$|The general time-space-time {{switching}} {{problem in}} telecommunications requires {{the use of}} multichannel time slot interchangers. In this paper, we propose two multichannel time slot sorters which sort N time division multiplexed (TDM) optical inputs, arranged as N frames with N time slots per frame using O(N log N) optical switch elements. The TDM optical inputs are sorted in place without expanding the space-time fabric into a <b>space</b> <b>division</b> <b>switch.</b> The hardware components used are 2 Θ 2 optical switches (LiNbO 3 directional couplers) and optical delay lines connected in a feed forward fashion. Two space-time variants of the spatial odd-even merge algorithm are used to design the sorters. By maintaining the number of shift-exchange operations invariant at each stage, the proposed sorters use fewer switches than previously proposed sorters using switches with feedback line delays, (the K-switch in [21]), and other sorters using switches with feed forward line delays [22, 23]...|$|E

40|$|In {{computer}} networks messages are transmitted through switches {{in order to}} reach destinations. Cross point switches are the simplest technique which requires one-to-one connection between input and output. The limitation of a cross bar switch technology is that if numbers of lines are large then cross point increases in huge amount consequently increasing the dimension of the <b>switch.</b> <b>Space</b> <b>division</b> <b>switches</b> are used to route the calls, which implies betterment over the cross bar technology. Actually it is built up of several smaller rectangular crossbars. This takes the advantage over the crossbar switches that less cross points are needed in the <b>space</b> <b>division</b> <b>switches.</b> The limitations of <b>space</b> <b>division</b> <b>switches</b> are that if more the number of cross points then there is increase the outgoing reaching probabilities of messages but the cost and overheads is also high with lesser cross points the congestion increases. In this paper we considered the architecture of a three crossbar space-division switch and assumed a Markov chain model for the transitional analysis of message flow. With the help of simulation study it is concluded that the impact of reaching probabilities for the different values of parameters must be kept in mind while designing this switch by designers...|$|R

The output beam of the VCSEL is switched electrically between two different emission angles. High-speed switching up to 2 GHz has been achieved with an 8 m 8 m device. Such beam-steering devices are particularly suitable for optical interconnect and photonic switching applications. By integrating the beam routers with VCSEL’s, the complexity and size of the switching nodes are significantly reduced.

Such matrices need {{light of a}} defined state of polarisation that will be provided via polarization maintaining fibers. These fibers are directly glued to the laser crystal so that the linearly polarized light of the laser matches one of their principal axes as exactly as possible. The influence of an angular mismatch on this coupling is calculated and a criterion for adjustment is determined. This gluing will alter the power balance of the laser and its P-I-characteristic, which is calculated in an appendix. With these formulas the laser-fiber coupling loss will be determined...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an N x N non-blocking, <b>space</b> <b>division</b> ATM <b>switch</b> with input cell queueing. At each input, the cell arrival process comprises geometrically distributed bursts of consecutive cells {{for the various}} outputs. Motivated {{by the fact that}} some input links may be connected to metropolitan area networks, and others directly to B-ISDN terminals, we study the situation where there are two classes of inputs with different values of mean burst length. We show that when inputs contend for an output, giving priority to an input with smaller expected burst length yields a saturation throughput larger than if the reverse priority is given. Further, giving priority to less bursty traffic can give better throughput than if all the inputs were occupied by this less bursty traffic. We derive the asymptotic (as N [...] > infinity) saturation throughputs for each priority class...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a general input queued M Θ N switch operating in continuous time. Analysis of such switches {{is important in}} the context of IP switches where the packet arrival process and packet lengths are drawn from continuous distributions. An approximate model to obtain the delay throughput characteristics of this switch is developed. The model is general enough to allow non uniform arrival rates, routing probabilities and output evacuation rates. After developing the general model, we consider N Θ N switches with uniform arrivals, speedup in the switch to allow multiple evacuations from input head-of-lines by an output and also the effect of hotspots in the output. All our analytical models are compared against simulation models. We also comment on some of the unexplained results in [3] where the first such system was considered. I.

40|$|Space based {{multicast}} switches use copy {{networks to}} {{make copies of}} the inputs before forwarding them to the multiple destinations. In a copy network a copy scheduling policy determines {{the order in which}} the copies of the input packets are made and this policy a#ects the performance of the multicast switch. In this paper we present queueing models for the copy network for three scheduling policies [...] acyclic service without fanout splitting and cyclic service with and without fanout splitting. From these queueing models we obtain the average copy delay and the sustainable throughput, the maximum load that can be applied to all the input ports without resulting in an unstable queue at any of the inputs, for the above scheduling policies.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 172 - 178. This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} research area of large scale ATM switches. The requirements for an ATM switch {{are determined by}} overviewing the ATM network architecture. These requirements lead to the discussion of an abstract ATM switch which illustrates the components of an ATM switch that automatically scale with increasing switch size (the Input Modules and Output Modules) {{and those that do}} not (the Connection Admission Control and Switch Management systems as well as the Cell Switch Fabric). An architecture is suggested which may result in a scalable Switch Management and Connection Admission Control function. However, the main thrust of the dissertation is confined to the cell switch fabric. The fundamental mathematical limits of ATM switches and buffer placement is presented next emphasising the desirability of output buffering. This is followed by an overview of the possible routing strategies in a multi-stage interconnection network. A variety of <b>space</b> <b>division</b> <b>switches</b> are then considered which leads to a discussion of the hypercube fabric, (a novel switching technique). The hypercube fabric achieves good performance with an O(N. log₂N) ²) scaling. The output module, resequencing, cell scheduling and output buffering technique is presented leading to a complete description of the proposed ATM switch. Various traffic models are used to quantify the switch's performance. These include a simple exponential inter-arrival time model, a locality of reference model and a self-similar, bursty, multiplexed Variable Bit Rate (VBR) model. FIFO queueing is simple to implement in an ATNI switch, however, more responsive queueing strategies can result in an improved performance. An associative memory is presented which allows the separate queues in the ATM switch to be effectively logically combined into a single FIFO queue. The associative memory is described in detail and its feasibility is shown by laying out the Integrated Circuit masks and performing an analogue simulation of the IC's performance is SPICE 3. Although optimisations were required to the original design, the feasibility of the approach is shown with a 15 Ƞs write time and a 160 Ƞs read time for a 32 row, 8 priority bit, 10 routing bit version of the memory. This is achieved with 2 µm technology, more advanced technologies may result in even better performance. The various traffic models and switch models are simulated in a number of runs. This shows the performance of the hypercube which outperforms a Clos network of equivalent technology and approaches the performance of an ideal reference fabric. The associative memory leverages a significant performance advantage in the hypercube network and a modest advantage in the Clos network. The performance of the switches is shown to degrade with increasing traffic density, increasing locality of reference, increasing variance in the cell rate and increasing burst length. Interestingly, the fabrics show no real degradation in response to increasing self similarity in the fabric. Lastly, the appendices present suggestions on how redundancy, reliability and multicasting can be achieved in the hypercube fabric. An overview of integrated circuits is provided. A brief description of commercial ATM switching products is given. Lastly, a road map to the simulation code is provided in the form of descriptions of the functionality found in all of the files within the source tree. This is intended to provide the starting ground for anyone wishing to modify or extend the simulation system developed for this thesis...|$|R

40|$|A Uniform Latin {{square of}} order k = m 2 is an k x k square matrix that {{consists}} of k symbols from 0 to k- 1 such that no symbol appears {{more than once in}} any row or in any column. This property is also maintained in any m x m area of main subsquares in a k x k Latin square. The uniqueness of each symbol in the main subsquares presents very attractive characteristic in applying Uniform Latin squares to time slot allocation problem in sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a <b>space</b> <b>division</b> multiple access (SDMA) scheme for wireless sensor networks based on Uniform Latin squares. The SDMA divides the geographical area into <b>space</b> <b>divisions,</b> where there is one-to-one map between <b>space</b> <b>divisions</b> and time slots.
