5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have taken {{advantage}} of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women <b>sitting</b> <b>together.</b> The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|One day, Rachmat hears {{screaming}} and finds Atikah, who has fainted after seeing a snake. After she regains consciousness, Atikah thanks him for rescuing her. Although Rachmat is disgusted {{that he has}} helped her after learning the identity of Atikah's father, as Rachmat and Atikah dedicate their time to social work, they begin to fall in love. Doerachman, however, disapproves of their relationship, and refuses to fund their work; as a result, Atikah takes her deceased mother's jewellery and some {{money to pay for}} village development. Later, when Rachmat and Atikah are <b>sitting</b> <b>together</b> and singing romantic songs, Mardjan overhears them. Hurrying back to Doerachman's home, Mardjan convinces his boss that Rachmat intends only to steal Doerachman's wealth, and to let Mardjan marry Atikah. As Doerachman prepares to leave, Mardjan has the illiterate hadji put his seal on a letter.|$|E

25|$|Hercule Poirot {{is enjoying}} a social visit by Dr. Burton, {{a fellow of}} All Souls who recites sonorously some lines from Homer's Iliad (XXIII, 316 f) and turns the {{conversation}} round {{to the subject of}} Poirot's unusual Christian name and how some of the pagan names parents give to their children do not suit their recipients. He thinks about Poirot's and Sherlock Holmes's mothers <b>sitting</b> <b>together</b> and discussing names for their children. Poirot claims ignorance of the legend of Hercules. The talk turns to Poirot's intention to retire after completing a few cases of interest and personal appeal and Burton laughingly refers to the twelve labours of Hercules. This comment gives Poirot pause for thought and after his visitor has gone, Poirot gets acquainted with the exploits of his legendary namesake, deciding his final cases will mimic Hercules's Twelve Labours.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Union of South Africa, elections in the Cape Colony were conducted {{on the basis of the}} qualified franchise. This meant that the right to vote was limited to men meeting property and literacy qualifications, but not restricted on the basis of race. This differed from the other South African colonies: in Natal the franchise was limited to white men in practise though not in law, while in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony the franchise was limited by law to white men. The South Africa Act, which was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, unified these four colonies to form the Union but preserved their franchise arrangements unchanged. Section 35 of the South Africa Act provided that no law could disenfranchise voters in the Cape Province on the basis of race, unless that law was passed by an absolute supermajority of two-thirds of the members of both Houses of Parliament <b>sitting</b> <b>together</b> in a joint session. Section 35 was entrenched by section 152, which provided that neither section 35 nor section 152 itself could be amended without a similar supermajority in joint session.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin {{would be}} {{thousands}} of miles away from her for what was sure to be months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857 Ellen had a daughter whom the Stantons name Eleanor Adams. After the girl's delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his decision to go to California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration's interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, Stanton set sail from New York on February 19, 1858 aboard the Star of the West, along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan, Jr., the President's nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton's detail by the Navy. After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in Kingston, Jamaica, where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton was surprised to see blacks and whites <b>sitting</b> <b>together.</b> Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in Panama, and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the Sonora. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.|$|E

500|$|Patel and Menon, {{who were}} charged with the actual job of {{negotiating}} with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru. The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on 5 July 1947 made no threats. Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress' intentions, and invited them to join independent India [...] "to make laws <b>sitting</b> <b>together</b> as friends than to make treaties as aliens". He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states. Unlike the Political Department of the British Government, {{it would not be}} an instrument of paramountcy, but a medium whereby business could be conducted between the states and India as equals.|$|E

[...] and he says [...] "Bring It On." [...] They then exit the car, walk down the pier and enter a nearby speedboat. Scenes are then shown in several different venues, including a club, a boat, a beachfront party, the speedboat and a hotel room. Throughout the video, Cruz is on escapades with different women. The video ends with Cruz's girlfriend laughing at his attempts to break her heart and then the two get off the boat they are on and go back onto the speedboat.

500|$|Late Registration has {{a diverse}} number of collaborations for its {{individual}} tracks. West chose his guest artists {{based on the}} effect each of their voices had on him when he heard them, citing the serene vocals of Adam Levine, the trademark sound of Brandy, and the lyricism of Lupe Fiasco and Paul Wall as primary examples. Adam Levine, lead vocalist of pop rock band Maroon 5 is featured on the album's opening track, [...] "Heard 'Em Say." [...] The two had previously collaborated when Maroon 5 commissioned West to produce a remix for [...] "This Love" [...] and later developed a friendship while <b>sitting</b> <b>together</b> on a flight to Rome for the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards. While playing songs from his second album on his iPod for him during the flight, West came across the demo for [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] to which Levine added a R hook he had recently written and thought was perfect for it. [...] The track was recorded quickly after the 2005 Grammy Awards ceremony, as Levine only {{had a couple of}} free hours available for time in the studio, and Brion was able to translate the two compositions in a matter of hours.|$|E
500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is sitting next to him and holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two <b>sitting</b> <b>together.</b> Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|E
500|$|Adam's most {{significant}} influence following his death {{is in the}} next episode [...] "Restless", where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. Buffys fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. [...] "Primeval" [...] is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly {{about the importance of}} the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development. [...] "Restless" [...] opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy's mother's house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in [...] "Primeval". Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series' set of laws. Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy's dream. They are wearing business suits, <b>sitting</b> <b>together</b> at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things—as Adam did in the Garden of Eden—and making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil, the seventh season's Big Bad, in [...] "Lessons".|$|E
