40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing need for Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter in medical {{application}} such as pacemaker. The demand for long battery life-time in these applications poses the requirement for designing ultra-low power SAR ADCs. This thesis work initially investigates and compares different structures of SAR control logics including the conventional structures and the delay line based controller. Additionally, it focuses on selection of suitable dynamic comparator architecture.   Based on this analysis, dynamic two-stage comparator is selected due to its energy efficiency and capability of working in low supply voltages. Eventually, based on these studies an ultra-low power 10 -bit SAR ADC in 65 nm technology is designed. Simulation results predict that the ADC consumes 12. 4 nW and achieves an energy efficiency of 14. 7 fJ/conversion at supply voltage of 1 V and sampling frequency of 1 kS/s. It has a signal-to-noise-and-distortion (<b>SINAD)</b> <b>ratio</b> of 60. 29 dB and effective-number-of-bits (ENOB) of 9. 72 bits. The ADC is functional down to supply voltage of 0. 5 V with proper performance and minimal power consumption of 6. 28 nW. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{analog-to-digital converter}} (ADC) introduces quantization error {{in excess of}} the ideal value and one way of expressing this is by comparing the value of this error with that of an ideal ADC. This comparison is known as the effective number of bits (ENOBs). It is accepted practice to measure ENOB using the signal-to-noise and distortion (<b>SINAD)</b> <b>ratio</b> of a sine-wave input. This paper extends ENOB theory to any arbitrary waveform by including the crest factor of the input signal. It is now possible to apply the ENOB concept to wideband systems. Measuring the SINAD of an arbitrary or multitone waveform with precision normally requires the use of laboratory standard test equipment. However, International Electrotechnical Commission standard 60748 - 4 - 3 specifies an alternative method for wideband SINAD measurements that may also be suitable for built-in test. It is essentially a multitone test using two pseudorandom signal sources and is sometimes known as the double comb-filter (DCF) method. This paper demonstrates the requirements for a practical implementation of a DCF-based system for measuring an ENOB of up to 24 bits. It is shown that in a practical application, DCF ENOB and sine-wave ENOB results have similar levels of accuracy, but in the presence of amplitude nonlinearity the differing test signal amplitude weightings cannot fundamentally produce the same ENOB figure. It is shown that DCF ENOB is more representative of communications system performance and therefore extends the use of ENOB to wideband application...|$|E

50|$|In {{communication}} systems, {{noise is}} an error or undesired random disturbance of a useful information signal. The noise is a summation of unwanted or disturbing energy from natural and sometimes man-made sources. Noise is, however, typically distinguished from interference, {{for example in}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) measures. Noise is also typically distinguished from distortion, which is an unwanted systematic alteration of the signal waveform by the communication equipment, for example in the signal-to-noise and distortion <b>ratio</b> (<b>SINAD)</b> and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).|$|R

We present a simple channel sorting algorithm, which significantly improves the signal-to-noise and distortion <b>ratio</b> (<b>SINAD)</b> and the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) by applying a simple low-pass filter. The power consumption of the presented timing mismatch compensation method is very low compared to other methods and does not significantly scale with the number of channel ADCs. Furthermore, the compensation method does not depend on the absolute accuracy of the identified timing mismatches, which vastly relaxes the requirements on timing mismatch identification methods. analog input xa(t) fs/M fs/M fs/M fs/...|$|R

At first the sine-fitting procedure used for the estimation of SIgnal-to-Noise And Distortion <b>ratio</b> (<b>SINAD)</b> and Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB) parameters is described. In the following the expressions for the bias and the standard deviation of the ENOB estimator provided by a SFA are derived. Then, the SFAs based on the Interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform (IpDFT) method, the Energy-Based (EB) method, and the well known three- and four-parameter SFAs are separately analyzed. For each algorithm, the basic theoretical background and the operational detail are given. Moreover, the accuracy of all the presented algorithms are compared by means of both theoretical and simulation results. Some aspects concerning {{the influence of the}} harmonics, time jitter, and time base distortions on the dynamic performance of an ADC are also discussed. Besides, some Multi-Harmonics Sine-Fitting Algorithms (MHSFAs) are briefly described.

Performance of coded {{signals in}} active Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) technology is studied in this work. In this work, {{the possibility of}} having covertness and environment friendliness in SONAR systems is investigated. Spread spectrum ping signal is considered to achieve low probability of detection and interception, while maintaining good performance. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) coded transmitted signals having a sequence type of maximal with lengths from 7 chips to 127 chips and tone burst pulse having single length as a reference signal are used as spread spectrum ping signal. The length of the tone burst pulse can not be increased indefinitely because of the multipath propagation. The problem of detection and localization of the targets and the cross correlation properties of the maximal length sequences are investigated as well. The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal to Interference and Distortion <b>ratio</b> (<b>SINAD)</b> are important parameters in detection and localization of the targets. It is found that {{as the number of}} chip length increases, the SNR and SINAD increase but the improvement of the SINAD is comparatively less because of the cross correlation properties of the maximal length sequences.

Most of the ADCs have a pre-ampliﬁer implemented for driving the large input capacitance of the ADC or amplifying the weak naturally occurred input signals. One of the key factors in designing a pre-ampliﬁer is its signal to noise and distortion <b>ratio</b> (<b>SINAD)</b> as the noise and distortion introduced by the pre-ampliﬁer might degrade the eﬀective number of bits (ENOB) of ADC. This work introduces a high gain, high bandwidth, wide input common mode range (ICMR), and highly linear fully diﬀerential folded cascode pre-ampliﬁer for a 14 -bit analog to digital converter. The system uses native n-channel transistors as diﬀerential input pair to achieve a wide ICMR with minimum transconductance variation. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the pre-ampliﬁer is minimized over diﬀerent process corners. A process corner conﬁgurable class AB output stage is implemented to provide a railtorailoutputsignal. Additionally, aprocesscornerconﬁgurablecompensationcircuit is implemented to ensure the stability of system over diﬀerent process corners. The preampliﬁer achieves a closed-loop gain of 130 dB, a unity gain bandwidth of 200 MHz, a THD of− 92. 2 dB, and a phase margin of 68 ◦. The pre-ampliﬁer is designed using TSMC 180 nm CMOS technology.
