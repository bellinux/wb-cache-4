500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only {{being able to go}} so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is dimensionally stable, thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high <b>strength</b> <b>concrete</b> that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. People often mix {{superplasticizer}} and particulate {{to increase}} the density of high-concrete, but ignoring the effect of coarse aggregate gradation on <b>concrete</b> <b>strength.</b> Referring to several Gradation Theories, this paper selects the coarse aggregate gradation with skeleton, uses uniform design method to test the compressive <b>strength</b> of high-strength <b>concrete,</b> and analyses the test results. It can be known from the test results of 7 d and 28 d concrete specimen that the <b>concrete</b> <b>strength</b> decreases linearly with water-cement ratio and sand ratio; The 7 d’s <b>concrete</b> <b>strength</b> has higher variability due to low water-cement ratio with superplasticizer; The coarse aggregate skeleton is interfered by the increase of steel slag and sand rate, and the <b>concrete</b> <b>strength</b> decreases with limited cement paste. Furthermore, the steel slag with less than 30 % addition has little effect on <b>concrete</b> <b>strength</b> and it can increase the cement’s possibility of contacting to water, and {{reduce the amount of}} cement without lowering the <b>concrete</b> <b>strength.</b> The influential degree on the compressive <b>strength</b> of <b>concrete</b> is followed by ascending sequence of steel slag content, sand ratio and water-cement.

50|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} RC is concrete {{in which}} reinforcement bars ("rebars"), reinforcement grids, plates or fibers are embedded to create bond {{and thus to}} strengthen the concrete in tension. The composite material was invented by French gardener Joseph Monier in 1849 and patented in 1867. Conventionally the term Concrete refers only to concrete that is reinforced with iron or steel. However, other materials are often used to reinforce concrete e.g. organic and inorganic fibres, composites in different forms. While compared to its compressive <b>strength,</b> <b>concrete</b> is weak in tension. Thus adding reinforcement increases the strength in tension. The other purpose of providing reinforcement in concrete is to hold the tension cracked sections together.|$|E
