The selected design is verified in more accurate coupled simulations. A prototypic realization serves for further optimization, if necessary. The applicability of the approach is proved {{on the basis of}} an inductor system for magnetic pulse welding of tubes. Introduction and motivation Electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a high-speed forming technology applicable for shaping, joining and cutting electrically conductive sheet metal or hollow profile components. To do so, a capacitor is discharged via an inductor system (i. e. a tool coil including a fieldshaper if applicable) positioned in direct proximity of the workpiece. Thus, a damped sinusoidal current flows throug...|$|E

The flow field of steady attached sheet cavitation and the case of unsteady cavitation behaviour with quasi-periodic fluctuations is analysed with different homogenous cavitation transport models. Three models in form of additional transport equations for water volume fraction are combined with the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) equations and calibrated for the cavitating flow around the NACA 66 (MOD) hydrofoil {{by means of an}} optimisation strategy. In the second stage, the optimised models are applied to the case of internal unsteady cavitating flow in Venturi type section. The results obtained using calibrated models are very close to each other, and agree well with the available experimental data, indicating that the optimisation process is recommended as a general – first <b>step</b> <b>tool</b> for mathematical models validation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, high {{performance}} applications exploit multiple level architectures, {{due to the}} presence of hardware accelerators like GPUs inside each computing node. Data transfers occur at two different levels: inside the computing node between the CPU and the accelerators and between computing nodes. We consider the case where intra-node parallelism is handled with HMPP compiler directives and message-passing programming with MPI is used to program inter-node communications. This way of programming on such an heterogeneous architecture is costly and error-prone. In this paper, we specifically demonstrate the transformation of HMPP programs designed to exploit a single computing node equipped with a GPU into an heterogeneous HMPP+MPI exploiting multiple GPUs located on different computing nodes. The <b>STEP</b> <b>tool</b> focuses on generating communications combining both powerful static analyses and runtime execution to reduce the volume of communications. Our source-to-source transformation is implemented inside the PIPS workbench.

The complexity of the compute block includes a number of column identification and timing issues that can confound the PROC REPORT user. Of course to make matters even more interesting, there can be multiple compute blocks that can interact with each other and these can execute for different portions of the report table.

40|$|Part with {{sculptured}} surfaces {{is obtained}} in three stages: roughing, semi-finishing and finishing. The roughing operation consists in using flat end tools or fillet end tools on sequential horizontal cutting planes {{to remove the}} most material from the raw part {{as rapidly as possible}} using “Parallel Planes” or “Offset Contours ” machining strategy. When roughing deep parts, radial cutting forces, vibrations and tool bending are important. To avoid these disadvantages, the “Plunge Milling ” strategy is developed. The complex geometry of sculptured surfaces makes the tool path generation without interferences and collisions a very difficult task. In this paper, an automated methodology is proposed for roughing any part with sculptured surfaces from its STL model using “Plunge Milling ” strategy on 3 -axis CNC milling machines. After the specification of the principal parameters (stock allowance, radial cutting depth, radial <b>step,</b> <b>tool</b> diameter and sweeping mode), the methodology determines: 1) intersection contours, 2) machined segments, 3) plunging positions without interferences, 4) plunge depth for each valid plunging position, 5) minimum tool length avoiding collision and finally tool path in « One-Way » or « Zig-Zag » mode...|$|E
40|$|In the {{industrial}} world there are different production processes for the manufacturing of spectacle lens. Nowadays casting {{is the most common}} lens manufacturing method. Here, the mould production is based on three stages: grinding, polishing and hardening, where, in the second step, different sets of process parameters {{play a key role in}} quality, time and cost. To optimize the polishing process of moulds a model for the correlation between the material removal and the process parameters is proposed. The model is developed for CNC ball polishing of free-form surfaces, where the pad, made of a polyurethane layer superimposed to a rubber bulk, moves along a scanning path, in a suspension of cerium oxide. The material removal can be derived through pressure and sliding velocity between polishing pad and workpiece and consequently can be related to the CAD-CAM-CNC parameters e. g. tool and workpiece shape, dimension and modulus of elasticity, feed rate, feed <b>step,</b> <b>tool</b> rotational speed and radial tool deformation.

40|$|Tool path ripple error (TPR_error) {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons due to the {{medium-high}} spatial frequency error on the surface of aspheric optics. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of the <b>tool</b> <b>step</b> size to the TPR_error in sub-aperture deterministic polishing (SDP) and study a method which can optimize the <b>tool</b> <b>step</b> size to restrain this error. Three groups of simulation experiments were conducted using three different tool influence functions to simulate the uniform removal of the material. As the TPR_error is influenced by three factors, which are full width at half maximum (FWHM) of tool influence function (TIF), <b>tool</b> <b>step</b> size, and depth of material removed, each group of the experiments was conducted under the fixed TIF and depth of material removed. It turns out that both peak-to-valley (PV) and root-mean-square (RMS) values of the TPR_error become larger with the increase of the <b>tool</b> <b>step</b> size, and the variation tendency likes a reversed “L” shape curve. And, the method adopted in the simulation was further validated by the experiment. Therefore, the <b>tool</b> <b>step</b> size at the inflection point would be optimal to restrain the TPR_error together with saving the polishing time to a certain extent. This method could be used to determine the best-suited <b>tool</b> <b>step</b> size in SDP whose typical TIF is a Gaussian or Gaussian-like shape...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of freeform glass components for precision optics is usually based on contour CNC {{grinding and polishing}} operations. To predict the geometrical precision of the production process, a correlation between the geometrical error and the process parameters is required. This {{is even more important}} in the polishing operation which is the final stage of the process. In this work a model for material removal estimation in deterministic polishing of glass moulds is proposed and validated. The model is developed for CNC ball polishing of free-form surfaces, where the pad, made of a polyurethane layer superimposed to a rubber bulk, moves along a scanning path, in a suspension of cerium oxide. As many models in literature the removed material can be estimated by pressure and sliding velocity between polishing pad and workpiece. Adopting the Hertz theory these physical characteristics can be related to the CAD-CAM-CNC parameters, e. g. tool and workpiece shape, dimension and modulus of elasticity, feed rate, feed <b>step,</b> <b>tool</b> rotational speed and radial tool deformation. The model validation was performed on ground glass flat samples polished with different process parameters, measuring the removed material by a contact probe profilometer.
