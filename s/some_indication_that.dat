5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and {{externally}} the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke Strigea strigis, the tape worm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursae of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. Women did the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E

25|$|While {{anorexia}} {{become more}} commonly diagnosed during the 20th century {{it is unclear}} if {{this was due to}} an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. Most studies show that since at least 1970 the incidence of AN in adult women is fairly constant, while there is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the incidence may have been increasing for girls aged between 14 and 20.|$|E
25|$|While voting {{by persons}} holding foreign {{passports}} has gone largely unchallenged, there is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> increasing appeals to patriotism may make non-citizen voting {{an issue of}} debate in the future.

25|$|While {{developing}} a new disruptive camouflage in the 2000, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) evaluated over 100 existing patterns, and judged Rhodesian Brushstroke {{to be one of}} the three best schemes previously developed, along with CADPAT and tigerstripe. None of the candidates were adopted because there was <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Marines would be better served by something more distinctive than a preexisting design. The MARPAT digital camouflage eventually introduced by the USMC in 2002 remains in use today, and blends elements from all three camouflages.|$|E

The biggest risk to the public is on Job Glacier, where large fumaroles were discovered. While there was <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the fumarole field {{has been around for}} the last 40 years, that July a helicopter pilot who was trained as a geologist noticed the fumaroles on the glacier. On top of that, throughout the summer of 2016 the NRC received reports of a sulphuric smell around the valley of Mount Meager.|$|E
25|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1687, {{the young women}} became wards of their cousin, John Manley (1654–1713), a Tory MP. John Manley had married a Cornish heiress and, later, bigamously, married Delarivier. They had a son in 1691, also named John. In January 1694 Manley left her husband and {{went to live with}} Barbara Villiers, the 1st Duchess of Cleveland, at one time the {{mistress}} of Charles II. She remained there only six months, at which time she was expelled by the duchess for allegedly flirting with her son. There is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> she may have been by then reconciled with her husband, for a time.|$|E

25|$|In March 2004, {{the labor}} union {{representing}} Metro Transit bus workers went on strike. This delayed {{the opening of}} the line from the anticipated start date of April 3, although there was <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the opening would have been delayed anyway. Apparently, some of the delay had to do with slow delivery of trainsets from Bombardier. Certain aspects of the design had been tried before, but the cars were the first to combine the factors of conforming to American standards (as opposed to European), having low floors and being built at the company's Mexico plant. Some problems also cropped up during testing of the vehicles, but Bombardier said that the issues were not out of the ordinary.|$|E
25|$|Essentially all ciphers {{remained}} {{vulnerable to}} cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until {{the development of}} the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.|$|E
25|$|Bowmen {{were the}} most {{important}} force component. Ancient sources indicate that the Sudanic archers favored one-piece bows that were between six and seven feet long, with so powerful a draw strength that many of the archers used their feet to bend their bows. Although composite types saw some use, the Greek historian Herodotus (circa 450-420BC) indicates primary bow construction was of seasoned palm wood, with the arrows made of cane. Other sources describe intense encounters between African archers and a variety of enemies. Such fighting men were not an uncommon sight on battlefields or royal courts throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East. There is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the arrows of Sudanic bowmen (including those fighting Rome) were often poison-tipped, a technique used elsewhere by Africa's archers, well into the 19th century. Among the Meriotic forces facing Rome, elephants were still occasionally used in war. Later Sudanic based forces like the Blemmye also deployed horses and camels for their raids over the Egyptian frontier, and the poisoned arrow tactics of their predecessors found ready employment.|$|E

25|$|Camel caravans, said to {{have first}} been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were {{a major part of}} Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods – leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local {{mountains}} – to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Syria and Iraq. Historical accounts also provide <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim. Other regional powers such as the Abyssinian, Ghassan, and Lakhm were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.|$|E

500|$|The species' {{movements}} are poorly understood, variously described as resident, nomadic or migratory. [...] Population {{numbers have been}} reported as fluctuating in some areas with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred mangrove and Melaleuca food trees, and there is <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the birds can travel more widely. A single bird was recaptured after being banded nearly five years earlier, [...] from the original banding site, and the species' occupation {{of a large number}} of offshore islands suggests that the red-headed myzomela is effective at crossing distances over water. The maximum age recorded from banding has been 7 years 1.5 months.|$|E
