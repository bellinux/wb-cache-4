A month had passed when one evening Torrance rode that way. The prairie, lying still and silent with a flush of saffron upon its western rim, was tinged with softest green, but broad across the {{foreground}} stretched the broken, chocolate-tinted clods of the ploughing, and the man's face grew grimmer as he glanced at them. He turned and watched the long lines of crawling cattle that stretched half-way across the vast sweep of green; and Larry and his wife, who stood waiting him outside the homestead, understood his feelings. Raw <b>soil,</b> <b>rent</b> by the harrows and seamed by the seeder, and creeping bands of stock, were tokens of the downfall of the old régime. Then Torrance, drawing bridle, sat still in his saddle while Hetty and her husband stood by his stirrup.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{incorporation}} of <b>Soil</b> <b>Rent</b> to the urban industrial capital {{is seen as a}} necessity of accumulation that expresses the insufficiency of the urban industrial profit for the reproduction of the social relations of production. As that, contrary of its appearance, the agro-industrial expansion, incorporating the over profit to its accumulation, is fundamented by the crises of the reproduction and not by an ascendant accumulation. The extensive and intensive expansion is a precarious necessity to solve contradictions of the accumulation put in and by the development of productive forces in the countryside, becoming the very <b>Soil</b> <b>Rent</b> an insufficient reposition of the capital presuppositions. So that, the extension of the milking agro-industry is an determination rather of the finance capital than of the value production, what reveals the agro-industrial expansion as a phenomenon of the fictitious capital.

40|$|A flume {{experiment}} with a finite slope of soil body {{was taken to}} study seepaged slope failure {{and the movement of}} destruct soil mass. The results were obtained as following: 1. The more the soil body was affected by the seepage or the higher the water level was in the soil body, the flatter the gradient of soil body failure area was. 2. According to the experiment, the critical value of limited slope failure was developed {{on the basis of the}} seepage theory as follow. tanψ≦tanθd+{(iρw) /[(H/h) 2 - 1]ρd+ρˊ} 3.

40|$|This study compares {{equivalent}} annual rents for two alternative {{land uses}} {{in a region}} where farming and timber plantations coexist. The comparison is motivated by the possibility that rising timber prices may stimulate timber processors to compete for farmland. Prices, costs, and market rents are assumed to first follow existing trends and then to reach steady state values. Market rents are projected and capitalized for agriculture. Internal <b>soil</b> <b>rents</b> are capitalized for timber. The results show timber to have a comparative advantage on high fertility sites and suggest that timber might become a competitive land use at the intensive margin of the region's farmland base.

40|$|The Complexo do Alem 3 o, as a {{place in}} Rio de Janeiro city, only {{acquired}} nominal, administrative and symbolic existence, from 1993, when it was recognized as a neighborhood. However, for its inhabitants, the particularities of the places that compound that administrative place, remain routed on the vast landscape of Serra da Miseric 3 rdia, that gathers the favelas of Morro do Alem 3 o, Grota or Joaquim de Queir 3 z, Nova Bras, Reservat 3 rio de Ramos, Parque Alvorada, Fazendinha, Morro das Palmeiras, Casinhas, Canitar, Pedra do Sapo, Mineiros, Matinha, Morro do Adeus e Morro da Baiana, bordering the neighborhoods of Ramos, Olaria, Higien 3 polis, Bonsucesso and Inha. Although we are not ignoring the symbolic representation of this area considering its connection to urban violence, this work aims {{to get back in}} time and shad some light on peculiarities of the evolution of the ways of stablishing residence on the first settling spots on the region. A previous study on the land history for that large region oriented the field job performed during the year of 2012, in favelas of Morro do Alem 3 o, Grota or Joaquim de Queir 3 z, Nova Bras, Reservat 3 rio de Ramos, Parque Alvorada, Mineiros e Fazendinha. The aim of the research, based on testimonies of the oldest local people, was to identify the different ways of stablishing residence that explain the settling of those places within the years 1920 's and 1970 's. We identify distinctive definitions for the usage and occupation of land that sprang out of the relations between the land owners and the residents, or their associations, such as: <b>soil</b> <b>renting,</b> allowed occupation, collective invasion, selling of leveled land by neighborhoods associations. We verified also other ways of stablishing residence that derivate from actions between "diffuse actors" and the residents as: invasion to sell ("faveleiro"), squatting and informal selling of land, rent of houses without identification of the owner or the. Renting and selling houses or lots were observed as usual practices in all the localities studied. The ethnographic analysis of the accounts presented throughout the text allow the redimensioning of the actual participation and responsibility of both the private sector - in that case represented by local landowners who disseminated and perpetrated the practice of <b>soil</b> <b>renting</b> - and the State - institutionally represented by IAPC and its officers, who distributed land based on personal preference. Therefore, the origin of these slums is not the result of 2 ̆ 01 cinvasions 2 ̆ 01 d. On the contrary, the invasions that actually happened, according to the narratives, were the result of other and previous situations, which we intend to demonstrate...|$|R

With a delightful (and deceptive) sense of power, I graved with heavy hand, as if with pen of steel on brazen tablets, picture after picture of the plain. I had no doubts, no hesitations about the kind of effect I wished to produce. I perceived little that was poetic, little that was idyllic, and nothing that was humorous in the man, who, with hands like claws, was scratching a scanty living from the <b>soil</b> of a <b>rented</b> farm, while his wife walked her ceaseless round from tub to churn and from churn to tub. On the contrary, the life of such a family appealed to me as an almost unrelievedly tragic futility.|$|R

Could a man be happier than I ought to be, sprung as I am from monopolists of all the sources and {{instruments}} of production--of land on the one side, and of machinery on the other? This very ground on which we are resting was the property of my mother's father. At least the law allowed him {{to use it as}} such. When he was a boy, there was a fairly prosperous race of peasants settled here, tilling the <b>soil,</b> paying him <b>rent</b> for permission to do so, and making enough out of it to satisfy his large wants and their own narrow needs without working themselves to death. But my grandfather was a shrewd man. He perceived that cows and sheep produced more money by their meat and wool than peasants by their husbandry. So he cleared the estate. That is, he drove the peasants from their homes, as my father did afterwards in his Scotch deer forest. Or, as his tombstone has it, he developed the resources of his country. I don't know what became of the peasants; HE didn't know, and, I presume, didn't care. I suppose the old ones went into the workhouse, and the young ones crowded the towns, and worked for men like my father in factories. Their places were taken by cattle, which paid for their food so well that my grandfather, getting my father to take shares in the enterprise, hired laborers on the Manchester terms to cut that canal for him. When it was made, he took toll upon it; and his heirs still take toll, and the sons of the navvies who dug it and of the engineer who designed it pay the toll when they have occasion to travel by it, or to purchase goods which have been conveyed along it. I remember my grandfather well. He was a well-bred man, and a perfect gentleman in his manners; but, on the whole, I think he was wickeder than my father, who, after all, was caught in the wheels of a vicious system, and had either to spoil others or be spoiled by them. But my grandfather--the old rascal!--was in no such dilemma. Master as he was of his bit of merry England, no man could have enslaved him, and he might at least have lived and let live. My father followed his example in the matter of the deer forest, but that was the climax of his wickedness, whereas it was only the beginning of my grandfather's. Howbeit, whichever bears the palm, there they were, the types after which we all strive." ...|$|R
