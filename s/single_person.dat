5|$|At the 2001 UK census, the Middlewich wards of Cledford and Kinderton {{had a total}} {{population}} of 13,101. Middlewich's population is relatively young; the proportion of children (aged 0–15) is 3% {{higher than the national}} average. Households are larger than average, consistent with a younger population, with an average of 2.51 people per household, compared to the national average of 2.36. Approximately 25% are <b>single</b> <b>person</b> households, compared to 30% nationally; the majority (almost 85%) of Middlewich's housing stock is owner-occupied.|$|E

Most residents drive cars, but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other than a <b>single</b> <b>person</b> per auto. Alternative transportation is encouraged. The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours.|$|E

5|$|In the 1940s, a {{religious}} movement called Allah Koura {{began in the}} San Cercle based upon the visions of a <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> Local administrators allowed the Allah Koura movement to spread and practice, seeing it as a potential limiting influence on the spread of Islam farther south. In the late 1950s, Muslim protests and riots throughout the colony further contributed to a growing independence movement.|$|E

Of these, 25.6% are married couples living together, 24.8% have a female householder with no husband present, and 43.6% are non-families. Meanwhile, 37.8% of all households comprise a <b>single</b> <b>person,</b> and 14.5% of households comprise a person over 65 years of age living alone.

5|$|Seventy {{percent of}} {{households}} consist of a <b>single</b> <b>person,</b> compared to forty-one percent on the mainland, giving an average 1.6 people per household.

Among women, 40 percent have higher education.|$|E

5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe.

Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} <b>single</b> <b>person</b> who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E

5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every <b>single</b> <b>person</b> who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a <b>single</b> <b>person,</b> and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E

5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a <b>single</b> <b>person,</b> or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a <b>single</b> <b>person.</b> Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E
