40|$|Former Title : Economic {{development}} & policy seriesFormer No. : EDP 06 - 10 Public debt stabilization {{has been}} considered important in the recent trend of institutional reforms of <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements</b> in emerging economies. One crucial issue separating emerging from developed economies is that emerging economies often face serious inefficiency associated with tax collection, such as corruption, reducing the capability of controlling the primary budget balance {{as well as the}} entire public debt. This paper studies the relationship between tax-related inefficiency and public debt stabilization under two designs of monetary policies: inflation targeting and discretionary <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The result is that such inefficiency not only induces a higher level of public debt in the steady state but also reduces the adjustment speed for public debt stabilization, irrespective of <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements.</b> This study also shows that the discretionary <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> enhances the adjustment speed for public debt more effectively, but which <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> is more effective in reducing the long-run level of public debt is highly dependent on the degree of tax-related inefficiency. In particular, the discretionary <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> could induce a higher level of public debt compared to the inflation targeting arrangement when the degree of tax-related inefficiency is either small or large enough...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{monetary}} {{conditions in}} US asset markets — corporate equity, real estate, Treasury bond and corporate & foreign bond — from a market specific perspective, proposing {{the concept of}} market leverage. Market leverage measures the average leverage of all asset holders in a particular asset market. The concept builds on an accounting based network that links balance sheet leverages of asset holders to their corresponding shares of ownership. Our empirical analysis yields the following results. Firstly, market <b>specific</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions can differ considerably among asset markets. Secondly, market <b>specific</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions are positively related to asset prices. Thirdly, US asset markets have experienced a loosening in market <b>specific</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions in the last decades. Fourthly, the loosening of market <b>specific</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions explains long-term increases in US asset prices. Fifthly, the recent convergence of market <b>specific</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions of real asset markets towards those of financial asset markets implies a rise in upside risk to future US asset price inflation. ...|$|R
40|$|Feasibility of a currency board type of <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> in {{transitional}} {{economies of}} Eastern Europe is a function {{of the size}} of the country and the nature of the financial sector in a country. For very small countries where financial services can be provided by subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions the currency board is likely to be an optimal <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement.</b> However, if the need exists for an efficient domestically based financial sector - as is likely in medium and large countries - the currency board type of arrangement appears unfeasible. Major reason is the need to restructure the domestic financial system in these countries. Such restructuring is costly and unlikely to be paid out of fiscal revenues. Hence, the need for Central Bank with its ability to create "net domestic assets" as the restructuring agent. However, once the transition is concluded and East European countries accession to EU becomes a serious possibility, a currency board arrangement appears to be a best intermediate monetary step before joining the Euro area. currency board, transitional economies, <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement,</b> accession to European Union...|$|R

We see this in long historical data and in panel data for the three episodes – the classical gold-standard period, the interwar period and the varied monetary regimes of the post-WWII era. Low frequency movements of exchange rates and relative price levels are highly correlated and more often than not bear a close to one-to-one relation to one another. Price-level behavior across countries differs in the way that PPP suggests when <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements</b> differ and is highly similar when <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangements</b> are themselves similar...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the extent}} to which ASEAN may be suitable for a regional <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement.</b> On the economic front, we review evidence on patterns of trade, economic shocks, the extent of factor mobility, and the monetary transmission mechanism. We find that ASEAN today is less suitable for a regional <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> than the euro area was before the Maastricht Treaty, but the differences are not large. On the political front, we analyse the prerequisites for monetary integration in light of 50 years of European experience. We conclude that a firm political commitment would be the key to ensuring that an attempt to form a regional <b>monetary</b> <b>arrangement</b> is not viewed as simply another fixed exchange rate system open to speculative attack. That commitment would have to be strong enough to survive for an extended period and to support difficult decisions such as rendering the central bank independent, adhering to fiscal and exchange rate arrangements even if the policy stance conflicts with that which would be adopted on the basis of purely domestic considerations, and accepting supranational directives. These are very considerable prerequisites for success. ASEAN; Optimum Currency Areas; Single Currency...|$|R

Several of those features are attributable primarily to White, including the adoption of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, the funding of operations with national currencies deposited by member states, extending credits through currency swaps rather than conventional loans, making these credits subject to policy conditions, and encouraging members to retain capital controls as an option for use in difficult circumstances.

Our analysis reveals considerable dissimilarities in the economic characteristics of the countries in west and central Africa. In particular, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) countries do not form a cluster with the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries; and, within the WAMZ, there is a significant lack of homogeneity. Furthermore, when west and central African countries are considered together, we find significant heterogeneities within the CFA franc zone, and some interesting similarities between the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and WAMZ countries.

Other arrangements, such as the gold standard and the Scandinavian union also impacted trade favourably. To explain this, we argue that monetary coordination, by fostering the correlation of business cycles compensate the adverse effect that the current account constraint has on trade integration. This is found to vastly compensate the negative consequences that trade integration might have on the symmetry of shocks, of which this Paper finds strong evidence, in contrast with recent empirical work. 19 th century; endogeneity; europe; gravity equations; monetary unions; optimum currency area; trade and business cycles correlation...|$|R

Second, the optimal degree of conservatism for a Rogoff (1985) -type central banker is an inverse function of the corruption level.
