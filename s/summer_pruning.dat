In 1999 – 2000 a general survey was conducted in rainfed fig plantations throughout Fars province. In this survey Phomopsis cinerascens was consistently isolated from the cankers.. The fungus produced pycnidia containing α-conidia on active cankers from fall to mid spring. No β-conidia were found under natural conditions, but many isolates produced β-conidia intermixed with α-conidia in culture. Only α-conidia germinated on agar medium. The optimum temperature for growth, pycnidial formation and pycnidiospore germination was 25 °C. Pathogenicity tests revealed that the fungus infected inoculated branches at 15 – 25 °C but no infection occurred at 5 °C or at 30 °C or higher.

Understanding the urban ecosystem pollution dynamics require long-term researches because the many factors involved (i. e. climate, pollution sources, urban characteristics, trees presence, traffic density, vehicle type). In the last years investigators are themselves concentrating on the possibility to develop models that can quantify the role of urban trees in removing pollutants from atmosphere; nevertheless, these models need many data on the species composition, age, structure, health, and geographic distribution. We analysed the main factors affecting atmospheric CO 2 and heavy metal concentrations in Rome in the long term, and the trees air amelioration capability, considering the most important deciduous and evergreen species widely distributed in the city. These species have a different role in carbon dioxide sequestration and in bioaccumulation of heavy metals. Moreover, trees contribute to air temperature mitigation by shading and transpiration, thus lowering energy consumption for air conditioning during <b>summer.</b> Incorrect <b>pruning</b> practices can reduce or undo the trees air amelioration role. Such a role depends on many factors, including trees species, plant size and leaf longevity. In particular, information on air pollution could be deduced from heavy metal concentration in plant tissues, offering a low-cost information about urban environment quality. Moreover, crown volume is a discriminant factor for carbon sequestration, and leaf longevity is the most important leaf trait changing in response to heavy metal pollution. It is important to identify the tree species mostly contributing to air amelioration, and the most discriminant plant traits helping long-time monitoring and city management.

Using the cultivar Kyoho, we conducted <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> and tested the effect of defoliation and fertilizing time on the growth of new shoots and flowering. On the basis of the results, we discussed the nutritional condition of the vine. 1. When all leaves were defoliated from the primary shoot at <b>summer</b> <b>pruning,</b> bud bursting was delayed and the growth of new shoots was much reduced. The development of flower clusters was restricted severely, and the berries set were only few. 2. Chemical analysis of the leaves developed on new shoots showed that defoliated vines contained less starch than un-defoliated vines. Nitrogen content was also lower in defoliated vines at the early stage of shoot growth. The nitrogen content decreased rapidly as the shoot grew in un-defoliated vines, while it increased until blooming in defoliated vines. Sugar content was also higher in defoliated vines than in those of un-defoliated. These results may be an indication that the nutrient movement to growing shoot tip or flower cluster was inactive in defoliated vines. 3.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to analyze the effect of various levels of light {{availability}} in the fruit microenvironment (induced by <b>summer</b> <b>pruning)</b> on some fruit quality traits. Materials and methods. Two levels of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> were set: removal of either 30 % or 60 % of the canopy leaf area. These treatments were compared with the control (unpruned vines). Two canopy layers (upper and lower) were identified in each treatment and in the control vines. At harvest, yield per cane and per shoot was recorded in the two canopy layers; fruit fresh weight, flesh firmness, total soluble solid content and total titratable acidity were measured. Fruit Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and Total Polyphenols (TPH) were determined at kiwifruit harvest and post-harvest (60 days after storage at 1 °C) {{in relation to their}} position within the canopy (layer) and to the pruning treatment applied. Results. Removing 60 % of the canopy leaf area induced higher titratable acidity and flesh firmness of kiwifruits at harvest; it reduced fruit weight and crop yield, but increased TAC and TPH compared with kiwifruits of control. Removing 30 % leaf area did not reduce mean fruit weight and crop yield; it increased TAC and TPH at harvest by 20 %. Post-harvest TAC and TPH evolution did not differ among treatments. Discussion and conclusion. Pergola-trained kiwifruit vines showed good performances in terms of crop yield and fruit quality when <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> reduced the Leaf Area Index (LAI) to 3.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the viability of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> as a tool to pilot ripening towards desired compositional patterns. Methods and Results: Ortrugo was subjected to basal leaf removal applied either at pre-flowering (ELR) or in lag-phase (LLR) and to bunch thinning (BT; removal of 50 % of crop at lag-phase) in comparison with untreated control (C). Treatments induced large variation in bunch mass (30 % less in ELR vs BT), yield per vine (37 and 21 % less in BT and ELR vs C) and total soluble solids at harvest (BT scored 2. 9 °Brix higher than that of C). Conversely, given the same harvest date, all practices failed to maintain titratable acidity (TA) at the threshold of 6. 5 g/L. Conclusions: The data suggest that crop regulation achieved in the high yielding Ortrugo, through either BT or ELR, increases sugar accumulation rate so that concurrent optimal TA level (≅ 6. 5 g/L) can be easily achieved by slightly anticipating harvest date. Under conditions of thermal or light stress, or weather conducive to bunch rot, preference should be given to ELR.

The use of pruning has increased due to improving agricultural management techniques such as high planting densities, use of mechanical machinery in orchards and the need for effective pesticide and pathological chemical spray applications. The main objective {{of this study was to}} obtain a practical means of manipulating lemon trees at the right time. Pruning at the correct time to cultivate productive trees that produce quality fruit would have financial benefits. Lemon fruit quality is dependent on market demand and involves a number of features such as fruit shelf life, rind thickness, fruit size, rind colour, and juice content. The study was conducted on ’Eureka’ lemon trees budded on C. volkameriana rootstock, bearing the fifth and sixth commercial crops in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Twelve monthly pruning treatments per year were conducted on one row of trees starting in December 1997 (site 1) and repeated in the second year on the adjacent row of the same orchard starting in December 1998 (site 2). Selective pruning heading cuts were applied below the intercalation on the intercalary units. Potential branch bearing units were tagged and assessed during the harvest and flowering periods. <b>Summer</b> <b>pruning</b> between 16 to 19 months before the subsequent April/May harvest, resulted in the longest and most complex (intercalation sprouted per axil) vegetative response. The estimated crop value indicated that <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> treatments produced the highest income. This was ascribed not to differences in fruit size or quality, but to an increase in yield. The industry’s trend is to prune citrus from post-harvest to the pre-bloom stage. Results from this study have provided a beneficial cultural practice to prune during the summer months and provides a practice to optimise farm production and profit margins...|$|E
40|$|A pêra é uma fruta de grande aceitação e importância nos mercados internacionais, entretanto, a cultura da pereira não apresenta grande destaque entre as frutíferas de clima temperado cultivadas no Brasil. A falta de {{material}} genético adaptado e a deficiência de tecnologias de manejo, bem como o abortamento de gemas florais são os principais problemas para o desenvolvimento da cultura nas condições do sul do Brasil. Estes estudos foram conduzidos com o objetivo de desenvolver uma metodologia de poda verde para a pereira cultivar Abate Fetel. O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido nos pomares da Frutirol Agrícola Ltda., em Vacaria/RS. O experimento foi instalado na cultivar Abate Fetel sobre dois porta-enxertos: marmeleiros EMC e Adams. Foram estudados os efeitos de dois níveis de poda verde em três diferentes épocas de realização da poda. Os tratamentos foram: a redução de 1 / 3 e 2 / 3 do comprimento de ramos do ano, com diâmetro não inferior a 5 mm, nas épocas de janeiro, fevereiro e março e uma testemunha sem poda verde. O delineamento adotado foi blocos ao acaso, com 5 blocos e 2 plantas por parcela. Os parâmetros avaliados foram comprimento dos ramos do ano obtidos pela média longitudinal de 5 ramos por planta; quantidade de ramos podados durante a poda seca; número de frutos por planta, obtidos pela contagem manual dos frutos; a frutificação efetiva; percentual de estruturas floríferas formadas {{no local}} da poda e após a colheita determinou-se o peso médio dos frutos, resistência da polpa, ºBrix, pH e acidez. Os dados foram submetidos à análise fatorial pelo teste F, e as médias comparadas mediante o teste de Tukey, em nível de 95 % de probabilidade. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que o porta-enxerto é fator determinante do potencial produtivo da pereira, sendo a principal ferramenta responsável pelo equilíbrio vegetativo das plantas. A poda verde é uma prática importante para melhoria da qualidade da produção e no controle do vigor das plantas, entretanto, estas práticas de manejo devem ser utilizadas de forma conjunta para obtenção de bons resultados. The pear is a fruit of great acceptance and importance in international markets, however, {{the culture of}} pear tree does not show much prestige among fruits of temperate climate that are cultivated in Brazil. The lack of adapted genetic material and the deficiency of technology management, {{as well as the}} abortion of flower buds are the main problems for the development of this culture in southern Brazil. These studies were conducted with the objective of developing a methodology of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> for cultivar Abate Fetel pear tree. This paper took place in the orchards of Frutirol Agricola Ltda., in Vacaria/RS. The experiment, in cultivar Abate Fetel, was installed on two quince tree rootstocks: EMC and Adams. It was studied the effects of two levels of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> during three different pruning periods. The process was: the reduction of 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of the branches length, with diameter not less than 5 mm, in January, February and March, and an original sample without <b>summer</b> <b>pruning.</b> The design adopted was randomized blocks - 5 blocks and 2 plants per lot. The parameters evaluated were the length of the branches of the year obtained by the longitudinal average of 5 branches per plant; the amount of branches pruned during the dry pruning; number of fruits per plant - which were manually counted -, the effective fruiting; percentage of flowering structures formed at the pruning site, and after the harvest, it was determined the average weight of the fruits, resistance of the pulp, °Brix, pH and acidity. Data were submitted to factor analysis by the F test, and the averages were compared by the Tukey test, at 95 % of probability. Results show that the rootstock is the determining factor of the productive potential of pear trees, being the main tool responsible for the vegetative balance of plants. The <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> is an important practice for improving the production quality and controlling the force of plants, even though, these management practices must be utilized together in order to obtain good results...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims:  Little {{work has}} been {{conducted}} on the effects that <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> operations have on the relative growth of grapevine berry parts. Our paper studies whether pre-bloom leaf removal is able to modify the proportions of seed, skin and flesh in ripe grapevines berries and the related effects on must composition. Methods and Results:  Pre-bloom defoliation (D) of the first six basal leaves on main shoots {{was applied to the}} field-grown cvs Barbera and Lambrusco salamino (Vitis vinifera L.) in Italy's Po Valley and compared with non-defoliated controls. D showed reduced fruitset, hence yield per shoot, and concurrently improved must soluble solids and total anthocyanins in both cultivars as a likely result of increased leaf-to-fruit ratio (+ 3. 4 cm 2 /g and + 5. 2 cm 2 /g for Barbera and Lambrusco, respectively) and improved relative skin mass (from 6. 0 to 9. 0...|$|E
40|$|The grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) {{is a key}} pest of grapevines in Greece. As part of {{a broader}} study on {{integrated}} pest management, the effects were investigated of different cultural methods on the establishment and survival of L. botrana, specifically: application of different nitrogen levels (30 and 100 units of ammonium sulfate or 70 units of Agrobiosol); summer leaf and shoot pruning; application of growth regulators (Regalis, probexadione-calcium; or Falgro, gibberellic acid). There were significant differences among the three levels of N application. The lowest L. botrana infestation rates were found in plots treated with 30 units of (NH 4) (2) SO 4 and plots that received some <b>summer</b> <b>pruning.</b> Following the application of plant growth regulators, the lowest L. botrana infestation levels occurred in the plots treated with Regalis or Falgro at the manufacturers' recommended concentrations.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of my PhD {{dissertation}} the problem of split pit, pit cracking and pit fragments in freestone and clingstone peaches was studied. To study the problem of pit fragments in clingstone peaches, the effect of cultivar, fruit size and stage of maturity at harvest on pit fragment formation were studied. The percentage of fruits with pit fragments in large size fruits was significantly larger than in small size fruits, but the stage of fruit maturity did not affect pit fragment formation. In order to reduce the pit fragment formation in clingstone peaches, fruit thinning at different time and density and different time of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> were applied. Light and delayed fruit thinning reduced pit fragment formation, in comparison to heavy and early fruit thinning. An attempt to reduce the split pit and pit cracking formation, fruit thinning at different time and density and different time of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> were applied. Delayed fruit thinning resulted in significantly reduced percentage of fruits with pit cracking. Heavy and/or early fruit thinning resulted in reduced duration of pit hardening and reduced lignin content in peach pits which consists in reduced strong structure of lignin polymers and the whole endocarp. In the second part of my PhD dissertation the effect of ethylene biosynthesis and action inhibitors at postharvest physiology and antioxidant properties of peach fruits was studied. The inhibitor of ethylene action 1 -MCP as gas or water soluble form and the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis AVG were applied after harvest on fruits of several cultivars. Both forms of 1 -MCP delayed fruit softening {{to a greater extent than}} AVG and control fruits during cold storage and 2 - 3 days at 20 οC. Application of AVG resulted in significantly decreased ethylene production, while there were no differences between 1 -MCP treated and control fruits. The inhibition of ethylene action resulted in increased coloration of the fruits, and increased red colour was found in the flesh of fruits of all of the cultivars. The inhibition of ethylene action resulted in increased antioxidant com-pound content and antioxidant activity in relation to non treated fruits. ...|$|E
40|$|Trials {{were carried}} out using mature apricot plants {{cultivar}} Tirynthos trained to transverse Y, at planting distances of 4. 5 x 2 m. The evolution of the leaf area has been studied during the annual growth cycle and the canopy has been characterized for light availability, in three different areas. The WUE of leaves with different levels of light exposure has been determined by periodic gas exchange measurements. The obtained data have stressed (highlighted) that: - when leaf area was completed (LAI 4. 7), about 35 % of this was shaded, with less than 20 % of PPFD available; - WUE in exposed leaves (40 % of incident PPFD) was 3 to 5 times {{higher than that of}} shaded ones; - daily balance (24 hours) of carbon fixed by shaded leaves at harvest time was negative, whilst their water consumption was about 25 % of the total; - small trees, training systems that improve light interception and <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> must be promoted to enhance an efficient use of mineral and water resources, through a reduction of the shaded areas of the canop...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in {{yield and}} quality by {{increasing}} the light distribution and carbohydrate uptake (<b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> and ground covering), optimizing the physiological state of harvested fruit (cultivar-specific harvesting indices), postharvest fruit protection (treatment with hot water and ethanol, respectively) and optimizing storage conditions (cultivar-specific CA and ULO storage procedures) were investigated {{in a set of}} eight organically grown apple cultivars. A combination of <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> and covering the orchard ground with white textile increased tree productivity, improved coloration at harvest, and increased contents of anthocyanin, ascorbic acid and total phenolic compounds in {{at least some of the}} cultivars. It also developed fruit resistance to Neofabraea spp. and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides which were the most common pathogens, causing fungal storage deseases. Analyses of various fruit ripening parameters showed that starch hydrolysis point and Streif index (firmness/(starch hydrolysis point * soluble solid concentration)) were corrlated with internal ethylene concentration (IEC) at harvest. Thus, the optimal harvesting time can be deduced from the starch index in some cultivars (Agra, Santana and Sultanat) while the Streif index is more accurate for other cultivars (Eir, Delorina and Zarya alatau). In yet others, titratable acidity and flesh firmness also produced important information and have to use as an additional index beside starch hydrolysis for Ella and Dayton respectively which showed only close correlation between starch hydrolysis and IEC. By contrast, soluble solids concentration and skin color are not useful due to their sensitivity to weather conditions and light intensity. Post-harvest hot water treatment (46 º C for 120 seconds) decreased fungal decay during storage in only two cultivars (Dayton and Eir), whereas spraying the fruit with 10 % ethanol decreased fungal decay in all six cultivars. Optimization of CA and ULO storage conditions maintained fruit quality and reduced amount of fungal decay. Storage of eight organic cultivars in a wide range of pCO 2 achieved slight additional improvement in some cultivars, while flesh browning, causing by high CO 2 can be expected. CA (2. 0 kPa O 2 and 2. 0 kPa CO 2) can be recommended for Agra, Eir, Ella and Delorina; ULO (1. 0 kPa O 2 and 1. 0 kPa CO 2) for Zarya alatau and (1. 0 kPa O 2 and 2. 0 kPa CO 2) for Dayton, Santana and Sultanat...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of rootstock and solar radiation intercepted from the branches on fruit quality is valued in peach trees. Moreover, a nondestructive method (optical properties of skin fruits) {{for determining the}} SSC, the flesh firmness and the harvest time of the fruits is examined. Trials were conducted, in 2004 growing season, at the experimental farms of the DCDSL of the University of Pisa (Italy), on a peach orchard cv. 'Flavorcrest', planted in February 2000 and grafted onto 'GF 677 ', 'Barrier 1 ', 'Mr. S. 2 / 5 ' and 'Ishtara-Ferciana'. Two <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> intensity treatments were applied and the solar radiation intercepted by the branches was measured. Growth of fruits and shoots inserted on the selected branches was monitored starting {{from the beginning of}} May up to harvest (middle of July). At harvest, fruit weight, diameter, SSC and flesh firmness were measured and all of the factors considered showed to be important for fruit quality. Particularly, solar radiation and medium vigour rootstocks induced a better fruit quality compared to vigorous rootstocks. The optical properties of the skin were effective to show fruit quality and predict harvest time...|$|E
40|$|A chronic wood wasting {{disease of}} kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) has {{recently}} been identified in Italian kiwifruit vineyards. This disease is principally caused by Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Fomitiporia mediterranea. The “wood decay” causes a reduced productivity and longevity in the vineyards and influences {{the quality of the}} final product. “Wood decay” has a high incidence throughout the vineyards, and is difficult to eradicate once present, leaving prevention as the best defence strategy. The different pathogens causing the disease infect the plant mainly through pruning wounds. We studied a commercial formulation of Trichoderma harzianum T 22 for the protection of pruning wounds, and thus for the prevention and reduction of the infection. The studies were carried out on potted plants, on shoots of the year that were cut, simulating a <b>summer</b> <b>pruning,</b> and treated with a T. harzianum commercial suspension. A different morphologic reaction was observed on treated and control shoots; physiological processes connected to the reaction, such as the variation in the levels of a growth-promoting hormone (auxin) and the content of total phenols were investigated through biochemical and histological analyses. The higher levels of auxin and phenols recorded in treated shoots suggested a stimulation of T. harzianum on the wound healing processes...|$|E
40|$|Winter and <b>summer</b> <b>pruning</b> {{are widely}} applied {{processes}} in all fruit trees, including in peach orchard management. This {{study was conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} summer prunings (SP), as compared to winter pruning (WP), on shoot length, shoot diameter, trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) increment, fruit yield, fruit quality, and carbohydrate content of two early ripening peach cultivars (“Early Red” and “Maycrest”) of six years of age, grown in semiarid climate conditions, in 2008 to 2010. The trees were grafted on GF 677 rootstocks, trained with a central leader system, and spaced 5 × 5 m apart. The SP carried out after harvesting in July and August decreased the shoot length significantly; however, it increased its diameter. Compared to 2009, this effect was more marked in year 2010. In general, control and winter pruned trees of both cultivars had the highest TCSA increment and yield efficiency. The SP increased the average fruit weight and soluble solids contents (SSC) more than both control and WP. The titratable acidity showed no consistent response to pruning time. The carbohydrate accumulation in shoot was higher in WP and in control than in SP trees. SP significantly affected carbohydrate accumulation; postharvest pruning showed higher carbohydrate content than preharvest pruning...|$|E
