A mercury-penicillin V (Hg-pen V) derivative {{was used as}} a heavy metal-labeled, electron-dense probe for accurately localizing PBPs in situ in single bacterial cells during growth. The most striking feature of thin sections was the presence of an abnormally large (17 to 24 nm in width) <b>splitting</b> <b>system</b> within the thick cross walls or septa of Hg-pen V-treated bacteria of all strains. Untreated control cells possessed a thin, condensed <b>splitting</b> <b>system,</b> 7 to 9 nm in width. A thick <b>splitting</b> <b>system</b> was also distinguishable in unstained thin sections, thereby confirming that the electron contrast of this structure was not attributed to binding of bulky heavy metal stains usually used for electron microscopy.

In contrast, the <b>splitting</b> <b>system</b> in penicillin V-treated bacteria was rarely visible after 30 min in the presence of antibiotic. These findings suggest that while most PBPs were associated with the plasma membrane, a proportion of PBPs were located within the fabric of the cell wall, in particular, in the <b>splitting</b> <b>system.</b> Inhibition of one or more high-M(r) PBPs by beta-lactam antibiotics modified the <b>splitting</b> <b>system</b> and cross-wall structure, therefore supporting a role for these PBPs in the synthesis and architectural design of these structures in S. aureus...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few years there has been a {{significant}} interest in spectrum <b>splitting</b> <b>systems</b> to increase the overall efficiency of photovoltaic solar energy systems. However, methods for comparing the performance of spectrum <b>splitting</b> <b>systems</b> and the effects of optical spectral filter design on system performance are not well developed. This dissertation first establishes a method to analyze and compare spectrum <b>splitting</b> <b>systems</b> with different filters, PV cells types and geometries. The method examines the system conversion efficiency in detail and the role of optical spectral filters. A new metric termed the Improvement over Best Bandgap is defined which expresses the efficiency gain of the spectrum <b>splitting</b> <b>system</b> with respect to a similar system that contains the highest constituent single bandgap photovoltaic cell. Also, this work expands the analysis on dispersive spectrum <b>splitting</b> <b>systems.</b> The dispersive effects of transmission type filters are evaluated using a cross-correlation analysis. Lastly, this work presents a grating-over-lens design for dispersive spectrum splitting. In this geometry, a transmission grating is placed at the entrance of a lens. Part of the incident solar spectrum is diffracted off-axis from normal incidence to the lens. The diffracted spectral range comes to a focus at an off-axis point and the undiffracted spectrum comes to a focus at the paraxial focus of the lens. Since the diffracted wave is planar and off-axis, the off-axis focal points suffer from aberrations that increase system loss. In this work, a novel aberration compensation technique is presented using non-planar transmission gratings recorded using a conjugate object beam to modify the off-axis wavefront. Diverging sources are used as conjugate object and reference beams. The spherical waves are incident at the lens and the grating is recorded at the entrance aperture of the solar concentrator. The on-axis source is adjusted to produce an on-axis planar wavefront at the hologram plane. The off-axis source is approximated to a diffraction limited spot producing a non-planar off-axis wavefront on the hologram plane. Illumination with a planar AM 1. 5 spectrum reproduces an off-axis diffraction-limited spot on the focal plane. Models and experimental data are presented to quantify the reduction in losses achieved with aberration correction...|$|R
