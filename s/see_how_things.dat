25|$|Sir Adventurous gratefully accepts {{these two}} gifts, Organate {{declares}} {{that she will}} wait for fifteen years {{for him to come}} for her. Sir Adventurous replies that he will have to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> go. So he returns to Artois, reverts to his old name and presents to the earl, who is even less pleased than before to see him, the head of the boar {{and the head of the}} giant.|$|E
500|$|Filatov {{was also}} the first overall {{selection}} in the 2008 Canadian Hockey League Import Draft, selected by the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Sudbury General Manager Mike Foligno was comfortable with the risks of not knowing whether Filatov would play at junior or professional level when he came to North America. Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson would not guarantee Filatov a place on their team, saying, [...] "We've already told Nikita that we'll <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> go in training camp and we'll decide what's best for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Maria Theresa {{found herself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. She did not know enough about [...] matters of state and she {{was unaware of the}} weakness of her father's ministers. She decided to rely on her father's advice to retain his councillors and defer to her husband, whom she considered to be more experienced, on other matters. Both decisions, though natural, later gave cause for regret. Ten years later, Maria Theresa recalled in her Political Testament the circumstances under which she had ascended: [...] "I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them at first wanted to wait and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would develop." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{gets even}} more strange when the scene changes, and Sayori realizes that she's in Hatsuhime's body; {{that she has}} somehow <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were, and the {{situation}} has somehow [...] "reset", giving her the chance to avert the princess's terrible fate.|$|R
60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were going, {{you may be}} {{sure that}} Arkal did not remain an idle spectator. He dropped again from the outer end of the bough he had reached, and when the bear rose once more to its feet, it found a foe {{on either side of}} it.|$|R
500|$|Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney {{chairman}} and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations {{more difficult than}} they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming Circle 7 Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Despite this announcement, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told CNN, [...] "We {{would love to be}} in business with Pixar. They are a great company." [...] After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would play out between the two companies.|$|E
2500|$|Elliott has {{qualified}} for ten races this season, with a best finish of 20th in the Sunoco Presents: The American Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. At Daytona Elliott announced that 2008 {{will be his}} final season as a Sprint Cup driver. But at Kansas {{in an interview on}} NASCAR Raceday, Elliot was asked about him racing, and said [...] "We will be at Lowe's, and do a few more races. Then we will <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> go." [...] Bill in 2008, best starts were 5th at Bristol and 7th at Kansas. His best finish was 12th at Homestead-Miami Speedway.|$|E
2500|$|Van Lente stated, [...] "What's neat {{about the}} MCU, {{just like in}} the comics' universe, is the {{interconnections}} between various movies, particularly Iron Man 2 and Thor. You'll start to see those coming out in First Vengeance." [...] On the differences between the MCU and original versions of the characters, Van Lente noted that when Joe Simon and Jack Kirby originally created Captain America, they [...] "didn't have 20/20 hindsight to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would fit together with the Marvel characters to follow. With the MCU, we're able to make those connections and heighten all of the characters' weight." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} version, reconstituted in 2008 (see above) {{opens with}} a dialogue between the Poet and his Double. The Double maintains that base human nature will always triumph over conscience. He makes a wager with the poet to write a play in which it will be <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> turn out.|$|R

60|$|Jordan said nothing, {{but there}} was trouble in his face, for he had <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were going, and though he was Eleanor's lover he was Jimmy's friend. When they reached the ranch they found that Mrs. Forster had come back, and she glanced at Jordan with a smile in her eyes when he crossed the room.|$|R
2500|$|Dan Patch {{made his}} next start on August 16 at the Brighton Beach {{racetrack}} in New York City, {{known as a}} gambling hotbed. Dan Patch was the heavy favorite to win the race, but his odds to win the first heat drifted up from 3/5 to 5/4, attracting a [...] "mad scramble" [...] from bettors looking {{to cash in on}} the generous odds. The start of the first heat was delayed by over an hour due to an equipment malfunction. When the race finally began, Dan Patch went to the early lead but was then eased back. In the homestretch, he was given [...] "modest" [...] encouragement but failed to close enough ground, finishing fourth. Bettors were incensed, believing McHenry did not drive to win, possibly after having tipped the bookmakers given the way the odds changed before the race. The time for the heat was 2:09, two seconds slower than Dan Patch's best time to date. McHenry stated that he had held back because he had heard that the winner was fast and he wanted to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> sorted out. Some reports say the judges paid no attention to the [...] "improbable" [...] result. However, the Boston Globe reported that the judges were [...] "very displeased" [...] and others reported on a heated meeting of the officials and a near riot by the fans.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 April 1937 when Orwell and his ILP comrades had {{returned}} to Barcelona on their leave they had been shocked to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> had changed. The revolutionary atmosphere of four months earlier had all but evaporated, and old class divisions been reasserted. Similarly, as {{he headed for the}} French border on the train to Port Bou, Orwell noticed another symptom of the change since his arrival—the train on which classes had been abolished now had both first-class compartments and a dining car. Bowker reports that [...] "Orwell mused that coming into Spain the previous year, bourgeois-looking people would be turned back at the border by Anarchist guards; now looking bourgeois gave one easy passage." [...] A simple hostility to Stalinist Communism became a [...] "deep-dyed loathing of it." [...] Animal Farm, [...] "his scintillating 1944 satire on Stalinism" [...] would be part of his response to the Spanish betrayal. [...] "He had learned a hard lesson, especially about the new political Europe. Totalitarianism, the new creed of 'the streamlined men' of Fascism and Communism, was a new manifestation of Orwell's old Catholic enemy, the doctrine of Absolutism ... the ghost of Torquemada had arisen, imprisonment without trial, confessions extracted under torture with summary executions to follow." [...] "The essential fact about a totalitarian regime is that it has no laws. People are not punished for specific offences, but because they are considered to be politically or intellectually undesirable. What they have done or not done is irrelevant." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Spedding (1685-1758) {{was first}} {{employed}} by Lowther's father, apparently {{to assist with}} the accounts. In his will Sir John bequeathed two years' salary (£20) to Spedding, and commended him to James. Spedding's adverse reports on the accounts of the colliery manager (John Gale, relative of the Speddings) led to Gale's dismissal (1707) and the discovery of embezzlement by him. John became colliery manager in his stead. [...] It had been intended that John's younger brother, Carlisle Spedding, should go to sea with one of Gale's sons, but this now fell through, and Carlisle was instead employed as a subordinate to his brother. [...] (It is said that Carlisle was sent to Tyneside to work as a hewer (under an assumed name) to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were done there, his true identity only being revealed by his getting expensive medical treatment after being hurt in an explosion. However the story first appeared in print a generation after Carlisle Spedding's death, and one modern writer doubts it, finding no evidence for it in the Lowther accounts, and seeing no reason for subterfuge since Tyneside and Cumberland sold their coal into different markets.) John was promoted to steward (in conjunction with Richard Gilpin 1722-30: on his own after 1730); he also entered into business on his own account, backed by Lowther's money and uncertainty as to when he was acting for himself, and when to further some scheme of his employer's was helpful to both parties. [...] Carlisle's innovations in the Lowther mines at Whitehaven earned him a national reputation as a mining engineer; he succeeded his brother as colliery manager in 1730.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Grant; [...] "we {{have got}} him tight. You had better come {{along to the}} auction--you'll get notice of it--and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the <b>thing</b> goes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes, exactly. Well, {{perhaps the}} wish is not deep-seated. You will <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the <b>things</b> are tumbled in anyhow, packing-cases and all. The only piece of {{ornamental}} furniture yet unpacked is this one.' ...|$|R

60|$|But {{his idea}} of a woman's love, of the purity and {{sanctity}} of her feelings, had been too high. He had left his betrothed to live without him, frequently without seeing him for months, and yet he had thought it utterly impossible that she should hold confidential intercourse with another man. We have <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> fell out with him. The story need not be repeated. He was shocked, outraged, torn to the heart's core; but he loved as warmly, perhaps more warmly than ever.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{while she}} was being dressed, Effie told her dream, and Nursey thought it very wonderful; but mamma smiled to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> curiously <b>things</b> the child had thought, read, heard, and seen through the day were mixed up in her sleep.|$|R
60|$|When {{they had}} gone Thirlwell sat down and lighted his pipe, for he knew he must grapple with his trouble before it {{mastered}} him. Looking back, he {{saw that he had}} been strangely pleased by Agatha's letters, and when he met her had at once felt her charm. This, however, was all; he frankly enjoyed her society and thought she liked his, but he was not romantic and was satisfied that they should drift into a close and confidential friendship. It was obvious now that he had been remarkably dull; Scott had <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were going.|$|R
