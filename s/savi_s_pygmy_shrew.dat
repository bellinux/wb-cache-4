40|$|Myxozoans (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} endoparasites of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, with {{the notable exception}} being two species of Soricimyxum Prunescu, Prunescu, Pucek et Lom, 2007 described from terrestrial shrews (Soricidae) in central Europe. Myxospores of the two parasites are morphologically indistinguishable, but have SSU rDNA sequences that differ by about 4 %. Herein, we report additional molecular and histology data from Soricimyxum fegati Prunescu, Prunescu, Pucek et Lom, 2007 from common shrew (Sorex araneus Linnaeus) from Hungary, and add a new geographic record for <b>S.</b> fegati in <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex minutus Linnaeus) from Slovakia. A limited survey of shrews from the northern United States, Blarina brevicauda Say and Sorex sp. from New York, and Sorex spp. from Oregon, did not discover any infections, which is {{in stark contrast to}} the relatively high infection rates (up to 66 %) in European shrew populations. We also provide a summary and discussion of literature records of species of Soricimyxum and a host survey. Given the lack of distinguishing morphological or morphometric characters between Soricimyxum spp., and the overlap in vertebrate hosts and geographic ranges, unambiguous identification of these closely related shrew parasites can presently only be achieved through sequence comparison of one or more variable SSU rDNA regions...|$|R

50|$|Primarily insectivorous, {{this animal}} forages in moist soil and dead leaves {{to find its}} prey. Because of the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew's</b> small size, its diet {{primarily}} consists of insects and insect larvae, while the larger shrews eat insects and worms. Its diet is almost exclusively protein-based. To stay alive, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> has to eat three times its body weight daily, which means capturing prey every 15 to 30 minutes, day and night; a full hour without food means certain death. Because of this high metabolism, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> never sleeps {{more than a few}} minutes at a time, as it is in a constant search for food. Although due to its small body size it is always losing body heat, being small has its advantagess during the winter when food is scarce. Predators of the American <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> include hawks, brook trout, owls, snakes, and domestic cats.|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex minutus L.) as a native or an {{introduced}} species in Ireland has been subject to much debate. To examine this {{and other aspects of}} the colonization history of the Irish <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew,</b> genetic variation was determined in 247 <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> collected throughout Ireland, using mitochondrial control region sequences and five polymorphic microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was low for both types of marker. The median-joining network for control region sequences was star-like, suggesting that the colonization of Ireland involved a small number of founders and rapid population expansion thereafter; this was supported by other statistics. Molecular dating with both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data is consistent with a human introduction. This would have been several thousand years ago; a recent colonization within historical times can be ruled out.

40|$|This {{study used}} {{a portion of}} the {{mitochondrial}} cytochrome b gene to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of Suncus <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> and to help clarify the taxonomic status of the Malayan <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> (<b>S.</b> malayanus) and the Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> (<b>S.</b> madagascariensis). Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using neighbour-joining and Bayesian analysis methods and revealed that S. malayanus is related to, but distinct from S. etruscus. The K 2 P-corrected genetic distance among the Malaysian taxon and other <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> for the cytochrome b gene was between 6. 1 and 8. 5 %, supporting recognition that S. malayanus represents a distinct species from the geographically widespread S. etruscus species complex. A close (1. 5 % K 2 P distance) sister-group relationship was revealed between S. etruscus from Sri Lanka and S. madagascariensis from Madagascar, which has been considered an island endemic, and suggests that these animals are not specifically distinct. The Malagasy population of this shrew most probably was translocated to the island by human intervention, with the lineage originating from Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent...|$|R
40|$|DESCRIPTION: The <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> is the {{smallest}} member of the mammalian fauna of Pennsylvania. It most closely resembles the masked shrew (Sorex cinereusy; however, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> is somewhat smaller with a slightly shorter tail than the masked shrew. The two species can only be definitely dis-tinguished by examination of the unicuspid teeth {{at the front of}} the toothrow. In the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew,</b> the third unicuspid has been compressed anteroposte-riorly and the fifth unicuspid is minute; therefore, only three unicuspids are easily seen when viewed from the lateral side. In the masked shrew by con-trast, five unicuspids are easily seen in lateral view. The eyes and external ears are small and the fur is short and velvety. The upper parts of the bod...|$|R
50|$|In his travels, Tagg befriends a {{similarly}} mysterious (and, unlike Tagg, prone to telling lies) harvest mouse named Nimbalo the Slayer, by saving {{him from a}} deadly snake from the mountains. Finding themselves {{in the company of}} a <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> colony, they rest until they are attacked by Gruven and his slowly-diminishing band of vermin. Gruven and his band start a landslide, killing and burying many <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews.</b> As Tagg chases the attackers of his newfound companions, the vermin scatter, leaving only one unfortunate member behind. Under the harsh gaze of Tagg, and the threat of being thrown to the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> who lost loved ones in the landslide, the long-time member of Rath's old tribe reveals all, including the name of Tagg's true home: Redwall Abbey.|$|R

50|$|The C. russula {{serves as}} a prey to many animals, however, an {{abundance}} in this species {{may lead to a}} decline in other small mammals such as <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews.</b> In April 2008, the greater white-toothed shrew was discovered in Ireland. While the introduction of the species will possibly sustain threatened birds of prey, such as the barn owl, the nonnative mammal could threaten some of the smaller native species, such as the Eurasian <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} {{uncertainty}} about how Ireland attained its current fauna and flora. Long-distance human-mediated colonization from southwestern Europe {{has been seen}} as a possible way that Ireland obtained many of its species; however, Britain has (surprisingly) been neglected as a source area for Ireland. The <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> has long been considered an illustrative model species, such that the uncertainty of the Irish colonization process has been dubbed ‘the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> syndrome’. Here, we used new genetic data consisting of 218 cytochrome (cyt) b sequences, 153 control region sequences, 17 Y-intron sequences and 335 microsatellite multilocus genotypes to distinguish between four possible hypotheses for the colonization of the British Isles, formulated in the context of previously published data. Cyt b sequences from western Europe were basal to those found in Ireland, but also to those found in the periphery of Britain and several offshore islands. Although the central cyt b haplotype in Ireland was found in northern Spain, we argue that it most likely occurred in Britain also, from where the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> colonized Ireland as a human introduction during the Holocene. Y-intron and microsatellite data are consistent with this hypothesis, and the biological traits and distributional data of <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> argue against long-distance colonization from Spain. The compact starburst of the Irish cyt b expansion and the low genetic diversity across all markers strongly suggests a recent colonization. This detailed molecular study of the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> provides a new perspective on an old colonization question...|$|R

40|$|Britain’s {{smallest}} mammal, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex minutus Linnaeus, 1766) is {{the only}} long established terrestrial mammal on Lundy. Little is known about this species’ mode of colonisation or its population structure on the island. Genetic analyses might provide useful insights in this respect, but DNA samples are difficult to obtain because <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> can be harmed by sampling methods. Two non invasive methods for obtaining DNA sequences were tested. DNA was extracted from hair samples and from a mandible derived from a bird-pellet.

40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} debate {{as to how}} Ireland {{attained}} its present fauna; we help to inform this debate with a molecular study of one species. A 1110 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was sequenced in 74 specimens of the <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew,</b> Sorex minutus, collected from throughout its western Palaearctic range. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed several well-supported lineages. Most of the 65 haplotypes belonged to a northern lineage, which ranged from Britain {{in the west to}} Lake Baikal in the east. The other lineages were largely limited to Iberia, Italy and the Balkans. One exception, however, was a lineage found in both Ireland and Andorra. This affinity, and the large difference between the mitochondrial sequences of Irish and British individuals, suggest that <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> did not colonize Ireland via a land connection from Britain, as has been previously supposed, but instead were introduced by boat from southwest continental Europe. All the Irish <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews</b> analysed were identical or very similar in cytochrome b sequence, suggesting an extreme founding event...|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{reproductive}} cycle of <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrews.</b> They appear to mate year round, with a bias of births occurring from November through March. The gestation period is estimated to last about 18 days. Females produce a litter of three to eight young, and only give birth once a year. The age the young are weaned is not known with certainty, but by 18 days old, they are nearly full grown, and are usually independent by 25 days. Being mammals, the mother nourishes her young with milk. The maximum lifespan of a <b>pygmy</b> <b>shrew</b> is not known, but it is believed to be about 16-17 months.|$|R
