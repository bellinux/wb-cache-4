This study aimed to assess the water quality of Nimbai stream using benthos macroinvertebrates tolerance level and several water quality parameters. Data retrieval was conducted in JuneJuly and SeptemberOctober 2012 in seven stations (L 1 L 7) from Nimbai upstream to downstream that connected to Prafi river. The water macroinvertebrates were taken using surber with mesh size 200 μm and then was identified at the family level.

Similarly the value of H' is low (0. 83), however, the value of C (0. 79) was high that dominated by Oligochaeta. Famili biotic index (FBI) value obtained showed that water quality in the L 1 L 4 stations was in good to excellent condition, but the quality at L 5 station is classified as very poor. As the distance far away from the sources of pollution in the L 5 station, water quality tends to improve as shown in the L 6 and L 7 stations.

The aim of the present work is to develop a constitutive model that is able to describe the behaviour of compacted expansive clays under these coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical actions. The proposed model is based on two existing models: one for the hydro-mechanical behaviour of compacted expansive clays and another for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of saturated clays. The elaborated model has been validated using the thermo-hydro-mechanical test results on the compacted MX 80 bentonite. Comparison between the model prediction and the experimental data show that this model is able to reproduce the main features of volume changes: heating at constant suction and pressure induces either expansion or contraction; the mean yield stress changes with variations of suction or temperature...|$|R
5000|$|The NCC was re-formed during August 1940, {{just over}} a year after {{conscription}} was reintroduced. The corps was composed of conscripted men who had been registered as non-combatants by tribunals. Unlike in the Great War, there were also enlisted members of the NCC who had been deemed not physically competent for combatant service. This gave the Corps less of a stigma than it had twenty five years earlier. It was divided into 14 companies, commanded mostly by veteran officers of the First World War and reservists. During {{the course of the war}} 6,766 men served in the NCC, of whom 465 volunteered to <b>specialise</b> in bomb <b>disposal.</b> During 1944-45 some volunteered for transfer to the Royal Army Medical Corps, while retaining their non-combatant status, in order to join Parachute Field Ambulance units dropped over France on and after D-Day. Others worked in army stores, transport, agriculture, forestry, or on other projects 'not involving the handling of military material of an aggressive nature'. As during 1916, the NCC was part of the army, not a civilian unit. During the war some members of the NCC renounced their conscientious objector status in order to serve in combat roles, sometimes as examples of German war crimes came to public attention, just as some men who had originally accepted call-up into the ordinary armed forces changed their minds, and claimed conscientious objection.|$|R
40|$|In {{most of the}} European Union's 27 member states, {{nuclear power}} is {{considered}} to be a risk rather than an advantage. The positive aspects of nuclear power, such as greater energy security and lower greenhouse gas emissions, are cancelled out by fears of terrorist attacks against nuclear facilities, the potential misuse of nuclear material and concerns about the safety of nuclear waste <b>disposal</b> and nuclear <b>installations.</b> To achieve effective synergy between breeding and minor actinide (MA) waste burning in a fuel cycle, fast reactors should be designed to recycle MAs from several (2 - 3) LWRs/CANDUs. For homogeneous recycling this in turn means that the MA fraction in the fuel should be about 5 %, which, in comparison to MA-free cores, nearly halves the negative Doppler reactivity feedback, however, and increases the positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficient. In the present study, we compare the effectiveness of different moderating materials to improve Doppler fuel temperature reactivity feedback and the coolant temperature reactivity coefficient in lead-cooled and sodium-cooled fast reactors (LFRs and SFRs) homogeneously recycling MAs. The materials investigated were hydrides (CaH_ 2), metallic beryllium, and enriched boron carbide (11 ^B_ 4 C). The calculations showed that, in homogeneous mode, both LFR and SFR systems could burn about 80 kg of MAs per year, with the burn-up reactivity swing remaining below 2. 5 $/yr. Hydride moderating pins appeared to be the most effective in improving reactivity coefficients and a Doppler coefficient twice as large as coolant temperature reactivity feedback was obtained in both an LFR and SFR when ~ 5 % of the fuel pins in each sub-assembly were replaced with CaH_ 2 moderating pins. The hydrides also proved to have the least influence on core breeding performance, but susceptibility to decomposition at relatively low temperatures (~ 1100 K) might pose safety problems. The moderating power of beryllium and 11 ^B_ 4 C is significantly smaller than that of hydrides, which means that the number of moderating pins in a sub-assembly has to be higher. This, however, has a negative influence on breeding and further exacerbates the burn-up reactivity swing. The LFR self-breeder shows a number of advantages over an SFR counterpart regarding its behaviour in unprotected loss-of-flow and unprotected loss-of-heat sink accidents due to superior natural coolant circulation and the larger heat capacity of lead.
