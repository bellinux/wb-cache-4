5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only predict the <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as spectrographic {{technology}} improved, additional <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model {{to explain the}} extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple <b>spectral</b> <b>lines.</b> The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{radio waves}} are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed {{is the result of}} synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields.

40|$|In magnetically {{confined}} torus plasmas, {{the local}} emission intensity, temperature, and flow velocity of {{atoms in the}} inboard and outboard scrape-off layers can be separately measured by a passive emission spectroscopy assisted by observation of the Zeeman splitting in their <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> shape. To utilize this technique, a near-infrared interference spectrometer optimized for the observation of the helium 2 (3) S- 2 (3) P transition <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> (wavelength 1083 nm) has been developed. The applicability of the technique to actual torus devices is elucidated by calculating the <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> shapes expected to be observed in LHD and QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with Steady State Spherical Tokamak).

5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X-ray {{photographs of}} manganese(II) sulfate. They observed <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> which they {{presumed to be}} of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name alkalinium, {{as it would be}} the heaviest alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic <b>spectral</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

5|$|Eta Carinae B is {{a massive}} {{luminous}} hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> that {{ought not to be}} produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B is thought to be a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and {{who was able to}} isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their <b>spectral</b> <b>lines.</b> The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E

The measured values have been compared with our calculated data, using the modified semiempirical approximation.

5|$|The wind-wind {{collision}} cone {{separates the}} winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> that {{are unlikely to be}} produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000K and 41,000K.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b was {{discovered}} independently by two different teams, one led by Geoffrey Marcy (with data from Keck Observatory and Lick Observatory) {{and the other}} by Xavier Delfosse (at Geneva Observatory). Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, it {{was discovered}} by detecting variations in its star's radial velocity {{as a result of}} the planet's gravity. This was done by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> of Gliese 876. It was the first discovered of four known planets in the Gliese 876 system.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d was {{discovered}} by analysing changes in its star's radial velocity {{as a result of}} the planet's gravity.

After the two planets were taken into account, the radial velocity still showed another period, at around two days. The planet, designated Gliese 876 d, was announced on June 13, 2005 by a team led by Eugenio Rivera and was estimated to have a mass approximately 7.5 times that of Earth.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored <b>spectral</b> <b>lines.</b> Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
5|$|In addition, stars may be {{classified}} by the luminosity effects {{found in their}} <b>spectral</b> <b>lines,</b> which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add VII (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of ordinary hydrogen-burning stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{is measured}} by the doppler shift of the star's <b>spectral</b> <b>lines,</b> and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E

5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of <b>spectral</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the hydrogen spectral series.

5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation <b>spectral</b> <b>lines,</b> but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These transient phenomena {{are thought to}} be related to interaction with the solar wind. The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail. The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval {{may be related to the}} boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.|$|E
