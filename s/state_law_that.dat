5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin's {{plan was}} to unite the slave states around a set of minimum {{concessions}} {{to see if the}} North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment repealing any <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> interfered with enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, passage of amendments to the Fugitive Slave Act ensuring that any state that would not return a fugitive slave or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the slave, passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a slave, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation. After the slave state governors refused Magoffin's plan, he endorsed the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.|$|E

25|$|Kobach {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the drafting of Arizona SB 1070, a <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> attracted national attention as the country's broadest and strictest—at the state level—illegal immigration measure, and has assisted in defending the state during the ongoing legal battle over SB 1070's legality. On February 7, 2008, Federal Judge Neil V. Wake ruled against a lawsuit filed by construction contractors and immigrant organizations who sought to halt a <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> imposes severe penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, but Arizona prevailed (with Kobach's assistance) in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Chicanos por la Causa v. Arizona, 558 F.3d 856; 2009).

25|$|Special {{elections}} for lieutenant governor were forbidden by {{an amendment to}} the State Constitution after the death of Thomas W. Wallace and subsequent election of Joe R.

Although the law would make street hail of livery cabs legal, it was not welcomed by some of the livery cab drivers and politicians due to the fear that the cost would be too expensive as seen in the yellow taxi medallions which are sold through auctions with an average of $700,000 each.

40|$|When the U. S. Supreme Court decided Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc. in March 2008, the Court {{held that}} under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), parties to an {{arbitration}} agreement may not contractually expand the grounds for judicial review of an arbitration award beyond the grounds enumerated in the FAA. In dicta, however, the Court expressly left {{open the possibility that}} parties nonetheless may obtain expanded review by relying on <b>state</b> arbitration <b>law,</b> rather than the FAA. This Note examines the availability of contractually expanded review under <b>state</b> <b>law</b> and addresses the question of whether, in light of Hall Street’s holding and despite its dicta, the FAA preempts <b>state</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> otherwise would permit expanded review of arbitration awards. This Note looks at the history and development of the FAA and examines its preemptive effect on <b>state</b> <b>laws.</b> It then analyzes the arguments for and against the proposition that the FAA preempts <b>state</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> permit expanded review. Finally, this Note argues that the FAA should preempt <b>state</b> <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> permit expanded review, unless the parties have expressly agreed <b>that</b> <b>state</b> arbitration <b>law</b> will apply to the exclusion of the FAA...|$|R
25|$|Because Connecticut was {{believed}} to be a Democratic stronghold, Connecticut's Senate seat was considered safe to remain as a Democratic seat by political analysts, but Lieberman's continued support for conservative and Bush administration policies made him vulnerable to a Democratic primary challenger.

25|$|Tompkins County became {{involved}} in supporting suburban routes and in developing rural transit service. The County formed TOMTRAN to extend fixed-route bus service to Dryden, Caroline and Newark Valley in 1982, Groton (1983), Newfield and Ulysses (1985), and Lansing and Danby (1991). In 1999, TCAT initiated bus service to Enfield, the last unserved town in the County. In 1992, the City, Cornell and County built a $5 million transit facility to base transit operations and fleet maintenance including GADABOUT. In 1996, the New York State Legislature adopted a <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> authorized TCAT to be created as a joint partnership, governmental entity, and on April 1, 1998, the City of Ithaca, Cornell University and Tompkins County established TCAT as a joint venture (public entity) to operate public transit service in Tompkins County, service began in 1999, establishing a unified route and fare system. TCAT re-organized itself as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, TCAT.

25|$|One of {{the last}} {{remaining}} blue laws in the United States that covers most retail sales, other than food and gasoline (among other limited items), is found in Bergen County. The blue law enforced in the county is actually a <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> each county could reject by voter referendum, with 20 of the state's 21 counties having voted to reject the legal option to enforce the law. Thus {{one of the largest}} and most popular commercial shopping cores of the New York metropolitan area is almost completely closed on Sunday (grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations, hotels, restaurants, pharmacies, entertainment venues, and any other exempted establishments that do not sell clothing, shoes, furniture, electronics, hardware, and home appliances are among the businesses allowed to operate). Furthermore, Bergen County has significant populations of Jewish (2000 estimate of 83,700) and Muslim (2000 estimate of 6,473) residents whose observant members would not be celebrating the Sunday Sabbath with most of their Christian neighbors. The substantial Orthodox Jewish minority is placed in the position of being unable to shop either on Sunday (due to the blue laws) or on Saturday (due to religious observance).|$|E

25|$|In 1971, {{a lawsuit}} filed against the St. Louis Board of Education by a black parent alleged that the city's schools were segregated, and {{although}} local U.S. District Court JudgeJames Hargrove Meredith ruled against the parent, the decision was overturned in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Gerald Heaney noted that efforts to desegregate schools in St. Louis City might require an interdistrict solution that would involve county schools, and the 8th Circuit returned the case to Meredith for reconsideration. During this period, the NAACP had joined the case by filing suit against suburban school districts alleging their participation in a segregating system prior to 1954, due to their busing of black suburban students into the city based on state segregation laws. Following Meredith's death in 1981, a plan was developed under court order by Edward T. Foote II that attempted to rectify the segregation situation {{in the city and}} county districts by having suburban districts voluntarily accept black students from the city. Because the state of Missouri was responsible for the <b>state</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> encouraged the initial busing of black students into the city from the county, the state would be required to pay all transportation costs and any cost that the suburban districts incurred in educating the students.|$|E
