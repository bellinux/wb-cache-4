Formation of grain-scale hills and valleys and {{their relation to}} the morphologies and corresponding orientations of <b>surface</b> <b>grains</b> after deformation were examined experimentally. These observations were analyzed using various approaches based on the Schmid and Taylor crystal plasticity models. It was observed that <b>surface</b> <b>grains</b> with and without slip bands tend to form valleys and hills, respectively, wherever {{these two types of}} grains are adjacent to each other along the planestrain tension direction. When the sample was pulled along the transverse direction, the formation of hills and valleys by unbanded and banded grains was more lineally organized in the plane-strain (rolling) direction than in the sample which was pulled along the rolling direction. Slip banding and valley formation were principally observed in the <b>surface</b> <b>grains</b> with either very few (1 ∼ 2) slip systems of high Schmid factors or low Taylor factors, in contrast to non slip-banded and hillforming <b>surface</b> <b>grains.</b> Quantitative analysis using correlation coefficients showed that the Schmid factor provided slightly better agreement than the Taylor factor in predicting slip-banding (and valley-forming) and non slip-banding (and hill-forming) behaviors of <b>surface</b> <b>grains.</b> In addition, measures that quantify the image qualities of EBSPs for selected <b>surface</b> <b>grains</b> suggested that the slip-banded and valley-forming grains contain less lattice distortion than the non slip-banded and Currently at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, PAhill-forming grains despite the larger strains experienced by these grains. This indicates that dislocations in the slip-banded grains move out of the surface to create deformation without lattice distortion. Plastic interactions between specific neighboring grains are central to the formation of meso-scale surface roughening. 1...|$|R

50|$|In microforming, {{the ratio}} of the total <b>surface</b> area of <b>grain</b> {{boundaries}} to the material volume decreases with the decrease of specimen size and the increase of grain size.

The change of flow stress with part geometry size is partly attributed to the change of volume fraction of <b>surface</b> <b>grains.</b> In addition, the anisotropic properties of each grain become significant with the decrease of workpiece size, which results in the inhomogeneous deformation, irregular formed geometry and the variation of deformation load.

40|$|Streambed {{surfaces}} are typically coarsened, or armored, at low flows, {{but there is}} little evidence of their condition during floods, when significant hydraulic and ecologic disturbance occurs. Some flume experiments have been used to conclude that armor layers wash out during floods, although other experiments have produced a persistent armor layer. In the absence of clear field or flume evidence, we use a surface-based transport model in an inverse prediction of <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> size as a function of transport rates observed in the field. The predicted <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> size matches that observed at low flow and indicates that low-flow armor layers persist at large flows.

40|$|The {{control of}} grain size in {{superalloys}} {{is critical in}} the manufacture of gas turbine blades. The aim of the present research is to provide the technology for producing complicated hollow turbine blades with fine surface grains and better comprehensive mechanical properties. By melt superheating treatment and coating the internal surfaces of shell mould using a cobalt aluminate-bearing coating material, the influence of cobalt aluminate as inoculant on the <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> sizes of turbine blade was studied with addition of cobalt aluminate: 0, 35 %, 45 % – 65 % and 100 % respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the catalytic {{role of the}} gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) and its <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries in enhancing the oxygen incorporation kinetics of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFC). Epitaxial and polycrystalline GDC thin films were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on the cathode side of 300 μm-thick single crystalline (100) and 100 μm-thick polycrystalline YSZ substrates, respectively. Fuel cell current-voltage behavior and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were {{carried out in the}} temperature range of 350 ◦C– 450 ◦C on both types of cells. Results of dc and ac measurements confirm that cathodic resistances of cells with epitaxial GDC layer are lower than that for the YSZ-only control cell. This is attributed to the higher surface exchange coefficient for GDC than YSZ. Moreover, the role of grain boundary density at the cathode side external surface was investigated on surface-engineered electrode-membrane assemblies (MEA) having different GDC <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> sizes. MEAs having smaller <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> size show better cell performance and correspondingly lower electrode interfacial resistance.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{superplasticity}} using surface markers {{have tended to}} use either diamond paste scratches, with which {{it is difficult to}} make quantitative measurements, or regular grids with spacing greater than the grain size, which prevents measurements of any deformation occurring within the grains. This paper reports the etching of regular marker grids with submicron line spacings using Focused Ion Beams (FIB), as well as mesoscopic grids with line spacings many grains across. These have enabled LIS to make quantitative measurements of deformation within the <b>surface</b> <b>grains,</b> and at length scales up to 0. 5 millimeters. Further refinements used include the use of Interferometric Surface Profilometry to measure the out-of-surface displacement during deformation. Results on Sn-Pb eutectic alloy tested in tension in Regions I and II showed that there was almost no intragranular deformation anywhere in any of the <b>surface</b> <b>grains.</b> Grain boundary sliding took place, particularly at Sn-Sn grain boundaries, and the accommodation mechanism was separation of interfaces normal to the tensile axis where sliding was blocked, particularly Pb-Pb grain boundaries.

40|$|Twenty-eight coupled {{observations}} of flow, transport, and bed <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution {{were made in}} a laboratory flume using {{a wide range of}} flows and a sediment with a very poorly sorted, bimodal grain size distribution. These observations permit the transport rates of individual size fractions to be scaled by the proportion of each size immediately available for transport on the bed surface. The key to our observations is the use of a sediment in which each size fraction has been painted a different color, which permits reliable, repeatable, and nondestructive measurement of the bed <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution from photographs of the bed surface. At a given flow, the fractional transport rates may be divided into two parts: a finer-grained portion within which fractional transport rates are a function only of their proportion on the bed surface and total transport rate, and a coarser-grained portion for which fractional transport rates also depend on the proportion of individual grains within a fraction that remain essentially immobile throughout the experimental run. We define the latter condition as one of partial transport and observe that the grain size separating partial and fully mobilized transport consistently increases with flow strength. Complete mobilization of a size fraction occurs at roughly twice the shear stress necessary for incipient motion ofthat fraction. Zones of partial and full mobility are quite distinct when fractional transport rates are scaled by the bed <b>surface</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution, although a region of partial transport is evident when these data and other experimental and field observations are scaled by the bulk grain size distribution of the sediment bed. Critical shear stresses for the incipient motion of individual fractions in our experimental sediment vary over an order of magnitude, a result strongly in contrast to many earlier observations, but consistent with our {{observations of}} incipient motion in sediments with bimodal grain size distributions...|$|E
