25|$|Previously, {{under section}} 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act ("SCA"), when a {{constitutional}} question arose in proceedings before the Subordinate Courts, the Courts could refer {{the question to}} the High Court and, meanwhile, <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b> However, this {{did not mean that}} the Subordinate Courts could not decide constitutional questions at all. In Johari bin Kanadi v. Public Prosecutor (2008), the High Court held that the Subordinate Courts may decide such questions where the relevant constitutional principles have already been set out by superior courts. Where the principles have not been decided, the question should be referred to the High Court.|$|E
25|$|Reports, papers or {{journals}} {{that are}} published by order {{or under the}} authority of Parliament are absolutely privileged. If civil or criminal proceedings (for instance, for defamation or sedition) are brought against a person or his or her employee for the publication, the person may give the court a certificate from the Speaker or Clerk of Parliament stating that the documents were published by order of Parliament or under its authority. The court must then immediately <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Further, in any civil or criminal proceedings started for printing or publishing any extract from or abstract of any document published under Parliament's authority, the court must grant judgment in favour of the defendant or accused if satisfied that the extract or abstract was printed or published bona fide and without malice.|$|E

The Supreme Court of India (November 2010) rejected a plea by the two charged auditors to <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> by the ICAI Disciplinary committee. The court's order came in response to the pleas of the charged auditors seeking a stay on the disciplinary proceedings against [...] them on the ground that it violated their fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution of India.|$|E
2500|$|Instead, Salleh {{asked the}} Supreme Court to <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{because of the}} tribunal's alleged {{improper}} constitution and because the King had been [...] "wrongfully advised". The Supreme Court, in an emergency session, unanimously ruled that the proceedings be stayed. Four days later, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong suspended the five Supreme Court judges who had issued the order, on Mahathir's advice. The government announced it would now attempt to impeach those five judges as well for [...] "gross misbehaviour" [...] and conspiring [...] "to make the order". There were now only four judges on the Supreme Court, two of them also sitting on the tribunal. The government appointed new judges to fill the void, who refused to hear any further motions by Salleh Abas. The tribunal eventually found Salleh guilty, and he was officially relieved of his position. Of the five judges who had supported him, two were convicted, {{and the other three}} were acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|Plaintiffs {{requested}} that the campaign produce internal documents {{that relate to the}} purpose and intent of the amendment and the development of political messages during the campaign. The Proposition 8 proponents objected to the request because of the potential chilling effect on political speech, among other grounds. On October 1, Walker rejected the contention that the First Amendment shielded all of those communications. The proponents appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and separately moved to <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the district court. Stating that the proponents were unlikely to succeed in this appeal, Walker rejected the stay request on October 23. Regardless, the proponents continued to assert a First Amendment privilege over these documents, a sampling of which Walker reviewed privately. On December 11, 2009, the Ninth Circuit overturned Walker's ruling, saying that the release of the documents [...] "would likely have a chilling effect on political association and the formulation of political expression" [...] in a unanimous opinion by Raymond C. Fisher with Kim McLane Wardlaw and Marsha S. Berzon.|$|E

[Lord Granville has a pencil note on the [...] margin, “The first order I received was to throw up the bill, to [...] which I answered that I could not do more than adjourn the [...] debate.”] Lord Granville made this announcement accordingly after [...] the Lords had, upon a hot debate and by a large majority, again [...] excluded our words from the preamble [173: 95]. This had been [...] after a speech from Lord Cairns, in which he announced his [...] intention of moving other amendments which he detailed, and which [...] were in general conformable to the proposals already made to us. [...] The first disposition of several of us this evening, myself [...] included, was to regard the proceeding of the opposition as now [...] complete; since the whole had been announced, the first stroke [...] struck, and the command shown of a force of peers amply sufficient [...] to do the rest.(183) ... The idea did not, however, include an [...] absolute abandonment of the bill, but only the suspension of our [...] responsibility for it, leaving the opposition to work their own [...] will, and with the intention, when this had been done, of [...] considering the matter further....|$|E
60|$|Paul Montague himself, who {{cannot be}} said to have been a man having his eyes open, in the city sense of the word, could not learn how the thing was progressing. At the regular {{meetings}} of the Board, which never sat for above half an hour, two or three papers were read by Miles Grendall. Melmotte himself would speak a few slow words, intended to be cheery, and always indicative of triumph, and then everybody would agree to everything, somebody would sign something, and the 'Board' for that day would be over. To Paul Montague this was very unsatisfactory. More than once or twice he endeavoured to <b>stay</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> not as disapproving, but simply as desirous of being made to understand; but the silent scorn of his chairman put him out of countenance, and the opposition of his colleagues was a barrier which he was not strong enough to overcome. Lord Alfred Grendall would declare that he 'did not think all that was at all necessary.' Lord Nidderdale, with whom Montague had now become intimate at the Beargarden, would nudge him in the ribs and bid him hold his tongue. Mr Cohenlupe would make a little speech in fluent but broken English, assuring the Committee that everything was being done after the approved city fashion. Sir Felix, after the first two meetings, was never there. And thus Paul Montague, with a sorely burdened conscience, was carried along as one of the Directors of the Great South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway Company.|$|E
