5|$|Before {{affecting}} North Carolina, {{the threat}} of Carol prompted a hurricane warning from Wilmington to Manteo. Storm warnings were issued southward to Charleston. Residents evacuated north of Wilmington along the ocean. While passing by the state, the strongest winds remained {{to the east of}} Hurricane Carol, though winds of 90 to 100mph (145 to 160km/h) were reported at Cape Hatteras. Further inland, the hurricane produced a wind gust of 55mph (90km/h) in Wilmington and 65mph (105km/h) in Cherry Point. The winds resulted in agricultural damage to the corn and <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> crop. High winds caused minor damage to roofs and houses, and also downed some trees and power lines. Near the coast, waves from the storm damaged fishing piers, and flooding was reported in New Bern. High waves also damaged coastal roadways. Damage in the state totaled to around $228,000. Carol passed 100miles (160km) to the east of Virginia, and produced 40mph (65km/h) winds in Virginia Beach. The hurricane produced 4inches (100mm) of rain in Norfolk. Further to the northwest, rainfall from the system alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area. Damage was minor from Virginia to Delaware, where light rains fell. Precipitation also extended into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In Guam, {{the threat}} of Typhoon Isa {{postponed}} a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled {{the first round of}} the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25cm (6–10in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86km/h (53mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> crops.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder {{mixed with}} {{water is a}} good food for animals. However, there are two {{problems}} with this brew. One is that <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder is sunk down to fast. Parts of <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder are too big and too heavy. Animals do not eat <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder because {{after a few minutes}} (around 3 min) is sunk down and <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> are on the bottom case. Another negative point is a quick growth of mold, especially during summer when the temperature is highest. Mold is making food unhealthy and causes unpleasant smell. After mold appears it is difficult to clean the case. One of the solutions to eliminate these problems is to use pulse power plasma discharge and the second solution is ultra sound treatment. It was observed that pulse power discharge can decrease the size of <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> powder a few times. Another advantage of such experiments was that the pulse power discharge killed bacteria and viruses. After our experiments we did not observe mold growing. Using pulse power discharge we can decrease sinking speed by about ten times. Ultra sound generation is useful and can decrease sinking speed even more, compared with pulse power discharge...|$|R

25|$|Qianzhang (skimmed <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> cream) – Qianzhang is {{the cream}} skimmed from soybean milk. In order to create, this several steps must be {{followed}} very carefully. First, soybeans are soaked in water, ground, strained, boiled, restrained {{several times and}} spread over gauze until delicate, snow-white cream is formed. The paste can also be hardened, cut into slivers and seasoned with sesame oil, garlic and chili oil. Another variation is to bake the cream and fry it with bacon, which is described as soft and sweet.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> {{cultivation}} remains scientifically debated. Early Chinese records mention that soybeans were {{a gift from}} the region of Manchuria and the Korean peninsula. Recent research, however, indicates that seeding of wild forms started early (before 5000 BCE) in multiple locations throughout East Asia The Great Soviet Encyclopedia claims soybean cultivation originated in China about 5000 years ago. Some scholars suggest that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BCE. However, the oldest preserved soybeans resembling modern varieties in size and shape were found in archaeological sites in Korea dated about 1000 BCE Radiocarbon dating of soybean samples recovered through flotation during excavations at the Early Mumun period Okbang site in Korea indicated soybean was cultivated as a food crop in around 1000–900 BCE. Soybeans from the Jomon period in Japan from 3000 BCE are also significantly larger than wild varieties. The cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern China by 2000 BCE, but is almost certainly much older. Soybeans became an important crop by the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE) in China. However, the details of where, when, and under what circumstances soybean developed a close relationship with people are poorly understood. <b>Soy</b> <b>bean</b> was unknown in South China before the Han period From about the first century CE to the Age of Discovery (15–16th century), soybeans were introduced into across South and Southeast Asia. This spread was due to the establishment of sea and land trade routes. The earliest Japanese textual reference to the soybean is in the classic Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters), which was completed in 712 CE.|$|E

50|$|BV is {{designed}} to ignore variation in digestibility of a food — which in turn largely depends on the food preparation.

50|$|Natto has a {{different}} nutritional makeup from raw <b>soy</b> <b>beans,</b> losing Vitamin A and several other vitamins and minerals. The calorie content of natto is {{lower than that of}} raw <b>soy</b> <b>beans,</b> however. While <b>soy</b> <b>beans</b> are highly nutritious, the nutrition is packed in the bean's hard fiber. Natto includes the benefits of nutritious soy and softer dietary fiber without the high sodium content present in many other soy products, notably in miso. Natto contains no cholesterol and is a significant source of iron, calcium, magnesium, protein, potassium, vitamins B6, B2, E, K2, and more. When Natto is mixed with egg and eaten with rice, Japanese call the dish a perfectly nutritious meal, covering all nutritional needs. Natto is the richest food source of natural K2. Consumption of it is strongly associated with bone health.|$|R
