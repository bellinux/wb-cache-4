50|$|An {{additional}} way {{in which}} the <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> tool can be altered is increasing or decreasing the separation between the source and receivers. This gives deeper penetration and overcomes the problem of low velocity zones posed by borehole wall damage.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> {{provides}} a formation interval transit time, which typically {{a function of}} lithology and rock texture but particularly porosity. The logging tool consists of a piezoelectric transmitter and receiver and the time taken to for the sound wave to travel the fixed distance {{between the two is}} recorded as an interval transit time.|$|E
50|$|The {{two types}} of {{porosity}} logs (acoustic logs and nuclear logs) date originally from the 1940s. <b>Sonic</b> <b>logs</b> grew out of technology developed during World War II.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Dutch {{development}} program Geo-impulse, which aims to half the occurrence of geotechnical failures in civil engineering projects inside the Netherlands by 2015, this master thesis is investigating how to trace imperfections in bored piles at an early stage. The objective is to carry out literature study on suitable methods and then focus the research on one particular method. The basis of the research is the single-hole <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> method. Field and laboratory measurements are carried out with the aim to investigate the detection range of the method as well as try to apply more advanced post-processing techniques. Results from the measurements are discussed and also a comparison between single-hole <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> and the better standardized test cross-hole <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> is made. The results indicate that single-hole <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> has a small detection range inside a bored pile, especially compared to cross-hole <b>sonic</b> <b>logging.</b> Also more advanced post-processing techniques fails or make the test to advance to use on a daily basis. Finally the recommendation is to carry on research with other techniques which in scientific papers have showed some promising results. ...|$|R

5000|$|If it is {{necessary}} to compensate for tool tilt and variations in the borehole width then both up-down and down-up arrays can be used and an average can be calculated. Overall this gives a <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> that can be made up of 1 or 2 pulse generators and 2 or 4 detectors, all located in single unit called a “sonde”, which is lowered down the well.|$|E
5000|$|Greensands {{may cause}} {{varying degrees of}} {{difficulty}} for porosity log analysis. [...] radicals affect neutron logs; the iron component is troublesome, and varying clay hydration needs {{to be considered for}} density log interpretation. The iron component affects the NMR logs and clay affects the <b>sonic</b> <b>log.</b> Therefore it is essential to have a core - or at least a good understanding of the geology - before invoking total vs effective porosity relationships.|$|E
5000|$|To {{improve the}} tie between well data and seismic data a [...] "check-shot" [...] survey {{is often used}} to {{generate}} a calibrated <b>sonic</b> <b>log.</b> A geophone, or array of geophones is lowered down the borehole, with a seismic source located at the surface. The seismic source is fired with the geophone(s) at a series of different depths, with the interval transit times being recorded. This is often done during the acquisition of a vertical seismic profile.|$|E

5000|$|Stoneley {{waves are}} most {{commonly}} generated during borehole <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> and vertical seismic profiling. They propagate {{along the walls}} of a fluid-filled borehole. They make up {{a large part of the}} low-frequency component of the signal from the seismic source and their attenuation is sensitive to fractures and formation permeability. Therefore, analysis of Stoneley waves can make it possible to estimate these rock properties. The standard data processing of <b>sonic</b> <b>logs</b> to derive wave velocity and energy content is explained in [...] and.|$|R
50|$|Sonic logging is a {{well logging}} tool that {{provides}} a formation’s interval transit time, designated as , which {{is a measure of}} a formation’s capacity to transmit seismic waves. Geologically, this capacity varies with lithology and rock textures, most notably decreasing with an increasing effective porosity. This means that a <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> can be used to calculate the porosity of a formation if the seismic velocity of the rock matrix, , and pore fluid, , are known, which is very useful for hydrocarbon exploration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of sonic logs is rather poor, evident {{by the fact}} that regular- and long-spaced log measurements often conflict, and this should be taken into account when there are disagreements between seismic data and <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> data. [...] Other considerations include that the resolution of sonic logs is on a scale of inches whereas seismic reflection data resolution is on the scale of meters, and the two methods use significantly different frequency ranges so travel times will vary due to dispersion.|$|E
50|$|Both sonic and density-neutron logs give {{porosity}} {{as their}} primary information. Sonic logs read {{farther away from the}} borehole so they are more useful where sections of the borehole are caved. Because they read deeper, they also tend to average more formation than the density-neutron logs do. Modern sonic configurations with pingers and microphones {{at both ends of the}} log, combined with computer analysis, minimize the averaging somewhat. Averaging is an advantage when the formation is being evaluated for seismic parameters, a different area of formation evaluation. A special log, the Long Spaced Sonic, is sometimes used for this purpose. Seismic signals (a single undulation of a sound wave in the earth) average together tens to hundreds of feet of formation, so an averaged <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> is more directly comparable to a seismic waveform.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sonic</b> <b>logging</b> {{has been}} widely used {{for many years to}} acquire {{physical}} properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs. In the early years, the detection of first breaks for acoustic signals travelling along wellbore, and, later, the method was replaced by slowness time coherence (STC) method using full acoustic waveform to accurately estimate the velocity of elastic waves in formation, since the estimation of velocity is important for the identification of fluid contacts such as OWC (Oil-Water Contact), GOC (Gas-Oil Contact), etc. The resolution of existing methods is restricted to 6 inch defined by neighboring receiver distance of logging tool. However, there are significant needs to gain the resolution higher than the current detection of fluid contact locations as well as their variations in time. We, therefore, tried to introduce the method of full-waveform inversion (FWI) as an innovative technique to estimate the elastic velocities with much higher resolution in the subsurface using <b>sonic</b> <b>logging.</b> Although the FWI method has been proven to provide seismic velocities with higher resolution than the other conventional seismic reflection methods, the applicability of FWI to the <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> has not been investigated yet, and we first examine if the FWI could be used for the objective to estimate velocities finer than the current limitation of receiver spacing using numerical experiments. Our results show that both GOC and OWC become visible with the resolution higher than the conventional sonic methods whose resolution is 6 inches. We conclude that FWI would be applicable to <b>sonic</b> <b>logging</b> as a high-resolution method...|$|R

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for calculating a ‘zero-offset ’ converted-wave (P-SV) synthetic seismogram. The algorithm {{is based on the}} simplifying assumption of layer thicknesses with constant interval times. These interval times represent the zero-offset travel time of a downgoing compressional wave and an upgoing shear wave. A reflected amplitude is computed for each offset used in the data acquisition, using the exact expression for a P-SV reflection. These reflection amplitudes are stacked to create the zero offset trace. Offsets are mapped to incident angles by raytracing the model. Computation of the synthetic requires either a full waveform <b>sonic</b> <b>log,</b> or a compressional-wave <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> and a time variant estimate of the V,JVl ratio. The algorithm has been tested on a full waveform <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> from southern Alberta, and compared to an offset mode-converted VSP.

40|$|The use of <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> data {{to analyse}} {{overpressure}} in the Cooper Basin, South Australia {{is complicated by}} the occurrence of Tertiary uplift in the basin. Uplift and overpressure are both associated with anomalous porosity/depth relationships: the former being witnessed by overcompaction and the later by undercompaction. Hence uplift may mask overpressure effects on log data. A normal compaction trend was determined for the Cooper Basin by averaging <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> data from 29 wells. The Maree Subgroup was omitted from the normal compaction trend because it has a markedly different <b>sonic</b> <b>log</b> signature. Shale sequences were isolated for study by applying a gamma ray filter (API > 100). In order to remove the effects of uplift, the normal compaction trend was adjusted to fit the trend of the upper, normally pressured part of the sequence in each well. Quantitative pore pressure analysis was undertaken on shale sequences from 8 wells using the Eaton (1972) method once the effect of uplift had been removed. The predictions of the Eaton (1972) method are consistent with pressure measurements (DSTs and mud weights) in sandstones in 7 of the 8 wells, suggesting that both uplift and overpressure have been successfully determined. Assuming that the shales at Moomba 55 are overpressured, as suggested by the Eaton (1972) method, these shales must be isolated from adjacent near normally pressured sandstones. Furthermore mud weights, which are only at best an approximation of formation pressure, are especially unreliable in overpressured shales adjacent to near-normally pressured sandstones.
