5|$|Except for the locks, the dam {{project was}} {{completed}} and fully functional as of July 4, 2012, {{when the last}} of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. The <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> was complete in December 2015. Each main water turbine has a capacity of 700MW. The dam body was completed in 2006. Coupling the dam's 32 main turbines with two smaller generators (50MW each) to power the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the dam is 22,500MW.|$|E

50|$|According to the Beijing Review the Hongshui River had 300 shoals that {{interfered}} with navigating the river with cargo vessels.Several of the dams {{are equipped with}} <b>ship</b> <b>lifts</b> capable of lifting vessels of 300 tons displacement.|$|R
2500|$|It may {{be either}} {{vertically}} moving, like the <b>ship</b> <b>lifts</b> in Germany, Belgium, the lift at [...] "Les Fontinettes" [...] in France or the Anderton boat lift in England, or rotational, like the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland.|$|R

Techport features the largest <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the canal locks, there is a <b>ship</b> <b>lift,</b> a kind of elevator for vessels. The <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> can lift ships of up to 3,000tons. The vertical distance traveled is 113 metres, {{and the size of}} the ship lift's basin is 120×18×3.5 metres. The <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> takes 30 to 40 minutes to transit, as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks. One complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically. The <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> must work even if water levels vary by [...] on the lower side, and 30metres on the upper side.|$|E
50|$|The lifting {{appliances}} {{are often}} used on a ship to put on land the heavy cargo or other goods. The controls are important. All the surveys are noted in the Register of <b>Ship’s</b> <b>Lifting</b> Appliances and Cargo Handling Gear; the inspection is directed by the classification society.|$|R
50|$|Finally, two bombs landed {{less than}} ten meters {{off the side of}} the <b>ship,</b> <b>lifting</b> her {{partially}} out of the water and spraying shrapnel up towards the anti-aircraft gunners. This last attack left five sailors wounded, one fatally, and knocked out the ship's electricity and fire control systems.|$|R
50|$|According to a 1989 {{survey of}} <b>ship</b> <b>lifts,</b> from the Permanent International Association of Navigation Congresses (PIANC), in 1893 a canal {{inclined}} plane was constructed on the canal, near Meaux.It was only capable of lifting vessels 70 tons and 24 metres length. The vertical lift was 12.2 metres.|$|R
500|$|As of May 2014, the <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> was {{expected}} to be completed by July 2015. It was tested in December 2015 and announced complete in January 2016. [...] Lahmeyer, the German firm that designed the <b>ship</b> <b>lift,</b> said it will take a vessel less than an hour to transit the lift. [...] An article in Steel Construction says the actual time of the lift will be 21 minutes. It says that the expected dimensions of the [...] passenger vessels the ship lift's basin was designed to carry will be [...] X [...] X [...]|$|E
500|$|During the 1980s, {{the idea}} of a dam reemerged. The National People's Congress {{approved}} the dam in 1992: out of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote. Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until May 2012. The <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> was completed in 2015. The dam had raised the water level in the reservoir to [...] above sea level by the end of 2008 and the designed maximum level of [...] by October 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Examples {{of famous}} [...] "real" [...] {{staircases}} in England are Bingley and Grindley Brook. Two-rise staircases are more common: Snakeholme Lock and Struncheon Hill Lock on the Driffield Navigation {{were converted to}} staircase locks after low water levels hindered navigation over the bottom cill at all but the higher tides – the new bottom chamber rises just far {{enough to get the}} boat over the original lock cill. In China, the recently completed Three Gorges Dam includes a double five-step staircase for large ships, and a <b>ship</b> <b>lift</b> for vessels of less than 3000 metric tons. Examples of [...] "apparent" [...] staircases are Foxton Locks and Watford Locks on the Leicester Branch of the Grand Union.|$|E
