5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
25|$|After Leo's arrest, Kira finds Andrei {{preparing}} for a speech to a Communist Party meeting. She declares she is proud that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> was necessary to save Leo's life, and she expresses contempt for the Communist ideology that would have let him die. Andrei says he understands and accepts responsibility for making her suffer. When she leaves, Andrei confronts Syerov and insists that he use his influence to secure Leo's release. When Andrei gives his speech, he deviates from his prepared remarks to speak in favor of freedom and individualism.|$|E

She is later shown in a secret base donning a helmet that is a combination of Cyclops and Magneto's in preparation for her next move, as she is now wanted and on the run from both the Inhumans and X-Men for her actions since Cyclops' death.|$|E

25|$|Helen Jenkins was crowned the 2011 ITU World Champion when <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> was {{required}} {{of her and}} finished second on the podium to claim her second individual elite world title. Andrea Hewitt won the Grand Final race to win her first World Championship series event since Madrid 2009 and finished {{in exactly the same}} time as when Snowsill won Olympic Gold in 2008. With the New Zealander winning, Paula Findlay pulling out on the bike leg, and Riveros Diaz being hampered by illness, Hewitt claimed silver overall. Sarah Groff finished in 10th place on the day, claimed to claim the overall bronze title ahead of Emma Jackson, but has to thank Emma Moffatt, who over took her team mate in the last few metres. Jackson finished 12th and therefore finished just 23 points behind the American. Diaz and Findlay finished fifth and sixth in the final standings.|$|E
500|$|Head writer Maria Arena Bell {{dedicated}} the 4th of July episode to Sharon, {{stating that}} the episode would [...] "shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her {{to be in this}} situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [...] self-esteem." [...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> she thought she had to do. Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never that easy {{to walk away from the}} people you love".|$|E
500|$|While Monroe {{remains a}} {{cultural}} icon, critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. David Thomson called her {{body of work}} [...] "insubstantial" [...] and Pauline Kael wrote {{that she could not}} act, but rather [...] "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting – and vice versa; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> others had the 'good taste' not to do". In contrast, according to Peter Bradshaw, Monroe was a talented comedian who [...] "understood how comedy achieved its effects", and [...] Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that [...] "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" [...] and that [...] "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".|$|E

500|$|But this contradicted O'Neal's {{own account}} of the {{relationship}} in 1995 in Vibe, where she remembered Jackson as [...] "being so shy" [...] and [...] "one of the nicest, most innocent people I've ever met", and, [...] "Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn't even sit on my bed." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "a really wonderful friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And that one time they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet", and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened.|$|E

[...] The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 and the Historic American Buildings Survey spent the part of the summer in 1997 preparing drawings and taking new photographs. [...] The Martins both died not long afterwards. [...] The Martin heirs sold the house in 2001 to a new family. [...] The house, along with four surviving ancillary structures, was declared a National Historic Landmark on August 18, 2004.|$|E

Shortly after Sparks' album was released Dobson said, [...] "Jordin Sparks just did , which was on Sunday Love, which was very cool. She did kind of, like, a more R version of it, which I think is really nice, actually. It was really cool that she didn't try and do a rock version of it, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> she's more comfortable with, which I thought was awesome." [...] The Sparks' version was released as a single in the UK on January 4, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|During Brown's tenure, the {{magazine}} was honored with 4 George Polk Awards, 5 Overseas Press Club Awards, and 10 National Magazine Awards, including a 1995 award for General Excellence, the first in {{the magazine}}'s history. Newsstand sales rose 145 percent The New Yorkers circulation increased to 807,935 for the second half of 1997, up from 658,916 during the corresponding period in 1992. Critics maintained it was hemorrhaging money, but Newhouse remained supportive, viewing the magazine under Brown as a start-up (which routinely lose money): [...] "It was practically a new magazine. She added topicality, photography, color. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> we would have done if we invented the New Yorker from scratch. To do all that was costly. We knew it would be." [...] Under Brown, its economic fortunes improved every year: in 1995 losses were about $17 million, in 1996 $14 million, and in 1997 $11 million.|$|E
2500|$|Kenny {{claimed in}} her 1943 {{autobiography}} (co-authored by Martha Ostenso) that she treated her first cases of infantile paralysis in 1910 while working alone as a bush nurse in the Clifton district. That episode was romanticised in the 1946 film Sister Kenny, featuring Rosalind Russell (who befriended Kenny). Surveillance {{records from the}} early 1900s show that infantile paralysis was a rare disease in Queensland prior to World War I, although {{there is evidence that}} subacute cases were brought to Kenny's cottage hospital in Clifton. In her memoir, Kenny claimed she was baffled by the cases she encountered and sought assurance from Dr. Aeneas McDonnell. He wired back, [...] "...treat them according to the symptoms as they present themselves". Sensing that their muscles were tight, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> mothers around the world did: applied hot compresses and weights made from woollen blankets to their legs. Kenny wrote in her autobiography that a little girl woke up very much relieved and said, [...] "Please, I want them rags that well my legs". Several children recovered with no serious aftereffects. Many years passed before Kenny treated anyone else who might have had polio. The story of Kenny's first encounter with an acute case of polio is a 20th-century medical legend, but there is no documented record other than her memoir. The chief witness to the discovery of her method for treating poliomyelitis was Aeneas McDonnell, who died before the story was widely publicised.|$|E
