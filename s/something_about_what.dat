25|$|In April 2006 {{the deaths}} of four {{teenagers}} at Pine Bush High School in two separate accidents along the stretch of 302 between Roberson Avenue and Crans Mill Road just north of Bullville led the school district to ask the state Department of Transportation to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> residents considered a deadly stretch of highway. Since all seven of the district's schools are either on or close to the highway, its officials fear that a school bus could {{be involved in the}} next fatal accident.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' We started talking about that and going back and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E
2500|$|South Korea {{developed}} {{programs for}} adult Korean adoptees {{to return to}} South Korea and learn {{about what it means}} to be Korean. One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi., so that meant that they would be, uh, eligible for a special visa status, that would allow them to return to South Korea for extended periods of time, and, in line with this, this is an image from the overseas Korean foundation, uh, summer cultural program for overseas adoptees, and so, they developed these programs to help adult adoptees return to Korea and learn <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it means to be Korean, so these programs are typically focused on traditional Korean culture, um, you know, adoptees dressing up in hanbok and learning how to make kimchi, um, such as these images here." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus all {{knowledge}} which, on {{a basis of}} experience tells us <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is not experienced, is based upon a belief which experience can neither confirm nor confute, yet which, at least in its more concrete applications, appears to be as firmly rooted in us {{as many of the}} facts of experience. The existence and justification of such beliefs--for the inductive principle, as we shall see, is not the only example--raises some of the most difficult and most debated problems of philosophy. We will, in the next chapter, consider briefly what may be said to account for such knowledge, and what is its scope and its degree of certainty.|$|E
60|$|He {{should have}} gone anyhow, and no doubt {{he would be able}} to get some {{opportunity}} of writing to Frank and setting his mind at rest as to his safety, and telling him <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened, and that he had been kidnapped and carried over to France. He had acted like a fool, no doubt, but Frank would understand why he had followed his first impulse and gone alone after the man who committed the murder, instead of going to the constables and telling them that some unknown man had killed the magistrate. One thing seemed certain, he should never be able to go back to Weymouth again unless the affair was cleared up, and he did not see how that ever could be.|$|E
60|$|We {{have now}} rapidly glanced at such general truths {{of nature as}} can be {{investigated}} without much knowledge of what is beautiful. Questions of arrangement, massing, and generalization, I prefer leaving untouched, until we know something about details, and <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is beautiful. All that is desirable, even in these mere technical and artificial points, is based upon truths and habits of nature; but we cannot understand those truths until we are acquainted with the specific forms and minor details which they affect, or out of which they arise. I shall, therefore, proceed to examine the invaluable and essential truths of specific character and form--briefly and imperfectly, indeed, as needs must be, but yet at length sufficient to enable the reader to pursue, if he will, the subject for himself.|$|E
5000|$|Mike Leigh, who was {{involved}} with the Victoria Theatre in the 1960s, said"Working with Peter was a special and creative time. Great friendships were made. There was <b>something</b> special <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Peter made people do and made people be. The kind of spirit in which we worked, to be political and truthful, was down to Peter. He is a genius, a vagabond, a facilitator. What he has achieved is colossal and he is regarded with great respect and love." ...|$|R

60|$|She hesitated, {{glancing at}} {{an open door}} close by, and then moved towards it as if she {{expected}} him to follow her. Foster did so and {{found himself in a}} small drawing-room, where she sat down on a sofa and waited for him to speak. Instead he stood opposite, pondering. The girl was pretty and fashionably dressed, but he had ground for thinking some of her friends or relatives were dangerous criminals. It did not, however, follow that she took part in their plots, and although she obviously knew <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was going on, he did not believe she knew it was connected with the tragedy at Gardner's Crossing. He admitted that he was perhaps giving way to romantic sentiment, but he was sorry for the girl and thought her Daly's victim. The fellow was handsome and must have charm, since {{he had been able to}} influence Carmen, who was strong-willed and clever.|$|E
6000|$|But {{would it}} not be well if our children, without being taught to blame anyone for what is past, were taught <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> ought to be done now, what must be done soon, with the {{rainfall}} of these islands; and about other and kindred health-questions, on the solution of which depends, and will depend more and more, the life of millions? One would have thought that those public schools and colleges which desire to monopolise the education of the owners of the soil; of the great employers of labour; of the clergy; and of all, indeed, who ought to be acquainted with the duties of property, the conditions of public health, and, in a word, with the general laws of what is now called Social Science-- one would have thought, I say, that these public schools and colleges would have taught their scholars somewhat at least about such matters, that they might go forth into life with at least some rough notions of the causes which make people healthy or unhealthy, rich or poor, comfortable or wretched, useful or dangerous to the State. But as long as our great educational institutions, safe, or fancying themselves safe, in some enchanted castle, shut out by ancient magic from the living world, put a premium on Latin and Greek verses: a wise father will, during the holidays, talk now and then, I hope, somewhat after this fashion: ...|$|E

As will be made explicit in the following, each of the articles tells us <b>something</b> <b>about</b> firstly, <b>what</b> big data is and how it relates to power.

40|$|Power Plays capitalises on {{this moment}} of renewed and {{heightened}} interest by investigating the why and the how of eight contemporary Australian playwrights: Andrew Bovell, Patricia Cornelius, Reg Cribb, Ben Ellis, Wesley Enoch, Hannie Rayson, Stephen Sewell and Katherine Thomson. These writers are passionate about the theatre as a forum for public discussion and they interrogate current issues in their work. Their plays reflect the passing show of cultural, political and economic life in Australia, telling audiences <b>something</b> critical <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is going on: this {{is the state of}} play, this is what we are. The author has conducted extensive interviews with these writers and offers an extended analysis of some of their recent plays. <br /...|$|R
