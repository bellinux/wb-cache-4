Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this was, as she had suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: she had said she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{answer to}} a {{question}} from a fellow candidate during the selection of top 5 finalists, Seifert believes that in [...] "Negros Occidental the principal problem {{is that there is no}} waste segregation, it is a problem because it is inevitable that we all produce waste; out of 13 cities only three of the cities right now are practicing solid waste management. We need to cover 10 more and 19 more municipalities. Let’s not sit back and relax,” <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> she stressed the need to take care of Mother Nature.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said she}} wanted her music {{to be remembered as}} that of Nina Simone, one of her {{favourite}} artists. She {{went on to say that}} Nina Simone achieved this for herself and writing her own songs is the best way possible. She also said [...] "These days nothing lasts, music is like fast food, you're in then you're out. <b>She</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> much as she would like, she would never play the piano as well as Simone, but she would give it her best shot. She loves the songs Simone produced, including [...] "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" [...] and Simone's version of [...] "I Think It's Going to Rain Today". She said that Simone's original songs are very poetic and she said [...] "So when I listen to commercial stuff at the moment, I'm just thinking 'haven't you heard Nina Simone, haven't you heard how a song should be written?" [...] She went on to say [...] "We choose and consume, feast and forget, then rush on to the next hot thing. There's no point chasing that kind of success because it's so transient. Far better to follow (our) own paths and be true to (ourselves)." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 16, 2009, Travis {{attacked}} Sandra Herold's 55-year-old friend Charla Nash, inflicting devastating {{injuries to}} her face and limbs. Travis had left the house with Sandra Herold's car keys, and Nash came to help get the chimp back in the house; upon seeing Nash holding {{one of his favorite}} toys, Travis immediately attacked her. [...] Travis was familiar with Nash, who had also worked at the Herolds' towing company, although Nash had a different hair style {{at the time of the}} attack. [...] The chimp had been taking medication for Lyme disease. Herold, then 70 years old, attempted to stop Travis by hitting him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife. [...] "For me to do something like that – put a knife in him – was like putting one in myself," [...] Herold later said. The chimp turned around, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> if to say, [...] "'Mom, what did you do?'" [...] The ape was angered more. Herold then called 9-1-1 and pleaded for help. Travis' screams can be heard in the background of the tape as Sandra pleads for police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax, until she started screaming, [...] "He's eating her!" [...] Emergency medical services waited for police before approaching the house. Travis walked up to the police car when it arrived, tried to open a locked passenger door, and smashed a side-view mirror. Then he went calmly around to the driver's-side door and opened it, at which point Officer Frank Chiafari shot him several times. Travis retreated to the house, where he was found dead next to his cage.|$|E
