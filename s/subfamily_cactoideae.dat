5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have}} {{supported}} the monophyly of three of these subfamilies (not Pereskioideae), but have not supported all of the tribes or even genera below this level; indeed, a 2011 study found only 39% of the genera in the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae</b> sampled in the research were monophyletic. Classification of the cacti currently remains uncertain {{and is likely to}} change.|$|E
25|$|In one {{widely used}} {{classification}} of cacti, Armatocereus and Jasminocereus {{are placed in}} the tribe Browningieae of the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae,</b> and Brachycereus {{is placed in the}} tribe Trichocereeae, which is inconsistent with the cladogram above. A classification produced in 2010 by Nyffeler and Eggli puts all three genera in a much larger tribe Phyllocacteae.|$|E
500|$|The 1,500 to 1,800 {{species of}} cacti mostly fall {{into one of}} two groups of [...] "core cacti": opuntias (subfamily Opuntioideae) and [...] "cactoids" [...] (<b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae).</b> Most members of these two groups are easily {{recognizable}} as cacti. They have fleshy succulent stems that are major organs of photosynthesis. They have absent, small, or transient leaves. They have flowers with ovaries that lie below the sepals and petals, often deeply sunken into a fleshy receptacle (the part of the stem from which the flower parts grow). All cacti have areoles—highly specialized short shoots with extremely short internodes that produce spines, normal shoots, and flowers.|$|E
50|$|Browningieae are a {{tribe of}} cactus {{belonging}} to the <b>Cactoideae</b> <b>subfamily.</b>|$|R
500|$|The leafless, spiny stem is the {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} majority of cacti (and all of those belonging to the largest <b>subfamily,</b> the <b>Cactoideae).</b> The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water. The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of Opuntia) or covered with protuberances of various kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small [...] "bumps" [...] to prominent, nipple-like shapes in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species. The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape. The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when full (up to 90% of the mass of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus is short of water and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.|$|R
500|$|Understanding {{evolution}} {{within the}} core cacti clade is difficult , since phylogenetic relationships are still uncertain and not well related to current classifications. Thus, a 2011 study found [...] "an extraordinarily {{high proportion of}} genera" [...] were not monophyletic, so were not all descendants of a single common ancestor. For example, of the 36 genera in the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae</b> sampled in the research, 22 (61%) were found not monophyletic. Nine tribes are recognized within Cactoideae in the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG) classification; one, Calymmantheae, comprises a single genus, Calymmanthium. Only two of the remaining eight, Cacteae and Rhipsalideae, were shown to be monophyletic in a 2011 study by Hernández-Hernández et al.

5000|$|Echinocactus is a genus of cacti in the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae.</b> The {{generic name}} {{derives from the}} Ancient Greek εχινος (echinos), meaning [...] "spiny," [...] and cactus.

50|$|Molecular {{studies show}} that the two endemic Galápagos genera, Brachycereus and Jasminocereus, are sisters, with their closest {{relative}} being the South American mainland species Armatocereus:In one widely used classification of cacti, Brachycereus is placed in the tribe Trichocereeae of the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae,</b> while Armatocereus and Jasminocereus are placed in the tribe Browningieae, which is inconsistent with the cladogram above.

5000|$|Classifications {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters placed Armatocereus in the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae,</b> tribe Browningieae. However, molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly {{shown that the}} tribe Browningieae is not monophyletic (like most other traditional cactus tribes). A 2011 study places Armatocereus in a clade called [...] "PHB", as it contains members of the previously defined Pachycereeae, Hylocereeae and Browningieae tribes; other Browningieae members, including Browningia, are placed in a more distantly related BCT clade. The main clades in the resulting phylogeny are shown below.|$|E

50|$|Rhipsalis is a genus of epiphytic cacti. They are {{typically}} known as mistletoe cacti. The scientific name {{derives from the}} Ancient Greek term for wickerwork, referring to the plants' habitus. Rhipsalis is one {{is part of the}} tribe Rhipsalideae within the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae</b> of the Cactaceae. It is the largest and most widely distributed genus of epiphytic cacti.The genus was described by Joseph Gaertner in 1788. But when he described the plant, he had in fact not realised it was a cactus. Instead, he assumed to have found a new species of Cassytha, a parasitic laurel. Hence, Cassytha is often indicated as a generic synonym for Rhipsalis, although this is not the case, since this generic name had been applied for a completely different genus in a different plant family.|$|E
50|$|The genus {{and species}} were first {{described}} in 1937 by Erich Werdermann after being discovered in northern Argentina by Harry Blossfeld and Oreste Marsoner. The genus name honours Blossfeld. Blossfeldia liliputana has several features making it unique among cacti, including {{a very small number}} of stomata, the absence of a thickened cuticle, and hairy seeds with an aril. It is placed in the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Cactoideae,</b> and traditionally in the tribe Notocacteae. However, molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly shown that it is sister to the remaining members of the subfamily, and well removed from other genera placed in the Notocacteae:Recognizing the position of Blossfeldia, Nyffler and Eggli in their 2010 classification of Cactaceae placed it in a separate tribe, Blossfeldieae, within Cactoideae. Earlier, Blossfeldia had been placed in an entirely separate subfamily, Blossfeldioideae.|$|E

Schum. ex Vaupel) Britton & Rose (Pachycereeae tribe) and Neoraimondia arequipensis (Meyen) Backeb., (Browningieae tribe). All pollen grains observed under a light microscope appeared in monades, shape varying from spheroidal to spheroidal oblate; all colpate, {{with the exception}} of C. brevistylus, with spinules < 1 μm to 2 μm; exine thickness varied 2 - 3 μm; tectum without perceptible differences, always was pierced.
