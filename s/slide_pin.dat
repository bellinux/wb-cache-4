50|$|After this a tag team match {{took place}} between the New Age Outlaws, a team made of The Road Dogg and Billy Gunn and the team of Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart. The latter team's manager, Debra, wore a skimpy outfit and the Outlaws tried to make her strip, when she wouldn't Gunn offered to do so himself first, living up to his moniker Mr. Ass. This led to the Outlaws being {{attacked}} from behind. Road Dogg and Jarrett began wrestling until Hart took a blind tag {{in an attempt to}} take advantage, though Dogg ran the two partners into each other. During the match Dogg had Hart secured in a back <b>slide</b> <b>pin</b> for more than three seconds but Jarrett distracted the referee from making the pin count. After Road Dogg was isolated for some time, Billy Gunn was tagged in and energetically took out both members before the two delivered a synchronized ten punch to their opponents in opposite corners. The match turned briefly and Hart and Jarrett tried to perform simultaneous submissions - the Sharpshooter and figure four leg lock, respectively - but Jarrett could not lock in the move. With Gunn free, he jumped onto Hart and sat on his head to slam Hart's head into the mat for the Fameasser, freeing Road Dogg of the Sharpshooter and allowing them to win the match. Afterward Gunn mooned the crowd.|$|E
25|$|The Facit calculator, and one {{similar to}} it, are {{basically}} pinwheel machines, but {{the array of}} pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of <b>sliding</b> <b>pins</b> ot extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector {{as well as the}} same pins for 6 through 9.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two ways}} to convert this split. The first is to strike either pin and have it bounce out of the pit area and strike the {{remaining}} pin. This not only requires substantial ball speed but the pin must be struck in the right spot. Additionally, a pin flying out from the pit is a fairly rare occurrence. This is made more difficult by variation of the pit design according to the pinsetter system, with the Brunswick A-2 being more prone to bounce-outs than recent machines. Bouncing out on a Brunswick GS-series pinsetter is exceedingly difficult due to a moving curtain {{at the back of the}} pit which absorbs the impact, while AMF pinsetters have a higher chance of bouncing out the pin facing away from the ball return of a lane pair. The second method is to strike either pin on the inside with enough velocity to bounce it off the side wall (kickback plate) and rebound onto and across the deck into the other <b>pin.</b> <b>Sliding</b> the <b>pin</b> directly will not work since the ball will fall off the lane before it gets far enough aside the 7 or 10 <b>pin</b> to <b>slide</b> it directly across. Despite this fact, many television shows and movies over the years have depicted the 7-10 split being converted by directly <b>sliding</b> one <b>pin</b> into another. In each case, the [...] "conversion" [...] was rigged by either moving the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> over on a deck without pin spots (giving the ball extra room to <b>slide</b> the <b>pin</b> sideways and making it look like the pin was spotted correctly) or by having some help (human or mechanical) from the pit to [...] "slide" [...] the pin over. Barring such [...] "Hollywood magic" [...] in real life, a freak bounce out of the pit or a side wall rebound are the only realistic ways to convert a 7-10 split.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{intended}} to use torpedoes containing 400 lb (180 kg) of black powder; but those actually employed by it contained 60 lb (27 kg) of fine powder of the kind known in the American service as No. 7. The [...] "obstruction shells" [...] have each an air space left round the powder, so as to allow the free expansion of the gases, and the torpedoes intended for use against vessels are of slightly less specific gravity than water, so that when released from the holder they rise slowly until they come against {{the bottom of the}} vessel under which they are placed. As will be seen by the section, Fig. 2, the powder is so placed in the torpedo that, when the later is released, it floats nearly upright with its point downwards. Within the torpedo case, on one side, is placed a tube, {{at the lower end of}} which is a percussion fuse in communication with the powder. At the upper end of the tube is a ball, which is held from falling upon the percussion fuse by a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> placed beneath it. This pin passes out through the torpedo case, and has an eye formed at its outer end, as shown in Fig. 2. When the torpedo is placed in the casing at the end of the projecting tube, that side of the torpedo through which the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> just mentioned projects is placed downwards, and one end of a cord is attached to the eye of the pin, and the other end to another eye fixed to the casing at the end of the projecting tube. The length of this cord is regulated according to the distance at which it is desired to fire the torpedo - the length generally employed being about 20 ft (6 m) — and it acts in the following manner: When the torpedo has been projected by means of the tube and released, the tube is of course drawn back, and as this movement takes place the cord is tightened, and the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> is withdrawn from the torpedo case, this movement releasing the ball and allowing it to fall upon the percussion fuse, and explode the torpedo.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} VTEC-E implementation is {{a variation}} of SOHC VTEC {{which is used to}} increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of roller rocker arms and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation(one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation(the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder—a very mild cam lobe with little lift and a normal cam lobe with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild cam lobe, forcing most of the intake charge through the other open intake valve with the normal cam lobe. This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine's speed and load increase, both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin,</b> just like with the original VTEC. This <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the [...] "normal" [...] camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the [...] "normal" [...] cam lobe has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of five recently developed C-ether-formulated fluids with an advanced formulated MIL-L- 27502 candidate ester is described. Steady state wear and friction measurements {{were made with}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> on disk friction apparatus. Conditions included disk temperatures up to 260 C, dry air test atmosphere, 1 kilogram load, 50 rpm disk speed, and test times to 130 minutes. Based on wear rates and coefficients of friction, three of the C-ether formulations {{as well as the}} C-ether base fluid gave better boundary lubrication than the ester fluid under all test conditions. The susceptibility of C-ethers to selective additive treatment (phosphinic esters or acids and other antiwear additives) was demonstrated when two of the formulations gave somewhat improved lubrication over the base fluid. The increased operating potential for this fluid was shown in relationship to bulk oil temperature limits for MIL-L- 23699 and MIL-L- 27502 type esters...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} results of a {{retrospective}} study on 120 patients treated for transtrochanteric fractures of the femur using a minimally invasive technique with an extramedullary <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> as implant – which we denoted the MINUS System. The evaluation was carried out in in the postoperative period, and the levels of haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Ht), surgical time, radiological screening time and pain levels were recorded. Prior to the operation, mean Hb and Ht were 11. 69  g/dl and 35. 72 %, respectively; in the immediate postoperative period, they were 10. 35  g/dl and 32. 4 %, respectively. Mean operating time was 39. 35  min. Average postoperative pain was assessed at 4. 44 (on a scale of 1 to 10). The average time for screening was 1. 07  min. Based on these criteria, we conclude that the minimally invasive technique of the MINUS System allows for a shorter operating time and a minimal blood loss in the treatment of transtrochanteric fractures of the femur...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{common design}} uses a hammer fixed {{directly}} onto the input shaft, {{with a pair of}} pins acting as clutches. When the hammer rotates past the anvil, a ball ramp pushes the pins outwards against a spring, extending them to where they will hit the anvil and deliver the impact, then release and spring back into the hammer, usually by having the balls [...] "fall off" [...] {{the other side of the}} ramp at the instant the hammer hits. Since the ramp need only have one peak around the shaft, and the engagement of the hammer with the anvil is not based on a number of teeth between them, this design allows the hammer to accelerate for a full revolution before contacting the anvil, giving it more time to accelerate and delivering a stronger impact. The disadvantages are that the <b>sliding</b> <b>pins</b> must handle very high impacts, and often cause the early failure of tool.|$|R
40|$|Rubbed {{films of}} natural flake Madagascar {{graphite}} {{were applied to}} ASTM A- 355 (D) steel with chemical surface pretreatments of zinc phosphate, gas nitride, salt nitride, sulfo-nitride, and with mechanical pretreatment (sandblasting). SAE 1045 steel pins were slid against these films using a pin-on-disk tribometer. The results indicate that two different lubricating mechanisms can occur. In the chemical surface pretreatment, the graphite can mix {{together to form a}} surface layer of the two constituents and this plasticity flowing layer provides the lubrication. The longest endurance lives and the lowest pin wear rates were obtained with this mechanism. In the other, surface topography appeared to control the mechanism. A rough surface was necessary to serve as a reservoir to supply the graphite to the flat metallic plateaus where it was sheared in very thin films between the plateaus and the <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> surface. For this mechanism, chemical pretreatment seemed to do little more than serve as a means for roughening the surface. Mean friction was not significantly influenced by chemical pretreatment, but surface roughness effects were observed...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to baby splits {{because of}} their close {{distance}} from one another, the side-by-side split is almost always made by fitting the ball in between the two pins left standing. A much rarer conversion of the split involves <b>sliding</b> one <b>pin</b> into the other. A similar split (4-5-7 or 5-6-10) should be made the same way. Also called [...] "Fit splits;" [...] the 4-5 {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Steam fitter" [...] on Make That Spare.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{show that}} the cancellum of some femoral heads and of the trochanteric region is too weak to support a nail. A simple {{classification}} of traumatic femoral neck fractures is presented. These are either vertical or, less commonly, transversely disposed. Either type may be undisplaced, impacted, or displaced. For adequate fixation of undisplaced vertical and all displaced fractures a nail plate is essential. For undisplaced transverse fractures and impacted vertical fractures two screws usually suffice. Impacted transverse fractures require no active treatment. Hammering nails into the femoral head can cause fractures of the articular cartilage, split the femoral head in two, lead to avulsion of articular cartilage under the weight-bearing area, and osteoarthrosis. Early weight-bearing on weak implants can be disastrous. For the unsolved fracture a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> compressing the fragments should be used. In a series of 54 displaced fractures so treated, 50 united. Prosthetic replacement should be reserved for patients with poor-quality bone. Children are best treated with a Coventry lag screw. Non-union after internal fixation in young patients should be salvaged by an excisional osteotomy, but a prosthesis is the answer for elderly patients.

40|$|Surface texture {{influences}} {{friction and}} transfer layer formation during sliding. In the present investigation, three well-defined surface textures- namely unidirectional, 8 -ground, and random- were employed on steel plates. Experiments {{were conducted by}} <b>sliding</b> <b>pins</b> made of FCC metals (Al, Cu and Pb) against the steel plates using an inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester. Tests were conducted at a sliding velocity of 2 mm/s in ambient conditions under both dry and lubricated conditions. The morphologies of the worn surfaces of the pins {{and the formation of}} transfer layer on the counter surfaces were observed using a scanning electron microscope. Surface roughness parameters of the plate were measured using an optical profilometer. It was observed that the transfer layer formation and the value of the friction (including adhesion and plowing components) depend primarily on texture of plate surfaces. The effect of surface texture on the friction was attributed to the variation of the plowing component of friction for different surfaces. It was also observed that among the surface roughness parameters, the mean slope of the profile, Δa, correlated best with the friction. Furthermore, dimensionless quantifiable roughness parameters were formulated to describe the degree of plowing taking place at the asperity level...|$|R

40|$|In this investigation, {{friction}} and sliding wear behaviour of AISI {{304 stainless steel}} with HVOF coating was studied. This approach explains the comparative study of steel and ceramics; and also to evaluate the frictional properties of coatings also. The austenitic stainless steels are good in mechanical properties. To enhance the tribological properties and surface hardness of the stainless steel the alumina – titania (60 – 40 wt. %) powder was deposited as coating using High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) method. The experiments were carried out by adopting <b>pin</b> on disc <b>sliding</b> wear test method as per ASTM guidelines.

40|$|The {{topography}} of a Cu surface was monitored in situ during a sliding experiment with lubrication. Fe and steel pins {{were used as}} counter-faces and poly alpha olefin (PAO- 8) was utilized as lubricant. 3 -D images of a specific area within the wear track were acquired after every cycle. These experiments were carried out with a state-of-the-art tribometer, which uses a holographic microscope in immersion to observe the Cu surface online. The results show {{the evolution of the}} wear track, with a particular focus on the generation of flake-like wear particles. For the first time, these phenomena are correlated with the dynamic behavior of the surface. It is shown that the generation of wear particles results from various processes that occur on the surface, apart from crack propagation. The areas where wear takes place spread within the wear track during the experiment. Additional investigations of the subsurface structure were performed by means of focussed ion beam cross-s ections. These revealed a gradient from nanocrystalline to ultrafine-crystalline grain structure beneath the Cu surface, as well as an orientation effect when sliding in one direction, linking the present work with the results published in the literature. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiles were obtained from the counter-faces.

50|$|The M1951 {{is a short}} recoil-operated, locked breech pistol with a {{vertically}} falling {{locking piece}} and an open top slide (the locking mechanism design {{was influenced by the}} Walther P38 pistol). The locking piece, located under the barrel, is unlocked by a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> and locked back into battery by a beveled surface on the pistol's frame. The locking piece features two locking lugs that engage appropriate recesses cut into the slide's internal side surfaces. When the pistol is fired, the locking piece, integral with the slide, goes back together with the barrel which is locked to the slide. After a brief period of unrestricted travel of approx. 13 mm the unlocking pin on the rear barrel lug strikes the receiver and stops. As the barrel and slide continue back, the locking piece strikes the stationary plunger and is forced down into recesses in the slide. The barrel comes to rest but the slide continues rearward for a further 50 mm. Upon forward return, the slide picks up the barrel and the locking piece on the barrel lug is lifted up by the receiver cam to lock the barrel to the slide. The spring-loaded extractor is integrated into the slide, and the fixed-type ejector is integral to the pistol's frame. The pistol has a hammer striking mechanism (with an exposed hammer) and a single-action trigger with a disconnector, which enables semi-automatic fire only. A cross-bolt safety mounted on the weapon's frame (beneath the hammer) provides safe operation with a cartridge introduced into the chamber. In the “weapon safe” position (the safety's button pushed in to the left) the slide catch is disabled.|$|R
50|$|VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift {{intelligent}} system) (also sometimes denoted as VVT-iL or Variable Valve Timing and Intelligence with Lift) is {{an enhanced}} version of VVT-i that can alter valve lift (and duration) {{as well as}} valve timing. In {{the case of the}} 16 valve 2ZZ-GE, the engine head resembles a typical DOHC design, featuring separate cams for intake and exhaust and featuring two intake and two exhaust valves (four total) per cylinder. Unlike a conventional design, each camshaft has two lobes per cylinder, one optimized for lower rpm operation and one optimized for high rpm operation, with higher lift and longer duration. Each valve pair is controlled by one rocker arm, which is operated by the camshaft. Each rocker arm has a slipper follower mounted to the rocker arm with a spring, allowing the slipper-follower to freely move up and down with the high lobe without affecting the rocker arm. When the engine is operating below 6000-7000 rpm (dependent on year, car, and ECU installed), the lower lobe is operating the rocker arm and thus the valves, and the slipper-follower is freewheeling next to the rocker arm. When the engine is operating above the lift engagement point, the ECU activates an oil pressure switch which pushes a <b>sliding</b> <b>pin</b> under the slipper-follower on each rocker arm. The rocker arm is now locked into the slipper-follower's movements and thus follows the movement of the high rpm cam lobe and will operate with the high rpm cam profile until the pin is disengaged by the ECU. The lift system is similar in principle to Honda VTEC operation.|$|R
