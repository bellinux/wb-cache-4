5000|$|The {{bottom of}} a caquelon {{requires}} a thickness sufficient to prevent burning of the melted cheese when the vessel is placed over a <b>spirit</b> <b>burner</b> at the table. Nevertheless, an encrusted layer of cheese forms on the bottom called the Grossmutter in German, La Religieuse in French, which is released when the fondue has been consumed and is shared between the diners.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the basic}} {{design of the}} Mamod has {{inspired}} several improved versions supplied by independent manufacturers. Notable amongst there are the Creekside Forge & Foundry Baldwin, the PPS Janet and the IP Engineering Jane. Several manufacturers also supply upgraded components for the original Mamod line. A particularly popular upgrade was to fit the locomotive with a Methylated <b>spirit</b> <b>burner</b> which produced greater heat and therefore allowed higher boiler pressure and great hauling capacity.|$|E
50|$|Most Mamod models use {{simple but}} {{effective}} oscillating cylinders, usually single-acting. Some of these engines have regulators {{either in the}} steam feed or exhaust but many others run unregulated (in the simpler models) or have a simple reversing mechanism to alter the cutoff, thus controlling the power/speed {{and direction of the}} engine. Early models had single or multi-wick lamps or vapourising <b>spirit</b> <b>burners</b> but in the mid-1970s the company changed to hexamine solid fuel which came in tablet form and provided low heat in a relatively safe form.|$|R
50|$|On July 27, 1838, the <b>spirits</b> <b>burner</b> Karl Joseph Watzke {{acquired}} the catering business, including the Schank concession. He {{gave her the}} name Watzke's garden restaurant with Elbterrasse. The restaurant remained family-owned and was expanded several times. In 1898, a year after Pieschen had been incorporated into Dresden, the old economy was demolished and a ball-house with a large ball hall was built by Gustav Paul Watzke (the grandson of the first Watzke host) First floor. It stands on the Kötzschenbroder Straße 1, which {{is located in the}} neighborhood of the village center Altpieschen, but already belongs to Mickten. The house in Neo-Empire style was given the name Watzke's Concert- and Balletablissement. The architect was Benno Hübel , the ceiling painting in the hall was by Emil Schulz. With 770 seats, the building had one of the largest halls in the city of Dresden. After Paul Watzke was drafted into the military in 1914, the house served as a temporary shelter.|$|R

The lamp (made in approx. 1914) burned vaporised paraffin; the vaporiser was heated by a methylated <b>spirit</b> <b>burner</b> to light. When lit, {{some of the}} vaporised fuel was diverted to a Bunsen burner to keep the vaporiser warm and the fuel in vapour form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so. This in turn pressurised the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp.

5000|$|In 1864, {{the first}} steam-driven {{nebulizer}} {{was invented in}} Germany. This inhaler, known as [...] "Siegle’s steam spray inhaler", used the Venturi principle to atomize liquid medication, {{and this was the}} very beginning of nebulizer therapy. The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds. The Siegle steam spray inhaler consisted of a <b>spirit</b> <b>burner,</b> which boiled water in the reservoir into steam that could then flow across the top and into a tube suspended in the pharmaceutical solution. The passage of steam drew the medicine into the vapor, and the patient inhaled this vapor through a mouthpiece made of glass.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of 1954 the SE range all {{received}} raised bases as well as cosmetic updates and changes. By 1958 all but the MM1 had received the new vaporising <b>spirit</b> <b>burners,</b> which had first appeared in 1957 {{with the introduction of}} the all new twin cylinder SE3. Again there was another round of cosmetic changes with updated boiler bands and fireboxes. Combinations of these old and new parts {{can be found in the}} 'transitional' engines of the late 1950s period (e.g. the SE1, 2 and MM2). By the mid-1960s the engines were using pop rivets for the engine frame securing method (along with the entire Mamod range) as well more cosmetic changes. In 1967 the SE range received its next major update with the introduction of the SE1a and SE2a replacing the SE1 and 2. The superheating was gone and the simplified pipe work was all new. The SE2a also got a reversing lever like the 'MEC1' Meccano engine of 1965. Other details such as paint colour, boiler end cap and whistle design as well as decal layout were gradually changed. One point worth mentioning was the fact that from 1967 until about 1972 the Se1, 2 and 3 could be found with a different green paint on their engine frames. This paint was similar to a hammered effect type finish and was probably purchased as a job lot by the Managing Director at the time, Eric Malins. Steve Malins has confirmed that this was the case and his father would try anything new or changes which made production cheaper. The Minor range never received this paint finish. The SE3 was unchanged bar the introduction of the Griffin and George (educational suppliers) version in 1969. This engine was the only real variation to Mamod's biggest post-war stationary engine. It featured the very first silver soldered boiler (at the insistence of G&G) and also had a steam pipe union nut at the boiler instead of the usual stop cock. It carried an extra foil G&G lozenge logo by the engine too. About 2,000 were made until about mid-1970s. It was only sold to schools and came complete with a comprehensive manual for using the engine in lab experiments. Later examples of this engine were standard SE3s but carrying a revised G&G logo of a different design. This Griffin badge could sometimes be found placed alongside the warning labels applied to all stationary engines in 1976 explaining the use of inappropriate fuel containers and refuelling techniques.|$|R
