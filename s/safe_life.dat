6000|$|The <b>safe</b> <b>life</b> {{in the old}} order, {{where one}} did this because it was right, and that {{because it was the}} custom, when one shunned this and hated that, as lead runs into a mould, all that is passing away. And presently, as the new century opens out, there will become more and more {{distinctly}} emergent many new cultures and settled ways. The grey expanse of life to-day is grey, not in its essence, but because of the minute confused mingling and mutual cancelling of many-coloured lives. Presently these tints and shades will gather together here as a mass of one colour, and there as a mass of another. And as these colours intensify and the tradition of the former order fades, as these cultures become more and more shaped and conscious, as the new literatures grow in substance and power, as differences develop from speculative matter of opinion to definite intentions, as contrasts and affinities grow sharper and clearer, there must follow some very extensive modifications in the collective public life. But one series of tints, one colour must needs have a heightening value amidst this iridescent display. While the forces at work in the wealthy and purely speculative groups of society make for disintegration, and in many cases for positive elimination, the forces that bring together the really functional people will tend more and more to impose upon them certain common characteristics and beliefs, and the discovery of a group of similar and compatible class interests upon which they can unite. The practical people, the engineering and medical and scientific people, will become more and more homogeneous in their fundamental culture, more and more distinctly aware of a common [...] "general reason" [...] in things, and of a common difference from the less functional masses and from any sort of people in the past. They will have in their positive science a common ground for understanding the real pride of life, the real reason for the incidental nastiness of vice, and so they will be a sanely reproductive class, and, above all, an educating class. Just how much they will have kept or changed of the deliquescent morality of to-day, when in a hundred years or so they do distinctively and powerfully emerge, I cannot speculate now. They will certainly be a moral people. They will have developed the literature of their needs, they will have discussed and tested and thrashed out many things, they will be clear where we are confused, resolved where we are undecided and weak. In the districts of industrial possibility, in the healthier quarters of the town regions, away from the swamps and away from the glare of the midnight lights, these people will be gathered together. They will be linked in professions through the agency of great and sober papers--in England the Lancet, the British Medical Journal, and the already great periodicals of the engineering trades, foreshadow something, but only a very little, of what these papers may be. The best of the wealthy will gravitate to their attracting centres.... Unless some great catastrophe in nature break down all that man has built, these great kindred groups of capable men and educated, adequate women must be, under the operation of the forces we have considered so far, the element finally emergent amidst the vast confusions of the coming time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Safe</b> <b>life</b> is {{particularly}} relevant to metal aircraft, where airframe components {{are subjected to}} varying loads over the lifetime of the aircraft which makes them susceptible to metal fatigue.

5000|$|In 1956, Vickers had {{performed}} {{a series of}} low level tests in WZ383 to assess the type for low level flight at high speed. Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and this data was used by Vickers to estimate the remaining <b>safe</b> <b>life</b> of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a <b>safe</b> <b>life</b> of 75 hours was recommended, which became [...] "the real figure might be less than 200 hours". The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was viewed as being an operational issue for the RAF.|$|E

50|$|As {{the average}} American in the 1920s became more enamored {{of wealth and}} {{everyday}} luxuries, some began satirizing the hypocrisy and greed they observed. Of these social critics, Sinclair Lewis was the most popular. His popular 1920 novel Main Street satirized the dull and ignorant lives {{of the residents of}} a Midwestern town. He followed with Babbitt, about a middle-aged businessman who rebels against his <b>safe</b> <b>life</b> and family, only to realize that the young generation is as hypocritical as his own. Lewis satirized religion with Elmer Gantry, which followed a con man who teams up with an evangelist to sell religion to a small town.|$|E

At the same time tsunami rehabilitation is also the story of failed promises and missed lessons. This scenario raises questions about humanitarian standards and the rights of the disaster-affected people. Besides, there is the challenge of ensuring <b>safe</b> <b>life</b> on the coasts. There is also the issue of dilution of coastal environmental norms to make way for business as part of the global neoliberal agenda. In the film humanitarian workers and local communities analyse these aspects of rehabilitation and seek answers.|$|E

Thus, on-board life usage monitoring systems need to address the crack propagation phase {{in the same manner as}} the crack initiation phase. It is shown how the calculations of fracture mechanics parameters and the resulting crack propagation process are integrated into the algorithms of on-board life usage monitoring software. Applicability of the methods is underlined by results obtained with OLMOS- the on-board life usage monitoring system of the German Tornado fleet. 2...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{introduced}} in the movie High Noon, sung over the opening credits by Tex Ritter. It was awarded the 1952 Academy Award for Best Original Song, and was performed that night for the Academy by Ritter. The song is about the films main character, Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper), and the moral dilemma of his new wife, Amy Fowler-Kane (played by Grace Kelly), abandoning (or [...] "forsaking") him because he chooses to stay and fight (and risk being killed) instead of running away with her after their wedding. The song refers to how he cant have a <b>safe</b> <b>life</b> with her until he has eliminated the threats that face him, and he wants her to stay with him just a while longer until its all over and not give up on him for good.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{explosion}} was obviously {{an explosion of}} the cordite charges in a main magazine, the reason for it was much less obvious. There were several theories. The inquiry found {{that some of the}} cordite on board, which had been temporarily offloaded in December 1916 and catalogued at that time, was past its stated <b>safe</b> <b>life.</b> The possibility of spontaneous detonation was raised, but could not be proved. It was also noted that a number of ship's boilers were still in use, and some watertight doors, which should have been closed in wartime, were open as the ship was in port. It was suggested that this might have contributed to a dangerously high temperature in the magazines. The final conclusion of the board was that a fire started in a four-inch magazine, perhaps when a raised temperature caused spontaneous ignition of cordite, spreading to one or the other main magazines, which then exploded.|$|E
50|$|Mewtwo, {{his heart}} having been {{softened}} by the selfless {{example of the}} human named Ash Ketchum back in his birthland in the eastern Kanto region, has now traveled to the western region of Johto {{in search of a}} location that is unreachable by the prying eyes and harsh judgments of humans {{for the sake of his}} band of cloned Pokémon, with whose welfare Mewtwo is solely concerned. He eventually finds the perfect hideaway: a huge mountain named Mt. Quena, surrounded by steep cliffs that are practically impossible to scale, but in its top is a forest and a freshwater lake that makes for a near-utopia for all the Bug Pokémon living there. This is a perfect fit for Mewtwo's band, so thus they settle in the top of Mt. Quena and begin a new, <b>safe</b> <b>life,</b> with Mewtwo watching over as their guardian, as he feels they cannot belong in the world as they were not born in it (Interestingly enough, he seems particularly close to the Pikachu and Meowth clones, possibly reflecting how important their templates were in his change of heart).|$|E

25|$|Klein {{was born}} in Ratno, Ukraine, but in 1910 (at age one) he immigrated {{with his family to}} Montreal, Quebec, the city in which he would live most of his life. Ratno had seen a series of pogroms and, like many Ukrainian Jews, Klein's parents sought a <b>safer</b> <b>life</b> elsewhere. As a result of the influx of Jewish {{immigrants}} to Montreal, its Jewish community flourished, even though many families lived close to the poverty line. The family of Irving Layton was another notable addition to this community. Klein's father, an Orthodox follower of the Jewish faith, influenced Klein's early development. The son's early education and literary interests owed much to his plan to become a rabbi when he grew up, a plan that he never fulfilled.|$|R
