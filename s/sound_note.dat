25|$|One of {{the most}} {{expensive}} strobe tuners is the Peterson Strobe Center, which has twelve separate mechanical strobe displays; one for each pitch of the equally tempered octave. This unit (about $3,500 US) can tune multiple notes of a sound or chord, displaying each note's overtone sub-structure simultaneously. This gives an overall picture of tuning within a <b>sound,</b> <b>note</b> or chord that is not possible with most other tuning devices. (The TC Electronic Polytune can display the pitch accuracy of up to six pre-selected notes.) It is often used for tuning complex instruments and sound sources, or difficult-to-tune instruments where the technician requires a very accurate and complete aural picture of an instrument's output. For instance, when tuning musical bells, this model displays several of the bell's partials (hum, second partial, tierce, quint and nominal/naming note) as well as the prime, and each of their partials, on separate displays. The unit is heavy and fragile, and requires a regular maintenance schedule. Each of the twelve displays requires periodic re-calibration. It can be used to teach students about note substructures, which show on the separate strobing displays.|$|E

5000|$|Pitch is {{an aspect}} of a sound that we can hear, {{reflecting}} whether one musical <b>sound,</b> <b>note</b> or tone is [...] "higher" [...] or [...] "lower" [...] than another musical <b>sound,</b> <b>note</b> or tone. We {{can talk about the}} highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high piccolo note or whistling tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a bass drum. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano than to try to discern the pitch of a crash cymbal that is struck.|$|E

5000|$|The {{names of}} {{different}} varieties of fife follow {{the conventions of}} a) defining the key in which a transposing instrument sounds as the major key whose tonic is the lowest pitch producible by that instrument without fingering or other manipulation and then b) naming different subtypes of a given transposing instrument after the respective keys in which those subtypes <b>sound.</b> (<b>Note</b> that these conventions are specific to transposing instruments. By contrast, for example, although the trombone and the tuba each produce a B-flat when played at their lowest harmonic position with the slide not extended or with no valves depressed, respectively, the trombone's music parts are not transposed, and the tuba's music parts are transposed only across octaves, such that the note sounded by a tuba bears the same name as the note read by the tubist.) ...|$|E

5000|$|A yogin, at {{the start}} of his practice, {{concentrates}} in the inner side of right ear from inside and, hears many sounds proceeding from those like an ocean and clouds( [...] It is said that this starts from sounds of crickets and other familiar sounds and at higher levels it is Sounds of flute, cymbals and Cloud thunder). These filter out, and over time, he can hear more subtle sounds such as single note of musical instruments at his will, and get absorbed in whichever <b>sound</b> <b>note</b> it wants to, asserts the text. This focus on sound notes help the yogi destroy distractions from other senses and fluctuations of his mind, just like a bee focussed on honey does not care about the odour that surrounds it. Such a yogi does not care about fame or disgrace from others, he does not feel heat or cold, neither joy nor sorrow, he is lost within, in his self, in Brahman-Pranava (Om).|$|E
50|$|When a {{longitudinal}} sound wave strikes a flat surface, sound {{is reflected in}} a coherent manner provided that the dimension of the reflective surface is large compared to the wavelength of the <b>sound.</b> <b>Note</b> that audible sound has a very wide frequency range (from 20 to about 17000 Hz), and thus a very wide range of wavelengths (from about 20 mm to 17 m). As a result, the overall nature of the reflection varies according to the texture {{and structure of the}} surface. For example, porous materials will absorb some energy, and rough materials (where rough is relative to the wavelength) tend to reflect in many directions—to scatter the energy, rather than to reflect it coherently. This leads into the field of architectural acoustics, because the nature of these reflections is critical to the auditory feel of a space. In the theory of exterior noise mitigation, reflective surface size mildly detracts from the concept of a noise barrier by reflecting some of the sound into the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring {{in different types}} of vehicles. The frequency can {{be as high as}} 500 Hz, but usually remains below 100 Hz and often as low as 10 - 20 Hz. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a <b>sound.</b> <b>Note</b> that a phenomenological definition (i. e {{forced vibration}}) of brake judder is used. Hence, the low frequency brake vibrations, creep groan (related to stick-slip) and dynamic groan (an instability phenomenon), are not studied in this work. The vibration starts with medium to heavy braking from high speed and remains until low speed, if the brakes are continuously applied. There is a considerable amplification of the judder vibration near certain critical vehicle speeds. This behavior has been successfully simulated by the amplitude function technique, which was developed within the project. The method is specially designed for theoretical analysis of forced vibrations like brake judder. The use of amplitude functions was also found to be valuable when analyzing measured vibrations in a braking vehicle. Brake torque variation (BTV) and brake pressure variation (BPV) are the primary excitation mechanisms for judder vibrations. While BPV causes vibrations mostly in the hydraulic system, BTV is believed to be responsible for vibrations in the vehicle structure. This work concentrates on the vibrations caused by BPV; direct effects of BPV like pedal vibrations are not studied. BTV arises mostly as a result of permanent or reversible, geometrical defects, e. g. DTV (Disc Thickness Variation) of disc brakes and shape deviations of drum brakes. DTV in turn is affected by manufacturing tolerances, disc runout, thermal coning and buckling of the disc, uneven disc wear, uneven friction film generation, uneven heating and Thermo-Elastic Instabilities (TEI). Verifying measurements were made on a street-going vehicle with strong first order DTV on one of its front brakes. The measured vibration variation during braking was predicted almost exactly by a rotor-stator model, exposed to a sinusoidal BTV with a sweeping frequency due to the finite deceleration. However, the maximal measured vibration level was seen to vary considerably compared to the predicted value. A full vehicle model, including the aerodynamic drag etc., combined with a more accurate signal analysis, was found to improve the absolute vibration level prediction, especially at low decelerations. Most of the remaining differences at low deceleration levels are believed to be caused {{by the fact that the}} relative BTV of the calculations was approximated by the measured relative BPV level. At high brake pressure levels, the relative BPV level becomes too low (less than 5 %) to admit a reliable estimation. Besides, the estimation of the correction terms due to aerodynamic drag etc. affects the theoretical vibration level. To avoid all this, one should try to measure the brake torque directly. However, measuring the BPV level is useful if one wishes to estimate the instantaneous DTV level in a braking vehicle. This is possible if a relevant pad compression model is available. It was found that a pad stiffness that increases with the brake pressure was able to explain the measured BPV level dependence on the absolute brake level. For such a pad stiffness characteristic, an increase of the DTV level (whatever reason) by 50 % might result in more than a 100 % increase in the corresponding BPV and BTV levels. Hence, a progressive pad is more sensitive to increases of the DTV level than a linear pad would be...|$|E
