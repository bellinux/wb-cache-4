The book focuses on diverse aspects of sequence stratigraphy that tend to cut across divisions based on depositional environments or age alone. There are two main themes that run through most of the papers: 1. Because biostratigraphical control is often so good in much of Britain, precise correlations are possible within and between basins. Therefore, many of the British outcrop sections serve as standards that can be compared to other areas around the world. 2. The papers illustrate the way in which sequence stratigraphical ideas can cast new light on problematic facies. In return, problematic facies can offer critical insights into the sequence stratigraphical model. -from Editor...|$|R

They overlie Eocene platform carbonate to bathyal marl successions that subsequently cover Cretaceous platform carbonates of Apulia and the Dinaride nappes.

Widespread occurrence of nannofossil species of zone NN 4 - 6 indicates that flysch deposition lasted up to at least the Mid-Miocene. Ubiquitous occurrence of various pre-Miocene taxa demonstrates that extensive, possibly submarine, sediment recycling has occurred in the Cenozoic.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>ages</b> of the {{geological}} bodies that built up the Strandja diabase-phyllitoid complex cover {{a wide range}} â€“ from Early Devonian to Middle Jurassic. The mineral paragenesies of the rocks are typical of the greenschist facies and include albite, chlorite, sericite (illite-muscovite), epidote, calcite. The temperature interval of 350 - 400 Â°C is estimated by the chlorite geothermometer. The b 0 values and the illite crystallinity (IC) values of illite/muscovite indicate high-temperature anchizonal-epizonal metamorphic conditions. K-Ar isotopic dating of illite/muscovite-rich 60 Âµm indicate Jurassic (160 â€“ 170 Ma) low-grade regional greenschist metamorphism. The K-Ar dates 110 â€“ 150 Ma {{of the other part}} of the fractions < 2 Âµm reflect the rejuvenation effect of the Upper-Cretaceous (80 â€“ 100 Ma) regional tectonothermal (250 - 280 Â°C) event related to the subduction of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. The primary magmatic and metamorphic ages are Early Paleozoic (probably Early Devonian) based on a poorly defined whole rock Rb/Sr isochron from metadiabases. The K-Ar dates 246 â€“ 309 Ma of some metadiabases confirm their Paleozoic age and indicate at least one Paleozoic low-grade or higher-grad...|$|R

The combination of the two dating techniques demonstrates that three major flank eruptions occurred on the lower north and west flanks during Greekâ€“Roman epochs, producing large scoria cones and extensive lava flows. In particular, the Mt Ruvolo and Mt Minardo events highly impacted the territory of the west flank, notably by damming the Simeto River.

40|$|Jovis Tholus, Ulysses Patera, and Biblis Patera, {{three small}} volcanoes in the Tharsis area of Mars, provide {{important}} {{insight into the}} evolution of volcanism on Mars. All three are interpreted to be shield volcanoes, indicating that shield volcansim was present from the outset in Tharsis. Jovis Tholus is the least complex with simple repeated outpouring of lavas and caldera-forming events. Ulysses Patera is dominated by a giant caldera within which is a line of cinder cones or domes suggesting terminal stages of volcanism in which the magma had either significant volatiles or increased viscosity. Biblis Patera is characterized by nested calderas which have expanded by block faulting of the flank; it also exhibits lava flows erupted onto the flanks from events along concentric fractures. These shields {{are different from the}} younger Tharsis Montes shields only in terms of the volume of erupted material. The limited shield volume suggests that the magma source which fed the shields was rapidly depleted. The relatively large size ofthe calderas probably results from relatively large, shallow magma bodies rather than significant burial of the flanks by younger lavas. Eruption rates consistent with typical terrestrial basaltic eruptiuon rates suggest that these volcanoes were probably built over time spans of 10 (exp 4) to 10 (exp 5) years. <b>Stratigraphic</b> <b>ages</b> range from Early to Upper Hesperian; absolute ages range from 1. 9 to 3. 4 Ga...|$|R
