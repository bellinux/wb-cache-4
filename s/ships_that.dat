5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook were pushed overboard to make room for more helicopters to land.

50|$|The {{equivalence}} principle {{can be understood}} by picturing a rocket ship in two scenarios. First, imagine a rocket <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> is at rest on the Earth's surface; objects in the rocket ship are being accelerated downward at 9.81 m/s². Now, imagine a rocket <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> has escaped Earth's gravitational field and is accelerating upwards at a constant 9.81 m/s² due to thrust from its rockets; objects in the rocket <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> are dropped will {{fall to the floor}} with an acceleration of 9.81 m/s². This example shows that a uniformly accelerating reference frame is indistinguishable from a gravitational reference frame.|$|R
5000|$|A hulk is a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> is afloat, but {{incapable}} {{of going to}} sea. Although sometimes used to describe a <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> has been launched but not completed, the term most often refers to an old <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> has had its rigging or internal equipment removed, retaining only its flotational qualities. The word hulk is also used as a verb: a ship is [...] "hulked" [...] to convert it to a hulk. The verb was also applied to crews of Royal Navy ships in dock, who {{were sent to the}} receiving ship for accommodation, or [...] "hulked".|$|R
5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American retreat from Quebec were those of a small fleet of lightly armed <b>ships</b> <b>that</b> Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775.
