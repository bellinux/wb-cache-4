40|$|Abstract: The {{methods and}} results of {{analysis}} of the orbital evolution of outer satellites of giant planets are presented. The <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularity</b> of their orbits required the refinement of the already known {{and the development of}} new analytical methods for analyzing their long-term evolution. These methods are based on various averaged variants of the Hill problem. H. Kinoshita, H. Nakai, and the author of this paper further extended the qualitative analyses of these variants earlier performed by N. D. Moiseev, A. A. Orlov, M. L. Lidov, and Y. Kozai, by constructing the general solution of the double averaged Hill problem and by developing a combined numerical-analytical method. In this paper we present the results graphical form (time dependences of the orbital elements) obtained by various methods. We compare these results with those obtained by the most accurate method to numerically integrate the equations of perturbed motion of real satellites of giant planets. We put special emphasis on the satellite orbits with librational behavior of the variation of the pericenter argument. This libration is usually associated with the well-known Lidov-Kozai resonance, however, in the case of orbits of three Jovian satellites it is determined by large-amplitude periodic solar perturbations. The research, that we present here, stemmed from our interest in new distant satellites of giant planets and, in particular, in the celestial-mechanical effects that show up in the orbital evolution of these peculiar celestial objects.

This paper {{discusses}} arbitrability of {{a lawsuit}} initiated by an action to declare {{a resolution of the}} general meeting of a public limited company null and void. The paper starts by presenting the relevant provisions of the Croatian Companies Act, as well as the present case law of the High Commercial Court that considers such nullity actions covered by exclusive jurisdiction of territorially competent commercial courts. The author suggests a change in the view in favour of the arbitrability of such disputes. After considering present normative obstacles to arbitrability, the author proposes an amendment to Art 3 para 1 of the Croatian Law on Arbitration to clarify that nullity actions at stake are indeed arbitrable. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the author analyses the main features of nullity actions against resolutions of general company meetings. First, the parties in dispute are considered, in particular possible claimants according to the Croatian Companies Act. Under specific conditions provided in that Act, not only natural and legal persons are authorised to launch this action, but the right to sue is also given to the management (managing board) of the company. The respondent is always the public limited company whose general meeting passed the resolution in question. While considering the rules on parties 2 ̆ 7 representation in court, special attention is paid to the possible conflict of interest between the parties 2 ̆ 7 representatives when respondent 2 ̆ 7 s management or managing board (or someone of its members) is a claimant. The prayer for relief is also discussed. It is pointed out that the wording of the prayer for relief is the same one when an action has been lodged on the ground of nullity or of voidance of the general meeting 2 ̆ 7 s resolution. In spite of this there is a difference between the legal nature of the raised claims. The first one is of declaratory nature, while the second has constituent nature. From the requirements provided in the Croatian Companies Act on which both actions are grounded, it may be concluded that the voidance of the resolution is treated as a rule and the cases of its nullity are strictly exceptional. Liberal interpretation of nullity grounds is not allowed. In spite of this difference, the change of arguments from voidance to nullity and vice versa does not require a change in the prayer for relief as the court has to find ex officio the legal consequences of the established facts. Regarding the burden of proof, it is stated that the claimant has to prove its authorization to raise the claim as well as the facts in dispute on which its prayer for relief is grounded. The respondent has to prove that procedural errors in the process of passing the resolution in question have not caused <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularity</b> of the regulation. A resolution of the general meeting may under certain conditions be entered into the company register in spite of the fact that a dispute on its validity is pending. The paper concludes by presenting these conditions, as well as the rationale of this option in the Croatian Companies Act. The consequences of entering such a resolution into the registers held by the courts are considered. In particular, the author highlights the need to change the prayer for relief after entering the decision into register, the proper way of doing it, as well as the consequences that will follow if the claimant fails to amend his claim...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how {{the nervous}} system {{achieves}} reliable performance using unreliable components is important for many disciplines of science and engineering, {{in part because it}} can suggest ways to lower the energetic cost of computing. In vision, retinal ganglion cells partition visual space into approximately circular regions termed receptive fields (RFs). Average RF shapes are such that they would provide maximal spatial resolution if they were centered on a perfect lattice. However, individual shapes have fine-scale irregularities. Here, we find that irregular RF shapes increase the spatial resolution in the presence of lattice irregularities from ≈ 60 % to ≈ 92 % of that possible for a perfect lattice. Optimization of RF boundaries around their fixed center positions reproduced experimental observations neuron-by-neuron. Our results suggest that lattice irregularities determine the shapes of retinal RFs and that similar algorithms can improve the performance of retinal prosthetics where <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularities</b> arise at their interface with neural tissue...|$|R

The 2. 77 Å crystal structure of the BST- 2 /tetherin extracellular core presented here reveals a parallel 90 Å long disulfide-linked coiled-coil domain, while the complete extracellular domain forms an extended 170 Å long rod-like structure based on small-angle X-ray scattering data. Mutagenesis analyses indicate that both the coiled coil and the N-terminal region are required for retention of HIV- 1, suggesting that the elongated structure can function as a molecular ruler to bridge long distances. The structure reveals <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularities</b> and instabilities throughout the coiled coil, which contribute to its low stability in the absence of disulfide bonds. We propose that the irregular coiled coil provides conformational flexibility, ensuring that BST- 2 /tetherin anchoring both in the plasma membrane and in the newly formed virus membrane is maintained during virus budding...|$|R
50|$|Suffrage is {{universal}} for citizens 18 {{years of age}} and older. A new election law passed in 2004 has received international criticism for its restrictive candidate registration requirements. Election requires an absolute majority of votes; if no candidate gains a majority, a second round is held between the top two vote getters. By controlling the Central Election Commission, the Rahmon regime has gained substantial influence over the registration of parties, the holding of referenda, and election procedures. In 1999 and 2003, referenda of dubious fairness made constitutional changes that strengthened Rahmon’s hold on power. International observers also found <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the conduct of the 1999 presidential election, in which only one opposition candidate was permitted to register, and the media were censored. Six parties participated in the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, although in both cases observers reported state interference with the process and with opposition candidates’ access to the media. Rahmon easily won re-election in November 2006, gaining 79 percent of the vote against four little-known opponents; international monitors again found the election unfair. Three major opposition parties—the Democratic Party, the Islamic Renaissance Party, and the Social Democratic Party—boycotted the election.|$|R

50|$|Although Mokhehle {{completed}} his term as Prime Minister, {{due to his}} failing health, he did not vie {{for a second term}} in office. The elections saw a landslide victory for the LCD, gaining 79 of the 80 seats contested in the newly expanded Parliament. As a result of the elections, Mokhehle's Deputy Prime Minister, Pakalitha Mosisili, became the new Prime Minister. The landslide electoral victory caused opposition parties to claim that there were <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the handling of the ballots and that the results were fraudulent. The conclusion of the Langa Commission, a commission appointed by Southern African Development Community (SADC) to investigate the electoral process, however, was consistent with the view of international observers and local courts that the outcome of the elections was not affected by these incidents. Despite the fact that the election results were found to reflect the will of the people, opposition protests in the country intensified. The protests culminated in a violent demonstration outside the royal palace in early August 1998 and in an unprecedented level of violence, looting, casualties, and destruction of property. In early September, junior members of the armed services mutinied. The Government of Lesotho requested that a SADC task force intervene to prevent a military coup and restore stability to the country. To this end, Operation Boleas, consisting of South African and (later) Botswana troops, entered Lesotho on September 22, 1998 to put down the mutiny and restore the democratically elected government. The army mutineers were brought before a court-martial.|$|R

Using a simple one-dimensional numerical model to simulate macroscopic interchange eddy transport, it is demonstrated that this smooth equilibrium distribution of mass can occur but only with the inclusion of a minimal level of small scale microscopic mixing at a rate approaching Bohm diffusion. Otherwise, the system exhibits a chaotic appearance which never approaches an equilibrium distribution. Various physical mechanisms for the microscopic diffusion process which is required to provide a sufficiently rapid mixing of material between the macroscopic eddies are discussed...|$|R

However, the subsequent election resulted in the surprise selection of Jerry Baxley by a narrow margin as the new national SNC chairman. <b>Substantial</b> voting <b>irregularities,</b> which, {{in the view of}} many, were orchestrated by the Baxley faction, produced additional disaffection within party ranks. This dissatisfaction was further exacerbated by what many viewed as Baxley's abrasive, erratic and unpopular leadership style. The party reunion was short-lived and Baxley soon found himself presiding over a rapidly shrinking party organization as other SNC members resigned and state party organizations began disaffiliating from the SNC as their recognized national party organ. The steady departure of established state party organizations ultimately led to the final dissolution of the SNC in 2002.|$|R

It is based on incremental contrasts of empirical entropies based on the frequencies of different patterns in the sequence. Sequences with large approximate entropy must have <b>substantial</b> fluctuation or <b>irregularity.</b> Alternatively, small values of this characteristic imply strong regularity, or lack of randomness, in a sequence. Pincus and Kalman (1997) evaluated approximate entropies for binary and decimal expansions of e; ß; p 2 and p 3 with the surprising conclusion that the expansion of p 3 demonstrated much more irregularity than that of ß.

40|$|Material and methods: Seventy-three {{pregnant}} women at varying gestation ages {{who came to}} the general practitioner and midwife practice of the author between 5 / 9 / 2007 and 27 / 3 / 2008 were screened twice, four weeks apart, as follows. A Gram-supported clinical diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Nugent Score) and the urine's bacterial biofilm using fluorescence-in situ-hybridisation (FISH) was performed on {{pregnant women}} and their partners. The clinical parameter, type of vaginal discomfort if present, pH value of the vagina and {{the quantity and quality of}} the vaginal smear were determined. The intestinal flora of the stool, with particular attention to the lacto bacillus and Polymerase-Chain Reaction (PCR), was examined if gardnerella vaginalis was found in the vagina. Results: Based on nugent scores, 10 out of 73 women (13. 6 %) were diagnosed with BV at the first examination. Only a few of the women with a high concentration of gardnerella vaginalis in the vagina also had a BV. Similarly, but not as obvious, was the presence of atopobium vaginae. Even before symptoms of BV were apparent, <b>substantial</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the vaginal flora could be shown, which are only unclearly determined by a nugent-score of 4 - 6 ("intermediate"). Reduction in H 2 O 2 -forming lactobacillus did not automatically result with an increase in gardnerella or atopobium. Twelve out of 73 women (17 %) had cohesive gardnerella vaginalis on epithelial cells in their urine. Ten out of 12 women had a nugent score between 7 and 10, indicating BV. Seven out of 10 women complained of typical symptoms. This seems to make a diagnosis of BV based on the presence of gardnerella vaginalis biofilm on epithelial cells in urine as accurate as a vaginal biopsy or a native preparation. Detection of cohesive gardnerella on epithelia in the partners´ urine was successful in 11 % of those men whose pregnant partners were diagnosed positive as well. Even though the concentration of cohesive gardnerella in women´s urine was higher than that in their partners´, sexual transmission is still apparent. More than 1 / 3 of the pregnant women complained of vaginal discomfort, mostly itching. This does not correlate with positive fungal cultures determined by vaginal smears. This also shows that subjective symptoms, especially with pregnant women, are not significant. Only four women out of 18 women with reduced H 2 O 2 -forming lactobacillus, suffered vaginal discomfort. Evidence of B-streptococci in the vagina in 10 out of 73 women (13. 7 %) correlates with literature on the subject. At the same time a reduction of H 2 O 2 -forming lactobacillus was found in the vagina as well as in the stool in 12 out of 32 cases. At no time was there biomolecular (PCR) evidence of gardnerella vaginalis in the stool. Equal levels of bacteriological disturbance in vaginal flora could not be determined at the second examination after 4 weeks. Only one premature delivery occurred during the 37 th week of pregnancy of a woman with a nugent score of 4 - 6. Conclusions: In addition to the clinical diagnosis of BV, there is often a subclinical bacterial alteration in vaginal flora, especially a reduction of H 2 O 2 -forming lactobacillus in the vagina and also the intestines. BV can be easily diagnosed with FISH by determining cohesive gardnerella on epithelia in the urine. These phenomena can also be seen in partners of women with BV, so that sexual transmission of BV can be assumed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Mural thickening, {{combined}} with longitudinal and circumferential shortening, and apical along with basal twisting are critical {{components of the}} left ventricular systolic deformation that contribute to ventricular ejection. It is axiomatic that the spatial alignment of the actively contracting aggregates of myocytes must {{play a major role}} in the resulting ventricular deformation. The need to conserve functional global myocytic architecture, therefore, is an important aspect of the surgical manoeuvres affecting ventricular mass and geometry. To investigate the influence of the global alignment of the myocytes on ventricular contraction, we used a mathematical model simulating the large deformations produced by systolic contraction of the left ventricle of a human heart. Methods: The alignment and meshing of the myocytes within their supporting fibrous matrix cause mechanical anisotropy, which was included in the mathematical model in the form of a unit vector field, constructed from the measured trajectories of aggregated myocytes in an autopsied human heart. The relationship between ventricular structure and ventricular dynamics was assessed by analysing the influence of systematic deviations of the orientation of the myocytes from their original alignment, in longitudinal as well as radial directions, on the distribution of stress and strain within the myocardium, as well as on the ejection fraction. In addition, simplified idealised geometries were used to investigate the influence of the overall geometrical modifications. Results: Left ventricular function proved to be robust with respect to small-to-moderate rotational variations in myocytic alignment, up to 14 °, a finding which we attribute to an equalising effect of the non-uniform anisotropic pattern found in a real heart involving <b>substantial</b> local <b>irregularities</b> in the architecture of the aggregated myocytes. Severe deterioration of function occurred only when deviations in alignment exceeded 30 °. Conclusions: Our findings substantiate the concept of the myocardial walls representing a continuous three-dimensional meshwork, with the absence of any intermediate structures such as discrete bands or tracts extending over the ventricles, which could be destroyed surgically, thereby adversely affecting systolic function. With appropriate indications, they also support the validity of the surgical procedures performed to reduce ventricular radius and therefore to reduce mural stres...|$|R
40|$|The link {{suspension}} {{is the most}} prevailing suspension system for freight wagons in central and western Europe. The system design is simple and has existed for more than 100 years. However, still its characteristics are not fully understood. This thesis emphasizes freight wagon dynamics and comprises three parts: In the first part a review of freight wagon running gear is made. The different suspension systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The review covers the running gear standardized by UIC and the conventional so-called three-piece bogie. Additionally five improved three-piece bogies and twelve novel running gear designs are presented. The second part focuses on the lateral force-displacement characteristics in the {{link suspension}}. Results from stationary measurements on freight wagons and laboratory tests of the link suspension characteristics are presented. To improve understanding of the various mechanisms and phenomena in link suspension systems a simulation model is developed. Link suspension systems have strongly nonlinear characteristics including a hysteresis loop. The loop exhibits usually three characteristic sections with different tangential stiffnesses. The actual contact geometry of the links and end bearings has a significant influence on the characteristics. By wear in ordinary service - {{as well as by}} geometric tolerances on new components - the contact geometry may deviate considerably from nominal geometry. Further, it seems that elastic deformation in the contact surfaces has considerable effects on the suspension characteristics, in particular on the initial rolling stiffness for small displacements. Also, flexibilities in links and end bearings influence the characteristics. It is also observed that new components after a short period of dynamic testing can exhibit a very low amount of energy dissipation, a phenomenon that is also indicated in some stationary measurements on wagons. To summarize the second part, it appears that the link suspension characteristics are very sensitive to several factors being hard to control in the real world of freight wagon operations. The various stiffnesses and hysteresis loops have a considerable variation and may have a strong influence on the ride qualities of vehicles. As long as the characteristics can not be controlled within closer limits than found in this study, there is a strong need for sensitivity analysis to be made, both in predictive multibody simulations of vehicle dynamics, as well as in verification and acceptance tests. In the third part a study on the possibility to improve ride qualities of freight wagons with link suspensions is presented. Parametric studies with multibody dynamic simulations on freight wagons equipped with link-suspension bogies are performed. The effect of supplementary friction and hydraulic damping is investigated under various running conditions: speed, loading, tangent and curved track, wheel-rail contact geometry, track gauge and track <b>irregularities.</b> <b>Substantial</b> improvements of the lateral running behaviour of wagons with link suspension bogies can be achieved - both at ordinary speeds and at increased speeds - by using a proper combination of supplementary hydraulic dampers.
